"US tennis star Venus Williams has been involved in a car crash that led to the death of a 78-year-old man. A spokesman for Palm Beach Gardens police in Florida confirmed to the BBC they were investigating a fatal crash involving the Grand Slam champion. A man was taken to hospital after the accident on 9 June and died two weeks later from his injuries, he said. Police believe she was at fault but her lawyer says it was an accident. She has not been cited or charged. The man who died, Jerome Barson, was travelling with his wife who was driving their vehicle through an intersection when the collision happened. Ms Williams' car suddenly darted into their path and was unable to clear the junction in time due to traffic jams, according to witness statements in a police report obtained by US media. Mrs Barson was also taken to hospital but survived. ""[Ms Williams] is at fault for violating the right of way of [the other driver],"" the report said, adding that there were no other factors like drugs, alcohol or mobile phone distractions. The 37-year-old, seven-time Grand Slam champion reportedly told police she did not see the couple's car and she was driving slowly. Ms Williams' lawyer Malcolm Cunningham told CNN in a statement: ""Ms Williams entered the intersection on a green light. The police report estimates that Ms Williams was travelling at 5mph when Mrs Barson crashed into her. ""Authorities did not issue Ms Williams with any citations or traffic violations. This is an unfortunate accident and Venus expresses her deepest condolences to the family who lost a loved one."" Next week, Ms Williams is due to play her 20th Wimbledon tournament in London, where she is seeded 10th. Ms Williams and her sister Serena have dominated the women's game for two decades.

"Andy Slaughter, Catherine West and Ruth Cadbury all voted for the amendment Three Labour frontbenchers have been sacked for defying Jeremy Corbyn and backing a call for the UK to stay in the single market after Brexit. Ruth Cadbury, Catherine West and Andy Slaughter had supported Chuka Umunna's amendment to the Queen's Speech. Staying in the single market is not Labour policy and Mr Corbyn had ordered his MPs to abstain - but 50 rebelled. His deputy Tom Watson said he was disappointed with Mr Umunna for trying to ""divide"" Labour MPs with the vote. Mr Watson added: ""I just felt that given we'd come out of the general election with such an unexpected result, and there's a real euphoria, to try and divide Labour MPs a week and a half in was a little disappointing. ""But, you know, we're still buzzing, we still want to hold the government to account, we'll get over it and move on."" Live updates from BBC Parliament Queen's Speech  clears Commons Northern Ireland women to get abortion funding Kuenssberg: Lessons from government climbdown No need to wear a tie, Bercow tells MPs Ms Cadbury said she was aware that, as she was breaking the Whip, she could not retain her frontbench role. ""I had no doubt that I had to support the amendment moved by Labour colleagues with cross-party support. This video can not be played Lots of Labour supporters ""will be disappointed"" by party's position on the single market, says Wes Streeting ""The amendment ruled out withdrawing from the EU without a deal, sought a parliamentary vote on the final negotiations, and proposed remaining in the customs union and single market. ""Only then can we protect jobs, trade and certainty for business, as well as protecting the rights of EU citizens, with reciprocal rights for UK citizens."" Ruth Cadbury,externalis the MP for Brentford and Isleworth, entering the House of Commons in the 2015 general election. Until she was dismissed, she had been a shadow housing minister. She has previously said it is""unsocialist"" to support Jeremy Corbyn.,external Catherine West,externalrepresents Hornsey and Wood Green and was a shadow Foreign Office minister. She took her seat in the 2015 election andsupported Jeremy Corbyn's bid,externalto get on the ballot paper to be leader of the Labour Party. Andy Slaughter,externalis MP for Hammersmith, having been in Parliament since 2005. In June 2016he quit as shadow justice minister,external, saying he did not believe Mr Corbyn was ""the best person to maximise support in the country"". But he returned as a shadow housing minister in October that same year - until being sacked. Forty-nine Labour MPs voted for the amendment while a 50th - Heidi Alexander - acted as a teller, one of the MPs who count the votes. Daniel Zeichner quit as shadow transport minister to take part in the vote. He said in a statement he was resigning ""with great regret"" but added: ""My position on Europe has always been clear. I am a passionate pro-European and a straight-forward politician."" Despite the support of the Lib Dems and SNP, Mr Umunna's amendment was defeated by 322 votes to 101, majority 221, during a series of final votes on the government's Queen's Speech. Among the Labour MPs who backed it was Stella Creasy, who appeared on the BBC's Question Time on Thursday. She said she had done so because she wanted single market membership to be ""part of the [Brexit] negotiations... because the economic and social cost of these things is going to be horrific"" - arguing 650,000 jobs in London alone depended on the single market. Mr Corbyn and his deputy Tom Watson instructed MPs to abstain in the vote ""I want all of these options on the table,"" she said, arguing there were ""101 different combinations"" that could see the UK leave the EU while remaining in the single market. Labour's Wes Streeting, who backed the amendment, said the vote had ""clarified"" Labour's official position but he was ""surprised and disappointed"" at the outcome. ""I don't believe that Labour can achieve our objectives of tariff-free, barrier-free access to the single market, and a jobs-first Brexit, outside of membership of the the single market,"" he told Radio 4's World at One. But Stephen Kinnock, who like many Labour MPs did not take part in the vote, said the decision to fire the rebels was ""regrettable"" but ""had to be done"". ""I suppose I'm quite old-fashioned on this stuff,"" he told the BBC. ""If you have a frontbench amendment and a backbench amendment and you are whipped in a certain way, if you are a frontbencher and you don't follow the whip there is only one conclusion that can be drawn from that."" Mr Corbyn has committed to leaving the single market after Brexit. A Labour amendment proposed by shadow chancellor John McDonnell was defeated by 323 to 297. It called for Brexit to deliver the ""exact same benefits"" as the EU single market and customs union, as well as scrapping tuition fees, increasing public spending and ending the public sector pay cap. Labour MP Hilary Benn told the BBC: ""I think we recognise that membership of the single market creates a difficulty because... you can't control free movement if you are in the single market. ""The policy on which we fought the election was to say that we wish to retain the benefits of the single market and the customs union. ""I think if the reference to the single market had not been in Chuka's amendment then you would've seen a different outcome."" Unison's general secretary Dave Prentis was very critical of Mr Umunna's amendment, saying it was ""totally inappropriate for Labour MPs to create a split over Europe"" and ""utterly self-defeating to become bogged down in the worst kind of gesture politics"". The government survived its first major Parliamentary test when MPs voted 323 to 309 in favour of the Queen's Speech - the government's package of legislation - which was stripped back after the Tories lost their Commons majority. The Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs had agreed to support the measures as part of a deal with the Tories.

"This video can not be played Aftermath of Paris mosque 'attack' A man has been arrested in Paris after trying to drive his vehicle into a crowd outside a mosque, police say. The incident took place at about 18:30 local time (16:30 GMT) in the suburb of CrÃ©teil and no-one was hurt. The man was apparently thwarted by barriers put up to protect the mosque. The suspect's motives remain unclear but Le Parisien newspaper reported that he was of Armenian origin and had said he wanted to avenge Islamist-linked attacks in Paris. Europe has seen a number of vehicle attacks in the past year, many by those claiming allegiance to IS. Police secure the mosque at CrÃ©teil after the alleged ramming incident A police statement said the suspect's 4x4 vehicle repeatedly struck bollards and barriers designed to protect the mosque in the south-eastern suburb of the French capital. The car sped off but crashed and the man fled before being arrested shortly afterwards. He did not appear to be acting under the influence of drugs or alcohol, Le Parisien said. It reported that the suspect had said he wanted to avenge attacks on the Bataclan theatre and Champs-ÃlysÃ©es, both linked to so-called Islamic State. France remains under a state of emergency, in place since attacks on the capital in November 2015, including at the Bataclan theatre, claimed 130 lives.

"Police said they would like to speak to John Tomlin in connection with the attack Police have released an image of a man they want to talk to in connection with anacid attack in east London. Two people were left with ""life-changing"" injuries when a corrosive substance was thrown on to them through their car windows. Cousins Resham Khan and Jameel Muhktar had been celebrating Ms Khan's 21st birthday before the attack. John Tomlin, 24, is described as white, 6ft tall, of stocky build and with short fair hair. He is known to frequent the Canning Town area. Resham Khan has been left with damage to her left eye She had just returned from a year abroad as part of her business management degree at Manchester Metropolitan University Ms Khan, a student at Manchester Metropolitan University, and Mr Muhktar suffered severe burns to the face and body in the attack on 21 June. ""Within seconds, my cousin started screaming. Her eyes were blistered, her face started melting. My face started melting"", Mr Muhktar said. According to police, they had stopped at traffic lights when the man approached them and threw the toxic substance at Ms Khan through the window. Jameel Muhktar had to be temporarily placed in an induced coma to treat his injuries The attacker then circled around the car and threw more of the acid at Mr Muhktar, before eventually fleeing the scene. Mr Muhktar, 37, had to be temporarily placed in an induced coma to treat his injuries. ""I'm in a really bad way. I'm going to be scarred for life. I can't walk properly, I can't hear properly, I can't sleep"", he said. Police said there was no current information to suggest the attack was racially or religiously motivated.

"The US president accused the TV host of having had plastic surgery US President Donald Trump has launched an extraordinary attack on a female news anchor's alleged plastic surgery. He said MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski was ""bleeding badly from a face-lift"" during a visit to his Florida golf resort Mar-a-Lago. In a Twitter salvo, Mr Trump also assailed Brzezinski's MSNBC co-presenter Joe Scarborough. They are both his occasional sparring partners and she this week accused him of developing a ""dictatorship"". ""I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore),"" Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday morning. He also accused ""low I.Q. Crazy Mika"" and ""Psycho Joe"" of ""insisting on joining me"" at Mar-a-Lago over three days at New Year's Eve. ""She was bleeding badly from a face-lift. I said no!"" he added. WATCH: Megyn Kelly laments Trump's 'online nastiness' Katty Kay: 'Cut her mic' moment left me flabbergasted Amid an outpouring of criticism from left and right, the White House rejected suggestions Mr Trump had done anything wrong. ""The president has been attacked mercilessly on personal accounts by members on that programme,"" deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told a news briefing. ""And I think he's been very clear that when he gets attacked he's going to hit back. ""The American people elected someone who's tough, who's smart and who's a fighter. ""And that's Donald Trump. And I don't think that's a surprise to anybody that he fights fire with fire."" Brzezinksi, 50, hit back earlier by tweeting an advert for a children's cereal, with the caption, ""made for small hands"", an apparent reference to a taunt often directed at Mr Trump by his critics. During his presidential campaign, Mr Trump was a frequent guest on MSNBC's Morning Joe programme, which was accused by liberal voices of giving him preferential treatment. But the relationship turned sour as the presenters sharpened their scrutiny of the candidate. The pair have stepped up their attacks since Mr Trump's inauguration, deriding him as a ""fake president"". In recent weeks, Scarborough has called Mr Trump a ""bumbling dope"", resembling ""a kid who pooped in his pants"", while Brzezinksi has mocked members of the administration as ""lobotomised"". Mr Trump's latest broadside comes just a month after Scarborough and Brzezinski, who are engaged to one another, told Vanity Fair magazine the president had offered to officiate at their wedding. She is the daughter of the late Zbigniew Brzezinski, who was an aide to Presidents Carter and Johnson, while Scarborough is a former Republican congressman. Let's quickly review all of the people who have told Donald Trump to tone down his tweets as president. His wife. His White House advisors. His lawyers. Republicans in Congress. Even his own supporters have said they think his social media fusillades are counterproductive. Yet here we are again. Another morning, another round of intensely personal Twitter invective that marks a dramatic departure from the (at least public) behaviour of past occupants of the Oval Office. That this comes as no shock may, in fact, be the biggest shock of all. Mr Trump mocked people's looks (Rosie O'Donnell) as a businessman, and he was rewarded with reality television show stardom. He mocked people's looks (Carly Fiorina, Rand Paul) as a candidate, and he was rewarded with the presidency. Now he's mocking people's looks from his new home in the White House. The president has hit the hornet's nest again, and he'll be roundly condemned by media commentators and Democrats. Republican politicians will express concern, then go back to their conservative legislative efforts. This, too, will pass. As will the next round. Until the American voters - the only ones, it seems, with the real power - decide they want a change. Republican South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham swiftly condemned the president's attack Nebraska Republican Senator Ben Sasse also condemned Trump's tweet Mr Trump's tirade comes weeks after Ivanka Trump complained about nasty attacks on her father. ""There's a level of viciousness I wasn't expecting"" in Washington DC, the first daughter told Fox News. Online critics have noted the president's wife, Melania Trump, expressed a desire during the election to campaign against cyber-bullying. But her spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, said in a statement on Thursday: ""As the First Lady has stated publicly in the past, when her husband gets attacked, he will punch back 10 times harder."" The Democratic National Committee described Mr Trump's tweet as ""an attack on women everywhere"". Mrs Trump vowed to tackle online bullying as first lady Paul Ryan, the highest-ranking congressional Republican, told a weekly news conference: ""We are trying to improve the tone and civility of the debate. ""This doesn't help that."" When asked in the past to clarify Mr Trump's social media postings, White House spokesman Sean Spicer has told reporters ""the president's tweets speak for themselves"" and they should be considered official statements. This is Mr Trump's second high-profile spat with a female news anchor. During a US election campaign debate in August 2016, Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly asked him why he had called certain women ""fat pigs, slobs and disgusting animals"". Afterwards, Mr Trump said of Ms Kelly ""there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever"".

"We assume that in our hyper-connected world, we can always access the information we need and track down the people we want to find. But the tragedy atGrenfell Towerhas thrown up a further horrible reality - two weeks on, the exact number of people who died is still unknown. On Wednesday,Detective Superintendent Fiona McCormack announcedthat the number of dead and missing had risen to 80. She also gave the most detailed account yet of how the police are trying to establish numbers. A wall of posters has appeared near the tower Why is it so hard to arrive at a figure? Many of the details of the current investigation are being kept close to officials' chests, but we can combine what we do know and look at past incidents. The first step is to set up a casualty bureau - a phone line the public can use to report people missing. The one for Grenfell Tower is on 0800 0961 233. Police have been urging members of the public who know of people who are missing to get in touch and to put aside any reservations they may have about contacting the police. But what about the people who aren't reported missing? This is much harder and in the case of Grenfell Tower the police say they are reviewing information from ""all imaginable sources"" to try to establish who was in the building that night. Judge 'doubt' over inquiry scope Retired judge to lead disaster inquiry Adele pays tribute to Grenfell victims at Wembley Stadium show Residents confront minister over issues The Tenant Management Organisation gave the police a list of tenants which turned out to contain inaccuracies. But in any case, it wouldn't have included visitors, many children or anyone illegally subletting. The electoral roll also helps to provide a picture, but again, not everyone living in the building or in each flat will be listed. So the police turned to schools, nurseries, government agencies, even fast food delivery outlets. They asked residents about their friends and neighbours. And they used recordings of 999 calls made on the night of the fire. Social media provides another source of intelligence. But this is like a jigsaw puzzle with so many people posting information about the missing. With all these sources, if names are spelled differently or personal information is inaccurate, this can lead to confusion, delay and double-counting. There is also often an international element, so the police will work with embassies according to a process supported by Interpol. The lack of clarity over the number of bodies still inside Grenfell Tower has caused great distress among the local community, with many questioning why this is the case. The police say they have done a full visual search of every flat on every floor. However, they say, ""utter devastation"" in the building is making a full forensic search difficult. ""It will be dusty, they will be witnessing harrowing things and of course there are no working lifts, so you have to climb up by foot,"" said Colin Sutton, a former police senior investigating officer. The ferocity of the fire itself makes it harder to recover remains and it is the police's view that there may be people who will never be recovered or identified. Where it's possible, identification will take place at the scene, using visual identification and DNA. It is the local coroner who leads the investigation and decides what evidence is required to identify people. Police are unwilling to estimate what the final number for those who died in Grenfell Tower will be, although Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said he hoped it wouldn't be triple figures. This has frustrated families, friends and residents who think the number will be much higher than the current number of confirmed missing and dead. In previous serious incidents, British authorities have overestimated numbers so police say they now take great care to avoid doing this. After thePaddington rail crashin October 1999, police said they thought 61 people were dead, however the final figure was 31. And two weeks after theIndian Ocean tsunami,externalin December 2004, the government said 453 British people were ""highly likely"" to be lost. The final number of Britons confirmed dead was 149 (and thousands of others). Overestimating numbers can cause undue alarm to families waiting to hear about loved ones and it can damage confidence in the police. The media has also been criticised for simply repeating the police figures, which is common practice. On the day the fire broke out, BBC News and other news organisations began to gather their own information to independently verify the numbers of victims and survivors. On 16 June when the police said the official number of confirmed dead was 30,the BBC estimated the number of dead and missing to be more than 70. Police say the search and recovery process at Grenfell Tower will take at least until the end of the year and the identification process will take even longer. So far, they say they have spoken to at least one person from 106 of the 129 flats in the building. But there are still 23 flats where they ""presume no-one survived"".

"Ankle-grazing hemlines, floaty sleeves and necklines which stop at the, well, neck. Modest dressing is having its day and putting cleavages and bare thighs under wraps. Farrah Storr, editor of the sexually-liberated magazine, Cosmopolitan,has written in the Times,externalabout why, at 38, she has decided to cover up. Age, she says, has something to do with it, as does body-shape (my hips are becoming ""padded, my backside ""cushiony"") but it's also about her reconnecting with her Pakistani heritage. In the office, she settles on tuxedo shirts and white trainers - ""a sort of sexless template for my work persona"", she writes. Others at the top of their game are also dressing modestly. Adele delights the fashion world in custom-made dresses and haute couture, but rarely bares her arms or displays more than an ankle. In 2003, Victoria Beckham's dress was low-cut with a hemline just below the knee when she accompanied her husband, David, to Buckingham Palace to pick up an OBE; this year, her hemline was down to her ankles when she picked up her own And Victoria Beckham, once associated with Little Black Dresses and those silk green hotpants on the catwalk, is now more likely to be seen in long, loose dresses with only a smidgen of flesh on show. But are these women opting for a more flowing silhouette because of their age and shape, or is modest dressing a new fashion trend? Nazmin Alim is creative director at Aab, which has been making modest wear for 10 years. She says the idea of dressing modestly has always been around but over the last couple years, the fast-growing population of young Muslim women has pushed the concept on social media. They have spending power, influence and don't want to compromise faith and fashion - so the market has taken note, she says. On Instagram, there are hundreds of thousands of images with the hashtag #modestfashion. Adele lit up the stage at Wembley Stadium, but kept bare flesh to a minimum Nazmin recalls looking for a long skirt years ago, but only finding a pencil skirt with a big slit. Now, she says, Aab is offering an ""alternative fashion choice"". These are clothes not just for Muslim women but other women who feel more comfortable with their arms and legs covered, she says. The recurring theme around modest fashion is that a definition is difficult to find, and not altogether necessary. Romanna Bint-Abubaker, who was behind London's first Modest Fashion Week in February, says she believes modesty has so many forms and is for everyone. ""We provide choices and alternatives. We're not dictating what that modesty should look like,"" she says. Women do not need to dress in a way to attract attention these days, she says, they have character and power, and it's their personality that's doing the attracting. Her company, Haute Elan, which curates collections of modest clothing for its London store and website sells mainly to women in their 20s from the UK, US and Middle East. When choosing pieces, style is the number one priority - comfort and modesty, a joint second, she says. Aab designs with comfort and design in mind, including length, movement, sleeves and interchangeable pieces So if modesty lacks a definition, where do sellers draw the line? With summer holidays around the corner, Romanna says bikinis are off their radar, but they might stock a swimsuit with a skirt covering the thighs. And remember Nigella Lawson on the beach in a burkini? Romanna says the suit that covers the whole body except the face, hands and feet sells well to women who aren't Muslim but might be slightly older or larger. Mehreen Baig, a 27 year-old British Pakistani, says she worries about labelling clothing "" modest"". That implies everything else is immodest, she points out. ""Clothing is all about self-expression, and that's different for every person. What I wear depends on what day it is, my mood and where I'm going."" Today, on a dress-down at work day, she's wearing leggings, flip-flops and a baggy top. Not exactly modest, she says. But her big circle of Asian, Muslim friends, who wear headscarves, might seek out designers to find clothing to match their hijabs. ""Girls who want to cover up have got somewhere to go to now where they can feel fashionable and cover up. That's a beautiful thing,"" she says.

"Left to right: Greg James, Annie Mac and Clara Amfo BBC Radio 1 has a problem. But it's not the playlist, its listening figures or social media following that controller Ben Cooper is concerned about - it's where the next generation of presenters is coming from. ""It's everyone's favourite game at Radio 1 to try and second guess me and come up with their fantasy schedule,"" he laughs as he speaks to the BBC on Wednesday morning. Cooper is chatting to journalists as heunveilsRadio 1 Vintage - a pop-up station which will broadcast old shows from across the decades as part of the station's 50th birthday celebrations in September. He describes the new venture as a great way of celebrating Radio 1's history - but what about its future? Nick Grimshaw has presented the Radio 1 breakfast show for nearly five years ""I'm not planning any schedule changes at the moment,"" he says, ""but I'm always looking for fresh new talent, for the next set of presenters, but I think it's really weird how it's getting harder. ""It's getting harder because you don't have the likes of MTV presenters like Cat Deeley, Edith Bowman, Trevor Nelson or Zane Lowe. ""You don't have T4 with Vernon Kay and Dermot O'Leary. You don't have CD:UK or Top of the Pops. So it's really hard to find that next group of presenters that are coming up."" With fewer platforms and avenues for presenters to make a name for themselves, where could the next generation of radio presenters come from? Jameela Jamil presented T4 before joining Radio 1 in 2012 In recent years, Radio 1's line-up has sometimes resembled a Sunday morning TV schedule. Fearne Cotton, Nick Grimshaw, Jameela Jamil and many more were hired to present on the station after first cutting their teeth on TV. But Cooper says the issue now with hiring from TV is the fundamental change in the type of personalities which fill our screens. ""With modern youth culture on television, you can't pick someone famous off the TV, because what you've got now is a lot of reality television, and people who are famous for a short burst of time,"" he explains. ""So it's really hard to find those next stars in the radio industry."" Saying that, Radio 1 has flirted with reality TV stars in the past - like when Kelly Osbourne was hired to present The Surgery. But she lasted less than 18 months and the station has rarely done it since (although early breakfast host Adele Roberts was once a Big Brother contestant). When Dan & Phil joined the station in 2012, listeners' reactions ranged from massive excitement to ""Sorry, who?"" While Radio 1's older listeners might not have heard of vlogging, hiring YouTubers who have built up their own following online seemed like a logical next step for a station which is constantly chasing a young audience. The show was popular, but the pair - otherwise known as Dan Howell and Phil Lester - left after four years. Cooper says: ""We've looked at YouTubers, people like Dan & Phil, but they get tempted by huge amounts of money and go off on world tours around America and Australia."" We may well see more vloggers hired to present on the station in the future, but it's likely the publicly-funded Radio 1 will struggle to compete with the money that YouTubers can make from lucrative merchandising and endorsement deals. Scott Mills and Clara Amfo both previously worked in commercial radio Twenty years ago, commercial radio was the natural place for BBC bosses to look for new talent, and vice versa. Scott Mills, Chris Moyles and Tim Westwood were all poached from commercial stations in the 1990s, and similarly, many BBC figures have jumped ship into the world of commercial. But in recent years, movement has slowed. Radio 1 has been looking elsewhere for on-air talent, but simulcasting (where the same show is broadcast on multiple regional stations) has meant there are fewer presenting jobs in commercial radio. However many presenters still swap sides - one of Radio 1's brightest new talents, Clara Amfo, previously presented on Kiss. Both Jack Saunders and Greg James have student radio backgrounds So with more and more avenues into radio closing, where exactly is the next generation of radio presenters coming from? Cooper says the answer lies in student and community radio stations. ""We got Greg James from student radio - he's the sort of poster boy for it. He gets mobbed every time he goes to a conference,"" Cooper says. ""Student radio and community radio is the one place where you still see people passionate about getting into a room with a microphone and broadcasting to listeners. That's where I look for the next talent."" It's not just the BBC who has been looking at student stations for the next generation of big names. To take just one commercial example, Radio X's presenters include Jack Saunders, Issy Panayis, Ross Buchanan and Michael Lavin - all of whom started on student stations.

"Shields Road, Byker, is Britain's least vibrant shopping district, according to new rankings Shields Road in Byker, Newcastle-upon-Tyne is the least attractive location to open a shop, according to a list ranking Britain's retail centres. Property advisors, Harper Dennis Hobbs judged 1,000 shopping districts on how well the store mix suited local needs. They also looked at vacancy rates and the numbers of ""undesirable"" shops such as pawnbrokers or betting shops. Cambridge moved up this year's rankings and was rated the UK's most vibrant retail centre. ""Cambridge has seen more and more retailers move in and it's very much on the radar. It's on the Chinese tourist bus scene. There's a demand for luxury retail there,"" said Jonathan De Mello head of retail consultancy at Harper Dennis Hobbs. ""It's on the hit list now for many retailers."" Two London locations, Westfield and Knightsbridge were ranked in second and third place; with 17 of the top 50 most vital centres located in the capital. Cambridge Westfield, London Knightsbridge Chelsea Bluewater Wimbledon Village Richmond Canary Wharf Marlborough Bath Harper Dennis Hobbs last published their ""vitality"" rankings in 2014 when Westfield, London topped the list and Dudley, West Midlands was ranked bottom. The firm said in recent years quality brands had gravitated towards a few very strong shopping districts, because the internet meant they could trade from fewer locations. Many of the bottom 50 ranked centres represented Britain's poorest areas, the firm said. ""There's definitely a geographical divide. The most vital centres are all in a ring around the London area apart from a few exceptions like Harrogate,"" said Mr De Mello. ""The least vital are principally in the north-west, north-east and Scotland. We've seen some strong declines in those centres for wider macro-economic reasons."" In 2014 Dudley came bottom of the rankings, which only looked at 500 locations, this year they are at 416 out of 1,000 Across the whole country there had been a 2.7% increase in the proportion of ""value"" stores , including charity shops, in the past five years, Harper Dennis Hobbs said. There was a 1.6% increase in the proportion of ""undesirable"" shops, which they defined as encouraging debt or addiction, including betting shops, pawnbrokers, pay-day loan shops, e-cigarette shops and bingo halls. Shields Road, Byker, Newcastle-upon-Tyne Harrow Road, Paddington, London Stretford, Greater Manchester Tonypandy, Wales Walton Road, Liverpool Burnt Oak, north London Gateshead Kirkby, Merseyside Selly Oak, Birmingham Shettleston Road, Glasgow In the least vibrant retail location, Shields Road in Byker, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, almost a fifth of retail floor space is vacant and the High Street is dominated by betting shops and money lenders, according to Harper Dennis Hobbs. Harper Dennis Hobbs has expanded the rankings this year to include smaller town centres with a minimum of 40 shops. The firm suggests that the locations with highest scores, whether they are large city centres or small town high streets, are places brands might choose to target when considering opening new branches.

"This video can not be played Sir Martin expressed his ""greatest sympathy"" with the tower's residents The retired judge heading the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire says he is ""doubtful"" the process will be as wide-ranging as some residents hope. Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the probe could be limited to the cause, how it spread, and preventing a future blaze. He was speaking after travelling to the site of the fire in North Kensington and meeting some of the survivors. Meanwhile, Kensington and Chelsea Council halted a cabinet meeting, saying it may ""prejudice"" the inquiry. The authority planned to have the meeting on Thursday evening in private, without members of the public or press present, citing fears of ""disruption"" after angry residents attempted to enter the council's offices two days after the Grenfell fire. But after a legal intervention by several media organisations, the High Court ruled it had to be opened to the press. While the media have a legal right to attend public meetings of local councils, Kensington and Chelsea's leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said: ""We can't have an unprejudiced discussion in this room with the public inquiry that is about to take place, if journalists are recording and writing our comments."" Kensington council meeting adjourned Sir Martin said the fire was an ""enormous tragedy and I can honestly say I have never seen anything like that building which is now completely gutted"". The judge added: ""I'm well aware the residents and the local people want a much broader investigation and I can fully understand why they would want that. ""Whether my inquiry is the right way in which to achieve that I'm more doubtful and I will give that some thought and in due course make a recommendation."" He added: ""But there may be other ways in which the desire for that investigation could be satisfied otherwise through the work that I'm going to do."" Residents previously told how theyraised fire safety concernsfor several years before the fire. The Metropolitan Police has said it will investigate""all criminal offences that may have been committed"". The force says80 people are now presumed deadafter the fire but the final toll may not be known until at least the end of the year. Why don't we know how many died? Disabled mum 'had no chance' Adele pays tribute to Grenfell victims Guide to what happened Why people invent fake victims Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs she expects Sir Martin will want to produce an interim report ""as early as possible"" to address the immediate lessons from the fire. Sir Martin, a retired Court of Appeal judge, said an interim report could be produced within a year. But he said the inquiry ""could be very challenging"". He said: ""I think it's impossible to say how long it's going to take; I have said on other occasions a matter of months, some people have talked about two or three months. I don't think that's realistic... ""I would hope to be able to answer the basic factual questions such as how did the fire start, how did it spread, how was it able to engulf the building in such speed and also questions such as what internal precautions there were, what steps were available for alerting residents and allowing them to escape."" Sir Martin saw the floral tributes left near the scene of the fire Speaking after the meeting with Sir Martin, Joe Delaney, from the Grenfell Action Group, said he ""seems a genuine guy"" but ""seems to want to keep the scope very narrow... while we are more looking at why was it started in the first place, why were residents ignored?"" Mr Delaney had earlier expressed concerns that a judge with a background in commercial law would be dealing with what he said was a ""criminal matter"". Olesea Matcovschi, chairwoman of the Lancaster West Residents Association, said: ""We told him what we expected for the public inquiry, so we will see how it goes, it is too early to say if the public inquiry satisfies our concerns."" Questions were raised in the aftermath of the disaster about the cladding used on Grenfell and other buildings. Cladding from 137 high rise buildings in 41 local authority areas of England has now failed fire safety tests. Where have cladding fire tests failed? 'Stop testing cladding,' says housing boss Police saida 52-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of fraudulently claiming financial supportby saying he had lost family members in the fire. This video can not be played Sir Martin has ""to act quickly"" to produce an interim report in to the Tower block fire says Lord Falconer Born in Wales and educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, his career has spanned nearly five decades after being called to the Bar in 1969. As a lawyer, he specialised in commercial law which involved dealing with disputes relating to maritime and land transport of goods. Sir Martin went on to spend more than 20 years as a judge of the Commercial Court and Court of Appeal until his retirement in 2016. Leading barrister Michael Mansfield QC, who has met survivors of the fire, said it was ""unbelievable that lessons are not learned"" from theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which is now on its fourth chairman. He said that inquiry ""did not consult with the families and the survivors"" and ""the same thing seems to have happened all over again"". Grenfell residents have already pointed to a case in November 2014, in which Sir Martin ruled Westminster City Council could rehouse a single mother-of-five more than 50 miles away in Bletchley, near Milton Keynes. The decision was overturned by the Supreme Court in April 2015 - but addressing residents' concerns over the ruling, Sir Martin said he was surprised at the focus on one of many cases he had heard. He added: ""One simply reaches the conclusion that you think is right, applying the law as you see it, and that is the work of a judge."" He said the incident was of a type he was ""very familiar with as a judge"", having dealt with disasters on sea and land. Some of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Eighteen people have been formally identified by the coroner, but not all names have been released. The opening of inquests intoseven of the victims heard six-month-old Leena Belkadi was found deadin her mother's arms. Most of those who died in the fire were said to be in 23 of the North Kensington tower block's 129 flats. Some residents tried to move up the building to escape the flames - and it is thought a number may have ended up in one flat.

"Bakelants is preparing for the start of the Tour de France on Saturday Belgian cyclist Jan Bakelants has said sorry for a comment about the women who stand on the podium at the end of each stage of the Tour de France. Bakelants told a Belgian newspaper he would carry a ""pack of condoms, because you never know where those podium chicks have been hanging out"". The women present gifts, flowers and coloured jerseys at the end of stages. This year's Tour de France gets under way on Saturday, starting in the German city of DÃ¼sseldorf. Bakelants, who rides for the AG2R-La Mondiale team and won a stage in the 2013 race, made his comments when asked in an interview in last Wednesday's Het Laastse Nieuws about sexual abstention during the three-week Tour. AG2R-La Mondiale apologised for the comments, saying they were in ""very bad taste"". The Tour organisers ASO also demanded an apology from Bakelants for the ""sexist"" remarks. Bakelants, 31, and married with a young daughter, took to Twitter to say sorry. ""My sincerest apologies to all those offended by my words in a so called humouristic itw (sic).

"US tennis star Venus Williams has been involved in a car crash that led to the death of a 78-year-old man. A spokesman for Palm Beach Gardens police in Florida confirmed to the BBC they were investigating a fatal crash involving the Grand Slam champion. A man was taken to hospital after the accident on 9 June and died two weeks later from his injuries, he said. Police believe she was at fault but her lawyer says it was an accident. She has not been cited or charged. The man who died, Jerome Barson, was travelling with his wife who was driving their vehicle through an intersection when the collision happened. Ms Williams' car suddenly darted into their path and was unable to clear the junction in time due to traffic jams, according to witness statements in a police report obtained by US media. Mrs Barson was also taken to hospital but survived. ""[Ms Williams] is at fault for violating the right of way of [the other driver],"" the report said, adding that there were no other factors like drugs, alcohol or mobile phone distractions. The 37-year-old, seven-time Grand Slam champion reportedly told police she did not see the couple's car and she was driving slowly. Ms Williams' lawyer Malcolm Cunningham told CNN in a statement: ""Ms Williams entered the intersection on a green light. The police report estimates that Ms Williams was travelling at 5mph when Mrs Barson crashed into her. ""Authorities did not issue Ms Williams with any citations or traffic violations. This is an unfortunate accident and Venus expresses her deepest condolences to the family who lost a loved one."" Next week, Ms Williams is due to play her 20th Wimbledon tournament in London, where she is seeded 10th. Ms Williams and her sister Serena have dominated the women's game for two decades.

"An LGBT+ organisation has apologised after some of the messages it created to publicise a forthcoming gay pride campaign were criticised. Pride in London launched its Love Happens Here posters to promote the capital's Pride Festival, which takes place between 24 June and 9 July. But after a backlash on social media, the organisation admitted some of its content was ""misjudged"". It said it had removed four images from the campaign as a result. The poster campaign used messages from members of the LGBT+ community and ""straight"" people, which were then made into posters by artists. On seeing one of the posters, which used gay as a pejorative, Twitter user Ryan James said: ""Imagine being a kid at school who dies a little every time they hear something called 'sooooo gay' and then seeing this trash."" A spokesperson for the organisation said: ""It is clear we misjudged the content of some of the messages in this poster series, undermining the individuality, importance, and dignity of the LGBT+ community. ""This was never our intention, and we are genuinely sorry to have played any part in something that appears to devalue our own community, and have removed these... images from our campaign."" Some have complained that the campaign concentrates too much on the gay and lesbian members of the LGBT+ community. Twitter user Pippin Drill said: ""Not a single mention of bisexuals, but plenty from straight people. Interesting. #LondonPride #Biphobia."" Another poster which has caused offence read ""Befriend a gay person and win a prize. Friendship"", while another said ""My gay friends make me more attractive by association"". Hundreds of people complained about the campaign on Twitter, Twitter user Jamie said: ""I'm shocked at how @LondonLGBTPride have managed to badly stereotype straight allies and completely alienate and insult the LGBT community."" Pride In London ends with the annual gay pride parade, which is being held on 8 July Pride In London takes in 14-days of events, aiming to raise awareness of issues facing the LGBT+ community, culminating in the London Pride parade on 8 July. A spokesperson added: ""This year has seen our largest ever LGBT+ campaign...

"The minority Conservative government has survived its first major test after its Queen's Speech cleared the Commons. MPs backed the legislative programme - stripped back after the Tories lost their majority - by 323 to 309. But the government had to make a late pledge on funding abortions in England for women from Northern Ireland, amid fears of a Conservative rebellion. The Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs had agreed to support the government as part of a deal with the Tories. Three Labour frontbenchers - shadow ministers Ruth Cadbury, Catherine West and Andy Slaughter - were sacked by the leadership while shadow transport minister Daniel Zeichner had resigned. Corbyn sacks three over single market vote Northern Ireland women to get abortion funding Kuenssberg: Lessons from government climbdown No need to wear a tie, Bercow tells MPs The sackings relate to the MPs' support for Labour MP Chuka Umunna's amendment during the Queen's Speech debate, which was defeated.

"The minority Conservative government has survived its first major test after its Queen's Speech cleared the Commons. MPs backed the legislative programme - stripped back after the Tories lost their majority - by 323 to 309. But the government had to make a late pledge on funding abortions in England for women from Northern Ireland, amid fears of a Conservative rebellion. The Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs had agreed to support the government as part of a deal with the Tories. Three Labour frontbenchers - shadow ministers Ruth Cadbury, Catherine West and Andy Slaughter - were sacked by the leadership while shadow transport minister Daniel Zeichner had resigned. Corbyn sacks three over single market vote Northern Ireland women to get abortion funding Kuenssberg: Lessons from government climbdown No need to wear a tie, Bercow tells MPs The sackings relate to the MPs' support for Labour MP Chuka Umunna's amendment during the Queen's Speech debate, which was defeated.

"Sakineh Afrasehabi (left) and sister Fatima Afrasiabi As grieving families come to terms with losing their loved ones in the fire that engulfed Grenfell Tower, one woman says her disabled mother never had a chance of escaping to safety from her home on the 18th floor. Nazanin Aghlani still has no confirmation of her mother Sakineh Afrasehabi's fate but is convinced she could not have survived. Describing her family's anguish, she said: ""We're not all right. We can accept death but being burnt alive?"" Mrs Aghlani said her mother had been registered as disabled and the family had been worried about her ability to escape her home in an emergency. She claims repeated attempts to have her re-housed in more appropriate accommodation had failed. ""This property was not suitable for a disabled person,"" she said. ""She was put in a death trap. They should have thought of how she'd escape in a fire."" Sakineh Afrasehabi (left) and sister Fatima Afrasiabi Mrs Afrasehabi, who was partially sighted and could not walk very far, also had diabetes and high blood pressure. She moved to Grenfell Tower last year after trying for a long time to move from her previous home, in Ladbroke Grove, because she had been struggling to manage the 40 steps needed to access her flat. ""She'd waited 17 years to get a transfer, and then they put her that high up,"" Mrs Aghlani said. A spokesman for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Council said: ""We do not make direct offers of properties above 4th floor level in lifted blocks in the cases of people with disability access needs. ""However, through the council's choice-based letting system, Home Connections, housing applicants are able to choose to bid on lifted properties located on higher floors."" Mrs Aghlani said she was offered flats on only the higher floors of tower blocks and claims the council told her: ""we have too many disabled people."" She said she had sought legal advice on behalf of her mother who had been told she had not been near the top of the waiting list. ""My mum was forced to take anything that came along,"" she said. ""I had bid for so many one-bed flats for my mum, but we were refused anything and everything. ""She was getting so ill that she had no choice but to bid for Grenfell. I didn't want her to go, but she said she had no choice. "" Sisters Fatima Afrasiabi (left) and Sakineh Afrasehabi On the afternoon before the fire, Mrs Aghlani visited her mother for a family get-together and left at about 19:30. After the fire broke out, a friend came to help Mrs Afrasehabi and her sister, Fatima Afrasiabi, who was still with her, to get to their flat on the 23rd floor to get away from the smoke. Mrs Aghlani said the friend was one of a family of seven who had lived together in the property. At some point, firefighters told them to stay inside the flat, but a couple of the family managed to push past and get out. ""My mum couldn't have done that. She could hardly walk,"" she said. ""My brother was on the phone with them. She said her goodbyes to him over the phone. ""My aunt Fatima who was staying overnight at my mum's was crying for help and for someone to rescue them."" Mrs Aghlani has had to describe what dress fabric and rings her mother was wearing to the police in the hope she may be identified at some point. ""What's happened was so avoidable,"" she said. ""Those who have escaped the fire have lost everything - they don't have their homes, but they haven't lost their lives like my mum.""

"The government's change of heart on funding abortions for Northern Irish women on the NHS in England matters for three reasons. Most of all of course, it will make a material difference to the lives of many women who, for whatever reason, find themselves in the situation of crossing the Irish Sea and having to pay for an abortion that the tighter rules in their home country prevent. Justine Greening, the education secretary and equalities minister, has promised this will end. ""It is our proposal that this will no longer happen,"" she wrote in a letter to all MPs published at lunchtime. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Northern Ireland women to get abortion funding The details will of course be closely monitored, and this is not a change to the situation in Northern Ireland itself, but to provision for women who come here for help. It matters too because it shows how the arithmetic of the Commons has changed. Without an overall majority, the Tories were facing a defeat after an impressive campaign by the Labour backbencher Stella Creasy that had garnered support among plenty of Conservatives who looked like they might rebel and vote with her, rather than with their party bosses. Rather than risk a defeat on a critical day when the Queen's Speech has to pass, Conservative ministers were willing to shift in the end - to make a big concession to avoid being beaten. Queen's Speech votes are seen as a matter of confidence votes in any government. After chucking away her majority, it is vital today that Theresa May avoids any further embarrassment. This government climbdown is the first significant evidence that ministers may be willing to budge rather a lot in the face of backbench, and cross-party, demands. They just do not have the numbers to stand firm on issues where there is sympathy in their own ranks. Third though, there were suggestions the government would be too afraid of upsetting their partners, the Democratic Unionist Party, only days after their agreement was signed. The DUP, as many do in Northern Ireland, take a very conservative view on abortion, and while the Tories had insisted they would have no influence over social issues, this was the first test of whether they would somehow be able to pull strings. In this case however it was the parliamentary numbers that made the difference. It's not clear whether the DUP even tried to exert any pressure. But in any event, the government has changed its mind, avoiding defeat on the issue and - if, as likely, the amendment is withdrawn - also preventing DUP MPs from having to vote for measures that would fund abortion for Northern Irish women. That's a complicated way of saying that since the election, the government is more vulnerable to pressure from all sides. And to avoid giving ground and being defeated day after day, they're already showing a readiness to back down.

"Peak 70s: Chelsea footballer Alan Hudson shows off his collection of kipper ties MPs no longer have to wear ties in the House of Commons - does this finally spell the end for an item of men's clothing that was once de rigueur in Western Europe? It just seems wrong somehow - MPs getting up to speak in the Commons in open-necked shirts. This is an institution in which people still refer to each other as ""right honourable gentleman"" and are offered a toot of powdered tobacco from a silver snuff box on their way into work (although few now indulge). They are attended to by men in tights and garters. And yet now - thanks to a ruling by Speaker John Bercow (a man who takes part in a ceremonial parade every working day, in a black silk robe with gold trimming and a train) - they can loll about on the green benches as if they were at a family barbecue. Mr Bercow's ruling may offend traditionalists - and many MPs will no doubt continue to cling to the comfort of their tie - but it is in keeping with the long, slow decline of this particular item of men's clothing in the West. The only MP who wears a T-shirt in Parliament Bercow: MPs don't need to wear ties What not to wear in Parliament Wearing a tie to work used to be a sign that you had reached a certain station in life. Now, for many British men, turning up for work in a tie will prompt some wag to ask if you have a job interview or a court appearance. British explorer FE Younghusband shows how it was done in 1895 Only about a third of British office staff regularly wear a tie to work, according to some surveys. Dress-down Friday has become dress-down every day in many workplaces, although people who deal with the public are usually still expected to don a tie every morning. The tie used to be a powerful signifier of social status - the regimental tie, the club tie and, above all, the old school tie were all used as symbols of authority and belonging, and as a subtle way of excluding those who did not belong. It is a tradition that stretches back to Roman times, when soldiers would wear different coloured neckwear to denote membership of different groups. In today's workplace power games, however, the man at the top is very often the one without a tie. The Silicon Valley chief executive look - chinos and casual shirt, no tie - is a way of letting your underlings know that you are a true meritocrat, and not hidebound by stuffy rules. World leaders at the G8 in Northern Ireland in 2013 were told to wear ""smart casual"" attire, although they still wore suits. World leaders now dress ""smart casual"" for summits The tieless trend has even spread to the Royal Family. When Prince Harry met 91-year-old Ivor Anderson at a military event last year, the D-Day veteran cheekily asked him: ""Where's your bloody tie?"" There are, of course, many traditional institutions in Britain, such as the gentleman's clubs of Mayfair, where you will still not get through the door without a tie. But these places tend to take their cues from the top. Parliament's official rule book Erskine May says military insignia or uniforms should not be worn in the Commons and that the custom is ""for gentlemen members to wear jackets and ties"". Well, not any more. Even the royals have freed themselves from the ties that bind Croatia claims to be the birthplace of the modern neck tie or cravat. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, ""Croat"" and ""cravat"" were originally variations on the same word. It arrived in Western Europe in the 17th Century as a piece of military clothing designed to protect soldiers' shirts and buttons but gradually caught on as a fashion item, with elaborate dandyish flourishes and frilly collars. It would take several centuries for the tie to slim down to the narrow piece of patterned cloth we are familiar with today, and it did not become de rigeur among middle-class ""white collar"" workers until the industrial revolution, when it was deemed more practical and comfortable than the fancier alternatives. The tie has proved remarkably adaptable as a piece of clothing, expanding in width and acquiring elaborate paisley patterns during the ""flower power"" era of the 1960s and 70s and then shrinking back down for the ""skinny tie"" punk and new wave look. Yet now, like spats or the top hat, its time may finally be running out. Then again, they said that about beards.

"When I saidhello to Rupert Murdochoutside the Manhattan headquarters of his media empire last month, he told me he was ""not worried at all"" about Ofcom. It turns out his confidence was misplaced, but not for reasons that are simple, or were widely predicted. As Karen Bradley said in Parliament today, the advice she received from Ofcom was that despite massive corporate failure at Fox News, there was no good reason for doubting the commitment to excellent broadcasting standards of the future, fully Murdoch-owned Sky. The regulator also said the Murdochs were indeed fit and proper holders of a broadcasting licence. Thegrounds,externalon which Ofcom came to this view were that senior executives at Fox were unaware of the alleged rampant sexual and racial harassment by their biggest on-screen star (Bill O'Reilly) and Fox News' omnipotent late CEO, Roger Ailes, until 2016. Sky deal likely to face competition probe Given the alleged rampant harassment has been taking place since the early 2000s - though not a single case has yet been proven - this assertion by Ofcom opens up a very juicy possibility: if anyone can produce evidence that the Murdochs were informed about such behaviour before 2016, then Ofcom will have to review their thinking on the fit and proper tests. Rupert Murdoch had said he was ""not worried at all"" about Ofcom Journalists on both sides of the Atlantic have now begun searching for this evidence. Douglas Wigdor, the lawyer who is leading the charge against Fox News in Manhattan, told me this afternoon: ""In its bid to salvage the merger, Fox has represented to Ofcom that no executive director was aware of any allegations of sexual and racial harassment at Fox News prior to July 2016.  I can assure you that the veracity of that statement will be probed in our current litigations."" Ofcom raised concerns about media plurality, saying that ""public interest concerns"" about excessive concentration of power justified moving to Phase 2 of this regulatory process. But here we come to a curiosity about this case. Fox approached Ofcom to suggest behavioural remedies for these concerns. Basically they made suggestions about guaranteeing editorial independence and investment. These were enough to satisfy Ofcom, who said, according to Mrs Bradley, they were enough to ""mitigate"" the serious concerns about plurality - but that they could be strengthened. If you study what Mrs Bradley said in parliament, she puts a great deal of weight behind Ofcom's view that these remedies suggested by Fox could be strengthened. So for Ofcom, what Fox suggests on editorial independence and investment is enough to mitigate concerns about media plurality. Whereas for Mrs Bradley, these proposals aren't enough. Karen Bradley says she has been ""scrupulously fair"" In short, Mrs Bradley defers to Ofcom on most of what they say, but on the crucial matter of media plurality, where they are satisfied but think more can be done, she finds reason to delay this process by many months. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will have at least 24 weeks to look into this matter - so long as there is no change to the government's position, following submissions to Mrs Bradley from the relevant parties by 14 July. If the CMA come to the same conclusions as Ofcom about media plurality, the ball will be back in Mrs Bradley's court. So there could be a weird circularity about this whole process. At every stage of this bid, the Secretary of State, who is acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, has taken the cautious path and deferred to other bodies. This has the effect of politicising - even though they would resist the term - Ofcom and its chief executive, Sharon White. The name Murdoch is so synonymous with controversy that whatever Mrs Bradley's decision, and Ofcom's judgement, there would be anger. The truth is Rupert Murdoch and his newspapers aren't nearly as powerful in Britain as they used to be. Though their papers have an online presence, Westminster is often pathetically lethargic when it comes to political opinion online. And in any case, digital publications such as Mail Online will never, I suspect, have the influence of print ancestors such as the Daily Mail. This applies to the Murdoch titles too. Moreover, the media world has changed beyond recognition in just a few years. Netflix will invest $6bn in content this year. Amazon are reinventing original production by the minute. I hear constant whispers that Facebook are going to follow Twitter into live sports. Rupert Murdoch with his sons James (right) and Lachlan (left) This massive disruption, rather than political influence, is driving James Murdoch's zeal for full ownership of Sky. It's about those who own the pipes and those who tell the stories becoming one and the same. It's the marriage of distribution and content, in the parlance, that I've beenbanging on about,externalon this page. When competition for eyeballs is so intense, he wants total control of the access to Sky's 22 million customers, particularly in the under-nourished markets of Germany and Italy. The other story at Fox News which seems to have been neglected is that their ratings aren't what they used to be, and no wonder, given the departure of not just Mr O'Reilly but the brilliant Megyn Kelly. Together with the flight of advertisers online, this ratings pressure threatens to reduce profits at Fox News - which means that the Murdochs need to sweat their other assets, such as Sky. Hence this bid. A major worry for this still extraordinarily powerful family is that a new civil trial into phone hacking claims at The Sun is due to start in October. Fox had wanted to complete the takeover by the end of this year, to trigger a 10p-a-share special dividend. That now looks unlikely. For the Murdochs, this second attempt to acquire full control of a broadcaster they have done so much to build is proving to be as big a headache as the first. At some point, a politician will have to take a view on whether the Murdochs are too powerful. Given the current mood in Westminster, that's a tough call that Mrs Bradley - and the prime minister - feel they could do without.

"This video can not be played Global demand for opals is soaring, pushing up prices of the gemstones. As the 40ft (12m) drill rattles down through the red dirt, miner Craig Stutley makes a statement that sounds a lot like what he said 30 minutes ago. ""This is the hole,"" says the 45-year-old. Mr Stutley's mining partner, Richard Saunders, who seems eternally caked in dusty soil, mumbles in agreement. The two men are standing in the middle of the sun-bleached South Australian outback, hunting for opals, the rare gemstones that can sparkle with a rainbow of different colours. They sift through the earth that the test drill pulls up, searching for signs of opals that could potentially make them a fortune. With the largest, best-quality Australian opals worth more than Â£600,000 thanks to soaring demand from jewellers around the world, there is a vast amount of money to be - potentially - made. Richard Saunders (pictured) and his friend Craig Stutley are hoping for a big find The trouble is that opals are so scarce. Even in designated opal fields, you need luck, and months, or even years, of patience to find them. ""Half of it is in your head,"" says Mr Stutley. ""You have to think positive, otherwise you wouldn't come to work."" Mr Stutley and Mr Saunders are mining a patch of land 15 miles north of the South Australian town of Coober Pedy, which is known as ""the opal capital of the world"". South Australia supplies 80% of the world's opals, and the industry is centred on Coober Pedy, a town of around 3,500 people located 850 miles (1,368km) north of Adelaide, and 430 miles south of Alice Springs. At the peak of the opal rush 40 years ago there were thousands of miners based in the town that can see summer temperatures top 47C (117F), but as finds have steadily fallen ever since, today there are just dozens. The Shell Patch mining area is a desolate area of rocky ground There is, however, still considerable amounts of money to be made, with state-wide opal output totalling 15.1m Australian dollars ($11.5m; Â£9m) last year, according to the South Australian government. This comes as the global prices of opals have doubled in the past few years, thanks to constant demand from India and China, as well as an opal renaissance in western markets such as the US. While Mr Stutley and Mr Saunders are still waiting for their big find, they did at least have some recent luck, when in March they won a free lottery to mine a newly reopened opal field. The pair, along with about 50 other miners, were chosen at random to restart mining in Shell Patch Reserve, an area that had been off limits for 40 years due to its importance to local Aboriginal people. More than 200 people had entered the lottery, and the winners got plots or ""claims"" of land that measure 100m by 50m (328ft by 164ft). Opals are typically sliced and made into jewellery John Dunstan, the vice president of Australia's Opal Mining Association, was one of the first to get to work at Shell Patch. He has already received a small payday after finding a piece (known in the industry as a ""parcel"") of opal worth about 5,900 Australian dollars. Rather than tunnelling into the ground, Mr Dunstan is open-cut mining, which involves scraping away a few inches of rock with an excavator, and then periodically investigating for opals. He hopes that a big find at Shell Patch will attract new entrants into the industry. John Dunstan wants to see a new generation of opal miners ""There hasn't been a major strike [in Coober Pedy] for quite a few years,"" says Mr Dunstan. ""We are desperate to find a new opal field and hopefully attract some new opal miners."" He adds that there's a saying in Coober Pedy that often rings true - the moment you find your first opal you catch ""opal fever"". Its symptom is a relentless pursuit of opal, which is Australia's national gemstone. Coober Pedy has a population of just 3,500 For Mr Dunstan that moment happened at age 14 back in 1965 when he found his first opal. ""It's a lifestyle for me,"" he says. ""It's a passion."" Justin Lang, 27, is one of the new miners that Mr Dunstan wants to see. He and his business partner, Daniel Becker, 43, started opal mining five years ago. More stories from the BBC'sBusiness Brainseries looking at quirky or unusual business topics from around the world: Can you be taught to be more charismatic? Does selling up mean selling out? 'I turned my dad's erotic novel into a hit podcast' Would you carry something abroad for a stranger? Mr Becker says they approach it as ""a hobby that makes you money"". About one week a month they leave the shops where they work in the town of Hahndorf, near Adelaide, and head to Coober Pedy, where they mine several different fields. Opal miners sieve soil to try to find the gemstones Mr Lang says: ""The possibility of finding millions and millions of dollars is real."" He adds that he is also drawn to opal mining because it favours small operators, unlike the multi-million dollar companies that mine Australia for copper and uranium. Finding opal is ""just too irregular"" for big business, says Mr Lang. For Mr Lang and his fellow miners, it also doesn't hurt that opals are back in vogue, and quite literally in Vogue. Opal miners say they get ""opal fever"" Earlier this year the magazineprofiled,externalyoung jewellery designers who are making ""opal cool again"" after years with a reputation as either an antique that grandma wore, or as tacky jewellery that tourists would buy from Australian airports. In another boost to opal's comeback, Dior's latest jewellery collection is centred on the gemstone. ""Every opal is completely different,"" says Emily Amey, a New York-based jewellery designer who sources many of her opals from Australia. ""Different colours, different patterns, they are just mystical."" While Ethiopia is now extracting about half the amount of opals that South Australia produces - other nations with sources of opals include Brazil and Peru - Australia is not going to lose its number one crown anytime soon. Jeweller Emily Amey says that no opal is the same as another Australian miners such as Mr Dunstan just seemingly need a mixture of blind positivity, patience and luck to find the gemstones. ""There are still millions of dollars here to be found,"" he says. ""You've just got to be digging in the right spot.""

"Like many of his generation, Lai Chun-yin feels little love for China This week, Hong Kong marks 20 years since its return from the UK to China but Lai Chun-yin is not celebrating. He is lying on his back on the pavement, spinning a football in the air. Between his stunt and the iconic Hong Kong harbour skyline stand a handful of mesmerised tourists. Chun-yin is a 20-year-old coffee shop barista and freestyle footballer, supplementing his earnings by busking his ball skills on the street. ""I don't have much sense of belonging to China,"" he says. ""I love Hong Kong and feel like a Hong Konger. My generation just don't have a good impression of China."" Lai Chun-yin says he identifies as a Hong Konger His assessment of the mood among young Hong Kongers was borne out by a survey this month suggesting the number choosing to identify as ""broadly Chinese"" has declined to new lows in the three years since student democracy protestors occupied the heart of the city during the so-called Umbrella Movement. The Hong Kong handover in a nutshell Golden geese and democracy 'infections'- did predictions come true? When HK languages get political Hong Kong's post-handover generation John Simpson: Hong Kong 20 years on On a warehouse rooftop 21 floors up in a packed district of Kowloon, art student Prince Wong is putting the finishing touches to a wordless statement in graffiti about her sentiments on the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. Instead of painting the Hong Kong flag in its familiar colours of white flower on red background, she is spraying the background black to symbolise mourning. This video can not be played Born in 1997... in Hong Kong Only a few hours later, on the eve of President Xi Jinping's visit, Prince was arrested forclambering onto a monumentwhich was the 1997 handover gift from China to Hong Kong. At 20, Prince is a veteran protester. Her awakening came at the age of 15, watching pupils demonstrate against a patriotic curriculum on Chinese history which the local government tried to introduce in Hong Kong's schools. Two years later, she was at the heart of the 79-day Umbrella Movement, mounting a week-long hunger strike to demand democracy. Now she runs workshops in schools to politicise the generation coming up behind. But Prince is no longer optimistic about what protest can achieve. ""We still bear the scars of the Umbrella Movement,"" she says. ""We did our utmost and we lost. Before we hoped to move forward, now we're just trying to avoid moving backwards."" Prince was part of the group that stormed the handover gift from China to Hong Kong Prince is a symptom of the difficulty Mr Xi faces in connecting with Hong Kong's post-handover generation. She suspects his intentions and despises his values. ""If you want people to love your country, it depends on what you do,"" she explains. ""If your country treats your people well, then your citizens will sure love your country, right? We hate the government because they do bad things. We don't hate it for nothing."" In my - admittedly limited - experience this week, the only 20-year-olds in Hong Kong who are reliably celebrating Mr Xi's visit and the 20th anniversary of the handover are the mainlanders. Those who grew up in the Chinese school system are taught from an early age that the loss of Hong Kong in the 1840s was a moment of national humiliation and that taking it back from Britain 150 years later is correspondingly a moment of national pride. There are also those who fall in line with Beijing, like these supporters of Mr Xi This Hong Kong story is a crucial part of Mr Xi's political message at home, a centrepiece of his ""great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation"". Sunny Tan from Hunan Province in central China is enthusiastic. An economics student at Hong Kong University, Sunny has a summer internship at a big Chinese state bank and when we meet in the busy shopping area of Causeway Bay, she is wearing a sober business suit. In common with Chun-yin and Prince, she is a 20-year old Chinese national living in Hong Kong. But unlike them she went to school on the Chinese mainland, believes the history she was taught there and is celebrating the 20th anniversary of Hong Kong's handover. The protesters should accept reality, says mainland-born Sunny ""I see the handover as a sign of an increasingly powerful China,"" she says. ""I am a patriot and I think we should love our country."" ""Young people here just want to achieve a high level of democracy at high speed, they want to do it overnight. But they should understand the realities."" University campuses are a natural battlefield in this war of ideas. In his office overlooking Hong Kong bay with the hills of mainland China stretching away on the horizon, the vice chancellor of Hong Kong University, Peter Mathieson, tells me that ""the three and a half years I've been in post have been among the most tumultuous in Hong Kong's history"". Some of his local students have moved from demanding democracy in the Umbrella Movement three years ago to calling for self-determination or even independence today, claiming that separation from China may be the only way of realising their goals. Such ideas are anathema to Beijing and, on the mainland, Mr Xi has subjected university campuses to ever stricter political indoctrination, but Peter Mathieson says that however unrealistic independence may be for Hong Kong, university campuses should be places where people are permitted to think the unthinkable. ""I think the calls for independence are a symptom, not a disease,"" he explains. Security is very tight for President Xi Jinping's Hong Kong visit ""The actual number of my students who really believe in independence is quite small but they're anxious about the future. So people want self-determination, anxious about the alternative - which is greater and greater integration with China."" After a long career in the Hong Kong civil service spanning the decades before and after the handover, Rachel Cartland takes the long view. She first arrived here from Britain 45 years ago at the age of 22, herself fresh from university. After watching many politicians come and go, and following the twists and turns of Hong Kong's democracy movement, she is hopeful about the values and the talent of some of the young leaders now emerging. ""I think if they can keep their heads, avoid going to prison as far as they possibly can and think about how to appeal not just to the young hotheads like themselves but also to the more mainstream Hong Kongers,"" she says. ""I think Hong Kong could have a pretty bright future."" ""Personally I have enormous faith in the people of Hong Kong. I think it will take a very great deal to make them look more like mainland China is today."" For some young Hong Kongers the vision of a bright future is less about politics than economics. Ann Tsang is 33 years old, single and saving for an apartment. She and her 30-year-old brother both live with their parents. She says that is completely normal in Hong Kong, but driving discontent. ""You don't eat, you don't go out, you don't have a social life, just to buy a house and you have a mortgage of 30 to 40 years. Basically you live like a slave for your house."" Property prices in Hong Kong are notoriously sky-high Ann and I are standing on a busy street, staring at the apartments on offer in the window of an estate agent. A space little bigger than a living room elsewhere in the world costs more than US$1m (Â£770,000) here. Hong Kong is now the world's most unequal city after New York. Ann Tsang is not a political protester, but she would like the politicians to tackle the housing crisis. ""Youngsters get really agitated and frustrated. They don't know what their future is,"" says local writer Jason Ng. On a hot Hong Kong tram rattling through this densely packed human hive, he remarks that this is not the tour the Chinese president will get. ""He will be taken on a North Korean-style highly controlled tour where he will only see the best side of Hong Kong. He will not see pain and suffering or protesters."" Jason Ng argues that this lack of connection with ordinary people has caused Chinese leaders to misdiagnose the problem in their relationship with Hong Kong. ""As far as Beijing is concerned the root cause of a lot of the ungovernability of Hong Kong is because young people don't have the sense that they are part of China. And the best way to get at that is to inculcate an idea of patriotism at an early age. To Beijing that is the ultimate solution. But you can't force people to love you."" The writer says if by some miracle he got a chance to speak to the Chinese president during the celebrations to mark the 20th anniversary of the handover, his message would be blunt. ""If you want to govern Hong Kong there's one very simple answer. Leave us alone. That's all we want. We are not interested in ending one-party rule in China. We just want our way of life. So de-escalate. Don't push us because when you push us, we push back.""

"This video can not be played Sarah Ewart: 'Why can't we have abortions in NI?' Women from Northern Ireland will be able to get free abortions in England, the government has said. More than 50 MPs from the major parties had backed a Labour-led call for the women to have access to NHS abortions in England. They currently have to pay. The BBC's political editor said ministers made the concession because it appeared some Tory MPs might back the call, risking a possible defeat. Northern Ireland's abortion laws are much stricter than the rest of the UK. Abortions are only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her physical or mental health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which they can be performed legally. Women seeking an abortion can travel to England to have one privately, but had not been allowed to have them free on the NHS - a position that was backed by the UK Supreme Court earlier this month. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Abortion law 'matter for NI assembly' Supreme Court rules against Northern Ireland woman Queen's Speech clears Commons An amendment on the issue, co-ordinated by Labour's Stella Creasy, which had cross-party backing, had been selected for inclusion in the Queen's Speech debate - which meant Theresa May's government ran the risk of possible defeat. Since the election Mrs May no longer has a majority of MPs so has to rely on backing from the 10 DUP MPs - but even then she remains vulnerable to a rebellion from her own Conservative MPs. The news of the change of policy was welcomed by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service which described it as a ""landmark moment: for years the women of Northern Ireland, despite being UK citizens and taxpayers, have not been entitled to NHS-funded treatment"". Labour's Stella Creasy had gathered support for her amendment Without an overall majority, the Tories were facing a defeat after an impressive campaign by the Labour backbencher Stella Creasy that had garnered support among plenty of Conservatives who looked like they might rebel and vote with her, rather than with their party bosses. Rather than risk a defeat on a critical day when the Queen's Speech has to pass, Conservative ministers were willing to shift in the end - to make a big concession to avoid being beaten. Queen's Speech votes are seen as a matter of confidence votes in any government. After chucking away her majority, it is vital today that Theresa May avoids any further embarrassment. Read more from Laura Abortion provider Marie Stopes UK said it was ""a hugely positive step forward, but there is no reason why these services shouldn't be provided in Northern Ireland, saving thousands of women each year the cost and stress of travelling to the mainland"". But anti-abortion charity Life said the government should be ""neutral on the issue of abortion"". ""This action by the Department for Women and Equalities not only undermines that neutrality, but also shows an abject disdain for Parliament, by seeking to bring this change in via the back door, avoiding full debate on this issue."" In a debate on the Queen's Speech on Thursday, Ms Creasy said women were having to spend Â£1,400 to get an abortion in England. Conservative Sir Peter Bottomley asked why, in the case of women from Northern Ireland, ""only the poor should be denied lawful abortions"". Chancellor Philip Hammond replied that Justine Greening, the minister for women and equalities, ""intends to intervene to fund abortions in England for women arriving here from Northern Ireland"". He later said: ""We will be funding [the Government Equalities Office] with additional funding so that she can make a grant to the external organisations that provide these services"". Analysis: James Gallagher, health and science reporter, BBC News Secrecy and stigma surround women from Northern Ireland deciding to have an abortion. They will, effectively, be left with two choices - ordering abortion pills online or travelling across the Irish Sea, often to Liverpool. Online pills are illegal and taken without medical supervision. Going to England comes with the expense of the journey, accommodation, time off work and the procedure itself. About 700 women came to England, from Northern Ireland, for an abortion last year. The cost is thought to stop some women from the poorest Northern Ireland families having an abortion in England. So, the announcement that the procedure, but not the other costs, will be free in England could influence some of those difficult, personal decisions. But this does not change the culture or visceral debate around abortion in Northern Ireland. The courts have ruled any decision on abortion law lies with the Northern Ireland Assembly, so any change in the law is deeply unlikely. Campaigner Sarah Ewart, who travelled to England for a termination in 2013 after doctors said her unborn child had no chance of survival outside the womb, said of the chancellor's announcement that it was positive news, but it was unfortunate that women from Northern Ireland found themselves in this position in the first place. The prime minister's official spokeswoman said later the government had estimated the cost of the decision to be ""around Â£1m a year"" and that the government was ""prepared to fund in excess of this"" if needed. The estimate was based on the 724 women who travelled from Northern Ireland last year to have an abortion. She added that ministers had ""had concerns about the issue and that's why we're taking action"". This video can not be played Northern Ireland's abortion debate: For and against Following the concession from the government, Stella Creasy's amendment was withdrawn. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson congratulated the Labour MP and said: ""I'm glad that Justine Greening has acted on this issue, but it is embarrassing that the health secretary had done nothing on this so far and only the threat of a defeat prompted change. ""Women deserve better than having their rights reliant on House of Commons arithmetic."" The concession on abortion came on the same day Belfast's Court of Appeal ruled abortion law in Northern Ireland should be left to the Stormont Assembly, not judges - effectively overturning an earlier ruling that the current abortion laws were incompatible with human rights laws.

"This video can not be played HMS Queen Elizabeth Capt Jerry Kyd says it ""is not just a ship but a sea base"" Russia has dismissed the Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier as ""just a convenient, large maritime target"". Russian Defence Ministry spokesman Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov was hitting back at the UK for criticism of Russia's ageing carrier Admiral Kuznetsov. HMS Queen Elizabeth set sail on Monday from Rosyth dockyard in Scotland. Later UK Defence Secretary Michael Fallon called the Admiral Kuznetsov ""old, dilapidated"". The ship sailed through the English Channel last year. The 26-year-old Kuznetsov rarely goes anywhere without a naval tug, in case it breaks down. Last October it was part of a Russian flotilla that sailed to Syrian coastal waters via the North Sea, English Channel and Mediterranean. The thick, black smoke belching from the giant Soviet-era ship attracted some mockery on social media. This video can not be played Aerial views of the Russian Kuznetsov carrier group transiting UK waters Planes flew bombing raids over Syria from the Admiral Kuznetsov - making it in Mr Fallon's words ""a ship of shame"". It is the only carrier in the Russian navy. Russian airpower has given Syrian President Bashar al-Assad considerable muscle in his offensive against rebel groups, some of which are backed by the West. Maj Gen Konashenkov said Mr Fallon's ""exalted statements"" about HMS Queen Elizabeth ""demonstrate a clear lack of knowledge of naval science"". ""Unlike the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier, fitted with air-defence, anti-submarine and, most importantly, Granit anti-ship missile systems, the British aircraft carrier is just a convenient, large maritime target,"" he said. At a cost of Â£3bn (â¬3.4bn; $3.8 billion) HMS Queen Elizabeth is the most powerful ship ever built for the Royal Navy. Its sister ship, HMS Prince of Wales, is also being built at Rosyth. Writing inthe Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Fallon said ""when you saw that old, dilapidated Kuznetsov sailing through the Channel, a few months ago, I think the Russians will look at this ship [HMS Queen Elizabeth] with a little bit of envy."" ""We will take every precaution to make sure that they don't get too close, but I think they will be admiring her,"" he added.

"Whether you're out for a cuppa with your mum, in a Whatsapp chat group with your mates or glued to Twitter, there are two words dominating many conversations this summer: Love Island. The ITV2 reality TV show has grown a dedicated following with audience figures showing around 2.1 million tuning in to watch each episode. For those who haven't seen it before,the show throws 13 singletons into a villa where they couple upin the hope a blossoming romance develops. The public usually has the pick of who stays on the Love Island with the winning couple receiving a Â£50,000 prize. Fans will know that if you get hooked then it is a major commitment in your life, with the show on every night of the week - including a weekly-round up of the best bits. As Love Island reaches the half-way point of this series, here's a catch-up on some of the stand out moments so far. What started out as a conversation about who pays on a date turned into a hot debate that ended a relationship before it had barely started. By episode nine, contestant Camilla had been cracking on (that's Love Island code for flirting) with fellow islander Jonny and thought that they might have something special. But then came the subject of feminism. Speaking in the kitchen, Camilla argued that everyone who believes in equality should be a feminist and questioned whether her potential partner felt the same. Jonny argued that ""real feminists"" believe in a ""slope towards them, rather than towards men"" and said ""women almost have more opportunities"". Cue lots of tears from Camilla and then an awkward chat between the pair where they decided they were too different to form a lasting romance. It sparked a big debate on Twitter about whether Camilla could class herself as a feminist while appearing on a TV show where the female contestants had to twerk to bag a date. @LaceyvanderHargwrote,external: ""Feminism is having the choice to do what you want. Camilla (and the others) want to do it, so they can and it's their choice."" While Leanne Bradysaid,external: ""Camilla, not sure the twerking & lap dance were showing a good example of feminism."" In what is a classic love triangle, contestant Olivia had to choose between two men, Mike and Chris, who were both vying for her affection. It created one of the best one liners of the show when Chris branded his love rival ""Muggy Mike"" for choosing Olivia to couple up with. Twitter was impressed and the phrase end up trending on the social media site. That was the question on everyone's lips following a shock double elimination. Let's set the scene. Dom and Jess had been coupled up from the beginning of the show and believed they were a ""power couple"". But she was dumped from the island, alongside fellow contestant Mike, and insisted to Dom she would be ""on the outside waiting"" for him when he left. Then came media headlines that Mike and Jess had spent the night together after being eliminated which was coupled with a cosy shot of themposing together on Instagram,external. Meanwhile inside the villa, Dom was pining for Jess and indicating he would remain faithful to her during the remainder of the show. Fans will have quickly discovered that rumours from the outside world have a habit of being revealed inside the villa. In what was one of the most awkward moments of the series so far, it came down to contestant Marcel to break the news to his housemate that his love interest may have set her sights elsewhere. A sun cream bottle was thrown, doors were slammed and the word ""bruv"" was used a lot. Tissues at the ready. Episode 21 was an emotional rollercoaster for many fans who have grown to love contestant Camilla. After a rocky start, Jonny and Camilla decided to rekindle their romance after putting their differences aside when it came to their feminism views. (Yep - a lot can change in a week). There were plenty of shy glances and late-night kissing, with viewers desperately hoping that nice-girl Camilla had finally found ""the one"". Then new girl Tyla walks in. Ever the lady, Camilla gives her blessing for Jonny to pursue his new romance and he does just that - snogging Tyla a few minutes later. While she may be the forgiving type, viewers definitely are not. Laura Eagleswrote,externalon Twitter: ""I wonder if Jonny realises he's on par with Theresa May as one of the most disliked people in Britain right now."" Allana Hoggardsaid,external: ""Camilla is a beautiful educated humanitaran bomb disposal expert and Jonny is a waste of space. Get him off my telly pronto"" Even last year's Love Island contestants waded into the drama. With the show expected to last seven weeks, producers have thrown in a huge curveball to keep the drama hot and the viewers hooked. In a Love Island first, the contestants' relationships will face their ""ultimate test"" when 11 new faces and a brand new villa are unveiled in Thursday's episode. Expect more muggy behaviour, more tears and lots more hilarious Twitter reaction for weeks to come. What's the big deal about Love Island?

"This video can not be played Orla Guerin on the front line in Mosul It was three years ago that a lightning advance by about 800 jihadist fighters in northern Iraq morphed into a global threat. Having taken over Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, the extremists proclaimed the birth of their so-called ""Islamic State"". As their self-styled caliphate marks its third anniversary, Iraqi forces are getting ready to pronounce its death - at least on their soil. In Mosul, which was the largest city under IS control, the remaining militants are corralled in the narrow alleyways of the Old City. Elite counter-terrorism units are hunting them down, house-to-house and room-to-room, in an area of about one square mile (2.6 sq km). Troops escorted us through the battle zone, where little stands except mounds of rubble. Here and there we spotted matted piles of human hair. Locals say militants left their beards behind as they fled. In the streets where they dispensed terror, the corpses of ""Islamic State"" (IS) fighters now lie rotting in the sun. More than 800,000 civilians have been displaced by the battle for Mosul We saw some of their victims fleeing on foot, taking only their children and their trauma. ""We couldn't move, we couldn't do anything,"" said Ilham, a gaunt woman in a black headscarf, who was escaping the fighting with her family. ""They were completely in control of everything. We were afraid to go anywhere."" As she spoke a neighbour, Sebham Jassem, doused his young sons in bottled water handed out by Iraqi troops. ""We had no clean water for two months,"" he said. ""Five mortars landed on our house and it was destroyed. We were hungry and scared. Our lives were a disaster."" The Iraqi army says it has recaptured about half of Mosul's Old City The campaign to free this ancient city has dragged on for almost nine months. I watched the opening shots being fired last October by Peshmerga fighters, from Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region, who swept towards Mosul. They were part of a complex coalition against IS that included the Iraqi security forces, state-sanctioned Shia militias, and Sunni tribal fighters. After the liberation of Mosul - a predominantly Sunni city - the scramble for power here could involve Turkey and Iran, and threaten the future of Iraq. The secret lives of young IS fighters Why Mosulâs Great Mosque of al-Nuri mattered Battle for Mosul: The story so far There is already one flashpoint on the horizon - the Kurds have announced plans for a referendum on independence in September. Even as Iraqi leaders prepare to declare victory in Mosul, there is a sense this battle may have to be fought again. Like al-Qaeda before it, IS found support among marginalised Sunnis in Iraq. The minority community complains of discrimination by the Shia-led government in Baghdad. Unless that changes the extremists could be back. Iraq's military has not disclosed casualty figures but commanders admit to heavy losses As he toured newly liberated streets in the Old City, a commander of Iraq's Counter Terrorism Service conceded that IS could be reborn. ""We can't tell now,"" said Maj Gen Maan al-Saadi. ""It depends on the politicians. It's complicated in Iraq. What I can tell you is that this country is now cleaned of IS. "" The militants who once controlled a third of Iraq may now be reduced to a few pockets of resistance, but Mosul bears many new scars. Mohammed Abdul Karim had an IS headquarters right beside his house, and a makeshift IS prison behind it. From his living room, the 30-year-old could hear the screams of those inside. A few months ago he joined them. IS detained him at work angry that he was repairing mobile phones, which they had banned. He walked me through the gates of the large two-storey house where he was held, pointed out the handcuffs still attached to the downstairs window. ""They brought a prisoner over here, and tied him up,"" he said rushing to a tree in the driveway. ""They put water all over his body. Then they brought two electric cables and shocked him until he fainted. They woke him and did it again. Later they rolled him up in a blanket."" The Great Mosque of al-Nuri and the leaning al-Hadba minaret were destroyed by IS last week Mr Abdul Karim said the man was one of two he saw tortured to death in this way. Another young man was beaten all over his body because he was suspected of providing intelligence to the Iraqi army. ""They beat him so much he confessed just to end the pain,"" he said. ""After that they killed him."" After Mosul is fully liberated more accounts like this may emerge, and new tensions may come to light - between those who opposed the extremists and those who backed them. Mr Abdul Karim said some of his neighbours joined the militants. If they returned to their homes, he added, he would do to them what IS did to his fellow prisoners. Security forces are advancing into a hospital complex where IS militants are holed up When this city finally regains its freedom the celebrations may not last long - for Mosul, or for Iraq. Many military families across the nation will be mourning sons killed in the fight here. Iraq has not disclosed casualty figures but commanders admit to heavy losses. ""We lost many martyrs here, all of them young,"" said Lt Col Mohammed Diab al-Tamimi of Iraq's Emergency Response Division. Lt Col Tamimi says he is always preparing for ""another battle"" ""I miss them. Their families miss them and the country misses them.  But they did not die for nothing. They died for this country. May God take them to paradise."" Col Tamimi and his men have been fighting for days to clear a hospital complex where about 200 IS militants are believed to be holed up in a basement. Asked if he thought the militants might re-emerge in future his response was swift. ""In Iraq,"" he said, ""there is always another battle.""

"This video can not be played June Whitcombe and Gretel Rieber met after the war as a special relationship developed between Reading and Dusseldorf In 1947 Germany and the UK were both still reeling after World War Two. But in Reading that did not stop the mayor, in the face of fierce criticism, inviting impoverished children from the city of Dusseldorf to her town. The twinning still thrives, and resulted in a life-long friendship between Gretel Rieber and June Whitcombe. Gretel Rieber was 12 years old and living in poverty when she was pulled out of class and put on a boat to the UK. Excitedly waiting for her arrival in the English town of Reading, Berkshire, was 13-year-old June Whitcombe. Seven decades on, she still vividly remembers returning home from school to find her new ""German sister"". ""When I first saw Gretel I was quite disappointed because she looked quite normal,"" says Mrs Whitcombe, recalling that day 70 years later. ""I hadn't met a German person before. I had only seen what was depicted in cartoons and, of course, propaganda and what we read about the bombing. ""I thought she would at least maybe have horns and two heads. All I knew of Germany was that it was bad and it was evil."" Poverty was spreading in Dusseldorf after it was bombed by Allied forces trying to break the Nazis' resolve The Royal Berkshire Regiment was occupying Dusseldorf and witnessed first hand widespread hunger and homelessness. Soldiers reported this back to Reading mayor, Phoebe Cusden. They told her how poverty was spreading after the city was reduced in parts to rubble by Allied forces trying to break the Nazi's resolve. Historians say some 56,000 people were living in ruins, cellars and bunkers. Moved by their stories, the mayor visited the city herself and was shocked by what she found. She penned a plea for help in the Berkshire Chronicle that resulted in half-a-tonne of food parcels being donated, ultimately paving the way for her ambition of bringing an initial six impoverished children to Reading. She wrote at the time: ""The condition of the poorest family in Reading is many times better than the average family in Germany. ""It would surely be disastrous to any hope of rebuilding Europe if we allowed the German people to believe, as they are already beginning to believe, that we are deliberately starving them."" An article about Phoebe Cusden's visit to Dusseldorf was published in the Berkshire Chronicle in September 1947 In response, the paper received furious letters from residents of Reading, a large town 40 miles west of London then known for its beer, biscuits and bulbs. One particularly angry letter read that ""we still cannot trust the Boche"" and that ""he himself should work to feed his children - it is not our job"". The Reading branch of the British Legion was also opposed, releasing a statement which read: ""We are of the opinion that any such assistance should first be applied to the necessitous cases in our own Borough of Reading."" But June, an only child living with her parents, was determined to help Mayor Cusden bring the children to the town and was on the phone to her ""straight away"". ""Phoebe said 'I better speak to your mother', and thus we had Gretel,"" Mrs Whitcombe recounts. Phoebe Cusden was moved to act after reading that many of the children in Germany's worst affected areas were living on as little as 400 calories a day Gretel was one of those children suffering, one of those whose parents struggled to put food on the table every night. ""The headmistress came to the classroom and said 'Gretel can you come to my office please?'"" says Mrs Rieber, now 81. ""There were two other girls there with me, and she said 'you are going today, to England, for three months'. And just like that, I was on my way."" She remembers leaving her suburban home in Dusseldorf, which she remembers as a ""city in ruins"", to a boat and being handed Â£1 by a British official for the journey. ""I was hungry and with that money I went to the bar on the boat and ordered a sandwich,"" says Mrs Rieber. ""When I arrived in Reading I said to Mrs Coleman, my foster mother, 'here is my money - the rest I ate'."" Gretel recalls enjoying her time in Reading with June's family That was an anecdote the family smiled about and recounted for many years after, and broke the ice at a time when the prospect of Germans visiting was an unsettling one for some in the community. Mrs Rieber says, although she was only ever treated with respect from the British people she encountered, she was aware of why there might be an anti-German sentiment. ""I can understand that they didn't want us. We had been their enemies. ""Not myself, not my parents, but Germany had been terrible enemies for Britain. ""But I never had a feeling that I was not welcome."" She adds that the ill-feeling towards Germans was not prompted by just propaganda. ""The majority of Germans were followers of Hitler so in a way it was true,"" she says. ""I knew very early - when I was maybe six or seven - that Hitler was bad."" Teachers at the pair's school urged Gretel (bottom row, second from right) to teach June (top left) and the other children German Mrs Whitcombe remembers the shame Gretel felt when she first arrived, and watching her struggle with violently vivid nightmares. ""When she first came to England she said she wished she wasn't German, but that changed rapidly. I don't think she wanted to talk about home,"" says Mrs Whitcombe. ""I am very proud of my mother and father. They opened their hearts and their home to her at a time when most people wouldn't. ""We didn't have much abuse, but nevertheless not many people were doing it."" Teachers at the pair's school urged Gretel to teach the other pupils German and she quickly integrated into British life. At the family home, June had to get used to having a sibling while Gretel began to accept she would no longer be left to go hungry. June remembers the shame Gretel initially felt when she arrived at her family home Mrs Whitcombe recounts how she once discovered Gretel eating chocolate in the middle of the night, the young German girl feeling the need to be surreptitious - back at home she always feared people taking her food away. They soon became inseparable and June's mother treated them as if they really were sisters. ""I always said if you share a knicker drawer then you are friends for life,"" says Mrs Whitcombe. ""Gretel didn't have any clothes. She had virtually nothing. I mean her dress was a flour sack.  My mother gave up - we just had communal clothing."" The knicker drawer theory proved correct - they continued to visit one another long after Mrs Rieber returned home as conditions in Germany improved. During a conversation recorded for a BBC Radio Berkshire documentary, Mrs Whitcombe tells her old friend: ""I reckon you and I are the oldest twins in Europe."" ""We were just two normal kids going to the same school."" Mrs Rieber says she hopes others will benefit from the Reading and Dusseldorf twinning And Mrs Rieber credits the Reading and Dusseldorf twinning, formalised in 1975, for helping hundreds of children broaden their horizons. She says she hopes others will form the bonds and experience the kind of formative moments she was lucky enough to have because of the relationship. And with the Reading Dusseldorf Association still flourishing, its events calendar as busy as ever, the legacy of Mayor Cusden's project lives on for another generation. But the original generation are still close. As Mrs Rieber says goodbye, the women tentatively arrange a trip away together to Israel.

"The minority Conservative government has survived its first major test after its Queen's Speech cleared the Commons. MPs backed the legislative programme - stripped back after the Tories lost their majority - by 323 to 309. But the government had to make a late pledge on funding abortions in England for women from Northern Ireland, amid fears of a Conservative rebellion. The Democratic Unionist Party's 10 MPs had agreed to support the government as part of a deal with the Tories. Three Labour frontbenchers - shadow ministers Ruth Cadbury, Catherine West and Andy Slaughter - were sacked by the leadership while shadow transport minister Daniel Zeichner had resigned. Corbyn sacks three over single market vote Northern Ireland women to get abortion funding Kuenssberg: Lessons from government climbdown No need to wear a tie, Bercow tells MPs The sackings relate to the MPs' support for Labour MP Chuka Umunna's amendment during the Queen's Speech debate, which was defeated. The amendment aimed to preserve the UK's EU single market membership. This is not Labour policy, and the party's MPs were told to abstain but 50 rebelled. The government averted a possible rebellion by announcing women from Northern Ireland would get free access to abortions on the NHS in England. Abortions are only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her physical or mental health - while they can travel to England to have one privately, they have had to pay for the procedure. Labour MP Stella Creasy had tabled an amendment which had attracted cross-party backing - but she agreed to withdraw it when the government announced its concession. The Conservatives have a working majority of 13 with DUP support Labour's amendment, which was defeated by 323 to 297, called for Brexit to deliver the ""exact same benefits"" as the EU single market and customs union, as well as scrapping tuition fees, increasing public spending and ending the public sector pay cap. Proposing it earlier, shadow chancellor John McDonnell described the Queen's Speech as a ""threadbare scrap of a document"" with many of the Tories' key pledges removed since the general election. He also claimed the cabinet was divided over Brexit, with ""weekly changes of direction"". Chancellor Philip Hammond challenged him to a ""grown-up"" debate about public spending, accusing Labour of asking voters ""would they like someone else to pay higher taxes?"" During the debate, one Tory MP, Heidi Allen, criticised the arrangement between her party and the DUP, saying she could ""barely put into words"" her ""anger"" at the Â£1bn deal. Ms Allen, who also criticised the Tories' general election campaign, said she wanted to put on record her ""distaste for the use of public funds to garner political control"" and warned that ""never again"" should a government prioritise spending in such a way.

"The average household income for food bank users is below Â£320 per month Food banks are an intensely divisive image, an uncomfortable underbelly of austerity often in touching distance of conspicuous wealth. They seem hard to explain - and Theresa May stumbled awkwardly when asked about them during the election campaign, getting no further than saying they were used by people for ""complex reasons"". But what are the reasons? And who are the people depending on food handouts? Are they struggling families in need of help? Or are food banks magnets for scroungers? Are they mostly being used by local people or by migrants? A major study from researchers at Oxford University and King's College London has tried to get beyond the stereotypes, looking at those using the Trussell Trust's network of food banks. In the most basic terms, these are people with many overlapping forms of ""destitution"". They have been missing meals, often for days at a time, going without heating and electricity. One in five had slept rough in recent months. They are at the lowest end of the low-income spectrum, with an average income below Â£320 per month, described as living in ""extreme financial vulnerability"". These are usually people of working age, middle-aged rather than young or old, mostly living in rented accommodation. About five out of six are without a job and depending on benefits. But among those in employment, this is usually unpredictable, insecure work, with an unreliable income. The long stagnation in wages seems to have made it harder to be self-reliant through work - and the research warns of the rising number of jobs that are low-paid and insecure. The best inoculation against needing a food bank seems to be a full-time permanent job. Food bank users are often single adults or lone parents Although there have been reports of people in regular jobs turning to food banks, the research suggests this remains very unusual. But there are some distinct characteristics of food bank users that are different from the general face of poverty. The most typical users are single men, lone mothers with children and single women - between them accounting for about two-thirds of all food bank users. Social isolation, the lack of a friend in need, plays a part, as well as threadbare finances. Ill health is a very common feature. Almost two-thirds of users had a health condition, half of households using food banks included someone with a disability and a third had mental health problems. Debts and a long tail of repayments are often dragging them down. They can be months behind with bills and having to pay back bank loans, credit cards, loan sharks, pawn shops and payday lenders. Food bank users are overwhelmingly UK born and even though 4% have a university degree, they have much lower education levels than the average working-age population. A volunteer packing items for a food bank Put together, it shows people living closest to the edge being the first to be pushed over. Lone adults, saddled with debts, with ill health, high levels of depression and anxiety and few qualifications to get a more secure job. These are people on the margins in many ways. But the researchers show that living on ""chronic low incomes"" and facing ""severe food insecurity"" are not necessarily the tipping points. There is often something else - an income or expenditure ""shock"" - that puts them on the road to the food bank. This can be a rise in rent, energy bills or the cost of food; or it could a delay in benefits or fewer working hours. On wafer-thin margins, it can be enough to literally turn out the lights and leave nothing for food. The research is also a reminder that the prevalence of food banks is a recent phenomenon, a tale of our times. In 2010-11, the Trussell Trust gave out 61,500 food parcels, but by 2016-17 this had risen to almost 1.2 million. Networks of food banks have expanded rapidly in recent years Rachel Loopstra, lead author of the report and lecturer in nutrition at King's College London, said people had been ""surprised and shocked"" at the growth in food banks. But there had not been enough understanding of the circumstances that meant people ended up having to ask for food. Dr Loopstra said the study showed how apparently small changes in income or outgoings could leave people with absolutely nothing, even for the most basic of needs. Over two-thirds of food bank users had often been going without food. ""The severity of food insecurity and other forms of destitution we observed amongst people using food banks are serious public health concerns,"" she said.

"The government's change of heart on funding abortions for Northern Irish women on the NHS in England matters for three reasons. Most of all of course, it will make a material difference to the lives of many women who, for whatever reason, find themselves in the situation of crossing the Irish Sea and having to pay for an abortion that the tighter rules in their home country prevent. Justine Greening, the education secretary and equalities minister, has promised this will end. ""It is our proposal that this will no longer happen,"" she wrote in a letter to all MPs published at lunchtime. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Northern Ireland women to get abortion funding The details will of course be closely monitored, and this is not a change to the situation in Northern Ireland itself, but to provision for women who come here for help. It matters too because it shows how the arithmetic of the Commons has changed. Without an overall majority, the Tories were facing a defeat after an impressive campaign by the Labour backbencher Stella Creasy that had garnered support among plenty of Conservatives who looked like they might rebel and vote with her, rather than with their party bosses. Rather than risk a defeat on a critical day when the Queen's Speech has to pass, Conservative ministers were willing to shift in the end - to make a big concession to avoid being beaten. Queen's Speech votes are seen as a matter of confidence votes in any government. After chucking away her majority, it is vital today that Theresa May avoids any further embarrassment. This government climbdown is the first significant evidence that ministers may be willing to budge rather a lot in the face of backbench, and cross-party, demands. They just do not have the numbers to stand firm on issues where there is sympathy in their own ranks. Third though, there were suggestions the government would be too afraid of upsetting their partners, the Democratic Unionist Party, only days after their agreement was signed. The DUP, as many do in Northern Ireland, take a very conservative view on abortion, and while the Tories had insisted they would have no influence over social issues, this was the first test of whether they would somehow be able to pull strings. In this case however it was the parliamentary numbers that made the difference. It's not clear whether the DUP even tried to exert any pressure. But in any event, the government has changed its mind, avoiding defeat on the issue and - if, as likely, the amendment is withdrawn - also preventing DUP MPs from having to vote for measures that would fund abortion for Northern Irish women. That's a complicated way of saying that since the election, the government is more vulnerable to pressure from all sides.

"Helen Pearson said the apology from Devon and Cornwall Police did not stop her suffering A woman who was stabbed by her stalker has dismissed a police apology as ""meaningless"". Helen Pearson, 34, suffered neck and face wounds when her neighbour Joseph Willis attacked her with scissors in an Exeter graveyard. She had made125 reportsto Devon and Cornwall Police about Willis' stalking before the attack in 2013. The force said its ""investigation and victim care did not meet the high standards we expect"". Ms Pearson said the apology ""didn't do anything"" for her and said she was ""still suffering every day because of what happened to me"". More on this story, and other Devon news The stalker and the woman who refused to give in She had reported 125 stalking incidents to police, including offensive graffiti near her home ""All I can hope is that what happened to me means police officers get more training and deal with victims of stalking better - so that no-one else has to go through what I did,"" she said. Willis wasjailed for life for attempted murder. A court heard that Ms Pearson's flat and car had been targeted by Willis, abusive messages were daubed on the streets around her house and threatening letters were sent to her between 18 January 2009 and 21 October 2013, when she was attacked. The incidents culminated in the graveyard attack in which she was stabbed with scissors Her attacker Joseph Willis was eventually jailed for attempted murder The force said its Professional Standards Department had found cases of misconduct against three officers, one of whom had retired. There was no detail immediately available on what action was taken against the other two officers. Two further officers did not have a case to answer, but were given ""management guidance and advice"". One in five women and one in ten men will be affected by stalking in their lifetime According to the Crime Survey for England and Wales 4.6% of women and 2.7% of men aged 16-59 were victims in 2015/16 alone In the year to June 2016, the police recorded 4,168 stalking offences, an increase of 32% since the previous year (3,166) There were a record 12,986 CPS prosecutions for stalking and harassment in 2014-15, the highest volume ever recorded Of these, 1,103 prosecutions commenced under the new stalking offences New orders planned to give stalking protection Alexis Bowater, former chief executive of Network for Surviving Stalking, said she was ""still, sadly, getting calls from victims saying that police are not taking their complaints seriously"". ""They call it murder in slow motion,"" she said. ""Taking stalking seriously is murder prevention."" Chief Constable Shaun Sawyer had met the Pearson family and ""offered a personal apology to them"", the force said. Deputy Chief Constable Paul Netherton said ""numerous changes"" in the force's stalking investigations had been made since the attack. Officers were given ""appropriate and regular training"" and the force would ""continue to strive to ensure that this type of incident is not repeated"".

"This video can not be played John Bercow: Wearing ties not compulsory Male MPs do not need to wear ties in the House of Commons chamber, Speaker John Bercow has said. In a break with tradition, Mr Bercow said MPs should wear ""businesslike attire"" but that it was not essential for this to include ties. Parliamentary custom is for male MPs to wear jackets and ties in the chamber. Mr Bercow was speaking after Tory backbencher Peter Bone said he had spotted an MP - who was Lib Dem Tom Brake - asking a question tieless. The only MP who wears a T-shirt in Parliament Is this finally the end for the tie? What not to wear in Parliament Mr Bone - who is well known for wearing rather flamboyant ties in the Commons - said he was ""not really one to talk about dress sense"" but asked whether the rules had changed. ""I think the general expectation is that members should dress in businesslike attire,"" Mr Bercow replied. ""So far as the chair is concerned... it seems to me that as long as a member arrives in the House in what might be thought to be businesslike attire, the question of whether that member is wearing a tie is not absolutely front and centre stage."" MPs should not be disrespectful towards their colleagues or the House of Commons, he said, but added: ""Do I think it's essential that a member wears a tie? No."" To laughter from MPs, Mr Bercow clarified that there was ""absolutely no obligation on female members not to wear ties, if they so choose"". Lib Dem Tom Brake was not wearing a tie when he asked a question on Wednesday It didn't take long for the SNP's Angus MacNeil to ditch his tie Parliament's official rule book Erskine May only has a limited set of rules on members' dress; namely that military insignia or uniforms should not be worn in the Commons and that the custom is ""for gentlemen members to wear jackets and ties"". As a parliamentary factsheet notes, the Speaker has ""on a number of occasions, taken exception to informal clothing, including the non-wearing of jackets and ties by men"". Former deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman wore a feminist campaign T-shirt during PMQs in 2014 In 2009, Labour MP Graham Allen was told by the former deputy speaker Sir Alan Haselhurst he was not ""properly attired"" when he tried to ask a question when not wearing a tie. Two years later, Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi apologised after a novelty tie he was wearing started playing a tune while he was making a Commons speech.

"The mother said she ""felt hysterical"" and had to leave the room after opening her son's nappy (stock image) A mother has described the distress of discovering her baby son had been circumcised without her consent. The woman, from Nottingham, said she opened her son's nappy to find him covered in blood - and was so distraught she had to leave the room. She has battled for four years for authorities to take action. Three people have now been arrested, including a 61-year-old man - thought to be a doctor - on suspicion of grievous bodily harm with intent. ""I opened the nappy and I ended up having to leave the room because I felt hysterical,"" said the mother, who did not want to be identified. ""It was just awful really, it wasn't very nice, there was all blood there and stuff."" The boy was circumcised in July 2013 when he was three months old, and apparently staying with his paternal grandparents, who are Muslim. His mother originally contacted social services, then contacted Nottinghamshire Police on 24 November 2014. There was an investigation but the force deemed it not to be a criminal matter, and the case was referred to the General Medical Council. The mother later got help from the anti-circumcision group Men Do Complain and leading human rights lawyer Saimo Chahal QC, who wrote to Nottinghamshire Police. According to the British Medical Association,male circumcision in the UK is generally assumed to be lawful provided there is valid consent,external. Police reopened the investigation after human rights lawyer Saimo Chahal QC wrote to them However, the mother believes it amounts to MGM or ""male genital mutilation"", and should be viewed in the same way as female genital mutilation (FGM). ""It's even illegal to dock dogs' tails. I've come home crying my eyes out thinking a dog has got more rights than my child. ""There's something seriously not right with it all. You can protect a dog, you can protect a girl, but not a boy."" After the letter from Ms Chahal, police reopened the investigation and arrested three suspects, including the 61-year-old man, on 21 June. The other two suspects - 44-year-old man and 47-year-old woman believed to be the boy's paternal grandparents - have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. Male circumcision is the removal of the foreskin - a sensitive fold of skin and other tissue that covers the head of the penis Circumcision was promoted as a way of discouraging masturbation in the past, and was regarded as clean and hygienic Circumcision rates in Europe are low, and it is mostly confined to the Jewish and Muslim communities Three-quarters of American adult men are circumcised - but the number of newborns having the operation is falling as the anti-circumcision movement grows Some argue there is a medical case for circumcision, to reduce the risk of urinary tract infections and penile cancer ""Intactivists"" argue that circumcision has negative health effects and reduces sexual pleasure for both partners Read more: Circumcision, the ultimate parenting dilemma Police said all three suspects had been released pending further investigation. In the years since the circumcision, the mother said her son has suffered from recurring infections, and his penis regularly becomes inflamed and sore. ""It looks like he's been half circumcised is the only way to describe it. There's half the skin, it's not all the way over. ""It swells up, it gets red and a little bit sore in places."" She has been given cream to apply to her son and told he may need further surgery when he is older. Following media coverage about the case, an experienced urologist based in Cambridge has offered to assess the boy and see what can be done to help him. ""When he first started talking he did say a lot that it hurt,"" said the mother. ""Now he doesn't really say much because it draws attention to it and he's getting a bit more private."" The boy's mother said the circumcision has affected her, as well as her son. ""As a new mum I didn't know what I was doing with a baby anyway, but now I had that added worry on my mind,"" she said. ""I was really upset about it. It didn't really get much better from there, it's just been ongoing really."" She said a lot of people have failed to empathise with her and her son. ""Even a couple of police officers have made remarks like 'Oh my husband is circumcised, I think it's better'. Or 'Oh they are tougher than they look, it will toughen him up'. It's just silly little comments like that. It's just heartbreaking. ""I wrote to MPs and they basically shoved me off. Everybody you speak to it's like speaking to a brick wall."" The mother supports a global movement against circumcision, and hopes her son's case will raise awareness The mother said she is relieved that action is finally being taken, and hopes the case will raise awareness. ""I just can't believe that we've actually got to this point now and it's taken four years,"" said the mother. ""Nobody was listening when I spoke about it and now it's being acknowledged worldwide. ""If anything good can come of what's happened to my son it's raising a little bit more awareness to the suffering that comes, and giving people that are thinking of circumcising their children a bit of understanding about what they are doing.""

"A man who died in a terror attack near a north London mosque was alive when he was hit by a van, an inquest has heard. Makram Ali, 51, from Haringey, was hit by the vehicle after leaving a prayer meeting at Muslim Welfare House in Finsbury Park on 19 June. An inquest at St Pancras Coroner's Court heard that he is believed to have had a ""medical episode"" shortly before. Darren Osborne, 47, from Cardiff, has appeared in court charged with murder and attempted murder. He appeared at the Old Bailey on Tuesday charged with killing Mr Ali and the attempted murder of others at the scene. Nine other people were injured as a result of the attack. Detective Inspector Edwin Hall of the Metropolitan Police told the court that the incident was being treated as a terrorist-related murder. A post-mortem examination found Mr Ali's death was caused by multiple injuries. According to his family, Mr Ali had suffered some form of collapse due to a weak leg and was ""sitting up and expressing a wish to return home"" when the attack happened. His relatives have previously described himas a ""quiet, gentle man"" who ""spent his whole life without any enemies"" and who regularly attended the local mosque. Mr Ali came to the UK from Bangladesh aged 10 and was married with four daughters, two sons and two grandchildren. The inquest was opened and adjourned by senior coroner for Inner North London Mary Hassell, until any criminal proceedings have finished.

"This video can not be played Sarah Ewart: 'Why can't we have abortions in NI?' Women from Northern Ireland will be able to get free abortions in England, the government has said. More than 50 MPs from the major parties had backed a Labour-led call for the women to have access to NHS abortions in England. They currently have to pay. The BBC's political editor said ministers made the concession because it appeared some Tory MPs might back the call, risking a possible defeat. Northern Ireland's abortion laws are much stricter than the rest of the UK. Abortions are only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her physical or mental health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which they can be performed legally. Women seeking an abortion can travel to England to have one privately, but had not been allowed to have them free on the NHS - a position that was backed by the UK Supreme Court earlier this month. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Abortion law 'matter for NI assembly' Supreme Court rules against Northern Ireland woman Queen's Speech clears Commons An amendment on the issue, co-ordinated by Labour's Stella Creasy, which had cross-party backing, had been selected for inclusion in the Queen's Speech debate - which meant Theresa May's government ran the risk of possible defeat. Since the election Mrs May no longer has a majority of MPs so has to rely on backing from the 10 DUP MPs - but even then she remains vulnerable to a rebellion from her own Conservative MPs. The news of the change of policy was welcomed by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service which described it as a ""landmark moment: for years the women of Northern Ireland, despite being UK citizens and taxpayers, have not been entitled to NHS-funded treatment"". Labour's Stella Creasy had gathered support for her amendment Without an overall majority, the Tories were facing a defeat after an impressive campaign by the Labour backbencher Stella Creasy that had garnered support among plenty of Conservatives who looked like they might rebel and vote with her, rather than with their party bosses. Rather than risk a defeat on a critical day when the Queen's Speech has to pass, Conservative ministers were willing to shift in the end - to make a big concession to avoid being beaten. Queen's Speech votes are seen as a matter of confidence votes in any government. After chucking away her majority, it is vital today that Theresa May avoids any further embarrassment. Read more from Laura Abortion provider Marie Stopes UK said it was ""a hugely positive step forward, but there is no reason why these services shouldn't be provided in Northern Ireland, saving thousands of women each year the cost and stress of travelling to the mainland"". But anti-abortion charity Life said the government should be ""neutral on the issue of abortion"". ""This action by the Department for Women and Equalities not only undermines that neutrality, but also shows an abject disdain for Parliament, by seeking to bring this change in via the back door, avoiding full debate on this issue."" In a debate on the Queen's Speech on Thursday, Ms Creasy said women were having to spend Â£1,400 to get an abortion in England. Conservative Sir Peter Bottomley asked why, in the case of women from Northern Ireland, ""only the poor should be denied lawful abortions"". Chancellor Philip Hammond replied that Justine Greening, the minister for women and equalities, ""intends to intervene to fund abortions in England for women arriving here from Northern Ireland"". He later said: ""We will be funding [the Government Equalities Office] with additional funding so that she can make a grant to the external organisations that provide these services"". Analysis: James Gallagher, health and science reporter, BBC News Secrecy and stigma surround women from Northern Ireland deciding to have an abortion. They will, effectively, be left with two choices - ordering abortion pills online or travelling across the Irish Sea, often to Liverpool. Online pills are illegal and taken without medical supervision. Going to England comes with the expense of the journey, accommodation, time off work and the procedure itself. About 700 women came to England, from Northern Ireland, for an abortion last year. The cost is thought to stop some women from the poorest Northern Ireland families having an abortion in England. So, the announcement that the procedure, but not the other costs, will be free in England could influence some of those difficult, personal decisions. But this does not change the culture or visceral debate around abortion in Northern Ireland. The courts have ruled any decision on abortion law lies with the Northern Ireland Assembly, so any change in the law is deeply unlikely. Campaigner Sarah Ewart, who travelled to England for a termination in 2013 after doctors said her unborn child had no chance of survival outside the womb, said of the chancellor's announcement that it was positive news, but it was unfortunate that women from Northern Ireland found themselves in this position in the first place. The prime minister's official spokeswoman said later the government had estimated the cost of the decision to be ""around Â£1m a year"" and that the government was ""prepared to fund in excess of this"" if needed. The estimate was based on the 724 women who travelled from Northern Ireland last year to have an abortion. She added that ministers had ""had concerns about the issue and that's why we're taking action"". This video can not be played Northern Ireland's abortion debate: For and against Following the concession from the government, Stella Creasy's amendment was withdrawn. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Jo Swinson congratulated the Labour MP and said: ""I'm glad that Justine Greening has acted on this issue, but it is embarrassing that the health secretary had done nothing on this so far and only the threat of a defeat prompted change. ""Women deserve better than having their rights reliant on House of Commons arithmetic."" The concession on abortion came on the same day Belfast's Court of Appeal ruled abortion law in Northern Ireland should be left to the Stormont Assembly, not judges - effectively overturning an earlier ruling that the current abortion laws were incompatible with human rights laws.

"Could robots harm humans? The science-fiction writer Isaac Asimov wrote about controlling intelligent machines with the three laws of robotics: A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm A robot must obey orders given to it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law As so often is the case, science fiction has become science fact. Areport published by the Royal Society and the British Academy,externalsuggests that there should not be three but just one overarching principle to govern the intelligent machines that we will soon be living alongside: ""Humans should flourish."" According to Prof Dame Ottoline Leyser, who co-chairs the Royal Society's science policy advisory group, human flourishing should be the key to how intelligent systems governed. Isaac Asimov laid out some laws for robots ""This was the term that really encapsulated what we wanted to say,"" she told BBC News. ""The thriving of people and communities needs to be put first, and we think Asimov's principles can be subsumed into that."" The report calls for a new body to ensure intelligent machines serve people rather than control them. It says that a system of democratic supervision is essential to regulate the development of self-learning systems. Without it they have the potential to cause great harm, the report says. It is not warning of machines enslaving humanity, at least not yet. But when systems that learn and make decisions independently are used in the home and across a range of commercial and public services, there is scope for plenty of bad things to happen. In Asimov's Caves Of Steel, humans lived closely alongside robots The report calls for safeguards to prioritise the interests of humans over machines. The development of such systems cannot by governed solely by technical standards. They also have to be imbued with ethical and democratic values, according to Antony Walker, who is deputy chief executive of the lobby group TechUK and another of the report's authors. ""There are many benefits that will come out of these technologies, but the public has to have the trust and confidence that these systems are being thought through and governed properly,"" he said. The report calls for a completely new approach. It suggests a ""stewardship body"" of experts and interested parties should build an ethical framework for the development of artificial intelligence technologies. It recommends four high-level principles to promote human flourishing: Protect individual and collective rights and interests Ensure transparency, accountability and inclusivity Seek out good practices and learn from success and failure Enhance existing democratic governance And the need for a new way to govern machines is urgent. The age of Asimov is already here. The development of autonomous vehicles, for example, raises questions about how human safety should be prioritised. What happens in a situation where the machine has to choose between the safety of those in the vehicle and pedestrians? There is also the issue of determining liability if there is an accident. Was it the fault of the vehicle owner or the machine? Another example is the emergence of intelligent systems for personalised tuition. These identify a student's strengths and weaknesses and teach accordingly. Several companies are testing driverless cars Should such a self-learning system be able to teach without proper guidelines? How do we make sure that we are comfortable with the way in which the machine is directing the child, just as we are concerned about the way in which a tutor teaches a child? These issues are not for the technology companies that develop the systems to resolve, they are for all of us. It is for this reason that the report argues that details of intelligent systems cannot be kept secret for commercial reasons. They have to be publicly available so that if something starts to goes wrong it can be spotted and put right. Current regulations focus on personal data. But they have nothing to say about the data we give away on a daily basis, through tracking of our mobile phones, our purchasing preferences, electricity smart meters and online ""likes"". There are systems that can piece together this public data and build up a personality profile that could potentially be used by insurance companies to set premiums, or by employers to assess suitability for certain jobs. Such systems can offer huge benefits, but if unchecked we could find our life chances determined by machines. The key, according to Prof Leyser, is that regulation has to be on a case-by-case basis. ""An algorithm to predict what books you should be recommended on Amazon is a very different thing from using an algorithm to diagnose your disease in a medical situation,"" she told the BBC. ""So, it is not sensible to regulate algorithms as a whole without taking into account what it is being used for."" The Conservative Party promised a digital charter in its manifesto, and the creation of a data use and ethics commission. While most of the rhetoric by ministers has been about stopping the internet from being used to incite terrorism and violence, some believe that the charter and commission might also adopt some of the ideas put forward in the data governance report. The UK's Minister for Digital, Matt Hancock, told the BBC that it was ""critical"" to get the rules right on how we used data as a society. ""Data governance, and the effective and ethical use of data, are vital for the future of our economy and society,"" he said. ""We are committed to continuing to work closely with industry to get this right."" Fundamentally, intelligent systems will take off only if people trust them and how they are regulated. Without that, the enormous potential these systems have for human flourishing will never be fully realised.

"Whether you enjoyed curling up with Tetris on a Gameboy, rolling around as Sonic on a Sega, or were just trying to ignore the loud beeping sounds coming from the next room... if you were around in the 1980s and 1990s, you will remember the arrival of home gaming. Computers had made it into our living rooms, and although fans had their favourites - the thrust of Street Fighter, the platforms of Super Mario or the simplicity of Pacman - children and adults alike were hooked. The market for consoles has continued to grow over the decades as technology companies across the globe try to get their bite out of the gaming pie. But almost 20 years into the new millennium, passionate players are still looking back in time to find their fix. Mario caps Nintendo's triumphant comeback Hopes of a games arcade revival ""While there's definitely an element of nostalgia, it's important to recognise how well designed many of those classic games are,"" said technology journalist and retro game collector KG Orphanides. ""The developers had so little space to work with - your average Sega Mega Drive or SNES cartridge had a maximum capacity of just 4MB - and limited graphics and sound capabilities."" The average game now weighs in at 40GB. But these limitations did not stop them from making some memorable games. Gemma Wood, from Basingstoke, has never put her Nintendo GameCube in the loft - despite having it for more than 15 years. ""I love it, in fact I was playing Mario Sunshine and Mario Kart Double Dash yesterday,"" she said. ""I really could not get on with the controls on the Wii [a more recent Nintendo console] and, with retro consoles, most of the games are cheap because they are second hand. ""Newer consoles and their games are incredibly expensive. I understand that a lot of hard work has gone into the design etc, but how can anyone justify Â£50 to Â£60 for a game that you might not even enjoy?"" Many fans still have their original games to play For others, it is a chance to show their children the computer games they grew up with. Howard Gardner, from south London, has revived his love of the Amstrad CPC and cannot wait to see the faces of his sons and daughter. ""Five years ago, when clearing out my uncle's house, I found another CPC, restored it to working order and re-acquired some of my old favourite games from eBay - and a laughably outdated 3D modelling package,"" he said. ""I don't get a whole lot of time to use it, but I plan to show the children the games I used to play and film a reaction video!"" Whatever your reason for picking up an old joypad, you are not alone, and it is not just an activity to take part in on your own or with the family at home. There is now a huge community of retro gamers across the country who love to share their passion. The National Videogame Arcade, which opened in Nottingham in 2015,is a centre of all things gaming. It welcomes thousands of visitors every year and runs huge events to make the point that gaming is for everyone. Young and old gamers enjoy playing Nintendo at the NVA ""It's one of the things we talk about a lot at the NVA,"" said its director Iain Simons. ""You don't know where you are unless you know where you've been. It's important that just because technology has moved forward, it doesn't necessarily mean that new games are better than old ones."" But he warned new gamers not to be complacent. ""One of the things we do notice is that a lot of home computer games from the 80s were much harder than the games that kids are playing these days,"" said Iain. ""Kids on school trips get very upset to discover that they can't even beat level one of Donkey Kong!"" The retro aspect has even spread to the way people buy their games. Kevin Cornwall manages retro games shop Playnation Games in Croydon and says the physical store adds to the feel. ""It is what people want,"" he said. ""It is that feeling of nostalgia, being able to look through the games, see and feel the boxes. ""Modern gaming has had its pitfalls so now people are looking to the past to relive some real gaming memories."" If you want to try before you buy, there has also been a resurgence in arcades or gaming cafes. These were something more common in the US or Japan when the games took off, but now the UK is getting in on the action. Konbo Arcade Cafe offers gaming with your coffee and croissants Konbo Arcade Cafe in Edinburgh offers classic arcade machines and believes a good game never goes out of style. Owner Michael Cox said: ""Konbo is influenced by the Japanese arcade scene and, over there, old games weren't removed and brought back in response to a trend - they never went away. ""They were simply accepted as good games - no level of gimmickry or nostalgia involved, no more than we would treat a 20-year-old film or piece of music as a novelty. ""A good game doesn't stop being a good game, and there's no reason a new generation of people can't rediscover and enjoy it all over again."" One of the household names of the gaming revolution, Nintendo, has always been a big draw - so much so, it has revived some of its older consoles in brand new casings, offering a collection of games in one handy machine. Last year's NES Classic was the must-have Christmas gift, but left fans disappointed when demand outstripped supply and the device was discontinued in April. Now, the company isbringing its SNES backin the same format and promising not to make the same error. Atari has also announced it will be bringing out a new console - 40 years after its original Video Computer System. CEO Fred Chesnais told GamesBeat: ""We're back in the hardware business."" Atari is making a comeback after 40 years ""Those games are very approachable,"" added KG. ""You can sit down and play for 10 or 20 minutes and feel that you've had a genuinely rewarding experience."" Retro gaming fans have welcomed the new devices - though it will not stop them collecting the original machines and cartridges. Take Andy Aldred, who has 19 consoles, alongside his PC, eight hand-held devices and over 1,000 games in a dedicated room. ""They are a really decent way of getting a nice collection of classic games for a reasonable price,"" he said. ""Buying the original hardware and all those games would cost a small fortune."" He still takes advantage of the newer technology on offer, but there is something special about the older genre. ""For a lot of people there is an element of nostalgia and being able to own all the games they wanted to play growing up,"" he said. You may reminisce about these games in a fun way - the fighting with your siblings over the next turn or the shouts of ""hadouken"" as you battled. You may recall a general feeling of confusion from the whole hubbub and noisy soundtrack. Or you may be dedicated to your modern Xbox, PlayStations and Switches. But in 2017, there is no denying the old school technology is well and truly back, and far from Game Over.

"Malicious pranksters have made up fake stories about Grenfell Tower and terror attacks in London and Manchester. Why? Stories of fake victims routinely crop up online in the wake of attacks and disasters, but they're spreading further and faster because of social media. The motivations of the hoaxers vary from financial gain to pure pranking to bizarre political point-scoring. It would have been a miracle - if the story was true. Over the weekend, rumours began to circulate on Twitter that a baby had been rescued from Grenfell Tower, nearly two weeks after the inferno that killed at least 80 people. The story was a hoax; the baby was just the latest made-up person affected by a disaster or terror attack. It started on a clickbait-heavy fake news site which uses the name of a real media outlet (""Metro""). The story also swiped the BBC's breaking news graphic to create an alert that appears real enough - if you don't look too closely. But ""the miracle baby"",debunked by many mainstream news outlets,external, is actually somewhat unusual in the recent annals of fake victim invention. BBC Trending noticed a spate of fake victim pictures on Twitter in the wake of this year's terror attacks in Manchester and London - some were posted online within minutes of the attack. The fakes take the form of a tweet, urging members of the public to look out for someone, with an attached picture usually taken from some other website or social media account. As posts are often deleted by the original posters or taken down by moderators, it's hard to quantify exactly how many fakes emerged, but some get retweeted hundreds or thousands of times. ""The primary reason that people do this kind of thing is that the behaviours work,"" says Whitney Phillips, author of a study on trolling, This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things. ""Journalists immediately descend on these kind of stories often to decry the stories, but what ends up happening is that in these same stories which are attacking these trolling behaviours is the journalists are reposting many of these same photos. ""People do it because they want a reaction and they know they're going to get it,"" Phillips told BBC Trending radio. Stream or downloadon BBC Trending radio In the wake of the Manchester suicide bomb attack, photos of the missing and dead began circulating online, but one picture that ended up in some news reports was a fake - it was an image taken from the Instagram account of a 13-year-old girl from Melbourne, Australia. ""It was on the news here in Australia, it was all over the place,"" says the girl's mother, Rachel Devine. Rachel Devine says the photo had been posted by her daughter Gemma about a year ago, ""Gemma's first reaction was 'Why are they worried about me, can't we be worried about the actual victims?' ""I don't understand what that person behind that Twitter account had to gain because it didn't do any damage to us, it didn't affect Gemma it only took away the spotlight from the people who actually needed to be found, or to be helped,"" Rachel says. Tamara de Anda's photo is posted online in the wake of attacks, along with false messages claiming that she is among the victims In some cases, however, the motivations are clearer. Tamara De Anda is a Mexican journalist who was in the news after a taxi driver was fined for catcalling her in the street. Since then she's been on the receiving end of death and rape threats, and in the most recent form of online bullying, her picture is posted online in the wake of attacks and disasters along with claims that she is a ""victim"". ""Every time there is an attack I am sure there will be a few pictures of me around,"" she says. ""The last time it happened I knew that a picture was being shared before I knew about the attack."" ""I think there's a few people controlling a lot of accounts,"" she says. ""Their attacks are coordinated and sometimes they make sense and you might get a feeling about how they're connected to the political situation in Mexico. Sometimes it's just hate."" Visit BBC Trending onFacebook,external BBC Trending contacted a number of the people who were spreading the false rumours. Several admitted they were in it for the laughs. One was a self-described ""fascist"" who said they were a teenager living in the United States. He mocked people who retweeted his hoax, in which he created a fake London Bridge victim. ""That tweet was a public service â¦ I made these 'people' [who retweeted the picture] feel good about themselves didn't I? â¦ If anything I should be lauded,"" he said via Twitter. Whitney Phillips, the expert in trolling, says that despite the varying motives, the pranksters tend to have a pattern when picking out their fake ""victims"". ""Around the globe, far-right actors have made great efforts to engage in media manipulation... and one of the ways that's done is to go after the most vulnerable populations or historically underrepresented populations, populations that they see as occupying a 'politically correct' or 'social justice warrior' ambit,"" she says. ""Overall the effort is to manipulate and to harm those who are vulnerable or perceived to be vulnerable,"" she says. ""And so that's the underlying thread even if the actual individuals participating are different and have different motivations.""

"This video can not be played Immigration activist Steven Choi: 'An unjust and discriminatory Muslim ban' The White House has set new criteria for visa applicants from six mainly Muslim countries and all refugees, requiring them to have a ""close"" family or business tie to the US. The rules, affecting people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen, are coming into force on Thursday. They were issued after the Supreme Court partially restored President Donald Trump's travel ban on Monday. The executive order had been blocked by lower courts since February. The revised rules - taking conditions laid out in the Supreme Court ruling - come into effect at 20:00 Washington time (00:00 GMT). According to the new rules, confirmed to the BBC, for the next 90 days those from the six countries without a close relationship will not be able to enter the US. Those considered to have a close relationship under the policy include a parent, spouse, child, son or daughter-in-law, or sibling, including step- or half-siblings. Excluded are grandparents, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews, in-laws, extended family and grandchildren. Trump travel ban: What happens next? US holds off expanding laptop ban The original ban in January provoked protests at US airports Also exempt from the new rules are those with business or educational ties to the US. However, the guidelines specifically state that the relationship must be formal, documented and not formed for the purpose of evading the order. Those who already hold valid visas are not affected. Dual nationals who travel on their passport from the unaffected country will also be allowed entry. Why did a US veteran give his medal to a stranger? Is Trump's bleak vision of America justified? The Canadian town feeling refugee burden The Supreme Courtsaid in Monday's decision,externalthat it would make a final ruling on the executive order in October. But in the meantime, it added, the order ""may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States"". President Donald Trump says the ban is a victory for national security The court also approved the 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States, allowing the government to bar entry to refugee claimants who do not have any ""bona fide relationship"" with an American individual or entity. President Trump called the court's decision a ""victory for our national security. He said the order was needed to stop terrorists entering the US, but critics said it was a ban on Muslims. Lawyers on both sides of the argument have warned that the new restrictions could open the door to a flood of legal challenges. In particular, the exact meaning of the phrase ""bona fide"" was expected to come under scrutiny. Only those with a ""bona fide"" link to the US will be allowed a visa Meanwhile, a number of activist groups have promised to help people caught up in the ban. The New York Immigration Coalition says it plans to be at the city's John F Kennedy International Airport to ""monitor the effects of Trump's revised Muslim and refugee ban"". But so far, the order does not appear to have had too big an impact on travellers. A spokesman form Emirates, the Middle East's largest airline, said on Thursday: ""Our flights to the US are operating as per normal. All passengers must possess the appropriate travel documents, including a valid US entry visa, in order to travel."" Muslims on Trump ban: I don't belong here.

"This video can not be played Sir Martin expressed his ""greatest sympathy"" with the tower's residents The retired judge heading the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire says he is ""doubtful"" the process will be as wide-ranging as some residents hope. Sir Martin Moore-Bick said the probe could be limited to the cause, how it spread, and preventing a future blaze. He was speaking after travelling to the site of the fire in North Kensington and meeting some of the survivors. Meanwhile, Kensington and Chelsea Council halted a cabinet meeting, saying it may ""prejudice"" the inquiry. The authority planned to have the meeting on Thursday evening in private, without members of the public or press present, citing fears of ""disruption"" after angry residents attempted to enter the council's offices two days after the Grenfell fire. But after a legal intervention by several media organisations, the High Court ruled it had to be opened to the press. While the media have a legal right to attend public meetings of local councils, Kensington and Chelsea's leader Nicholas Paget-Brown said: ""We can't have an unprejudiced discussion in this room with the public inquiry that is about to take place, if journalists are recording and writing our comments."" Kensington council meeting adjourned Sir Martin said the fire was an ""enormous tragedy and I can honestly say I have never seen anything like that building which is now completely gutted"". The judge added: ""I'm well aware the residents and the local people want a much broader investigation and I can fully understand why they would want that. ""Whether my inquiry is the right way in which to achieve that I'm more doubtful and I will give that some thought and in due course make a recommendation."" He added: ""But there may be other ways in which the desire for that investigation could be satisfied otherwise through the work that I'm going to do."" Residents previously told how theyraised fire safety concernsfor several years before the fire. The Metropolitan Police has said it will investigate""all criminal offences that may have been committed"". The force says80 people are now presumed deadafter the fire but the final toll may not be known until at least the end of the year. Why don't we know how many died? Disabled mum 'had no chance' Adele pays tribute to Grenfell victims Guide to what happened Why people invent fake victims Prime Minister Theresa May told MPs she expects Sir Martin will want to produce an interim report ""as early as possible"" to address the immediate lessons from the fire. Sir Martin, a retired Court of Appeal judge, said an interim report could be produced within a year. But he said the inquiry ""could be very challenging"". He said: ""I think it's impossible to say how long it's going to take; I have said on other occasions a matter of months, some people have talked about two or three months. I don't think that's realistic... ""I would hope to be able to answer the basic factual questions such as how did the fire start, how did it spread, how was it able to engulf the building in such speed and also questions such as what internal precautions there were, what steps were available for alerting residents and allowing them to escape."" Sir Martin saw the floral tributes left near the scene of the fire Speaking after the meeting with Sir Martin, Joe Delaney, from the Grenfell Action Group, said he ""seems a genuine guy"" but ""seems to want to keep the scope very narrow... while we are more looking at why was it started in the first place, why were residents ignored?"" Mr Delaney had earlier expressed concerns that a judge with a background in commercial law would be dealing with what he said was a ""criminal matter"". Olesea Matcovschi, chairwoman of the Lancaster West Residents Association, said: ""We told him what we expected for the public inquiry, so we will see how it goes, it is too early to say if the public inquiry satisfies our concerns."" Questions were raised in the aftermath of the disaster about the cladding used on Grenfell and other buildings. Cladding from 137 high rise buildings in 41 local authority areas of England has now failed fire safety tests. Where have cladding fire tests failed? 'Stop testing cladding,' says housing boss Police saida 52-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of fraudulently claiming financial supportby saying he had lost family members in the fire. This video can not be played Sir Martin has ""to act quickly"" to produce an interim report in to the Tower block fire says Lord Falconer Born in Wales and educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, his career has spanned nearly five decades after being called to the Bar in 1969. As a lawyer, he specialised in commercial law which involved dealing with disputes relating to maritime and land transport of goods. Sir Martin went on to spend more than 20 years as a judge of the Commercial Court and Court of Appeal until his retirement in 2016. Leading barrister Michael Mansfield QC, who has met survivors of the fire, said it was ""unbelievable that lessons are not learned"" from theIndependent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, which is now on its fourth chairman. He said that inquiry ""did not consult with the families and the survivors"" and ""the same thing seems to have happened all over again"". Grenfell residents have already pointed to a case in November 2014, in which Sir Martin ruled Westminster City Council could rehouse a single mother-of-five more than 50 miles away in Bletchley, near Milton Keynes. The decision was overturned by the Supreme Court in April 2015 - but addressing residents' concerns over the ruling, Sir Martin said he was surprised at the focus on one of many cases he had heard. He added: ""One simply reaches the conclusion that you think is right, applying the law as you see it, and that is the work of a judge."" He said the incident was of a type he was ""very familiar with as a judge"", having dealt with disasters on sea and land. Some of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Eighteen people have been formally identified by the coroner, but not all names have been released. The opening of inquests intoseven of the victims heard six-month-old Leena Belkadi was found deadin her mother's arms. Most of those who died in the fire were said to be in 23 of the North Kensington tower block's 129 flats.

"This video can not be played Sarah Ewart: 'Why can't we have abortions in NI?' Women from Northern Ireland will be able to get free abortions in England, the government has said. More than 50 MPs from the major parties had backed a Labour-led call for the women to have access to NHS abortions in England. They currently have to pay. The BBC's political editor said ministers made the concession because it appeared some Tory MPs might back the call, risking a possible defeat. Northern Ireland's abortion laws are much stricter than the rest of the UK. Abortions are only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her physical or mental health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which they can be performed legally. Women seeking an abortion can travel to England to have one privately, but had not been allowed to have them free on the NHS - a position that was backed by the UK Supreme Court earlier this month. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Abortion law 'matter for NI assembly' Supreme Court rules against Northern Ireland woman Queen's Speech clears Commons An amendment on the issue, co-ordinated by Labour's Stella Creasy, which had cross-party backing, had been selected for inclusion in the Queen's Speech debate - which meant Theresa May's government ran the risk of possible defeat. Since the election Mrs May no longer has a majority of MPs so has to rely on backing from the 10 DUP MPs - but even then she remains vulnerable to a rebellion from her own Conservative MPs. The news of the change of policy was welcomed by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service which described it as a ""landmark moment: for years the women of Northern Ireland, despite being UK citizens and taxpayers, have not been entitled to NHS-funded treatment"". Labour's Stella Creasy had gathered support for her amendment Without an overall majority, the Tories were facing a defeat after an impressive campaign by the Labour backbencher Stella Creasy that had garnered support among plenty of Conservatives who looked like they might rebel and vote with her, rather than with their party bosses. Rather than risk a defeat on a critical day when the Queen's Speech has to pass, Conservative ministers were willing to shift in the end - to make a big concession to avoid being beaten. Queen's Speech votes are seen as a matter of confidence votes in any government. After chucking away her majority, it is vital today that Theresa May avoids any further embarrassment. Read more from Laura Abortion provider Marie Stopes UK said it was ""a hugely positive step forward, but there is no reason why these services shouldn't be provided in Northern Ireland, saving thousands of women each year the cost and stress of travelling to the mainland"". But anti-abortion charity Life said the government should be ""neutral on the issue of abortion"". ""This action by the Department for Women and Equalities not only undermines that neutrality, but also shows an abject disdain for Parliament, by seeking to bring this change in via the back door, avoiding full debate on this issue."" In a debate on the Queen's Speech on Thursday, Ms Creasy said women were having to spend Â£1,400 to get an abortion in England. Conservative Sir Peter Bottomley asked why, in the case of women from Northern Ireland, ""only the poor should be denied lawful abortions"". Chancellor Philip Hammond replied that Justine Greening, the minister for women and equalities, ""intends to intervene to fund abortions in England for women arriving here from Northern Ireland"". He later said: ""We will be funding [the Government Equalities Office] with additional funding so that she can make a grant to the external organisations that provide these services"". Analysis: James Gallagher, health and science reporter, BBC News Secrecy and stigma surround women from Northern Ireland deciding to have an abortion. They will, effectively, be left with two choices - ordering abortion pills online or travelling across the Irish Sea, often to Liverpool. Online pills are illegal and taken without medical supervision. Going to England comes with the expense of the journey, accommodation, time off work and the procedure itself. About 700 women came to England, from Northern Ireland, for an abortion last year. The cost is thought to stop some women from the poorest Northern Ireland families having an abortion in England. So, the announcement that the procedure, but not the other costs, will be free in England could influence some of those difficult, personal decisions. But this does not change the culture or visceral debate around abortion in Northern Ireland. The courts have ruled any decision on abortion law lies with the Northern Ireland Assembly, so any change in the law is deeply unlikely. Campaigner Sarah Ewart, who travelled to England for a termination in 2013 after doctors said her unborn child had no chance of survival outside the womb, said of the chancellor's announcement that it was positive news, but it was unfortunate that women from Northern Ireland found themselves in this position in the first place. The prime minister's official spokeswoman said later the government had estimated the cost of the decision to be ""around Â£1m a year"" and that the government was ""prepared to fund in excess of this"" if needed. The estimate was based on the 724 women who travelled from Northern Ireland last year to have an abortion.

"Villagers want to convert the chapel into a community centre The ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, has helped a small Cornish village buy its Methodist chapel.

The village shares a name with the world famous Godolphin stables, founded by the sheikh,Cornwall Live reports,external. Richard Mckie from the Godolphin Cross Community Association said: ""We are extremely appreciative.""

"This video can not be played Sarah Ewart: 'Why can't we have abortions in NI?' Women from Northern Ireland will be able to get free abortions in England, the government has said. More than 50 MPs from the major parties had backed a Labour-led call for the women to have access to NHS abortions in England. They currently have to pay. The BBC's political editor said ministers made the concession because it appeared some Tory MPs might back the call, risking a possible defeat. Northern Ireland's abortion laws are much stricter than the rest of the UK. Abortions are only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her physical or mental health. Rape, incest and fatal foetal abnormalities are not circumstances in which they can be performed legally. Women seeking an abortion can travel to England to have one privately, but had not been allowed to have them free on the NHS - a position that was backed by the UK Supreme Court earlier this month. Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Abortion law 'matter for NI assembly' Supreme Court rules against Northern Ireland woman Queen's Speech clears Commons An amendment on the issue, co-ordinated by Labour's Stella Creasy, which had cross-party backing, had been selected for inclusion in the Queen's Speech debate - which meant Theresa May's government ran the risk of possible defeat. Since the election Mrs May no longer has a majority of MPs so has to rely on backing from the 10 DUP MPs - but even then she remains vulnerable to a rebellion from her own Conservative MPs. The news of the change of policy was welcomed by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service which described it as a ""landmark moment: for years the women of Northern Ireland, despite being UK citizens and taxpayers, have not been entitled to NHS-funded treatment"". Labour's Stella Creasy had gathered support for her amendment Without an overall majority, the Tories were facing a defeat after an impressive campaign by the Labour backbencher Stella Creasy that had garnered support among plenty of Conservatives who looked like they might rebel and vote with her, rather than with their party bosses. Rather than risk a defeat on a critical day when the Queen's Speech has to pass, Conservative ministers were willing to shift in the end - to make a big concession to avoid being beaten. Queen's Speech votes are seen as a matter of confidence votes in any government. After chucking away her majority, it is vital today that Theresa May avoids any further embarrassment. Read more from Laura Abortion provider Marie Stopes UK said it was ""a hugely positive step forward, but there is no reason why these services shouldn't be provided in Northern Ireland, saving thousands of women each year the cost and stress of travelling to the mainland"". But anti-abortion charity Life said the government should be ""neutral on the issue of abortion"". ""This action by the Department for Women and Equalities not only undermines that neutrality, but also shows an abject disdain for Parliament, by seeking to bring this change in via the back door, avoiding full debate on this issue."" In a debate on the Queen's Speech on Thursday, Ms Creasy said women were having to spend Â£1,400 to get an abortion in England. Conservative Sir Peter Bottomley asked why, in the case of women from Northern Ireland, ""only the poor should be denied lawful abortions"". Chancellor Philip Hammond replied that Justine Greening, the minister for women and equalities, ""intends to intervene to fund abortions in England for women arriving here from Northern Ireland"". He later said: ""We will be funding [the Government Equalities Office] with additional funding so that she can make a grant to the external organisations that provide these services"". Analysis: James Gallagher, health and science reporter, BBC News Secrecy and stigma surround women from Northern Ireland deciding to have an abortion. They will, effectively, be left with two choices - ordering abortion pills online or travelling across the Irish Sea, often to Liverpool. Online pills are illegal and taken without medical supervision. Going to England comes with the expense of the journey, accommodation, time off work and the procedure itself. About 700 women came to England, from Northern Ireland, for an abortion last year. The cost is thought to stop some women from the poorest Northern Ireland families having an abortion in England. So, the announcement that the procedure, but not the other costs, will be free in England could influence some of those difficult, personal decisions. But this does not change the culture or visceral debate around abortion in Northern Ireland. The courts have ruled any decision on abortion law lies with the Northern Ireland Assembly, so any change in the law is deeply unlikely. Campaigner Sarah Ewart, who travelled to England for a termination in 2013 after doctors said her unborn child had no chance of survival outside the womb, said of the chancellor's announcement that it was positive news, but it was unfortunate that women from Northern Ireland found themselves in this position in the first place. The prime minister's official spokeswoman said later the government had estimated the cost of the decision to be ""around Â£1m a year"" and that the government was ""prepared to fund in excess of this"" if needed. The estimate was based on the 724 women who travelled from Northern Ireland last year to have an abortion. She added that ministers had ""had concerns about the issue and that's why we're taking action"".

"Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox already owns 39% of Sky The culture secretary has said she is ""minded to"" refer Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox takeover of Sky to the competition watchdog. Karen Bradley's decision is a blow to the media mogul's hopes of having the Â£11.7bn deal waved through without further scrutiny. Mr Murdoch already owns 39% of the satellite broadcaster. An earlier attempt to take over Sky was abandoned in the wake of the phone hacking scandal. Ms Bradley told the Commons that Ofcom's report into the deal found it risked the Murdoch family having ""increased influence"" over the UK's news agenda and the political process. ""On the basis of Ofcom's assessment, I confirm that I am minded to refer to a phase two investigation on the grounds of media plurality,"" she said. Amol Rajan: Are the Murdochs too powerful? The parties involved can make representations to the culture secretary until Friday 14 July, when she will make a further decision about referring the deal to the Competition and Markets Authority. Ofcom said it had no concerns about Fox's genuine commitment to broadcasting standards, which Ms Bradley said was a second test for approving the deal. As a result she told MPs she was ""minded not to refer"" the bid for a phase two investigation in relation to those concerns. Karen Bradley said her decisions 'can only be influenced by facts' ""While there are strong feelings among both supporters and opponents of this merger, in this quasi-judicial process, my decisions can only be influenced by facts, not opinions - and by the quality of evidence, not who shouts the loudest,"" she said. Tom Watson, the shadow culture secretary, told the Commons that ""nothing about this decision is a surprise"" as he predicted the government would eventually allow the merger to go ahead. He said if James Murdoch, who is both chairman of Sky and chief executive of Fox, could pass a ""fit and proper"" test, ""then that says more about the rules than it does about Mr Murdoch"". ""It's clear that the rules need to be reviewed and if the current Conservative government won't do that then the next Labour government will."" Mr Watson said undertakings from the Murdoch family were ""not worth the newsprint they are written on"" as he warned that lessons had not been learned from the phone-hacking scandal. He also accused the Conservatives of forming ""an implicit bargain"" with the Murdochs as he pushed Ms Bradley to order part two of the Leveson Inquiry into phone-hacking. The culture secretary claimed Mr Watson was making a ""cynical"" attempt to politicise the issue and to prejudge the decision. Evan Harris, executive director of the lobby group Hacked Off, said it condemned Ms Bradley's failure to refer the bid on commitment to broadcasting standards grounds. ""The Secretary of State must now begin Leveson part two immediately, and allow that inquiry to report before considering this merger further,"" he said. The deal wasapproved by European Commission competition authoritiesin April. Shares in Skyclosed 3.3% higher at 988p, valuing the company at almost Â£17bn. Analysts at Citi said it was possible Fox could find a resolution to Ofcom's concerns before the 14 July deadline and avoid a lengthy inquiry. ""Ultimately this is a positive outcome for the Fox/Sky in the sense that it makes deal completion more likely,"" they said. ""Concerns about broadcasting standards would have been almost impossible to work around, while we believe the groups will be able to offer concessions that adequately address concerns about plurality.""

"The Attorney General and Department of Justice have challenged a High Court ruling on NI abortion law Belfast's Court of Appeal has ruled it is not up to the courts to decide on abortion law in Northern Ireland, but up to the Stormont assembly. In 2015, theHigh Court ruledthe NI law breached the European Convention on Human Rights by not allowing abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality or sexual crime. The justice department and the NI attorney general challenged the ruling. Northern Ireland's abortion law is much stricter than the rest of the UK. On Thursday, three appeal judges allowed an appeal against the lower court's ruling that abortion legislation was incompatible with the UK's Human Rights Act obligations. This video can not be played Northern Ireland's abortion debate: For and against However, in an unusual move, the court invited legal submissions for the case to go to the Supreme Court. It ruled it was not up to local government, and not the courts, to decide on abortion law. It said the complex moral and religious questions behind the issue should be determined by a legislature. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission said it was disappointed by the ruling. Lessons from ministers' abortion climbdown Reaction to Belfast court abortion ruling Why are Northern Ireland's abortion laws different? Northern Ireland abortion guidelines Unlike the rest of the UK, abortion is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or there is a permanent or serious risk to her mental or physical health. It is unlawful to perform a termination of pregnancy, under section 58 of the Offences against the Person Act 1861, unless on these grounds. The punishment for breaking the law is life imprisonment. The original case was brought by the NI Human Rights Commission (NIHRC). It cross-appealed and re-introduced all of the original grounds it brought before the High Court. In 2013, Sarah Ewarttravelled to Englandfor a termination after doctors said her unborn child had no chance of survival outside the womb. Such a diagnosis, known as fatal foetal abnormality, is not grounds for a legal abortion in Northern Ireland. Speaking to BBC News NI's Talkback programme, Sarah said Appeal Court ruling was""totally devastating"" but she would not give up. She said she was, however, encouraged by the court inviting legal submissions for the case togo to the Supreme Court. Read morehere. Abortion is only legal in Northern Ireland under limited circumstances That court agreed that women's rights to privacy and bodily autonomy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights were breached. However, the High Court did not find that the existing abortion law breached Article 3, which protects people from torture or inhuman and degrading treatment, or that it breached Article 14, which covers discrimination. In January 2016, both the Department of Justice and the Attorney Generalappealed against the High Court judgment. The Department of Justice argued there was a lack of legal certainty in it which could lead inadvertently to abortion on demand. The law on abortion in NI has been the subject of protests by different groups It also argued that the ruling on sexual crime was unclear. The Attorney General said Judge Horner was clearly wrong in his decision when he said ""there was no life to protect"". He also argued that there was no proper basis for a doctor to say a foetus had a fatal abnormality. Meanwhile, at Westminster,Chancellor Philip Hammond has said the government intends to fund abortions in England for women from Northern Ireland. The letter followed the Speaker selecting an amendment to the Queen's Speech relating to access to abortions. It calls on the government to allow women in Northern Ireland to have abortions for free in England, instead of being charged as they are now. More than 50 MPs from all the major parties have signed the amendment, co-ordinated by Labour's Stella Creasy. The concession came ahead of a vote on the issue in the Commons. This is a mixed day for Northern Ireland's abortion campaigners - on both sides of the argument. Overthrowing the previous ruling came as a shock to the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission and Amnesty International. While they had claimed victory in 2015 for moving the local abortion story closer in line with the rest of the UK -  on Thursday, they said, all that was undone. Meanwhile, as anti-abortion campaigners were celebrating at that decision -  their feelings quickly turned to absolute dismay and disbelief as the news emerged from Westminster. Read morehere. Earlier this month,the UK's highest court narrowly rejected an appealby a mother and daughter for women from Northern Ireland to receive free abortions on the NHS in England. The Supreme Court clarified that restrictions on NHS-funded abortion care for Northern Ireland women are not due to economic or legal constraints. Rather, they are based on the secretary of state's political considerations and respect for the local assembly. In a separate case, a judicial review is due to take place in the autumn into the decision to criminally prosecute a woman who allegedly bought abortion pills online for her daughter. The woman, who cannot be named, is accused of procuring and supplying poison in 2013 with the intent to procure a miscarriage contrary to the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act.

"This video can not be played Matthew Horne from the National Crime Agency discusses Albanian gangs Violent Albanian criminal groups are exerting ""considerable control"" over the drug trafficking market in the UK, a law enforcement report has said. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it was increasingly concerned by what it called the Albanians' ""high-profile influence within UK organised crime"". The remarks are in the agency's annual assessment of the nature and scale of serious and organised crime in the UK. It also warned of the threat of cyber-crime from Russian-speaking countries. The NCA said profit margins in the drugs trade remained ""substantial"" despite international efforts. Among those to emerge as a ""significant threat"" were Albanian gangs - which the agency said had particular influence on the cocaine market. Officials said the gangs were characterised by their readiness to resort to serious violence. London is their ""primary hub"", the report says,  but they are established across the UK. NCA deputy director general Matthew Horne said: ""It's very much a group that's small in number but big in impact. ""We have seen an emergence of violence, particularly around enforcing the drug trade, in this group."" The report also said that Serbian and Turkish crime groups ""dominate high volume maritime cocaine logistics"", while Turkish and Pakistani groups ""continue to dominate heroin trafficking to the UK"". The report said corruption among staff working at ports and airports was a ""key vulnerability"", because it made it easier for gangs to smuggle in drugs and bring in illegal immigrants. Is your postman delivering drugs? Cocaine is getting stronger, drug experts warn The agency also warned about cyber-crime, saying its scale was being underestimated. It said many businesses failed to report attacks for fear of damaging their reputation. Mr Horne added: ""What is striking from this year's assessment are the themes running through the crime types. ""Organised criminal networks are using online methods to defraud and extort, but also facilitate the abuse of children and advertise the victims of human trafficking and modern slavery. ""Similarly, the threat from corruption encompasses a huge range of sectors and professional enablers, from bank insiders and accountants involved in high-end money laundering, through to port workers and delivery drivers facilitating drug trafficking.""

"A female Kurdish fighter, part of the coalition against IS in Raqqa, Syria The so-called Islamic State group is facing its ""end game"" in the Iraqi city where its campaign of violence began in 2014, the defence secretary has said. Sir Michael Fallon said the RAF had hit more than 700 targets in support of the liberation of Mosul by Iraqi forces. IS is also losing ground in its Syrian stronghold of Raqqa, Sir Michael said. He was speaking before a Nato meeting where he is expected to confirm 85 more UK troops will be sent to Afghanistan on training duties. There are already 500 British personnel in the country. UK asked to send more troops to Afghanistan Iraq forces repel IS Mosul counter-attack Iraqi forces have been making advances in Mosul The US-led coalition against IS has been stepping up airstrikes in recent months, with the RAF now working at its highest operational tempo in 25 years. UK forces have also hit 69 targets in support of Syrian Democratic Forces in Raqqa, where Sir Michael said there is ""irreversible momentum and progress"" towards the defeat of IS. The UK has also been using ""offensive"" cyber attacks against IS. The Ministry of Defence said the UK commitment to the Afghan training mission was part of a global effort to counter terror and build stability. Sir Michael Fallon said: ""Keeping Afghanistan from becoming a safe haven for transnational terrorists helps to keep our streets safe too.

"This video can not be played Cardinal Pell: ""I am innocent of these charges, they are false"" The Vatican treasurer, Cardinal George Pell, has vehemently denied any wrongdoing after being charged with sex offences in his native Australia. He complained that he had been subjected to ""relentless character assassination"" during a two-year investigation into the ""false"" claims. He said the Pope had granted him a leave of absence to fight the charges. The charges relate to alleged ""historical"" incidents, police in the state of Victoria said. The allegations were made by a number of people, said Police Deputy Commissioner Shane Patton. Cardinal Pell, 76, who is based in the Vatican, is considered the third-ranking official in the Holy See. He told a news conference at the Holy See that he would travel to Australia if his doctors permitted it. ""I'm looking forward finally to having my day in court,"" he said. ""I am innocent of these charges, they are false. The whole idea of sexual abuse is abhorrent to me."" Vatican's credibility crisis over Pell Vatican's child abuse response Documenting Australia's shame The Catholic Church worldwide has in recent years faced a damaging series of allegations relating to sex abuse by priests, and claims that these cases were covered up. The BBC's James Reynolds says the charges leave the Church - and the Pope - in an uncomfortable position. After his election in 2013, Pope Francis created a commission to deal with allegations of sexual abuse by clerics. Now he finds that one of his closest advisers faces charges of his own. In a statement following the announcement of the charges, the Vatican said: ""The Holy See expresses its respect for the Australian justice system that will have to decide the merits of the questions raised. ""At the same time, it is important to recall that Cardinal Pell has openly and repeatedly condemned as immoral and intolerable the acts of abuse committed against minors; has co-operated in the past with Australian authorities... has supported the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors; and finally, as a diocesan bishop in Australia, has introduced systems and procedures both for the protection of minors and to provide assistance to victims of abuse."" Victoria Police said they had made the decision to charge Cardinal Pell after receiving advice from prosecutors last month. ""Cardinal Pell is facing multiple charges and there are multiple complainants,"" Deputy Commissioner Patton said. The cardinal would be required to face the Melbourne Magistrates' Court on 18 July, Deputy Commissioner Patton said. A magistrate will decide next week whether to release the details and the nature of the charges ahead of the cardinal's court appearance. Cardinal Pell was questioned by Australian detectives in the Vatican last year after saying he was too unwell to take a long flight to Australia. Cardinal Pell has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing Cardinal Pell has been a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values, taking a conservative stance on same-sex marriage and contraception, and advocating priestly celibacy. But his career has been dogged first by claims that he covered up child sexual abuse by priests, and then later that he was himself an abuser. He has always strongly denied any wrongdoing. In 2014, Cardinal Pell was summoned to Rome to become chief of the Vatican's finances, a new position created by Pope Francis in the wake of scandals at the Vatican Bank. But he left behind growing anger over revelations of child sex abuse by members of the Catholic clergy in Australia. Cardinal Pell repeatedly faced allegations from abuse victims of a cover-up and his critics accused him of appearing aloof and arrogant. In 2016 the Australian Broadcasting Corp (ABC) aired allegations by two men who claimed Cardinal Pell had touched them inappropriately in the 1970s. He strongly denied the allegations, describing them as a ""scandalous smear campaign"". More on Cardinal Pell Cardinal Pell is not just Australia's most senior cleric, he is one of the highest-ranking officials in the Catholic world. For two decades, he has been a frontline figure in the Church's debate over controversial issues such as homosexuality, Aids and stem cell research. He has also handled the Church's official response to allegations of sexual abuse within its Australian ranks during a series of inquiries. When he gave evidence via video link to a Royal Commission into abuse last year, some abuse survivors flew all the way to Rome to watch. It is hard to overstate, therefore, the significance of the decision to press charges against him. When he returns to face those charges in an Australian court, every second will be scrutinised not just by the Australian press, but by members of Catholic congregations across the globe. The sexual abuse of children was rarely discussed in public before the 1970s, and it was not until the 1980s that the first cases of molestation by priests came to light, in the US and Canada. In the 1990s, revelations began of widespread abuse in Ireland and in the new century, more cases of abuse were revealed in more than a dozen countries. This video can not be played ""There will be a lot of sadness"" in the town of Ballarat over Cardinal sex offence charges, says resident The UN has accused the Vatican of ""systematically"" adopting policies allowing priests to sexually abuse thousands of children. Since his election, Pope Francis has appeared to offer new hope to victims, with a call for action on sex abuse in the Church. Under his papacy, a Vatican committee has been set up to fight sexual abuse and help victims. In a report by Vatican Radio, the Pope asked for forgiveness for the ""evil"" damage to children caused by sexual abusers in the clergy and said ""sanctions"" would be imposed. Vatican officials submitted publicly to questioning for the first time in January 2013, before a UN panel in Geneva, but refused to supply data on abuse cases. Victims' groups have responded to almost every move by the Vatican with scepticism.

"The news that six men are to face criminal charges over the Hillsborough disaster dominates many of the front pages. Most of the headlines reflect the long passage of time since the tragedy. ""Twenty-eight years on, six face trial,""is the headline in the Guardian,external. The Daily Telegraph's headline quotes the chairwoman,externalof the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Margaret Aspinall, as describing the announcement as ""the beginning of the end"". The Daily Mirror's is ""95 manslaughter charges"",external, with the nine and the five figures made up of pictures of the Liverpool fans who died in April 1989. Over the years, theSun has faced much vilification from people in Liverpool,externalbecause of its coverage of what happened. It devotes the whole of its front page - and four more inside - to the story. The paper pictures a single Liverpool fan sitting on the Leppings Lane terrace in the immediate aftermath of the disaster, with his head in his hands. TheFinancial Times,externalleads with the ""confusion"" it says was caused in bond and currency markets after Europe's two most influential central bankers, Bank of England governor Mark Carney and the European Central Bank's Mario Draghi, struggled to communicate how they planned to move on from years of crisis-era economic stimulus policies. The FT notes that the pound jumped by more than 1% against the dollar - before retreating - after Mr Carney said he was prepared to raise interest rates, just a week after saying this was ""not the time"". The Daily Mail regards his latest comments as a clear sign,externalthat a rate rise in on the horizon. The Times observes,externalthat, after putting a state visit to the UK on hold, Donald Trump has accepted an invitation from President Macron of France to attend the Bastille Day parade in Paris next month. It says that while ""Le Donald"" is deeply unpopular in France, particularly after pulling the US out of the Paris climate change accord, he has apparently decided to brave likely protests for the sake of a glittering occasion alongside Europe's man of the moment. The trip will lack the pomp of a royal reception at Buckingham Palace, the Times believes, but it will be seen in Europe as a sign of British decline and French clout under Mr Macron. And this, adds theFT,external, after the two men's relationship got off to a tense start at a Nato summit with a knuckle-crushing handshake. The Guardian highlights figures it has obtained,externalsuggesting that a million plastic bottles are being bought around the world every minute. According to the estimates from global research firm Euromonitor International this number will jump by a fifth by 2021, creating an environmental crisis that could be as serious as climate change. Most plastic bottles end up in landfill or in oceans. The paper says demand is being driven by an apparently insatiable desire for bottled water and the spread of a Western ""on the go"" culture. Finally, the chief of the French air force is ""under fire"" for allegedly borrowing a fighter jet at weekends to commute from his base in Bordeaux to his home in Provence, a journey of nearly 400 miles. According to the Telegraph,external, Gen Richard Reboul is reported to have used the jet at least 10 times since last August, switching last weekend to a six-seater military plane complete with pilot and co-pilot.

"Healthcare was the main subject of protests US President Donald Trump has hosted an event at his hotel in Washington, to raise cash for his 2020 re-election campaign. Protesters greeted the president with cries of ""Shame!""as he arrived at the $35,000 (Â£27,000) per person bash. Many were unhappy with the Republican healthcare plan, holding placards that said ""Healthcare, not tax cuts"". Holding the fundraising event at Trump International Hotel has increased concerns about conflicts of interest. Richard Painter, who served as the chief ethics lawyer in the White House for former President George W Bush, said it was unacceptable for the president to be potentially benefiting financially from this kind of event. He should have picked another hotel, he said. But Kathleen Clark, a law professor who specialises in government ethics at Washington University in St. Louis,told USA Today,externalit did not break any laws. It is not clear if the hotel is being paid to host the event. Republican National Committee officials were expecting to raise about $10m, with about 300 places available. The cost of Trump's 'Winter White House' A list of Trump's potential conflicts Trump sued over business foreign payments Not all the money raised will go towards the Trump 2020 campaign - some will go to other Republican Party causes. It is unusual for a president to raise cash for re-election so early in his first term, only five months since the former property developer took office. ""Of course he is running for re-election,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Wednesday. Reporters were barred from attending the event. The president has previously been criticised for entertaining foreign leaders at another of his properties in Florida. A lawsuit filed in June argued President Trump was ""flagrantly violating the constitution"" by accepting payments from foreign governments, a charge the White House has strongly denied.

"For some young people in Hong Kong, speaking Mandarin is somewhat taboo When Hong Kong was handed back from the UK to China in 1997, only a quarter of the population spoke any Mandarin. Now, two decades later, that figure has nearly doubled. But even as people get better at communicating in Mandarin, also known as Putonghua, some in Hong Kong are losing interest, or even downright refusing to speak it. Chan Shui-duen, a professor of Chinese and Bilingual Studies at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, said that among some of her students, speaking Putonghua can almost be taboo. ""Especially among young people, the overall standard of Putonghua is rising,"" she said. ""But some of them just reject it."" This is because, for many, Putonghua has become an unwelcome reminder of the increasing ""mainlandisation"" of Hong Kong. Why Britain returned Hong Kong to China Golden geese and democracy 'infections'- did predictions come true? Hong Kong's post-handover generation John Simpson: Hong Kong 20 years on The social rejection of Putonghua has come as people question their Chinese identity, which has alarmed both the Hong Kong and mainland Chinese governments. Last June, an annual poll by the University of Hong Kong found that only 31% of people said they felt proud to be Chinese nationals, a significant drop from the year before, and a record low since the survey first began in 1997. This video can not be played Cantonese v Mandarin: What's the difference? Even as resentment against Putonghua builds, there is grudging awareness that - with nearly one billion speakers in the world - fluency in the language may hold the key to wealth and success in Hong Kong. When my eldest child turned two, I started looking for a suitable kindergarten. It surprised me that the most sought-after schools in Hong Kong taught in English or Mandarin, rather than Cantonese, which is the default language for nearly the entire population. And I was shocked to hear from Ruth Benny, founder of the Hong Kong-based education consultancy Top Schools, that 99% of her clients, both local and expatriate, strongly preferred Mandarin. ""I believe Cantonese is not valued in the context of formal education much at all,"" said Ruth Benny, the Hong Kong-based founder of Top Schools. She said Cantonese families are happy for their children to be ""socially fluent,"" but preferred them to learn Chinese literacy in Mandarin, with a standard form of written Chinese. The rising educational preference for Mandarin at the expense of Cantonese is causing anger and anxiety among Hong Kong residents, 20 years after the city was handed back from the UK to China. They worry the city's distinctive culture and identity will eventually be subsumed by mainland China, with some questioning if the language - and the city so closely identified with it - is dying. Before the 1997 handover, most local schools in Hong Kong officially used English as the medium of instruction, but in practice also taught in Cantonese. Mandarin, also known as Putonghua, is seen as the key to success by many Hong Kong parents Mandarin, also known as Putonghua, was introduced in schools in the 1980s and only became a core part of the curriculum in 1998. A man at a protest expressing support for Cantonese Cantonese is believed to have originated after the fall of the Han Dynasty in 220AD, when long periods of war caused northern Chinese to flee south, taking their ancient language with them. Mandarin was documented much later in the Yuan Dynasty in 14th century China. It was later popularised across China by the Communist Party after taking power in 1949. ""As expected, after the handover, Putonghua became more privileged and popular,"" said Brian Tse, a professor of education at the University of Hong Kong. By 1999, the Education Bureau had started publicising its long-term goal of adopting Putonghua, not Cantonese, as the medium of instruction in Chinese classes, even though it offered no timetable on when this should be achieved. About a decade later, the Standing Committee on Language Education and Research (Scolar), a government advisory group, announced plans to give $26m to schools to switch to Putonghua for Chinese teaching. It said a maximum of 160 schools could join the scheme over four years. Cantonese concern groups estimate that 70% of all primary schools and 25% of secondary schools now use Putonghua to teach Chinese. Officially, the city government encourages students to become bi-literate in Chinese and English and trilingual in English, Cantonese and Mandarin. But Robert Bauer, a Cantonese expert who teaches at several universities in Hong Kong, said Scolar and the Education Bureau were essentially ""bribing"" schools to make the switch from Cantonese to Mandarin as the medium of instruction in Chinese language classes. ""They're taking orders from the people of Beijing,"" he said. ""Cantonese sets Hong Kong apart from the mainland. The Chinese government hates that, and so does the Hong Kong government."" It is now 20 years since the UK handed control of Hong Kong back to China Those who support this view point to a gaffe made by the Education Bureau in 2014. On its site detailing Hong Kong's language policy, it stated that Cantonese was a ""Chinese dialect that is not an official language"". It caused an outcry, as Hong Kong residents certainly believe theirs is a proper form of Chinese, and not just a dialect.  The bureau was forced to apologise and delete the phrase. In 1997, there was hope and expectation that the city, unlike the rest of China, would soon enjoy universal suffrage. But the Chinese government's interpretation of reform angered the public. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets in unprecedented protests in 2014. The reform proposal was vetoed by pro-democracy politicians in 2015, and today, Hong Kong seems stuck in a political stalemate. The young people out to save Hong Kong's unique opera Have Hong Kong's youth lost hope in the future? What's changed since the handover? Against this backdrop, Cantonese has not just survived but thrived in a totally unexpected way, according to linguistics expert Lau Chaak-ming. Starting about 10 years ago, writing in vernacular Cantonese, in addition to standard Chinese, began appearing in public in advertisements. Mr Lau said this trend has greatly accelerated in the past four years. ""We can now use our language in the written form,"" he told me proudly. Previously, advertisements and newspapers used only standard written Chinese, which is easily comprehensible to all Chinese-literate readers, whereas non-Cantonese speakers might struggle to understand the written vernacular. Mr Lau dates the rise in written Cantonese to greater awareness of a local Cantonese identity, as opposed to a more general Chinese sense of self. Mr Lau and a number of volunteers are compiling an online Cantonese dictionary, documenting its evolution. Working in parallel, Mr Bauer, the Cantonese expert, will soon be publishing a Cantonese-English dictionary, which will be available online and in book form. According to these experts, Cantonese isn't dying at all. For now. ""From a linguistic point of view, it's not endangered at all. It's doing quite well compared to other languages in the China region,"" said Mr Lau. But he and others worry about the long-term consequences of the rise of Putonghua in Hong Kong, especially as more schools seem to be keen to teach in the medium. ""Speaking, and writing, Cantonese has now become an political act,"" said Robert Bauer. ""If present trends continue, children are not going to speak Cantonese down the road. It will become endangered."" An advert promoting a Cantonese Opera house in Hong Kong He cited the history of Cantonese in Guangdong province, where he believes efforts to spread Putonghua have been too successful, with children now not using their mother tongue. But Ms Chan of Hong Kong Polytechnic is less pessimistic. Contrary to what had been predicted, she says, Cantonese has maintained, and even extended, its dominant position after the handover in the areas of politics and law. It has been ""transmuted"", she maintains, from a low-status dialect to a high-status form that displays all the full functions of a standard language - which is something quite unique and unprecedented in the Chinese context. Cantonese may not entirely enjoy the ""prestige"" of a national language, but it is quite important - and indispensible for anyone living and working in Hong Kong.

"Protesters daubed ""Temer out"" on the street outside the palace in September A car has rammed the gate of the Brazilian president's palace in the capital Brasilia as pressure grows on Michel Temer to resign. Security forces fired warning shots and the driver, who is underage, was detained, a government statement said. Mr Temer was not in the Alvorada Palace at the time. Brazilian media have shown footage of a gate lying on the ground along with what appear to be a number of spent bullet cartridges. Earlier, a Supreme Court judge sent a charge of corruption against President Temer to Congress - the next move in a process which could see him removed from office and face trial. Mr Temer has been indicted for arranging to receive millions of dollars in bribes from a meat-processing company. He has denied any wrongdoing. Mr Temer's speech was his first reaction since the bribery charge was filed The lower house of Congress is expected to vote in the coming weeks on whether to allow him to be tried. Mr Temer, one-third of his cabinet, four past presidents, and dozens of politicians are either on trial, facing charges or under investigation in a giant three-year corruption inquiry linked to the state oil company. Since taking office, he has led a market-friendly government which has tried to implement unpopular labour and pension reforms that, he says, are vital for Brazil's economic recovery. His predecessor as president, leftist Dilma Rousseff, was removed from office following an impeachment vote in the Senate last year. She was accused of illegally manipulating the budget, a charge she strongly denied.
