"This video can not be played Ahead of meeting EU leaders, the UK PM is asked what she will do if they only grant a long extension. Theresa May is waiting to hear the decision of the other 27 EU leaders, who are discussing her request for a short delay to Brexit. The PM wants to move the UK's exit date from Friday to 30 June - but leaders are split over the length of delay. Seventeen member states so far favour a long extension, including Germany, while France wants a short delay. Reuters reports that the French president told the summit a delay beyond 30 June would jeopardise the EU. A no-deal Brexit was not the worst option and the EU would run a higher risk if the UK obstructed EU operations, a French official is reported to have said. The PM spoke for about an hour at the summit, before leaving the room to leave the EU leaders to discuss her request. All the leaders have spoken and had a break, and they will now each speak for a second time. The EU member states have to reach a unanimous decision by law. Allow Twitter content?

LIVE: EU summit as May faces leaders PM to make Brexit delay plea at EU summit A really simple guide to Brexit Varadkar hints at UK say in trade deals Ahead of the summit, European Council President Donald Tusk said ""neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated"" and urged the other 27 leaders to back a flexible extension of up to a year. Mrs May said the UK could leave the EU whenever a deal was ratified by Parliament - meaning the exit date could be by 22 May - the day before the European Parliament elections. This is a huge moment, a really vital night for the prime minister, who for so long told us repeatedly she wanted to keep the option of leaving without a deal on the table. But that has completely changed. She now believes that would be a huge mistake, that that could be a complete disaster, and therefore tonight she is arguing to avoid that at almost any cost. Tonight, whatever Theresa May says, the ultimate decision is with the European Union. It is absolutely clear at the moment what happens next to her - and what happens next at home - is not in British hands tonight. This video can not be played Theresa May, Angela Merkel and Donald Tusk share a laugh over an iPad If no extension is granted, the default position would be for the UK to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday, 12 April without a deal. So far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year and the House of Commons has also voted against leaving without a deal. EU leaders will discuss Theresa May's proposal over dinner The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said the ""only way to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK"" was for Parliament to agree the withdrawal agreement, and any extension ""has to be useful and serve a purpose"". Brexit explained in flowcharts Why a long Brexit extension worries Europe Kuenssberg: Brexit delay proves lesser evil for May Mrs May said she knew many people would be ""frustrated that the summit is taking place at all"", but its purpose was ""to agree a deal to enable us to leave the EU in that smooth and orderly way"". She said the extra time to get a deal through Parliament was ""in everybody's interest"". Asked if she would accept a longer extension, she said: ""I have asked for an extension to 30 June. The PM has previously said she was ""not prepared to delay Brexit any further than 30 June"". Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button EU officials prepared a draft document for the leaders to discuss at the summit - but the end date of the delay was left blank for them to fill in once deliberations ended. The draft document from EU officials leaves the date of an extension blank BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said ""much has been spelled out in advance"", including the condition that the UK would have to hold European Parliament elections if it remained in the EU at the end of May - or else be forced to leave immediately. The UK would also be expected to commit to not disrupting EU business - such as the preparation of the next budget - and its influence ""would be sharply reduced and its voice muted"". Arriving in Brussels, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the leaders needed to discuss Mrs May's request ""openly and constructively"", and she had ""no doubt"" there would be unity over an extension. She said: ""The greatest interest for us is an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU and to maintain the unity of the 27."" Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar told reporters he was ""very confident"" an extension would be agreed Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he did not anticipate that the UK would leave the EU on Friday, and he was ""very confident"" that an extension will be agreed at the summit. ""What is still open is how long that extension will be and what the conditions will be,"" he added. But French President Emmanuel Macron said ""nothing is settled, and in particular no long extension"". He said he was ""impatient"" to hear ""clear proposals"" from Mrs May, and leaders would need ""a lot of calm, a lot of determination and a lot of sang-froid"". President Macron added: ""I believe deeply that we are carrying out a European rebirth, and I don't want the subject of Brexit to get in the way of that."" Meanwhile, DUP leader Arlene Foster and Northern Ireland MEP Diane Dodds will meet Mr Barnier on Thursday, with Conservative MPs Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson. Ms Foster said the prime minister had ""limped along and tried to force people into a cul-de-sac"" in trying to get support for her ""bad"" deal.

"This video can not be played May on Brexit extension: ""The UK should have left the EU by now"" European Union leaders have granted the UK a six-month extension to Brexit, after late-night talks in Brussels. The new deadline - 31 October - averts the prospect of the UK having to leave the EU without a deal on Friday, as MPs are still deadlocked over a deal. European Council President Donald Tusk said his ""message to British friends"" was ""please do not waste this time"". Theresa May, who had wanted a shorter delay, said the UK would still aim to leave the EU as soon as possible. The UK must now hold European elections in May, or leave on 1 June without a deal. The prime minister will later make a statement on the Brussels summit to the House of Commons, while talks with the Labour Party, aimed at reaching consensus on how to handle Brexit, are set to continue. Mrs Maytweeted:,external""The choices we now face are stark and the timetable is clear. So we must now press on at pace with our efforts to reach a consensus on a deal that is in the national interest."" What happens next? Brexit: A really simple guide Trick or treat? Halloween deadline is both So far, MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year and they have voted against leaving the EU without a deal. The EU has ruled out any renegotiation of the withdrawal agreement. Before the summit, Mrs May had told leaders she wanted to move the UK's exit date from this Friday to 30 June, with the option of leaving earlier if Parliament ratified her agreement. For Labour, shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer called the delay to 31 October ""a good thing"", saying businesses would be ""relieved"". He added: ""Negotiations are in good faith. We all feel a deep sense of duty to break the impasse. ""But there's also this question of how on Earth do we ensure that anything this prime minister promises is actually delivered in the future because of course she's already said she's going to step down, probably within months."" One government minister told BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg the latest delay to Brexit could mean a Conservative Party leadership contest after Easter, with a new prime minister potentially in place by June. Former Brexit Secretary David Davis said: ""There's been no progress whatsoever, really."" He added that it was still ""difficult to see how"" Mrs May could get her deal with the EU through Parliament and said: ""The pressure on her to go will increase dramatically now, I suspect."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted,externalher ""relief"" that the UK wouldn't be ""crashing out"" on Friday, adding that ""allowing people to decide if they still want to leave is now imperative"". A Brexit extension ""only as long as necessary"" and ""no longer than 31 October"" to allow for the ratification of the withdrawal agreement The UK ""must hold the elections to the European Parliament"" and if it fails to do this, the UK will leave on 1 June The European Council reiterates there can be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement negotiations Read the EU's conclusions here.,external What is Theresa May's withdrawal agreement? Donald Tusk emerged from the talks - and a subsequent meeting with Mrs May - to address reporters at a news conference at 02:15 local time (01:15 BST). ""The course of action will be entirely in the UK's hands,"" he said. ""They can still ratify the withdrawal agreement, in which case the extension can be terminated."" This video can not be played Tusk on Brexit extension: ""Please do not waste this time"" Mr Tusk said the UK could also rethink its strategy or choose to ""cancel Brexit altogether"". He added: ""Let me finish with a message to our British friends: This extension is as flexible as I expected, and a little bit shorter than I expected, but it's still enough to find the best possible solution. Please do not waste this time."" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said: ""There will probably be a European election in the UK - that might seem a bit odd, but rules are rules and we must respect European law and then we will see what happens."" Mrs May spoke at 02:45 local time (01:45 BST). She said that, although the delay extends until 31 October, the UK can leave before then if MPs pass her withdrawal deal. This video can not be played BBC's Adam Fleming explains how the EU agreed a Brexit delay. ""I know that there is huge frustration from many people that I had to request this extension,"" she said. ""The UK should have left the EU by now and I sincerely regret the fact that I have not yet been able to persuade Parliament to approve a deal."" She added: ""I do not pretend the next few weeks will be easy, or there is a simple way to break the deadlock in Parliament. But we have a duty as politicians to find a way to fulfil the democratic decision of the referendum, deliver Brexit and move our country forward. Nothing is more pressing or more vital."" The PM said the UK would ""continue to hold full membership rights and obligations [of the EU]"" during the delay. You couldn't quite make it up. The new Brexit deadline is, you guessed it, Halloween. So to get all the terrible metaphors about horror shows, ghosts and ghouls out of the way right now, let's consider straight away some of the reasons why this decision is a treat in one sense, but could be a trick too. A treat? First and most importantly, the EU has agreed to put the brakes on. We will not leave tomorrow without a deal. The prime minister's acceptance that leaving the EU without a formal arrangement in place could be a disaster won out. And there are quite a few potential tricks. This new October deadline might not solve very much at all. This could, although I hate to say it, just make way for months of extra gridlock before the UK and the EU find themselves back here in a similar situation in the autumn. Read Laura's blog here The EU had been split over the length of delay to offer the UK, and by law its other 27 member states had to reach a unanimous decision. Although other countries backed a longer delay, French President Emmanuel Macron pushed for a shorter extension. He called the 31 October deadline ""a good solution"". German Chancellor Angela Merkel had argued for a longer delay Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, the Irish prime minister, said the extension gave the UK time ""to come to a cross-party agreement"". Fudge and can-kicking are the EU-familiar words that spring to mind at the end of this Brexit summit. After all the drama and speculation leading up to the meeting, effectively all that happened here is that the threat of a no-deal Brexit has been postponed for another six months. Time enough for the EU to hold European parliamentary elections, choose a new president of the European Commission and pass a new budget - without EU leaders having to keep one eye at least on the day-to-day dramas in the House of Commons. Despite EU leaders' rhetoric beforehand, they granted this extension without hearing a convincing plan of Brexit action from Theresa May. In the summit conclusions there is no evidence of the punitive safeguards mooted to ensure the UK ""behaves itself"" - refraining from blocking EU decisions - as long as it remains a club member. Yes, EU leaders worry about who might replace Theresa May as prime minister. Yes, they're concerned these six months could fly past with the UK as divided as ever but their message to the UK tonight was: ""We've done our bit. Now you do yours. It's up to you. Please use the time well.""

"Theresa May met Angela Merkel in Berlin ahead of the EU summit The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, has urged European Union leaders not to humiliate Theresa May when they discuss her latest request to delay Brexit. But the other 27 EU countries (known as the EU27) may still impose tough conditions on any extension to the Article 50 negotiating period, to ensure that they protect their own interests. The EU's main initial demand is that the UK fulfils its commitment to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May, if Brexit hasn't happened by then. Draft conclusions for today's summit in Brussels say that if the UK were to fail to hold the elections, it would automatically leave the EU - without a deal if necessary - on 1 June. But even if those elections take place, and UK MEPs attend the first session of the new parliament in July, there is still concern in some quarters that a disgruntled British government could prevent the EU making progress on a series of important issues. Different member states have different opinions on how serious a threat this is. But it is certainly an important part of the discussion. Theresa May has already pledged that theUK will remain a ""constructive and responsible"" member state, and abide by its ""duty of sincere co-operation"" with the rest of the EU. This is a form of words that carries weight in Brussels, but it doesn't bind any future UK government to act in the same way. The EU has a series of big decisions to make in the coming months. It doesn't want Brexit to get in the way. To begin with, there is a changing of the guard at the top of the EU's political structures. A new president of the European Commission has to be nominated by EU leaders, and approved by the European Parliament, in time to take over on 1 November from Jean-Claude Juncker, who is standing down. A month later, on 1 December, a new European Council president will take office, succeeding Donald Tusk. Both of these appointment, though, involve qualified majority voting - in other words they don't have to be approved unanimously by all member states. That would limit the ability of an unhappy UK government to block critical EU business. ""We've looked very carefully,"" a senior EU official says, ""and in reality there aren't many things you can veto over the coming year."" But there are other important issues looming for the EU notably on the size and shape of the next seven year budget for 2021-27. Negotiations on the budget will start to intensify under the new Commission, although final decisions won't be made for at least a year. The budget does need unanimous approval. How do European elections work? What does Brexit delay letter say? That is one of the reasons why any Brexit extension will almost certainly, as Mr Tusk has suggested, be ""no longer than a year"". Brexit has been taking up far too much time already. It has diverted the EU from a focus on other subjects, and the leaders of the EU27 would rather concentrate on their own future than on the internal debates of a country that is trying to leave. So the leaders will have to decide how many conditions they impose on a Brexit extension, and they will want to hear Mrs May repeat her written pledge of co-operation in person. Throughout the Brexit process, the unity of the EU27 has been a consistent factor. But there is now a difficult balance to strike. Does there need to be a formal review process during an extension, or is a European Council decision to ""remain seized of the matter"" (EU jargon for paying close attention to it) enough? ""I think the extension should be as short as possible,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel told the German parliament. ""But it should be long enough to create calm, so we don't have to meet every two weeks to talk about the same subject,"" she added.

"Hundreds died at Jallianwala Bagh park, which is now home to a memorial UK Prime Minister Theresa May has described the 1919 Amritsar massacre as a ""shameful scar"" on Britain's history in India. Speaking in Britain's parliament, Mrs May reiterated the ""regret"" expressed by previous prime ministers. Her statement, however, fell short of a formal apology that some people have called for. Hundreds of people were shot dead during the massacre - the 100th anniversary is on Saturday. ""We deeply regret what happened and the suffering caused,"" Mrs May told MPs. ""The tragedy of Jallianwala Bagh of 1919 is a shameful scar on British Indian history."" Should Britain apologise for Amritsar massacre? Inside Amritsar's massacre gardens Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said ""a full, clear and unequivocal apology"" was needed. Prime Minister May expressed ""regret"" for the massacre, but fell short of a formal apology Troops opened fire on thousands of people who had gathered at the Jallianwala Bagh public gardens in Amritsar. Some were Indian nationalists protesting against heavy war taxes and the forced conscription of Indian soldiers. Others were celebrating the city's Sikh Baisakhi festival and found themselves mixed up with the demonstrators. British colonial authorities had earlier declared martial law in the city and banned public meetings due to a rise in public demonstrations. Brigadier General Reginald Dyer was sent to disperse the crowds at Jallianwala Bagh. Without warning, Gen Dyer blocked the exits and ordered his troops to fire on the crowd. They stopped firing 10 minutes later when their ammunition ran out. The death toll is disputed - an inquiry set up by the colonial authorities put the figure at 379 but Indian sources put it nearer to 1,000. The killings are portrayed in a painting at Jallianwala Bagh Martyrs' Memorial The killings were condemned by the British at the time - War Secretary Winston Churchill described them as ""monstrous"" in 1920. In 2013, David Cameron became the first serving UK prime minister to pay his respects at Jallianwala Bagh public gardens. He later defended his decision not to offer an apology, saying the British government had ""rightly condemned"" the massacre at the time. ""I don't think the right thing is to reach back into history and to seek out things that we should apologise for. I think the right thing to do is to acknowledge what happened, to recall what happened, to show respect and understanding for what happened,"" he said.

"The finger and toe bones are curved, suggesting climbing was still an important activity for this species There's a new addition to the family tree: an extinct species of human that's been found in the Philippines. It's known asHomo luzonensis, after the site of its discovery on the country's largest island Luzon. Its physical features are a mixture of those found in very ancient human ancestors and in more recent people. That could mean primitive human relatives left Africa and made it all the way to South-East Asia, something not previously thought possible. The find shows that human evolution in the region may have been a highly complicated affair, with three or more human species in the region at around the time our ancestors arrive. One of these species was the diminutive ""Hobbit"" -Homo floresiensis- which survived on the Indonesian island of Flores until 50,000 years ago. Prof Chris Stringer, from London's Natural History Museum, commented: ""After the remarkable finds of the diminutiveHomo floresiensiswere published in 2004, I said that the experiment in human evolution conducted on Flores could have been repeated on many of the other islands in the region. ""That speculation has seemingly been confirmed on the island of Luzon... nearly 3,000km away."" DNA shows cave girl was half Neanderthal Ancient humans interbred with us Study backs 'hobbit' shrinking idea The new specimens from Callao Cave, in the north of Luzon, are described in the journal Nature. They have been dated to between 67,000 years and 50,000 years ago. They consist of thirteen remains - teeth, hand and foot bones, as well as part of a femur - that belong to at least three adult and juvenile individuals. They have been recovered in excavations at the cave since 2007. Homo luzonensishas some physical similarities to recent humans, but in other features hark back to the australopithecines, upright-walking ape-like creatures that lived in Africa between two and four million years ago, as well as very early members of the genusHomo. The finger and toe bones are curved, suggesting climbing was still an important activity for this species. This also seems to have been the case for some australopithecines. The teeth of Homo luzonensis are consistent with the remains being assigned to a new species If australopithecine-like species were able to reach South-East Asia, it would change the way our ideas about who in our human family tree left Africa first. Homo erectushas long thought to have been the first member of our direct line to leave the African homeland - around 1.9 million years ago. And given that Luzon was only ever accessible by sea, the find raises questions about how pre-human species might have reached the island. In addition toHomo luzonensis, island South-East Asia also appears to have been home to another human species called the Denisovans, who appear to have interbred with early modern humans (Homo sapiens) when they arrived in the region. Callao Cave, in the north of Luzon, is open to tourists This evidence comes from analysis of DNA, as no known Denisovan fossils have been found in the region. The Indonesian island of Flores was home to a species calledHomo floresiensis, nicknamed The Hobbits because of their small stature. They are thought to have survived there from at least 100,000 years ago until 50,000 years ago - potentially overlapping with the arrival of modern humans. Interestingly, scientists have also argued thatHomo floresiensisshows physical features that are reminiscent of those found in australopithecines. But other researchers have argued that the Hobbits were descended from Homo erectus but that some of their anatomy reverted to a more primitive state. In an article published in Nature, Matthew Tocheri from Lakehead University in Canada, who was not involved with the research, commented: ""Explaining the many similarities thatH.Â floresiensisandH.Â luzonensisshare with earlyHomospecies and australopiths as independently acquired reversals to a more ancestral-like hominin anatomy, owing to evolution in isolated island settings, seems like a stretch of coincidence tooÂ far.""

"Luis Suarez celebrates after his header is turned in by Luke Shaw Manchester United must produce another unlikely Champions League comeback to keep their hopes alive after Barcelona left Old Trafford with a slender advantage following the quarter-final first leg. Barcelona, with superstar Lionel Messi quiet by his standards, were nowhere near their best but secured the win after Luis Suarez's far post header from the Argentine's pass deflected in off Luke Shaw in the 12th minute and was confirmed by the video assistant referee after initially being given offside. New Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer can take heart from his team's great endeavour but opportunities were at a premium, the best being a first-half header from Diogo Dalot that he directed off target. In fact United did not muster a single shot on target. Barcelona still posed a threat, with David de Gea saving from Philippe Coutinho and Messi - and United must now repeat their last-16 heroics against Paris St-Germain in France when they travel to the Nou Camp chasing a semi-final spot against Liverpool or Porto. Manchester United's players took the applause of Old Trafford - but it was acknowledgment of a plucky effort rather than praise for any serious quality. United had excellent performers, with youngster Scott McTominay delivering a performance of real maturity, but the bottom line was that they barely laid a glove on Barcelona all night. And the frustration for the Premier League side will be that this should be regarded as a missed opportunity because Barcelona were light years away from their flowing best here. We can score in Barcelona, says Man Utd boss Solskjaer Football Daily podcast: Barcelona draw first blood against Man Utd Dion Dublin analysis This was the first time United have failed to have a shot on target in a Champions League game since March 2005, when they lost away to AC Milan. Solskjaer and his side are left hoping for the same sort of miracle that saw them overcome a 2-0 home defeat to come through the last 16 against PSG - but lightning does not usually strike twice, Barcelona are a superior side and the Red Devils have won only once in the Nou Camp, when they beat Bayern Munich there in the 1999 Champions League final. United will summon up those spirits but this is very much odds against once more. Barcelona have glittered in the Champions League for years. This was a night for the grind and they got the job done. It was undistinguished, unspectacular, but done all the same. Suarez got his goal but was only an intermittent threat while Messi occasionally flashed but was often on the margins, not helped by sustaining a facial injury in a first-half challenge by Chris Smalling. Coutinho showed glimpses of the brilliance that made him such a precious commodity but this was a night when Barcelona played well within themselves. There was little in the way of celebration from their players at the final whistle as they knew their performance was poor but it was still a giant stride towards the semi-final, and they will be satisfied by how they totally nullified United. Scott McTominay showed a maturity in his play at the heart of the Manchester United midfield Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer:""There were pluses and negatives. We started sloppy and a bit nervous. After their goal we settled and played well. This video can not be played PSG performance gives us belief against Barcelona - Solskjaer ""We had very good individual performances in midfield. At times it felt like a proper United team - the crowd were behind us, we got out wide and got crosses in. ""We didn't start great, but it was a great goal and movement from Messi and Suarez but they're fortunate it comes off Luke Shaw. It's a blow but we settled well. We're still in this tie."" Barcelona manager Ernesto Valverde said:""It's a good feeling because it's a decent result. We know it's still tight and there is a second game to come. We know they can react away from home and they did well against PSG. It was a very tough game and what we expected. There were moments where we suffered but we are happy."" Former United and current Barcelona defender Gerard Pique:""After seeing the PSG game, you do not have to trust the result - they came in Paris with a better result and look what happened. Big clubs can do these things, you have to work it out. ""It was special to come here after so many years. We are defensively at the best moment of the season. I feel comfortable because of my age and experience."" Manchester United have lost three consecutive home Champions League knockout stage games for the first time. This was Barcelona's fourth Champions League victory against Manchester United, with each one coming in a different stadium (Nou Camp, Stadio Olimpico, Wembley and Old Trafford). Manchester United have lost four of their past six Champions League home games, as many as they had in their previous 71 at Old Trafford in the competition (W51 D16 L4). Manchester United failed to have a single shot on target in a Champions League game for the first time since March 2005, in a 1-0 loss at AC Milan. Barcelona have won five of their past seven away games against English opponents in the Champions League (D1 L1), as many as they had in their first 17 such games in the competition (W5 D5 L7). 36% of Manchester United's total home defeats in the Champions League have been against Spanish opponents (5/14). Luke Shaw's own goal was the eighth Manchester United have scored in the Champions League - no side has conceded more in the history of the competition. Luis Suarez has had more shots without finding the net than any other player in the Champions League this season (33).

"Police were called to a flat on Dumbarton Road, near Boquhanran Road A two-year-old girl is in a critical condition in hospital after falling from a third-floor flat window. Police were called to the house, on Dumbarton Road in Clydebank, at about 14:10. The girl was taken to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow where she is being treated for serious injuries. Police said several people came to the girl's aid, and have appealed for further witnesses to come forward. Det Insp Steve Martin said: ""The little girl has sustained very serious injuries and we are trying to establish the full circumstances surrounding the incident. ""As such we are keen to speak to anyone who witnessed the child fall or anyone who has seen her at the window prior to her falling. ""A number of people were in the area at the time and came to the assistance of the girl and it is important that we speak to all of these people. Therefore, if any of these people left before speaking to police, we urge them to contact police immediately. ""I also ask any motorists who were in the vicinity around 2.10 pm today to check their dash cam footage to see if they have captured the incident.""

"Middle-class families are seeing their incomes stagnating as they are squeezed by the ultra-rich taking a bigger slice, says an international report from the OECD economics think tank. The report says the middle classes are being ""hollowed out"", with declining chances of rising prosperity and growing fears of job insecurity. The OECD says there will be political consequences for Western countries. It says middle classes have often been the ""bedrock of democracy"". Against a background of political populism and concerns about rising extremism, the report says that traditionally moderate middle-class families are feeling ""left behind"" and are increasingly likely to support ""anti-establishment"" movements. It warns of a destabilising impact if this section of society - defined as earning between 75% and 200% of the average income - continues to feel that prosperity is slipping away. In the UK, almost 60% of people live in households classified as being in this middle-income group. The report warns of anti-establishment ""discontent"" driven by a widening income gap: France has faced months of ""yellow jacket"" protests From an international perspective, the OECD shows a changing economic model, in which high earners have accelerated upwards, while those in the middle have seen ""dismal income growth"" or a falling back. Across OECD countries, which include most of the big economies in Western Europe and North America, the 10% of highest earners have increased their income by a third more than middle earners In the UK, more than a third of middle-income households ""report having difficulty making ends meet"", says the OECD In the United States over the past three decades, the top 1% of earners have increased their slice of total annual income from 11% to 20% ""Middle incomes are barely higher today than they were 10 years ago,"" says the analysis. The report warns of social consequences if the middle classes lose trust in the system, beyond their own economic self-interest. It says the middle classes have been important supporters of sectors such as education, health and housing and ""good quality public services"". Younger generations face an uphill challenge to buy their home But worsening income inequality could threaten ""their trust in others and in democratic institutions"". The study says that this perception of declining opportunities is causing ""growing discontent"". Half of children born into families renting British Gas boss gets 44% pay rise after 'challenging year' A third of millennials face renting their entire lives The ""stagnation of middle-class living standards"" has been accompanied by the emergence of ""new forms of nationalism, isolationism, populism and protectionism"". Instead of upwards social mobility and growing prosperity, the report says the middle classes are more worried about slipping downwards. The report,Under Pressure: The Squeezed Middle Class,external, says that totems of middle class family life, such as access to housing and higher education, have become increasingly expensive. The rising cost of property, in particular, has outstripped the growth in income, with parents worrying about the housing prospects for their children. Another traditional middle-class advantage has been job security, but this has also been eroded. ""Today, the middle class looks increasingly like a boat in rocky waters,"" says the OECD's secretary general, Angel GurrÃ­a The OECD highlights a generational divide - with a shrinking number of younger people in this middle-class group. The widening gap of incomes has pushed more people to the extremes of rich and poor, so that millennials in their 20s are less likely to be in middle-income households than baby boomers in their 50s and 60s. ""A strong and prosperous middle class is important for the economy and society as a whole,"" says the study. But it says middle-class households feel a sense of ""unfairness"" and are ""increasingly anxious about their economic situation"".

"Ched Evans' case against Brabners had been due to be heard at the High Court Ched Evans has reached an out-of-court settlement with his original defence team over their handling of the case where he was found guilty of rape. The conviction was later quashed and overturned at a retrial. The BBC understands the Welsh footballer, 30, who now plays for League One Fleetwood Town, will receive a six-figure sum. A spokesman for the law firm Brabners said Mr Evans' case had been ""entirely without merit"". Mr Evans was originally convicted following a trial of raping a 19-year-old woman in a Premier Inn near Rhyl, Denbighshire, in May 2011. Ched Evans suing former defence lawyers Ched Evans rape conviction quashed Ched Evans found not guilty of rape At the time, he was playing for Sheffield United and was earning a reported Â£18,000 a week. But the Court of Appeal quashed his conviction and ordered a retrial in 2016. Private investigators gathered new evidence, with a Â£50,000 reward offered for information to help his case. In a rare move, the jury at Cardiff Crown Court heard from two men who had had sex with the complainant around the time of the rape allegation. The jury took less than three hours to find Mr Evans not guilty of the charge following the eight-day trial. The spokesman for Brabners said: ""We are glad that Ched Evans has agreed not to pursue this case, which we believe was entirely without merit. ""Brabners put forward a strong defence of Mr Evans claim following a thorough process and we were prepared to vigorously defend our handling of the case.""

"Around 900 people are thought to have travelled from the UK to Syria since the conflict began A ""small number"" of British children have left Syria and returned to the UK via other countries in the last year, the government has said. But British officials were not involved in helping them leave IS territory. British women who went to Syria to join the group may have given birth there or taken children with them, according to Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Confirmation that children have returned comes afterIS bride Shamima Begum's baby died in a Syrian camp. The death raised questions over the government's policy on repatriating the children of British IS fighters. Why countries face a dilemma over IS children In response to a written parliamentary question, Home Office minister Baroness Williams of Trafford said: ""We can confirm that in the last 12 months there have been a small number of British children who have left Syria and returned to the UK via third countries."" She said the UK did not have a consulate in Syria and the government advised against travelling to the country. ""We will not put British officials' lives at risk to assist those who have left the UK to join a proscribed terrorist organisation,"" she continued. ""If a British child who has been in Syria is able to seek consular assistance outside of Syria, then we would work with local and UK authorities to facilitate their return if requested."" Earlier this year, Ms Begum - who left London aged 15 to join Islamic State in 2015 - gave media interviews from a Syrian refugee camp in which she said she wanted to return home. Butshe was stripped of her British citizenship by the home secretary in an effort to stop her returning to the UK, who said those who left to join IS were ""full of hate for our country"". Ms Begum gave birth to a baby boy in the camp, who was considered a British citizen, but he died three weeks later of pneumonia. The government was criticised over the death, butForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it would have been too dangerous to rescue the baby from the camp. This video can not be played ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" The home secretary defended his decision to revoke Ms Begum's citizenship, saying the power was only used in ""extreme circumstances where conducive to the public good"". It also emerged in March that the UK had stripped British citizenship from two more women living in Syrian refugee camps with young children. Mr Javid has previously indicated hundreds of children may have been born to so-called foreign fighters. Women make up a significant proportion of around 900 people who have travelled from the UK to join the conflict in Syria, according to the home secretary. Some 20% of those are believed to have been killed overseas, while around 40% have returned to the UK. Commenting on Baroness Williams's statement, the Home Office said: ""Our support will be tailored to the needs of each individual child. ""Local authorities and the police can use existing safeguarding powers to protect returning children, support their welfare and reintegration back in to UK society and minimise any threat they could pose within schools and to their local community.""

"Scientists have taken cancer apart piece-by-piece to reveal its weaknesses, and come up with new ideas for treatment. A team at the Wellcome Sanger Institute disabled every genetic instruction, one at a time, inside 30 types of cancer. It has thrown up 600 new cancer vulnerabilities and each could be the target of a drug. Cancer Research UK praised the sheer scale of the study. The study heralds the future of personalised cancer medicine. At the moment drugs like chemotherapy cause damage throughout the body. One of the researchers is Dr Fiona Behan, whose mother died after getting cancer for the second time. The first course of chemotherapy damaged her mother's heart, so she was not physically strong enough for many treatments the second time around. Dr Behan told the BBC: ""This is so important because currently we treat cancer by treating the entire patient's body. We don't target the cancer cells specifically. ""The information we have uncovered in this study has identified key weak-spots of the cancer cells, and will allow us to develop drugs that target the cancer and leave the healthy tissue undamaged."" The researchers believe their work could lead to new treatments Cancer is caused by mutations inside our body's own cells that change the instructions written into our DNA. Mutations corrupt cells leading to them growing uncontrollably, spreading around the body and eventually killing people. The researchers embarked on a gargantuan feat of disabling each genetic instruction - called a gene - inside cancers, to see which were crucial for survival. They disrupted nearly 20,000 genes in more than 300 lab-grown tumours made from 30 different types of cancer. They used a tool called Crispr - the same genetic technology that was used tore-engineer two babies in China last year. It is a relatively new, easy and cheap tool for manipulating DNA, and this study would have been an impossible feat just a decade ago. The results,published in the journal Nature,external, revealed 6,000 crucial genes which at least one type of cancer needs to survive. Some were unsuitable for developing cancer drugs, as they are also essential in healthy cells. Others are already the target of precision drugs like Herceptin in breast cancer - the team called this a ""sanity check"" that proves their method works. And yet more are beyond current science to develop suitable drugs, so the researchers narrowed down a shortlist of 600 potential new targets for drugs to attack. One potential target is ""Werner syndrome RecQ helicase"" also known more simply as WRN. The research team found it was essential for keeping some of the most genetically unstable cancers alive. WRN plays a vital role in around 15% of colon cancers and 28% of stomach cancers, but there are no drugs that target it. The work was a collaboration between Sanger, the European Molecular Biology Laboratory and pharmaceutical giant GSK. All the findings are publicly available. The eventual aim of the research is to develop a ""Cancer Dependency Map"" of every vulnerability in every type of cancer. Then doctors would be able to test a patient's tumour and give them a cocktail of precision drugs to kill the cancerous cells. Dr Behan told the BBC: ""We're understanding what's going on in the cancer cells so we can shoot our machine gun at the cancer cells, not at the whole body as chemotherapy does. ""This is the first step in putting a laser sight on our machine gun."" Prof Karen Vousden, Cancer Research UK's chief scientist, said: ""What makes this research so powerful, is the scale. ""This work provides some excellent starting points and the next step will be a thorough analysis of the genes that have been identified as weaknesses in this study, to determine if they will one day lead to the development of new treatments for patients.""

Chris and Colin Weir, who scooped Â£161m on the EuroMillions in 2011, also confirmed in a statement they had been living apart ""for some time"". The couple from Largs in Ayrshire, have been married for more than 30 years and have two grown-up children. They made the Sunday Times Rich List with their win eight years ago.

"Middle-class families are seeing their incomes stagnating as they are squeezed by the ultra-rich taking a bigger slice, says an international report from the OECD economics think tank. The report says the middle classes are being ""hollowed out"", with declining chances of rising prosperity and growing fears of job insecurity. The OECD says there will be political consequences for Western countries. It says middle classes have often been the ""bedrock of democracy"". Against a background of political populism and concerns about rising extremism, the report says that traditionally moderate middle-class families are feeling ""left behind"" and are increasingly likely to support ""anti-establishment"" movements. It warns of a destabilising impact if this section of society - defined as earning between 75% and 200% of the average income - continues to feel that prosperity is slipping away. In the UK, almost 60% of people live in households classified as being in this middle-income group. The report warns of anti-establishment ""discontent"" driven by a widening income gap: France has faced months of ""yellow jacket"" protests From an international perspective, the OECD shows a changing economic model, in which high earners have accelerated upwards, while those in the middle have seen ""dismal income growth"" or a falling back. Across OECD countries, which include most of the big economies in Western Europe and North America, the 10% of highest earners have increased their income by a third more than middle earners In the UK, more than a third of middle-income households ""report having difficulty making ends meet"", says the OECD In the United States over the past three decades, the top 1% of earners have increased their slice of total annual income from 11% to 20% ""Middle incomes are barely higher today than they were 10 years ago,"" says the analysis. The report warns of social consequences if the middle classes lose trust in the system, beyond their own economic self-interest. It says the middle classes have been important supporters of sectors such as education, health and housing and ""good quality public services"". Younger generations face an uphill challenge to buy their home But worsening income inequality could threaten ""their trust in others and in democratic institutions"". The study says that this perception of declining opportunities is causing ""growing discontent"". Half of children born into families renting British Gas boss gets 44% pay rise after 'challenging year' A third of millennials face renting their entire lives The ""stagnation of middle-class living standards"" has been accompanied by the emergence of ""new forms of nationalism, isolationism, populism and protectionism"". Instead of upwards social mobility and growing prosperity, the report says the middle classes are more worried about slipping downwards. The report,Under Pressure: The Squeezed Middle Class,external, says that totems of middle class family life, such as access to housing and higher education, have become increasingly expensive. The rising cost of property, in particular, has outstripped the growth in income, with parents worrying about the housing prospects for their children. Another traditional middle-class advantage has been job security, but this has also been eroded. ""Today, the middle class looks increasingly like a boat in rocky waters,"" says the OECD's secretary general, Angel GurrÃ­a The OECD highlights a generational divide - with a shrinking number of younger people in this middle-class group. The widening gap of incomes has pushed more people to the extremes of rich and poor, so that millennials in their 20s are less likely to be in middle-income households than baby boomers in their 50s and 60s. ""A strong and prosperous middle class is important for the economy and society as a whole,"" says the study. But it says middle-class households feel a sense of ""unfairness"" and are ""increasingly anxious about their economic situation"".

"Wayne Bell was sentenced for robbery in 2007 A man who remains in prison after he was jailed aged 17 for stealing a bike has given up hope of being released, his family has said. Wayne Bell was given a now-obsolete type of indefinite sentence for robbery in 2007. Now 29, he has suffered a mental breakdown and feels ""trapped"" after being repeatedly turned down for release, his relatives said. The Parole Board said it was handling cases as quickly as possible. Mr Bell received the Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP) sentence in 2007 after he was arrested for taking a bike from a boy he assaulted in Withington, Manchester. Carl Bell said his son had been unable to access courses which would help his parole case He was told he would serve a minimum sentence of four years for the crime. Mr Bell's father, Carl, said his son had gone before the Parole Board every two years but had been denied release for a number of reasons. His son had been unable to access courses to tackle issues including anger management because they were oversubscribed, he said. Mr Bell said his son had been an ""easy target"" for other inmates which had led to him becoming involved in fights and further hampered his release. ""We are all hoping, but Wayne has given up. ""He's 29 years old and he's had no life."" He said the abolition of IPP sentences in 2012 had come too late for his son and called on the government to release him. Introduced in 2005, IPPs sentenced offenders to a minimum term set by a judge, after which they could apply to the Parole Board for release. At one stage there were 6,080 IPP prisoners in England and Wales, representing 7% of the total jail population. The Parole Board may only approve release if it believes an offender is safe to rejoin the community. IPPs were abolished in 2012 after it emerged they were being used more widely than intended - and in some instances for low-level crimes. The Howard League for Penal Reform has called on the government to ""urgently"" review the detention of IPP prisoners who have served their minimum tariff. Former home secretary David Blunkett hasexpressed ""regret""that the sentences, brought in while he was in office, have led to ""injustices"". Withington MP Jeff Smith said: ""This example highlights that IPPs were completely unsatisfactory."" Former home secretary David Blunkett has expressed ""regret"" that IPP sentences have led to ""injustices"" The Parole Board said it had made significant progress by cutting IPP prisoner numbers to 2,489 as at June 2018.

"Hundreds died at Jallianwala Bagh park, which is now home to a memorial UK Prime Minister Theresa May has described the 1919 Amritsar massacre as a ""shameful scar"" on Britain's history in India. Speaking in Britain's parliament, Mrs May reiterated the ""regret"" expressed by previous prime ministers. Her statement, however, fell short of a formal apology that some people have called for. Hundreds of people were shot dead during the massacre - the 100th anniversary is on Saturday. ""We deeply regret what happened and the suffering caused,"" Mrs May told MPs. ""The tragedy of Jallianwala Bagh of 1919 is a shameful scar on British Indian history."" Should Britain apologise for Amritsar massacre? Inside Amritsar's massacre gardens Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn said ""a full, clear and unequivocal apology"" was needed. Prime Minister May expressed ""regret"" for the massacre, but fell short of a formal apology Troops opened fire on thousands of people who had gathered at the Jallianwala Bagh public gardens in Amritsar. Some were Indian nationalists protesting against heavy war taxes and the forced conscription of Indian soldiers. Others were celebrating the city's Sikh Baisakhi festival and found themselves mixed up with the demonstrators. British colonial authorities had earlier declared martial law in the city and banned public meetings due to a rise in public demonstrations. Brigadier General Reginald Dyer was sent to disperse the crowds at Jallianwala Bagh. Without warning, Gen Dyer blocked the exits and ordered his troops to fire on the crowd. They stopped firing 10 minutes later when their ammunition ran out. The death toll is disputed - an inquiry set up by the colonial authorities put the figure at 379 but Indian sources put it nearer to 1,000. The killings are portrayed in a painting at Jallianwala Bagh Martyrs' Memorial The killings were condemned by the British at the time - War Secretary Winston Churchill described them as ""monstrous"" in 1920. In 2013, David Cameron became the first serving UK prime minister to pay his respects at Jallianwala Bagh public gardens. He later defended his decision not to offer an apology, saying the British government had ""rightly condemned"" the massacre at the time. ""I don't think the right thing is to reach back into history and to seek out things that we should apologise for. I think the right thing to do is to acknowledge what happened, to recall what happened, to show respect and understanding for what happened,"" he said.

"Around 900 people are thought to have travelled from the UK to Syria since the conflict began A ""small number"" of British children have left Syria and returned to the UK via other countries in the last year, the government has said. But British officials were not involved in helping them leave IS territory. British women who went to Syria to join the group may have given birth there or taken children with them, according to Home Secretary Sajid Javid. Confirmation that children have returned comes afterIS bride Shamima Begum's baby died in a Syrian camp. The death raised questions over the government's policy on repatriating the children of British IS fighters. Why countries face a dilemma over IS children In response to a written parliamentary question, Home Office minister Baroness Williams of Trafford said: ""We can confirm that in the last 12 months there have been a small number of British children who have left Syria and returned to the UK via third countries."" She said the UK did not have a consulate in Syria and the government advised against travelling to the country. ""We will not put British officials' lives at risk to assist those who have left the UK to join a proscribed terrorist organisation,"" she continued. ""If a British child who has been in Syria is able to seek consular assistance outside of Syria, then we would work with local and UK authorities to facilitate their return if requested."" Earlier this year, Ms Begum - who left London aged 15 to join Islamic State in 2015 - gave media interviews from a Syrian refugee camp in which she said she wanted to return home. Butshe was stripped of her British citizenship by the home secretary in an effort to stop her returning to the UK, who said those who left to join IS were ""full of hate for our country"". Ms Begum gave birth to a baby boy in the camp, who was considered a British citizen, but he died three weeks later of pneumonia. The government was criticised over the death, butForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said it would have been too dangerous to rescue the baby from the camp. This video can not be played ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" The home secretary defended his decision to revoke Ms Begum's citizenship, saying the power was only used in ""extreme circumstances where conducive to the public good"". It also emerged in March that the UK had stripped British citizenship from two more women living in Syrian refugee camps with young children. Mr Javid has previously indicated hundreds of children may have been born to so-called foreign fighters. Women make up a significant proportion of around 900 people who have travelled from the UK to join the conflict in Syria, according to the home secretary. Some 20% of those are believed to have been killed overseas, while around 40% have returned to the UK.

"The first ever picture of a black hole: It's surrounded by a halo of bright gas Astronomers have taken the first ever image of a black hole, which is located in a distant galaxy. It measures 40 billion km across - three million times the size of the Earth - and has been described by scientists as ""a monster"". The black hole is 500 million trillion km away and was photographed by a network of eight telescopes across the world. Details have been published today in Astrophysical Journal Letters. It was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a network of eight linked telescopes. Prof Heino Falcke, of Radboud University in the Netherlands, who proposed the experiment, told BBC News that the black hole was found in a galaxy called M87. ""What we see is larger than the size of our entire Solar System,"" he said. ""It has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun. And it is one of the heaviest black holes that we think exists. It is an absolute monster, the heavyweight champion of black holes in the Universe."" This video can not be played M87: The significance of the first ever image of a black hole The image shows an intensely bright ""ring of fire"", as Prof Falcke describes it, surrounding a perfectly circular dark hole. The bright halo is caused by superheated gas falling into the hole. The light is brighter than all the billions of other stars in the galaxy combined - which is why it can be seen at such distance from Earth. The edge of the dark circle at the centre is the point at which the gas enters the black hole, which is an object that has such a large gravitational pull, not even light can escape. The woman behind the black hole photo Taking the temperature of black holes Hawking: Black holes store information Get BBC news in your inbox, each weekday morning Astronomers have suspected that the M87 galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its heart from false colour images such as this one. The dark centre is not a black hole but indicates that stars are densely packed and fast moving The image matches what theoretical physicists and indeed, Hollywood directors, imagined black holes would look like, according to Dr Ziri Younsi, of University College London - who is part of the EHT collaboration. ""Although they are relatively simple objects, black holes raise some of the most complex questions about the nature of space and time, and ultimately of our existence,"" he said. ""It is remarkable that the image we observe is so similar to that which we obtain from our theoretical calculations. So far, it looks like Einstein is correct once again."" But having the first image will enable researchers to learn more about these mysterious objects. They will be keen to look out for ways in which the black hole departs from what's expected in physics. No-one really knows how the bright ring around the hole is created. Even more intriguing is the question of what happens when an object falls into a black hole. A black hole is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape Despite the name, they are not empty but instead consist of a huge amount of matter packed densely into a small area, giving it an immense gravitational pull There is a region of space beyond the black hole called the event horizon. This is a ""point of no return"", beyond which it is impossible to escape the gravitational effects of the black hole Prof Falcke had the idea for the project when he was a PhD student in 1993. At the time, no-one thought it was possible. But he was the first to realise that a certain type of radio emission would be generated close to and all around the black hole, which would be powerful enough to be detected by telescopes on Earth. He also recalled reading a scientific paper from 1973 that suggested that because of their enormous gravity, black holes appear 2.5 times larger than they actually are. These two factors suddenly made the seemingly impossible, possible. After arguing his case for 20 years, Prof Falcke persuaded theEuropean Research Council,externalto fund the project. The National Science Foundation and agencies in East Asia then joined in to bankroll the project to the tune of more than Â£40m. The eventual EHT array will have 12 widely spaced participating radio facilities It is an investment that has been vindicated with the publication of the image. Prof Falcke told me that he felt that ""it's mission accomplished"". He said: ""It has been a long journey, but this is what I wanted to see with my own eyes. I wanted to know is this real?"" No single telescope is powerful enough to image the black hole. So, in the biggest experiment of its kind, Prof Sheperd Doeleman of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics led a project to set up a network of eight linked telescopes. Together, they form the Event Horizon Telescope and can be thought of as a planet-sized array of dishes. Katie Bouman is the MIT student who developed the algorithm that pieced together the data from the EHT. Without her contribution the project would not have been possible. Each is located high up at a variety of exotic sites, including on volcanoes in Hawaii and Mexico, mountains in Arizona and the Spanish Sierra Nevada, in the Atacama Desert of Chile, and in Antarctica. A team of 200 scientists pointed the networked telescopes towards M87 and scanned its heart over a period of 10 days. The information they gathered was too much to be sent across the internet. Instead, the data was stored on hundreds of hard drives that were flown to central processing centres in Boston, US, and Bonn, Germany, to assemble the information. Katie Bouman a PhD student at MIT  developed an algorithm that pieced together the data from the EHT. Without her contribution the project would not have been possible. Prof Doeleman described the achievement as ""an extraordinary scientific feat"". ""We have achieved something presumed to be impossible just a generation ago,"" he said. ""Breakthroughs in technology, connections between the world's best radio observatories, and innovative algorithms all came together to open an entirely new window on black holes."" The team is also imaging the supermassive black hole at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. Odd though it may sound, that is harder than getting an image from a distant galaxy 55 million light-years away. This is because, for some unknown reason, the ""ring of fire"" around the black hole at the heart of the Milky Way is smaller and dimmer.

"Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson says his train business could disappear from the UK after its partner Stagecoach was barred from three rail franchise bids. Sir Richard, whose Virgin Trains is 49% owned by Stagecoach, said he was ""devastated"" by the disqualification. The Department for Transport (DfT) disallowed the bids because they did not meet pensions rules. Virgin was bidding to renew the West Coast franchise in partnership with Stagecoach and France's SNCF. Stagecoach had also applied for the East Midlands and South Eastern franchises, both of which have been rejected. Ina blog on Virgin's corporate website,external, Sir Richard said Virgin Trains ""could be gone from the UK in November"". ""We're baffled why the DfT did not tell us that we would be disqualified or even discuss the issue - they have known about this qualification in our bid on pensions for months,"" he wrote. ""The pensions regulator has warned that more cash will be needed in the future, but no one knows how big that bill might eventually be and no responsible company could take that risk with pensions. ""We can't accept a risk we can't manage - this would have been reckless. This is an industry-wide issue and forcing rail companies to take these risks could lead to the failure of more rail franchises."" The deadline for bids is now closed, so any reopening of the process seems unlikely. There are thought to be two remaining bids left for the West Coast franchise. However, the DfT said Stagecoach - had ""repeatedly ignored established rules"" and that other bidders had met its requirements.The DfT's statement does not mention Virgin Trains.,external The DfT also announced that the East Midlands franchise had now been awarded to Abellio ""after they presented a strong, compliant bid"". Martin Griffiths, chief executive of Stagecoach, has called for an ""urgent meeting"" with the DfT. Mr Griffiths said in a statement:,external""We are extremely concerned at both the DfT's decision and its timing. The department has had full knowledge of these bids for a lengthy period and we are seeking an urgent meeting to discuss our significant concerns."" Bidders for the franchises have been asked to bear full long-term funding risk on relevant sections of the Railways Pension Scheme, Stagecoach said. The Pensions Regulator has estimated the UK rail industry needs an additional Â£5-6bn to plug the pensions shortfall, and the company said it was being asked to take on risks it ""cannot control and manage"". Rail firms have called on the government to help make up the pensions deficit. Mr Griffiths said: ""Forcing rail companies to take these risks could lead to the failure of more rail franchises and cannot be in the best long-term interests of either customers, employees, taxpayers or the investors the railway needs for it to prosper."" It was, he said, ""more evidence that the current franchising model is not fit for purpose"" and ""further damages the already fragile investor confidence in the UK rail market"". Stagecoach had bid independently for the East Midlands franchise, had intended to partner with Alstom for the South Eastern operations, and was jointly bidding for the West Coast Partnership with Virgin and SNCF. Stagecoach shares fell 9.3% in Wednesday trading. A DfT spokesman said: ""Stagecoach is an experienced bidder and fully aware of the rules of franchise competitions. It is regrettable that they submitted non-compliant bids for all current competitions which breached established rules and, in doing so, they are responsible for their own disqualification. ""Stagecoach chose to propose significant changes to the commercial terms for the East Midlands, West Coast Partnership and South Eastern contracts, leading to bids which proposed a significantly different deal to the ones on offer. While Stagecoach has played an important role in the UK railways industry, ""it is entirely for Stagecoach and their bidding partners to explain why they decided to repeatedly ignore established rules by rejecting the commercial terms on offer"". Stagecoach, which also has a huge bus division, currently operates the East Midlands rail franchise between London St Pancras International and destinations including Leicester, Derby, Sheffield, Nottingham, Manchester and Liverpool. As well as its stake in Virgin Rail, Stagecoach also runs the Sheffield Supertram. Stagecoach's East Coast franchise was renationalised last year following poor performance and mounting losses.

"Jack Shepherd told the BBC he regretted going on the run Jack Shepherd, who was found guilty of killing a woman in a speedboat crash on the River Thames, has arrived in the UK to finish his extradition from Georgia. He fled before the trial which convicted him of the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown. Speaking to the BBC on-board a plane at Tbilisi International Airport, Shepherd said he regretted going on the run and did so through ""animalistic fear"". He arrived at Gatwick Airport at 21:20 BST. He was taken from Gatwick by Metropolitan Police officers ahead of his court appearance later. After months in hiding in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, he handed himself into police in January and was jailed for three months whilehis extradition was arranged by the British and Georgian authorities. Jack Shepherd was held at a prison in Tbilisi, Georgia, after handing himself in Speaking in Georgia before he left for the UK, Shepherd said: ""I am terribly sorry for my involvement in Charlotte's death and subsequent actions which have made things worse and I'd like to make amends for that. ""I ran for fear. It wasn't premeditated, it was just a case of being driven by an animalistic fear and jumping on a plane with not much of a plan.""

"The report said eight students had sought help for mental health problems A report into the death of 14 students who had taken their own lives found eight had already sought help for mental health issues. The University of the West of England (UWE) report stated the deaths were mostly among white male students whose average age was 21. Half of the group had also resat exams or ""submitted extenuating circumstances forms"" during their university time. UWE's vice-chancellor said the suicide rate was lower than ""in communities"". Steve West added: ""In many ways, looking at Office for National Statistics data, it's safer to come to university than actually to remain in a local community."" The deaths investigated in the UWE report range from 2010 to the summer of 2018 and do not include deaths at Bristol's other university. It was released as a partnership with Public Health England following concern over the numbers of death nationally. One student, Elisa, said her first year at UWE was difficult but that the second year out of halls of residence was harder. She said when she was in private accommodation she could not get the help she needed. ""My mum reached out for help [from the university] but didn't get it,"" she added. Steve West claimed it was safer to come to university than ""remain in a local community"" While the report has not recommended actions it has highlighted issues which could help identify students at risk. Those included people transferring from other courses, students repeating a year's studies, and some who had problems with debt, all of which should be seen as ""possible flags"", it said. Other issues that could show ""students in need"" included alcohol and substance misuse and relationship breakdowns. Three of the students had previously self-harmed or attempted to take their own lives, the report said. In two cases the report said greater ""skills and confidence"" among students to highlight ""severe cause for concern"" might have helped. Jo Midgley, a UWE chancellor, said the university had now started to intervene earlier when people spotted problems. ""When we contacted students, 50% of those who we contacted because it looked as if something wasn't quite right actually did need some additional help,"" she said. This video can not be played Students at both UWE and Bristol University talk openly about their mental health struggles (Video: Arthur Cauty) The investigation said there was no cluster identified, and that one of the 14 included was no longer registered with the university at the time of their death. Another student's inquest recorded a narrative verdict rather than that of suicide, but both were still included within the report. The report also warned that it was ""based on a small sample size, rendering it difficult to draw clear conclusions"". The National Union of Students said a range of help methods had been put in place to help students. ""The mental health of our students is extremely important to us, so we are continuing to work closely with the University on joint initiatives to support students in this area,"" they said. Students open up on mental health in film Call for data change after student death Student had 'no support' before death The report comes after at least 13 students in Bristol are thought to have taken their own lives since 2016. Many of those students were from UWE's neighbouring establishment, the University of Bristol. Figures from the Office for National Statistics for 2017 - the most recent available - show at least 95 university students in England or Wales took their own lives across the year.

"The babies had been in the intensive care unit at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital A third baby has died after contracting a rare blood infection at a maternity hospital in Glasgow. In January it was revealed that two extremely premature babies had died at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the third child was extremely poorly at the time of birth and that a rare strain of Staphylococcus aureus infection was one of a number of factors in the death. No further patients have tested positive for the infection since March. A spokesperson for the health board said a total of four babies at the hospital had contracted the infection, but one was successfully treated and was discharged from the hospital. Two babies die after blood infection Do hospitals make you sick? Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that is found on the skin and in the nasal passage of about one in four people, and only causes infection when it enters the body. It is one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired infections - but the type 11164 strain which infected the babies at the Princess Royal is highly resistant to the two antibiotics that are normally prescribed. It is also resistant to the skin cleaning agent routinely used in hospitals across the UK. In January, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed that a third child was receiving treatment after also contracting the blood stream infection following the deaths of the two babies. At the time they set up an incident management team (IMT) to investigate the cases. An IMT comprises specialist clinicians, infection control doctors and nurses, occupational health clinicians and colleagues from estates and facilities. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has said the source of the infection may never be known In a statement issued on Wednesday, the health board said: ""As previously reported, we have been rigorously managing a number of cases of a rare Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection in extremely premature babies in the neonatal unit of the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital. ""Three babies, who were extremely poorly due to their very early birth, sadly died and infection was one of a number of contributing causes in their deaths."" Babies born before 28 weeks gestation are described as extremely premature. The health authority said a programme of staff and family screening was carried out at the hospital as part of a number of steps being taken to respond to the infection. They added: ""As this was an extremely rare strain, which is highly resistant to the two antibiotics normally prescribed for S. Aureus and the skin cleaning agent routinely used in hospitals across the UK, we put in place a number of further infection control measures including the prescribing of different antibiotics and the introduction of a new skin cleaning agent."" The hospital, which has not revealed when the baby died, said that the source of the infection in the intensive care unit may never be known. Staphylococcus Aureus is a bacteria commonly found on the skin 24 January:  An incident management team is set up after staphylococcus aureus bacterium is detected in the neonatal unit at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital. A deep clean subsequently takes place. 31 January: NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) confirms it is investigating three cases - two of the ""extremely premature"" babies had died and the infection was ""one of a number of contributing causes"". The third premature baby requires treatment and is in a stable condition. 22 Feb: The health board confirms the babies had been infected with a rare strain of the staphylococcus aureus bacterium - 11164. The board says four other babies were found to have the type 11164 strain on their skin, but had not been infected. 10 April: The death of a third baby is reported by NHSGGC.

"More rail passengers are getting the option to use paperless tickets, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) has said. Major stations are having the infrastructure for smart ticketing installed, with nine in 10 journeys ""soon"" available in this format, RDG, which represents rail firms, said. Smart tickets can be bought online and stored on smartphones or smartcards. Consumer group Which? said the plans were a ""positive step"" but ""long overdue"". The process has required a rollout of new technology across the network, with recent upgrades at Waterloo, Edinburgh Waverley and Gatwick Airport stations. This will be followed by new readers and computer software at Blackfriars, Watford Junction, City Thameslink, London Bridge, East Croydon and Shenfield. Paperless rail tickets 'across UK by 2019' Reality Check: Where does your train fare go? Train firms want overhaul of ticket system Robert Nisbet, regional director at the Rail Delivery Group, said: ""Together, rail companies are going full steam ahead with smart ticketing, with passengers increasingly able to use their phones or smartcards thanks to station upgrades across the network. ""Of course, we want to go further, but realising the full benefits of new ticketing technology requires regulatory reform of the wider fares system. That's why train companies are working with government to update the rules that underpin our rail fares."" According to RDG: 22% of journeys in 2018 were made using tickets bought online Paper equating to the distance from London to Edinburgh and back was saved in the first two months of 2019 thanks to paperless tickets Smart ticketing makes compensation for delayed or cancelled journeys easier Which? managing director of public markets Alex Hayman said: ""This long overdue rollout of smart ticketing across the rail network is a positive step towards making journeys simpler and improving passengers' experience. ""Last year train companies failed to resolve a quarter of a million compensation claims on time and too many people miss out on getting back the compensation they are owed for delays and cancellations."" He said plans to link smart ticketing to one-click compensation did not ""go far enough"". The Labour Party also has doubts that the ambitions for smart ticketing can be achieved. ""There are more than 50 million different types of train ticket across the railway and smart tickets will do little to solve that confusion,"" said Labour's shadow rail minister Rachael Maskell. ""The government and industry are deluding themselves if they think they are anywhere near meeting their own targets for 'smart ticketing'"".

"This video can not be played Ahead of meeting EU leaders, the UK PM is asked what she will do if they only grant a long extension. Theresa May is waiting to hear the decision of the other 27 EU leaders, who are discussing her request for a short delay to Brexit. The PM wants to move the UK's exit date from Friday to 30 June - but leaders are split over the length of delay. Seventeen member states so far favour a long extension, including Germany, while France wants a short delay. Reuters reports that the French president told the summit a delay beyond 30 June would jeopardise the EU. A no-deal Brexit was not the worst option and the EU would run a higher risk if the UK obstructed EU operations, a French official is reported to have said. The PM spoke for about an hour at the summit, before leaving the room to leave the EU leaders to discuss her request. All the leaders have spoken and had a break, and they will now each speak for a second time. The EU member states have to reach a unanimous decision by law. Allow Twitter content?

"Researchers at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh have developed a new formula to quickly calculate the temperature of a black hole. They say it is simple and powerful, and offers fundamental insights into space and time. The formula owes its origin to observations made on the Union Canal near Edinburgh 185 years ago. The idea that black holes have temperatures at all came as something of a surprise to researchers. They have so much mass and exert a gravitational pull so strong that nothing - not even heat or light - was expected to escape. Professor Stephen Hawking predicted black holes would emit thermal radiation However, Professor Stephen Hawking changed that. In 1974, at the age of just 32, he proposed the concept of what is now called Hawking radiation. He predicted black holes would emit thermal radiation and gradually evaporate. This is still at the frontiers of theory, with different schools of thought on the exact process. One major issue is calculating how much radiation a black hole gives out. Accuracy has proved elusive. Complex calculations have produced contradictory answers. At Heriot-Watt, Dr Fabio Biancalana and his colleagues have come up with their new formula to quickly and precisely calculate the Hawking radiation temperature from any kind of black hole. Dr Biancalala says they tested it against all published types of black holes - whether static, rotating, charged or even more exotic - and it always produced the exact Hawking temperature. A coffee mug and a doughnut are the same in topological terms The key is the mathematical discipline of topology. It deals with the properties of space - and not just outer space. Topology treats things according to the fundamental properties they possess, even if they are bent, crushed, folded or otherwise deformed. Tearing, cutting, gluing or poking holes would be cheating. One celebrated example is a coffee mug and a doughnut. In topological terms, they are the same. That's because each is a lump of stuff with a single hole in it. In theory you could even squish the mug into the shape of a doughnut if you fancied (provided you didn't mind how it tasted). ""We discovered that only the topology of black holes matters when it comes to determining Hawking radiation,"" says Dr Biancalana. ""Not the size, not the electric charge, the spacetime in which they are embedded, or how they spin around their axis. ""Black holes can be physically very different, but if they have the same topology they will emit the same amount of Hawking radiation."" In effect the new formula counts the holes of a black hole and the spacetime that surrounds it (yes, even black holes have holes in them). This information is enough to determine the temperature. Dr Biancalana calls it a ""magic formula"". ""For years scientists have been theorising about four dimensions and whether space has more dimensions we are still ignorant of, and now we know only two dimensions really matter in the description of all these astronomical monsters."" Which leads us to the banks of the Union Canal, not too far from the Heriot-Watt campus on the outskirts of Edinburgh. It was there that the Scottish engineer John Scott Russell first described what he called a ""wave of translation"" - a solitary wave that kept its shape while travelling at a constant speed. He hoped his work would lead to a better canal barge. These days - now called solitons - these waves are important in laser physics and fibre optics. The Heriot-Watt team realised that, as solitons and black holes shared identical mathematical properties, Hawking radiation would follow the same rules. Dr Biancalana says it takes us a step closer to understanding how the universe works. ""This must mean something fundamental about space and time,"" he says. ""Now we just need to find out what.""

"Prof Hawking says that physical information could be stored on a black hole's ""event horizon"" Black holes preserve information about the stuff that falls into them, according to Prof Stephen Hawking. Physicists have long argued about what happens to information about the physical state of things that are swallowed up by black holes. This information was thought to be destroyed, but it turned out that this violated laws of quantum physics. Prof Hawking now says the information may not make it into the black hole at all, but is held on its boundary. In broad terms, black holes are regions in space where the gravity is so strong that nothing that gets pulled in - even light - can escape. At the same time, the laws of quantum mechanics dictate that everything in our world can be broken down into information, for example, a string of 1s and 0s. And according to those laws, this information should never disappear, not even if it gets sucked into a black hole. But according to Einstein's theory of general relativity, the information must be destroyed. This quandary is known as the information paradox. Prof Hawking believes the information doesn't make it inside the black hole at all. ""The information is not stored in the interior of the black hole as one might expect, but in its boundary - the event horizon,""he told a conference,externalat the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden. The event horizon is a boundary, or point of no return, where escape from the gravitational pull of the black hole becomes impossible. Contrary to Einstein's picture, black holes may not have an ""inside"" Hawking has been working with Cambridge colleague Prof Malcolm Perry and Harvard professor Andrew Strominger on the problem. They believe that information at the event horizon is transformed into a 2D hologram - a phenomenon known as a super translation. ""The idea is the super translations are a hologram of the ingoing particles,"" Hawking explained. ""Thus, they contain all the information that would otherwise be lost."" Prof Marika Taylor, a theoretical physicist at the University of Southampton, told BBC News: ""Einstein's theory says that matter gets sucked into the black hole, falling behind its event horizon. ""Holography seems to suggest that Einstein's picture of black holes isn't right. In particular, it's not clear that there is actually an 'inside' to black holes at all - matter which gets sucked in might get stuck at the event horizon and hang around as a hologram there."" But she added that there was no consensus on this. On the question of matter getting stuck at the event horizon, she said: ""Nobody really understands the details of how this happens - this is what Hawking is trying to work out and what other related ideas 'fuzzball' and 'firewall' explore too."" There's currently little additional detail on the maths behind Prof Hawking's talk, but he and his collaborators plan to publish a scientific paper in coming weeks. Light particles - or photons - can be emitted from black holes due to quantum fluctuations, a concept known as Hawking radiation. Information from the black hole might be able to escape via this route. But, Prof Hawking says it would be in ""chaotic, useless form,"" adding: ""For all practical purposes the information is lost."" If the information was not in this chaotic form, an observer might be able to reconstruct everything that had fallen into the black hole if they were able to wait for a vast amount of time.

"The babies had been in the intensive care unit at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital A third baby has died after contracting a rare blood infection at a maternity hospital in Glasgow. In January it was revealed that two extremely premature babies had died at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said the third child was extremely poorly at the time of birth and that a rare strain of Staphylococcus aureus infection was one of a number of factors in the death. No further patients have tested positive for the infection since March. A spokesperson for the health board said a total of four babies at the hospital had contracted the infection, but one was successfully treated and was discharged from the hospital. Two babies die after blood infection Do hospitals make you sick? Staphylococcus aureus is a bacterium that is found on the skin and in the nasal passage of about one in four people, and only causes infection when it enters the body. It is one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired infections - but the type 11164 strain which infected the babies at the Princess Royal is highly resistant to the two antibiotics that are normally prescribed. It is also resistant to the skin cleaning agent routinely used in hospitals across the UK. In January, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed that a third child was receiving treatment after also contracting the blood stream infection following the deaths of the two babies. At the time they set up an incident management team (IMT) to investigate the cases. An IMT comprises specialist clinicians, infection control doctors and nurses, occupational health clinicians and colleagues from estates and facilities. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has said the source of the infection may never be known In a statement issued on Wednesday, the health board said: ""As previously reported, we have been rigorously managing a number of cases of a rare Staphylococcus aureus blood stream infection in extremely premature babies in the neonatal unit of the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital. ""Three babies, who were extremely poorly due to their very early birth, sadly died and infection was one of a number of contributing causes in their deaths."" Babies born before 28 weeks gestation are described as extremely premature. The health authority said a programme of staff and family screening was carried out at the hospital as part of a number of steps being taken to respond to the infection. They added: ""As this was an extremely rare strain, which is highly resistant to the two antibiotics normally prescribed for S. Aureus and the skin cleaning agent routinely used in hospitals across the UK, we put in place a number of further infection control measures including the prescribing of different antibiotics and the introduction of a new skin cleaning agent."" The hospital, which has not revealed when the baby died, said that the source of the infection in the intensive care unit may never be known. Staphylococcus Aureus is a bacteria commonly found on the skin 24 January:  An incident management team is set up after staphylococcus aureus bacterium is detected in the neonatal unit at the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital. A deep clean subsequently takes place. 31 January: NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) confirms it is investigating three cases - two of the ""extremely premature"" babies had died and the infection was ""one of a number of contributing causes"". The third premature baby requires treatment and is in a stable condition. 22 Feb: The health board confirms the babies had been infected with a rare strain of the staphylococcus aureus bacterium - 11164. The board says four other babies were found to have the type 11164 strain on their skin, but had not been infected. 10 April: The death of a third baby is reported by NHSGGC.

"The report said eight students had sought help for mental health problems A report into the death of 14 students who had taken their own lives found eight had already sought help for mental health issues. The University of the West of England (UWE) report stated the deaths were mostly among white male students whose average age was 21. Half of the group had also resat exams or ""submitted extenuating circumstances forms"" during their university time. UWE's vice-chancellor said the suicide rate was lower than ""in communities"". Steve West added: ""In many ways, looking at Office for National Statistics data, it's safer to come to university than actually to remain in a local community."" The deaths investigated in the UWE report range from 2010 to the summer of 2018 and do not include deaths at Bristol's other university. It was released as a partnership with Public Health England following concern over the numbers of death nationally. One student, Elisa, said her first year at UWE was difficult but that the second year out of halls of residence was harder. She said when she was in private accommodation she could not get the help she needed. ""My mum reached out for help [from the university] but didn't get it,"" she added. Steve West claimed it was safer to come to university than ""remain in a local community"" While the report has not recommended actions it has highlighted issues which could help identify students at risk. Those included people transferring from other courses, students repeating a year's studies, and some who had problems with debt, all of which should be seen as ""possible flags"", it said. Other issues that could show ""students in need"" included alcohol and substance misuse and relationship breakdowns. Three of the students had previously self-harmed or attempted to take their own lives, the report said. In two cases the report said greater ""skills and confidence"" among students to highlight ""severe cause for concern"" might have helped. Jo Midgley, a UWE chancellor, said the university had now started to intervene earlier when people spotted problems. ""When we contacted students, 50% of those who we contacted because it looked as if something wasn't quite right actually did need some additional help,"" she said. This video can not be played Students at both UWE and Bristol University talk openly about their mental health struggles (Video: Arthur Cauty) The investigation said there was no cluster identified, and that one of the 14 included was no longer registered with the university at the time of their death. Another student's inquest recorded a narrative verdict rather than that of suicide, but both were still included within the report. The report also warned that it was ""based on a small sample size, rendering it difficult to draw clear conclusions"". The National Union of Students said a range of help methods had been put in place to help students. ""The mental health of our students is extremely important to us, so we are continuing to work closely with the University on joint initiatives to support students in this area,"" they said. Students open up on mental health in film Call for data change after student death Student had 'no support' before death The report comes after at least 13 students in Bristol are thought to have taken their own lives since 2016. Many of those students were from UWE's neighbouring establishment, the University of Bristol. Figures from the Office for National Statistics for 2017 - the most recent available - show at least 95 university students in England or Wales took their own lives across the year.

"More rail passengers are getting the option to use paperless tickets, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) has said. Major stations are having the infrastructure for smart ticketing installed, with nine in 10 journeys ""soon"" available in this format, RDG, which represents rail firms, said. Smart tickets can be bought online and stored on smartphones or smartcards. Consumer group Which? said the plans were a ""positive step"" but ""long overdue"". The process has required a rollout of new technology across the network, with recent upgrades at Waterloo, Edinburgh Waverley and Gatwick Airport stations. This will be followed by new readers and computer software at Blackfriars, Watford Junction, City Thameslink, London Bridge, East Croydon and Shenfield. Paperless rail tickets 'across UK by 2019' Reality Check: Where does your train fare go? Train firms want overhaul of ticket system Robert Nisbet, regional director at the Rail Delivery Group, said: ""Together, rail companies are going full steam ahead with smart ticketing, with passengers increasingly able to use their phones or smartcards thanks to station upgrades across the network. ""Of course, we want to go further, but realising the full benefits of new ticketing technology requires regulatory reform of the wider fares system. That's why train companies are working with government to update the rules that underpin our rail fares."" According to RDG: 22% of journeys in 2018 were made using tickets bought online Paper equating to the distance from London to Edinburgh and back was saved in the first two months of 2019 thanks to paperless tickets Smart ticketing makes compensation for delayed or cancelled journeys easier Which? managing director of public markets Alex Hayman said: ""This long overdue rollout of smart ticketing across the rail network is a positive step towards making journeys simpler and improving passengers' experience. ""Last year train companies failed to resolve a quarter of a million compensation claims on time and too many people miss out on getting back the compensation they are owed for delays and cancellations."" He said plans to link smart ticketing to one-click compensation did not ""go far enough"". The Labour Party also has doubts that the ambitions for smart ticketing can be achieved. ""There are more than 50 million different types of train ticket across the railway and smart tickets will do little to solve that confusion,"" said Labour's shadow rail minister Rachael Maskell. ""The government and industry are deluding themselves if they think they are anywhere near meeting their own targets for 'smart ticketing'"".

"The plant at Sullom Voe takes North Sea gas and pipes it to the national gas grid The operators of the Shetland Gas Plant have been given four months to show its shift patterns for workers are safe. The Health and Safety Executive has served the improvement notice on the French oil company Total. It said Total had failed to demonstrate that it had properly assessed potential fatigue risk arising from current or proposed shift patterns at Sullom Voe. Shift patterns at the plant have also been subject to an ongoing industrial dispute with the Unite union. The HSE said no specified risks to safety had been identified, but the workers involved were employed in environments where mistakes could lead to major accidents. Total has been given until the end of August to carry out the risk assessment and mitigate any threat to the safety of workers or the environment that may arise. The current shift pattern of two weeks on, three weeks off rota and proposals to change that to three weeks on, three off, three on, four off rota, are to be assessed. The Unite union welcomed the report and said it showed Total ""must take immediate steps to scrap these new rotas and return to safe working practices"". Spokesman John Clark said: ""We have consistently highlighted that issues such as ill-health and fatigue induced by long hours and periods of work could result in major incidents. ""However, Unite's concerns have been completely ignored by industry and new contracts have instead been imposed on the offshore workforce."" A spokesman for Total said the company was ""committed to ensuring that shift working patterns at the Shetland Gas Plant (SGP) are safe"". He added: ""We are in the process of thoroughly assessing the proposed work patterns in accordance with our procedures, with a focus on the specific conditions at the SGP and on fatigue risk management. ""Provided fatigue risks are adequately controlled, we believe that the proposed work pattern will enhance safety. ""We will continue to work with the HSE, our safety representatives and affected personnel in order to ensure that any fatigue risks are adequately managed and controlled."" The Shetland Gas Plant is said by operator Total to be capable of supplying energy to two million homes. The plant at Sullom Voe began processing gas from the vast Laggan and Tormore fields, north west of Shetland, in February 2016. A pipeline takes the gas to the UK mainland and into the national gas grid.

"The PM wants to postpone Brexit until 30 June - but the EU is expected to want a longer delay EU leaders will meet at 17:00 BST for an emergency summit in Brussels to decide whether to offer the UK another delay to Brexit. Theresa May wants to postpone the UK's exit beyond this Friday, until 30 June. But the EU is expected to offer a longer delay, after European Council President Donald Tusk urged the other 27 leaders to back a flexible extension of up to a year - with conditions. Mr Tusk added that ""neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated"". Leaders will begin arriving at the summit from 16:00. A really simple guide to Brexit Brexit explained in flowcharts Why a long Brexit extension worries Europe Kuenssberg: Brexit delay proves lesser evil for May Earlier, Mrs May appeared in the Commons for the weekly question session with opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn atPrime Minister's Questions. That head-to-head followed five days of talks between the government and Labour officials aimed at breaking the Brexit impasse. The 1922 Committee - made up of Tory backbench MPs - will also meet at 17:00, with some members seeking a firm date for Mrs May to step down as leader of the party. The UK is currently due to leave the EU at 23:00 BST on Friday, 12 April. If no extension is granted, the default position would be for the UK to leave on Friday without a deal. So far, UK MPs have rejected the withdrawal agreement Mrs May reached with other European leaders last year. But the Commons has also voted against leaving in a no-deal scenario. To prevent this happening, a group of backbench MPs managed to get a bill through Parliament to force Mrs May to ask for an extension to Article 50 - the process that defines the UK exit date - by law. This video can not be played Former Labour minister Yvette Cooper's bill passed by 313 votes to 312 Mrs May will ask EU leaders to extend the exit date until 30 June. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM had to convince EU leaders about the credibility of talks with Labour and prove they were ""a genuine political plan that has a chance of getting the UK out of this maze"". Every EU member state needs to agree on any delay before it can be granted. So, at the summit - which begins at about 18:00 local time (17:00 BST) on Wednesday evening - Mrs May will formally present her case for a short delay, with the option for the UK to leave earlier if her Brexit deal is ratified. The other EU leaders will then have dinner without her and discuss how to respond. EU Council President Donald Tusk and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker are expected to make statements afterwards. In a formal letter to the leaders on the eve of the summit, Mr Tusk proposed a longer, flexible extension - although ""no longer than one year"" - to avoid creating more cliff-edge extensions or emergency summits in the future. Any delay should have conditions attached, he said - including that there would be no reopening of the withdrawal agreement talks. And the UK would have the option to leave earlier if a Brexit deal was ratified. France's Emmanuel Macron and the EU's Donald Tusk gesture for Mrs May to join a group photo at the EU summit last month Referring to Mrs May's proposal for an extension until the end of June, Mr Tusk said there was ""little reason to believe"" that Mrs May's deal could be ratified by then. And if the European Council did not agree on an extension at all, ""there would be a risk of an accidental no-deal Brexit"", he added. Mr Tusk also warned that ""neither side should be allowed to feel humiliated at any stage in this difficult process"". What happens now? Brexit explained in flowcharts Brexit Basics: The customs union Video: John Bercow's Brexit stardom EU officials have also prepared a draft document for the leaders to discuss at the summit - but the end date of the delay has been left blank for the EU leaders to fill in once deliberations have ended. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said the blank space showed EU leaders were still divided on the issue. The draft document from EU officials leaves the date of an extension blank BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said ""much has been spelled out in advance"", including the condition that if the UK remains a member of the EU at the end of May it will have to hold elections to the European Parliament or be forced to leave immediately. He added that, during the delay, the UK would be expected to commit to not disrupting EU business, such as the preparation of the next budget, and its influence ""would be sharply reduced and its voice muted"". Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay said neither he nor the PM wanted to see a longer extension, but it was a possibility because MPs had not backed Mrs May's deal. This video can not be played Steve Barclay blames Parliament for the delays to Brexit But others have called for the UK to leave the EU on Friday without an agreement. Tory Brexiteer Anne Marie Morris told BBC News that exiting on World Trade Organisation rules - the default if the UK leaves without an agreement - was ""actually a very good deal"" for the country. Other Leave-supporting backbenchers are seeking an exit day for Mrs May,after she vowed to step down ahead of the second phase of Brexit negotiations. Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith said although the PM had ""hinged"" her resignation on MPs supporting her deal, the ""reality"" is her ""firm date of departure"" should be in May or June. ""To have a leadership contest in the Conservative Party is going to take the better part of 10 to 11 weeks, and that will take you to the autumn, so this thing is going to have to happen,"" he told the BBC. But some in Westminster back a longer extension, saying it would give time for another referendum to take place. The People's Vote campaign held a rally on Tuesday to drum up support, with former Speaker of the House, Baroness Boothroyd, calling for a public ballot. This video can not be played People's Vote: Betty Boothroyd says ""nobody voted for this mess"" Talks between Labour and the Conservatives are scheduled to resume after Mrs May returns from the summit. The Brexit Secretary, Stephen Barclay, said holding talks with the opposition was ""contrary to the normal tradition"", but they were taking place ""in good faith"". A Labour spokesman said the discussions were being conducted ""in a serious, detailed, and engaged way"", but they had ""yet to see clear evidence of real change and compromise that would be necessary to find agreement"". If the two sides do not come to an agreement, the PM has said she will put a number of options on a way forward to Parliament and make the votes binding. Brexit Basics: The backstop.

"Jonathan Kotler with Billy the Badger, Fulham FC's mascot, outside Craven Cottage stadium in west London A Fulham FC fan living in California is suing a state agency after he was banned from having the letters COYW on a personalised car number plate, as they feared the slogan ""Come on you whites"" had racist connotations. University professor Jonathan Kotler said he was ""shocked"" at the decision. Launching his legal case, he claimed the decision by the California Department of Motor Vehicles violated his right to freedom of speech. ""It's just a shirt colour,"" he said. ""The people at the DMV are either extra thick or very PC."" Prof Kotler applied for a plate that would read COY-W - an abbreviation of the slogan commonly used by Fulham football fans - and a hashtag seen every weekend on many Twitter posts about the club. The 73-year-old, who was born in New Jersey and now lives in Calabasas, California, has been a fan of Fulham FC for decades, after watching a match ""by happenchance"" during a visit to London. He was originally a fan of both Manchester United and Fulham, but chose his current allegiance in 2006 when both teams were in the Premier League. Prof Kotler's plate currently reads FFC SW6 for the club's initials and stadium postcode Prof Kotler, who teaches media law at the University of Southern California, put in his application for the number plate last year and had to include the reasons for his choice of letters, but it was turned down. The Department of Motor Vehicles said the COYW slogan could be considered hostile, insulting, or racially degrading, according to the US federal legal case. ""I sent them tons of material,"" Prof Kotler told the BBC. ""Press releases, stories from the British media, letters from the chairman who uses 'come on you whites'. ""I pointed out that many clubs in Britain are known by their colour - the blues, the clarets. Nobody thought the Liverpool reds were communists."" He added: ""Even when I did it, it was the furthest thing from my mind that anyone would object to it. I was shocked, absolutely."" He said the club's owner, Shahid Khan,""uses the phrase all the time"".,external ""Half of the team are non-white. And it's just a shirt colour. It's got nothing to do with anything other than that. ""I decided this is crazy, this is enough. I can take it up to a point but this became personal."" Prof Kotler said he travels to watch Fulham play in Britain on average around eight to 10 times a season, often taking the 11-hour flight on a Thursday and returning back in the US by Tuesday ready to teach his students. In his legal complaint, he is asking the court to declare the DMV's criteria for personalised licence plates unconstitutional. He claims he has been deprived of his right to freedom of speech. The Department of Motor Vehicles says it does not comment on pending legal cases. Plates will be refused if they carry any configuration deemed ""offensive to good taste and decency"", including: sexual connotations, or terms of lust or depravity vulgar terms, terms of contempt, prejudice or hostility, insulting or degrading terms, racially or ethnically degrading terms Swear words or terms considered profane, obscene or repulsive configurations with a negative connotation to a specific group configurations misrepresenting a law enforcement entity foreign or slang words, or phonetic spellings or mirror images of words falling into the above categories The number 69 is reserved for cars made in 1969.

"Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson says his train business could disappear from the UK after its partner Stagecoach was barred from three rail franchise bids. Sir Richard, whose Virgin Trains is 49% owned by Stagecoach, said he was ""devastated"" by the disqualification. The Department for Transport (DfT) disallowed the bids because they did not meet pensions rules. Virgin was bidding to renew the West Coast franchise in partnership with Stagecoach and France's SNCF. Stagecoach had also applied for the East Midlands and South Eastern franchises, both of which have been rejected. Ina blog on Virgin's corporate website,external, Sir Richard said Virgin Trains ""could be gone from the UK in November"". ""We're baffled why the DfT did not tell us that we would be disqualified or even discuss the issue - they have known about this qualification in our bid on pensions for months,"" he wrote. ""The pensions regulator has warned that more cash will be needed in the future, but no one knows how big that bill might eventually be and no responsible company could take that risk with pensions. ""We can't accept a risk we can't manage - this would have been reckless. This is an industry-wide issue and forcing rail companies to take these risks could lead to the failure of more rail franchises."" The deadline for bids is now closed, so any reopening of the process seems unlikely. There are thought to be two remaining bids left for the West Coast franchise. However, the DfT said Stagecoach - had ""repeatedly ignored established rules"" and that other bidders had met its requirements.The DfT's statement does not mention Virgin Trains.,external The DfT also announced that the East Midlands franchise had now been awarded to Abellio ""after they presented a strong, compliant bid"". Martin Griffiths, chief executive of Stagecoach, has called for an ""urgent meeting"" with the DfT. Mr Griffiths said in a statement:,external""We are extremely concerned at both the DfT's decision and its timing. The department has had full knowledge of these bids for a lengthy period and we are seeking an urgent meeting to discuss our significant concerns."" Bidders for the franchises have been asked to bear full long-term funding risk on relevant sections of the Railways Pension Scheme, Stagecoach said. The Pensions Regulator has estimated the UK rail industry needs an additional Â£5-6bn to plug the pensions shortfall, and the company said it was being asked to take on risks it ""cannot control and manage"". Rail firms have called on the government to help make up the pensions deficit. Mr Griffiths said: ""Forcing rail companies to take these risks could lead to the failure of more rail franchises and cannot be in the best long-term interests of either customers, employees, taxpayers or the investors the railway needs for it to prosper."" It was, he said, ""more evidence that the current franchising model is not fit for purpose"" and ""further damages the already fragile investor confidence in the UK rail market"". Stagecoach had bid independently for the East Midlands franchise, had intended to partner with Alstom for the South Eastern operations, and was jointly bidding for the West Coast Partnership with Virgin and SNCF. Stagecoach shares fell 9.3% in Wednesday trading. A DfT spokesman said: ""Stagecoach is an experienced bidder and fully aware of the rules of franchise competitions. It is regrettable that they submitted non-compliant bids for all current competitions which breached established rules and, in doing so, they are responsible for their own disqualification. ""Stagecoach chose to propose significant changes to the commercial terms for the East Midlands, West Coast Partnership and South Eastern contracts, leading to bids which proposed a significantly different deal to the ones on offer. While Stagecoach has played an important role in the UK railways industry, ""it is entirely for Stagecoach and their bidding partners to explain why they decided to repeatedly ignore established rules by rejecting the commercial terms on offer"". Stagecoach, which also has a huge bus division, currently operates the East Midlands rail franchise between London St Pancras International and destinations including Leicester, Derby, Sheffield, Nottingham, Manchester and Liverpool. As well as its stake in Virgin Rail, Stagecoach also runs the Sheffield Supertram. Stagecoach's East Coast franchise was renationalised last year following poor performance and mounting losses.

"Amsterdam is well known for its De Wallen red light area, but campaigners say the prostitutes are exploited A petition is to be handed into the Dutch parliament demanding that visiting a prostitute be made illegal. Some 42,000 young people have added their signatures, which means the issue will be debated by politicians in a country that has some of the most relaxed laws around paying for sex. ""I am priceless"" is the name of the social media-led campaign. Activists want buyers to be penalised, under the so-called Nordic model. Partly inspired by Christian and feminist views, the group have posted Instagram photos showing supporters clasping boards with words in black and white bearing the message ""Ik ben onbetaalbaar"" (I'm priceless) along with ""what if it was your sister?"" and ""prostitution is both a cause and consequence of inequality"".

However, in response to the images, one person wrote: ""I'm a voluntary sex worker. There's many people like me. This campaign will make my job much, much more dangerous."" In the Netherlands, buying and selling sex is legal,externalas long as it involves ""sex between consenting adults"". Under the Nordic model, adopted by Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Northern Ireland and France, buyers are penalised. Read Anna Holligan's report from Amsterdam's red light zone here The young activists argue more should be done to protect vulnerable women. According to the ""I am priceless"" petition, the Netherlands' facilitation of the sex industry is outdated, exploitative and the Dutch should look to countries like Sweden for inspiration. They say countries in which the model has been introduced have seen: fewer people going to buy sex the country becoming less attractive for human traffickers fewer people being exploited by prostitution. Among the founders of the Exxpose movement behind the petition is social worker Sara Lous,external, who used to work in a rehabilitation centre with former sex workers. ""We are feminists and Christians and some of us are neutral,"" she says. France outlaws paying for sex The ""I am priceless"" campaigners say their proposal would stop people buying sex legally ""The idea is of course that the Netherlands has a safer policy, that decriminalising is safer and it's a freedom to sell sex. But so much is going wrong. we have so much human trafficking and Amsterdam is most vulnerable because of the high demand for cheap sex."" She argues that women are given a signal that prostitution is an easy way to make money, whereas they need to have other options. ""There are only a few who are incapable of finding another job. They should have help to find other skills,"" she says. Amsterdam's Red Light Zone is one of the capital's most popular attractions, in a country where prostitution has been traditionally framed as a reflection of the value placed on freedom of choice. ""If a women wants to sell her body then that's her choice,"" is an argument pushed by politicians and public alike. The Dutch coalition government has pledged to provide more funds to help women seeking to leave prostitution Women working behind the red light windows have told me it is their free choice - but deeper conversations reveal it's often based on circumstances which they felt left them with no alternative. They include single mothers struggling to ensure that their children in Romania receive a decent education, and young women who have experienced abuse, leaving them with low self-esteem. But Foxxy, a board member on the sex-workers' collective Proud, warns that any attempt to criminalise clients would harm the prostitutes themselves. ""This petition is not in the sex workers' interest. It's people who read the Bible who are trying to stop us,"" she argues. ""If this happens sex workers will work illegally. Then we're more likely to be victims of violence. Clients will know we can't go to the police. We will be much more at risk, clients will try to take condoms off, we're more at risk of being exposed to HIV. It happened in France when they started this Nordic model."" In response to the petition, a justice ministry spokesman told the BBC thatthe government had plans to step up measures against human trafficking,externalas well as provide funds to help sex workers trying to leave prostitution. The plans were going into consultation and would be put to parliament later this year, he said. But any drastic overturn of the Netherlands' current liberal laws will face opposition from those in politics and society who see prostitution as a symbol of freedom rather than repression.

"Shares in drugmaker Indivior plunged 71% after the US Department of Justice charged it with fraudulent marketing. Afederal grand jury in Virginia,externalaccused Indivior of a ""truly shameful scheme to put profits over the health and well-being of patients"". It alleged the firm conducted an illicit scheme to increase sales of Suboxone Film, an opioid drug used to treat opioid addiction. Indivior has issued aneight-page rebuttal,externalcontesting the charges. The company, which calls itself the world leader in addiction treatment, is listed in London, with a research centre in Hull and a US headquarters. The Department of Justice (DoJ) has demanded at least $3bn in fines.Indivior had a market valueof Â£202m after the collapse of its shares on Wednesday. Indivior's research centre opened in Hull in 2017 Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt said: ""Indivior promoted it with a disregard for the truth about its safety and despite known risks of diversion and abuse."" According to the indictment, Indivior ""obtained billions of dollars in revenue from Suboxone Film prescriptions by deceiving health care providers and health care benefit programmes into believing that Suboxone Film was safer, less divertible, and less abusable than other opioid-addiction treatment drugs"". It said Indivior ""lacked any scientific evidence to support those claims"". Indivior said: ""Put simply, Indivior is not a contributor to the opioid epidemic. Rather, as acknowledged by government experts at the FDA [Food and Drug Administration]and CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], its medicines are a key part of combatting it. ""Key allegations made by the Justice Department are contradicted by the government's own scientific agencies, they are almost exclusively based on years-old events from before Indivior became an independent company in 2014, and they are wrong."" Indivior was spun off from Reckitt Benckiser in 2014. The company's shares had already lost some four-fifths of their value before today's news, as it faced increasing competition from generic drug makers such as Dr Reddy and Mylan. While Indivior is a treatment for opioid addiction, opioid manufacturers such as Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceuticals are also facing lawsuits. The DoJ also alleged that Indivior used a ""Here to Help"" internet and telephone programme as part of its scheme to induce physicians to write prescriptions for Suboxone Film. The DOJ's indictment said Indivior touted ""Here to Help"" as a resource for opioid-addicted patients but used the programme in part to connect patients to doctors it knew were prescribing Suboxone and other opioids to more patients than were allowed by federal law, at high doses, and in ""suspect circumstances"". Indivior denied this and said: ""To the contrary, we have engaged in an extensive education campaign to teach doctors about recommended Suboxone dosing limits and patient caps and have developed a process to identify concerning prescribers, going beyond what the law requires.""

" On a cold night in February, residents of the battle-weary city of Srinagar woke up to the noise of fighter jets buzzing in the inky black skies. War, many feared, was now just a shot away. Residents of the city in Indian-administered Kashmir had begun stocking up on food. Petrol pumps had run dry. Hospital doctors were told to stockpile medicines. Anxious residents talked about building bunkers in their gardens. A prominent politician rued that he had bought a house near the airport, which now didn’t seem like a “good idea”. Within days, Indian Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft were crossing deep into Pakistan. An Indian Mirage 2000 aircraft on a practice run India said the jets - armed with laser-guided bombs - were targeting a militant training camp near Balakot in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The air strikes were the first launched across the LoC (line of control) - the de facto border that divides Kashmir - and into Pakistan since a war between the two countries in 1971. Conventional wisdom rules that nuclear-armed neighbours  should tread carefully. This policy was now being upended by India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. With characteristic bravado, the 68-year-old leader had ordered the strike as a “fitting, jaw-breaking response” to a deadly attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir earlier in the month. Modi told people he had given the army a “free hand”. “The blood of people is boiling,” he said at one meeting. At another, he said: “I feel the same fire in my heart that’s burning inside you.” Kashmir is the battleground of a protracted, debilitating rivalry between India and Pakistan. Both sides claim all of the breathtakingly scenic Muslim-majority region, but control only parts of it. Each side feels threatened by the other. They have fought two wars and a smaller conflict in the region. The latest “provocation” to India had been dire enough. On 14 February, a minivan packed with explosives was driven into a convoy of 78 buses carrying Indian paramilitary troops on a heavily guarded highway, about 19km (12 miles) from Srinagar. The blast killed 46 troops, the deadliest attack on Indian forces in the region in decades. Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad promptly said it was behind the attack. February 2019: Wreckage from the attack which killed 46 Indian troops Modi’s response upped the ante. His party, the BJP, has always maintained that “nationalism, and national unity” are an “article of faith” in the party. Modi has energised the base with his muscular, unabashed nationalism. Modi’s supporters believed he had kept his word and delivered a “crushing blow” to Pakistan. The truth, however, was more complicated. Less than 24 hours after the air strike, Pakistan shot down an Indian fighter jet in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and captured an Indian pilot. With both sides under immense pressure to calm tensions, Pakistan offered to release the pilot. A day later, Wing Cdr Abhinandan  was returned to India. A man watches the televised release of Indian Wing Cdr Abhinandan At home, Modi wasted no time moulding the narrative to his own advantage. “The country is in safe hands,” he announced. It was a victory for Modi in more ways than one. His approval ratings, which had declined after a series of setbacks in state elections,recovered appreciably. Modi had swept to power in 2014, leading the Hindu nationalist BJP to an unprecedented win. It was the first time since 1984 a party had won an absolute majority in a general election. But despite the massive mandate, the verdict on Modi’s performance has been mixed. There have been some gains – more roads, rural works, cheap cooking gas for the poor, village toilets, a uniform sales tax, a promising health insurance scheme which could end up benefiting 500 million families, and a new bankruptcy and insolvency law. But the economy is underperforming. India’s farms, where most of its people work, are beset by a crisis of low crop prices. Unemployment is rising, and a controversial currency ban ended up hurting the poor. Socially, the BJP’s strident Hindu nationalism has left the country polarised and minorities nervous. India is in the grip of a fake-news epidemic, partly due to cheap phones and data. Some dissenters have been labelled as “anti-nationals” and thrown into prison. Modi has now won a second general election. In some ways, it has been a referendum on the man himself. Many believe he wants to fashion India in his image - forcefully nationalist, socially conservative, openly patriotic. For nearly 40 days in April and May, more than 600 million people have voted in 543 parliamentary seats in a marathon staggered election. It has been the biggest, longest and possibly most expensive ballot ever. For one of India’s leading public intellectuals, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, it has been a “high stakes election with very low expectations”. Has this election been, as some have said, “a battle for the soul of India”? It's a bright day in March. Ranjanben Dhananjay Bhatt’s election campaign swings through the sun-baked streets of Vadodara, also known as Baroda, in Gujarat state in western India. Fifty-six-year-old Bhatt is the BJP’s candidate for the seat. She stands atop a shiny black jeep, her hands folded in a traditional Indian greeting. Knots of men, women and children gather on the road to welcome her. They shower her with marigolds, bless her with prayers and offer homemade sweets and juice. They crowd  verandahs and rooftops and cheerfully return the victory sign Bhatt flashes at them. The streets are awash with saffron, the BJP’s signature colour. Motorcycle outriders wearing saffron turbans, scarves, caps and bandanas, lead the way. A flatbed truck with a smiling DJ plays upbeat music. Firecrackers burst. In this merry festival of cacophony and colour, the air is thick with cries. They invoke one man. “Modi, Modi, Modi,” young party workers chant in frenzied unison. Modi’s face is emblazoned on T-shirts, caps, campaign hoardings and car stickers. He is everywhere, except in body - BJP workers are not sure whether he will find time to campaign in the seat. “Modi is not contesting here. But he’s larger than life, and a vote for me is also a vote for Modi,” says Bhatt, an indefatigable campaigner. In 2014, Modi won Vadodara by a mammoth 570,128 votes. He vacated Vadodara after winning  a second seat in Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh (candidates can stand for more than one seat in Indian elections, and choose which one to take up if successful). Bhatt, a former municipal councillor and a deputy mayor, swept to victory in the by-election a few months later. Ranjanben Dhananjay Bhatt is the BJP candidate in Vadodara In this BJP heartland, it is hardly a fight. The party has been in power here since 1996, and the opposition these days is pretty much invisible. “This election is not about my winning, but the margin of victory. I am aiming to win by at least 600,000 votes and set a new record in Gujarat,” says Bhatt. Two months later, she will go on to win a convincing victory. “Everything we do here is finally dedicated to Narendra bhai [brother]. Votes here are given to Modi. Gujarat is his birthplace and Vadodara is his workplace.” Surprisingly little is known about the man who became India’s most powerful politician. Modi was born the son of a tea-stall owner in Vadnagar, a grubby town some 200km (124 miles) from Vadodara. According to one biographer, Modi did not have any special bond with either family or friends in Vadnagar and “virtually abandoned” the place in his youth. As a teenager he was married in a traditional ceremony - a fact only confirmed in 2014 when he filed his election nomination papers. He lived with his wife, Jashodaben, for just three years. Early in his life, Modi joined the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), widely regarded as the parent organisation of the BJP, and became a full-time worker. RSS volunteers on parade in Bhopal, 2015 The RSS (which translates as National Volunteer Corps) was founded in 1925 and believes in the unity and protection of India’s majority Hindus. The organisation does not present itself as primarily political - its mission statement “emphasises culture and patriotism”, according to one study. Nevertheless, the RSS has been the mainstay of Hindu nationalism since the days of British rule. Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by a former member. Today, the RSS has some 6,000 full-time workers. Some two million people participate in nearly 80,000 branches  (known as shakhas) across India. The BJP is a political affiliate of the RSS. It believes in Hindutva, an ideology seeking to establish the supremacy of the Hindus and the Hindu way of life. During his early days with the RSS, say BJP workers, Modi lived for extended periods of time in Vadodara, sharing an austere one-bedroom RSS-owned property. “He would sometimes go around on a bike, meeting workers. He knows every street here, and he still has friends in the city,” says one party official. Modi earned his spurs as a business-friendly, efficient chief minister during the 13 years he ruled Gujarat before moving to Delhi in 2014. He was credited with making Gujarat an economic powerhouse, although the success of so-called “Modinomics” isa subject of keen debate among economists. Modi was also accused of not doing enough to stop religious riots in 2002 when more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. The violence was sparked by a train fire in the town of Godhra in which 60 Hindu pilgrims died. The fire was widely blamed on Muslim arsonists. More than 1,000 people were killed in the Gujarat riots of 2002 Modi was named leader of the BJP in 2013. A year later he became  prime minister. His supporters see him as a hard-working, no-nonsense doer who does not “pamper the minorities”, alluding mainly to India’s 170 million Muslims. They say he is a self-made man with humble roots, and contrast him with what they describe as the entitled and privileged Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has led the main opposition Congress party and ruled India for nearly half a century. Priyanka Gandhi is the latest member of her family to become involved in the Congress party “Modi is more popular than the BJP here. He’s a phenomenon. He was Gujarat’s most successful chief minister, and now he’s India’s tallest leader. Gujaratis are proud of him,” says a senior BJP official. Amit Dholakia, a professor of political science in Vadodara’s MS University, says Gujarat has a long history of political Hinduism, which has helped Modi. But he adds: “Modi understands that political Hinduism has its limitations because of divisions among the Hindus. Even in Gujarat, the BJP has never got more than 48% of the popular vote. So now he talks more about nationalism and development. Hindutva is a campaign filler. “Modi is more of a pragmatist than an ideologue. He loves power. And the people here love him.” Ambarish Nag Biswas was returning home from work near the eastern city of Kolkata on a balmy November evening in 2016 when his mobile phone rang. It was his friend, and he sounded panic-stricken. “Narendra Modi is on TV, and he’s taking away our money!” he shrilled. “What do you mean?” asked Biswas. His hyperventilating friend calmed down and explained. Prime Minister Modi had announced that his government was abolishing high denomination notes. In four hours, the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes would be banned from circulation. These two notes accounted for more than 80% of the currency circulating in India’s sprawling and messy cash-driven economy  (500 rupees would buy seven litres of petrol in Delhi). The drastic move, according to Modi, was intended to crack down on corruption by exposing billions of dollars in unaccounted-for wealth, which would now have to be presented to banks to change into the new currency notes. It was also intended to help resolve the problem of counterfeit currency, and to meet the long-held aspiration of successive governments to move India away from a cash-dependent economy (the shadow economy, according to the World Bank, makes up a fifth of India’s GDP.) That night Biswas remained wide awake. Ambarish Nag Biswas The 48-year-old, who worked for a dairy farm, had 24,000 rupees stashed away at home for emergencies. Now he had to go to a bank, deposit the defunct notes, and withdraw fresh currency for his family. His wife, Rinku, was a homemaker, and his daughter, Saborni, was in high school. When Biswas arrived at the bank the next morning, it was shut. A huge crowd had gathered, and nobody quite knew how the money would be exchanged. Biswas queued all day without success. The next day he tried another bank where he had a separate savings account, but the queue was even longer. He returned to the first bank. Suddenly, he heard a commotion. An elderly man in the queue, with a walking stick and a plastic bag containing his cash savings and bank papers, had collapsed from exhaustion. He had been standing under the boiling sun for hours. Biswas rushed ahead, picked up the man and, flagging down a car, took him to a hospital. Two hours later, the man had still not regained consciousness. “I had lost two days at work standing in the queue. I still hadn’t been able to exchange and get money.” He called his boss and asked for another day’s leave. After queuing eight hours without food and water, Biswas deposited his notes, but managed to withdraw only 2,000 rupees. The banks were fast running out of cash. “It was strange. There were only people like us in the cash queues. Where were the rich and influential who were supposed to be hoarding cash?” he says. Modi’s announcement had plunged India into chaos. Cities and towns were filled with panic-stricken people who were thronging banks to deposit money and withdraw lower denominations. Cash machines ran dry. There were stories of people burning sacks of illegal cash and of people unable to pay for cremations and hospital admissions. A man was said to have walked into a mobile phone store near Delhi with three million rupees in expired cash, offering to buy its entire stock of iPhones. A politician in Bihar was reported to have spent 20 million rupees on gold ornaments. A dengue patient settled his hospital bills in coins, since bills were in short supply. There was what was called a thriving “discount scam” where people offered to buy scrapped notes for less than their value, before laundering the expired money. Reports said more than 100 people had died of heart attacks in the bank queues. For Biswas, and the many others like him, the ordeal and indignity would continue for months. “I was always lying at work, so I could sneak out and withdraw my own money,” says Biswas. “After work, I would go out looking for cash. I took my bike travelling to villages all the time looking for an ATM with cash. I would go to more than a dozen cash machines every day to look for cash. “I bribed a guard to enter a dental college where I heard there was a less-used ATM. Even that had run out of cash.” Modi had promised that the hardship would only last 50 days. “Please, 50 days, just give me 50 days. After 30 December, I promise to show you the India that you have always wished for,” he said. But 2017 arrived and the banks still didn’t have enough cash to give out. It took months for things to return to normal. A year later, analysts concluded Modi’s currency gamble had been an “epic failure”. It had dealt a body blow to India’s informal economy, which ran mainly on cash. Small factories had shut, and poor workers had been laid off. One academic compared demonetisation in a booming economy to “shooting at the tyres of a racing car”. One of Modi’s own economic advisers called demonetisation a “massive, draconian, monetary shock”. The US-based National Bureau of Economic Research found it had lowered economic growth by at least two percentage points in the last quarter of 2016. January 2017: Congress politician Mamata Banerjee addresses a protest against demonetisation in Kolkata By the central bank’s own admission, more than 99% of the “demonetised” money had been returned to the banks. Either there had not been much illicit money circulating in the system to begin with, or the owners had found ways to convert it into legal tender. Counterfeit currency accounted for a negligible amount of withdrawn notes. Modi’s move to clean up the economy had yielded very little and made many suffer. Many believed that state elections in Uttar Pradesh in March 2017 would be a judgement on demonetisation - and that the BJP would suffer. They were wrong. The party won its biggest majority in nearly 40 years. March 2017: Modi celebrates BJP victory in the state elections Not everyone finds this surprising. A young student I speak to in Uttar Pradesh tells me: “In a divided and unequal society, the poor are willing to suffer if they are convinced that the rich are being hurt. It took them a long time to realise they were wrong.” In other words, the currency ban was a moment of schadenfreude – feeling joy at another’s pain - for India’s masses. But in Kolkata, Biswas finds it hard to forgive the prime minister. “The humiliation I had to go through to access my own hard earned money was unbelievable,” he says. “All this happened because we trusted Modi. We had believed him when he said this was to teach the corrupt rich a lesson. We believed that ordinary people had to sacrifice a little to help punish the dishonest. “After that time, I don’t trust Modi any more. He has persistently lied to the people. This is not befitting of a prime minister.” Rajasthan is an internationally feted tourist destination. It evokes images of gorgeous forts, colourful bazaars, art deco hotels and camel rides in stark deserts. But the state is also a base of violent “cow vigilantism”, stoked by Hindu nationalist rhetoric. Rajasthan is one of India's biggest tourist destinations Many of India’s majority Hindus worship the cow as a sacred animal. Cow protection movements date back to the 1870s. Conflicts over cow slaughter in the distant past have provoked deadly religious riots, protests outside the parliament, and even a hunger strike. Cow vigilante groups have mushroomed since the BJP came to power in 2014. To Modi’s supporters, the cow is totemic. Slaughter laws have been toughened and punishments made dire. In Rajasthan, cattle slaughter - or exporting cattle for slaughter - can attract a 10-year prison sentence. In parts of north and west India, vigilante groups are a law unto themselves, setting up highway checkpoints, checking vehicles for cows, and roughing up dairy farmers, cattle traders and herders, mostly Muslims. Cow protection has become an extortion racket. A cow vigilante group in Rajasthan, photographed in 2015 Human Rights Watch says at least 44 people – 36 of them Muslims – have been killed in vigilante incidents since 2015.  Hundreds more have been injured. Modi himself has condemned such attacks, and accused vigilante groups of being “anti-social” groups masquerading as cow protectors. But BJP lawmakers close to the prime minister have sent out different signals. A cabinet colleague was photographed garlanding men who had been convicted for lynching a meat trader. A senior RSS official said the lynchings would stop if the Muslims stopped eating beef. A photograph of dairy farmer Pehlu Khan Pehlu Khan was killed for trying to take his cows home. The 55-year-old dairy farmer lived in Nuh, a district of the northern state of Haryana with his wife and five children. A nondescript place comprising a dusty town and a smattering of Muslim-majority villages and verdant farms, the people here till their land and sell cow milk for a living. In April 2017, Pehlu was driving home in a hired pick-up with his two sons and two fellow villagers. They were transporting livestock they had bought at a cattle fair in neighbouring Rajasthan. After driving a few hours and clearing some checkpoints, they realised they were being followed by six men on motorcycles, who overtook Pehlu and stopped the truck. “We showed them the sale papers. They tore up the papers. They said they were from the Bajrang Dal (a radical Hindu right-wing group),” says Pehlu's son Arif. Pehlul Khan's son Arif survived the attack “Then they just dragged us down from the vehicle. They beat up my father most. They punched him, and beat him up with whatever they could lay their hands on - sticks, belts. Soon a mob gathered and joined the lynching.” “They are Muslims. Just beat them up,” the mob howled. By the time, the police arrived and rescued the men,  Pehlu was already unconscious. The mob had snatched the cows, three phones and 45,000 rupees in cash. The police took the victims to hospital. Pehlu died two days later. His sons survived the attack. Villagers remember Pehlu as a devout, hardworking man. “He worked hard to provide a decent life for all of us,” says his wife, Jaibuna. Pehlu's widow, Jaibuna, and one of their sons After his death, his family sold off their cows to pay for their legal expenses. The family did not receive any compensation. “We barely survive now,” says Arif. When it comes to cow lynchings, justice has been patchy in Modi’s India. As he drifted in and out of consciousness before haemorrhaging to death, Pehlu Khan named six men as his attackers. But before arresting them, the police filed a complaint against the victims, including Pehlu, for allegedly smuggling cows. In September, the two brothers and two other witnesses to the attack were on their way to court to give evidence, when an unmarked SUV began following their vehicle. “They drove up and shouted at us to turn back. When we refused, a man in the vehicle fired in the air. We turned our vehicle back and returned home,” says Arif. I don’t hope for justice - I just want to live Since then, he says, they have not responded to the court summons. The brothers say they will only do so if the case is moved out of Rajasthan. “I am too scared. We lost our father. Now I don’t want to die. I don’t hope for justice. I just want to live,” he says. Five months after the attack, charges against the six accused men were dropped by Rajasthan police. An independent report later accused state authorities of working to “diminish the enormity of the crime”. Last December, the main opposition Congress party defeated the BJP and took power in Rajasthan. “But nothing has changed,” says Arif. “The vigilantes still man the checkpoints. We are still scared to go out with our cows.” Job seekers line up for interviews at a job fair in Chinchwad, India, 7 February, 2019 In an apartment building tucked away in a warren of narrow lanes in the northern city of Lucknow, three young men have been studying up to 10 hours a day for months on end. All they want is a job. The young men are children of small farmers. They are first generation literate and part of an increasing number of Indians migrating to cities in search of jobs. All of them are from Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with nearly as many people as Brazil. Mithilesh Yadav, Karunesh Jaisawal and Ram Sagar Gupta Armed with diplomas in engineering, the three men have sat exams for more than two-dozen jobs in the past year. They head to exam halls on buses and second-class trains, sleeping in railway and bus stations to save money. They sit for gruelling exams, competing against tens of millions for a few thousand jobs.  More than 20 million people applied last year for 63,000 jobs in the state-run railways, one of India’s largest employers. Pune, February 2019: Candidates sleep out ahead of army job tests The three men have been trying for jobs as train drivers, technicians, linesmen, engineers, clerks, government admin staff and even police officers. They have sat exams held by power stations, public works, and the railways. These are government jobs which offer dignity and security. But the competition is intense, and vacancies are few. Hopes are dashed quickly. The three men want to work as engineers, but are now reconciled to accepting whatever government job they can get. Job security is precarious. Karunesh Jaiswal, one of the three men, worked as a contract engineer for an aviation oil company last year and earned 17,000 rupees a month. Since  his contract ended - and despite the experience - he hasn’t found another job. “I don’t have a choice. I have to keep trying. When you are jobless in India, you are not alone,” says the 22-year-old. Karunesh Jaiswal: “I don’t have a choice. I have to keep trying” On the campaign trail five years ago, Narendra Modi fired the imagination of the young by promising plenty of jobs. But as he seeks a second term in office, India is in the throes of a massive unemployment crisis. According toa leaked government report, the unemployment rate is at a 45-year-high. More than 30 million people were looking for jobs in February, according to a study by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank. A class at Dhyeya Coaching Institute in Lucknow, where students prepare for civil service examinations Despite decades of brisk growth, vacancies have remained scarce. India’s fastest growing industries – telecoms, banking, finance – do not offer enough jobs to absorb the country’s teeming army of poorly educated, low-skilled workers. Under Modi, private investment has slowed down and growth has sputtered, further hurting job creation. More than 80% of India’s workforce are trapped in low paying, benefits-scarce “unorganised or informal” workplaces. Fewer than 10% of Indians actually work in the formal economy with full benefits. Not surprisingly, getting a job is a Sisyphean struggle. In their basic two-room, rented apartment, Jaiswal, Ram Sagar Gupta and Mithilesh Yadav wake up at five in the morning.  After a quick breakfast, they sit on a bed and “self-study”. A map of India adorns the whitewashed walls. Books on engineering, maths, English grammar and general knowledge are strewn all over the place. Sometimes their parents call from the villages, and ask whether they have got a job yet. Ram Sagar Gupta “Those calls are the most difficult. I feel very sad to tell them the truth. But they always support me. The family keeps us going,” says Gupta. He believes Modi will deliver the jobs one day. He still holds out hope. “At least he talks about the dreams and aspirations of the young. He himself works hard. We still have lot of hopes from him.” His jobless flatmates are not so sure. “Where are the factories he promised to build?” asks one. Mithilesh Yadav Yadav says one of his uncles finally cracked a test for a policeman’s job after 10 years of trying. The uncle was 27 when he joined the force. “One day, I will also possibly get a job. But patience also takes a heavy toll,” says Yadav. A plot of government land is the venue of Modi’s inaugural campaign meeting in the northern Indian city of Meerut. Minutes after entering a flower-bedecked stage and acknowledging the lusty cheering from several thousand people in the audience, Modi launches into his speech with gusto. “The 1.3 billion people of India have made up their mind,” he says. “Once again India will have a Modi sarkar (government).” Modi is a preternaturally confident politician. Although his powerful aide Amit Shah has stitched up some smart alliances, he has made 2019 a verdict on his performance. He is a tireless campaigner. In 2014, according to the BJP, he travelled more than 300,000km (186,000 miles) across 25 states to “connect to people”. This year, according to the BJP, he has travelled the entire country over 51 days and addressed 142 public meetings - a third of those in the two crucial states of Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Modi is also pugnacious, deftly mixing nationalism, dog-whistle politics and populism. He’s adept at creating binaries: the nationalists (his supporters) versus the anti-nationals (his political rivals and critics); the watchman (Modi himself, protecting the country on “land, air, and outer space”) versus the entitled and the corrupt (an obvious dig at the main opposition Congress party). Sometimes his campaign has sounded like he’s blaming previous governments for all ills - rather than a vision for the present. 2019 has been a bruising and brutal campaign. India’s Grand Old Party, the Congress, led by a resurgent Rahul Gandhi, has unsuccessfully tried to re-establish itself as a credible opposition after sinking to its lowest tally in 2014. The BJP has also fought off the threat from a host of regional parties which are powerful in a number of states. Arvind Panagariya, a professor of economics at Columbia University who served as the vice-chairman of a government think tank under Modi, has always believed that the prime minister would win a second term, despite what critics said. He says Modi remains intensely popular with people and has “enormous energy and ability to communicate with the masses”. “He has successfully conveyed to the average Indian that he is sincere, hard-working and decisive.” Some analysts believe India is headed for a second “dominant party system”, this time led by the BJP. Previously, Congress led the country for more than four decades. But one thing is clear - 2019 has proved that the power of Modi endures for now. Built with Shorthand",Negative,1.2964284e-07

"A dozen black holes may lie at the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way, researchers have said. A new analysis provides support for a decades-old prediction that ""supermassive"" black holes at the centres of galaxies are surrounded by many smaller ones. However, previous searches of the Milky Way's centre, where the nearest supermassive black hole is located, have found little evidence for this. Detailsappear in the journal Nature.,external Charles Hailey from Columbia University in New York and colleagues used archival data from Nasa's Chandra X-ray telescope to come to their conclusions. They report the discovery of a dozen inactive and low-mass ""binary systems"", in which a star orbits an unseen companion - the black hole. The supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way, known as Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), is surrounded by a halo of gas and dust that provides the perfect breeding ground for the birth of massive stars. These stars live, die and could turn into black holes there. In addition, black holes from outside the halo are believed to fall under the influence of Sgr A* as they lose their energy, causing them to be pulled into its vicinity, where they are held captive by its force. Some of these bind - or ""mate"" - to passing stars, forming binary systems. Previous attempts to detect this population of black holes have looked for the bright bursts of X-rays that are sometimes emitted by black hole binaries. ""The galactic centre is so far away from Earth that those bursts are only strong and bright enough to see about once every 100 to 1,000 years,"" said Prof Hailey. Instead, the Columbia University astrophysicist and his colleagues decided to look for the fainter but steadier X-rays emitted when these binaries are in an inactive state. ""Isolated, unmated black holes are just black - they don't do anything,"" said Prof Hailey. ""But when black holes mate with a low mass star, the marriage emits X-ray bursts that are weaker, but consistent and detectable."" A search for the X-ray signatures of low-mass black hole binaries in the Chandra data turned up 12 within three light-years of Sgr A*. By extrapolating from the properties and distribution of these binaries, the team estimates that there may be 300-500 low-mass binaries and 10,000 isolated low-mass black holes surrounding Sgr A*. Prof Hailey said the finding ""confirms a major theory"", adding: ""It is going to significantly advance gravitational wave research because knowing the number of black holes in the centre of a typical galaxy can help in better predicting how many gravitational wave events may be associated with them."" Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of space-time. They were predicted by Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity and detected by the Ligo experiment in 2015. One way these ripples arise isthrough the collision of separate black holes.

"Theresa May had last-minute Brexit talks with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday The request for delay is an answer to one question. When confronted with the possibility of taking the UK out of the EU without a formal deal in place or slamming on the brakes, which way would the prime minister jump? Would she choose a pure plan - pursuing Brexit over the risk of instability? Or would Theresa May heed the voices of warning, rather than those in her own party arguing that any short-term pain would be worth long-term gain, and ask for delay, despite the embarrassment of doing so, and the frustration of those who wanted her to keep the promise of leaving on time? Mrs May kept many in Westminster guessing for a long time. But her meetings in Europe, her plea on Tuesday, are evidence of the decision she finally took - that almost any entreaties to European leaders are worth it to avoid opening Pandora's Box. Pausing again brings embarrassment and angers many on her own side, but it's a lesser evil than departing with no deal. If the prime minister is granted a strings-attached delay later, the next question is perhaps as big. What will she do with the extra time she's been granted? Will it even be up to her? Tusk suggests Brexit delay of up to a year Brexit: Significant hurdles for cross-party talks Cross-party talks with the Labour Party are serious - both sides in the room are taking part in good faith and expect more negotiations on Thursday. But the more talking they do, the more the scale of the task to bring them together reveals itself. Forget a quick solution from this joint process, and don't bank on one happening at all. The divisions may simply be too great - the moment when it might have worked perhaps has passed. If that fails, then the answer may pass again, back to Parliament - MPs confronted again with the power to choose from a wide array of different choices - with the ability, if not yet the common purpose to choose a version of Brexit for all of us. And of course, if a long delay is agreed it could push hungry Tories who want a change of leadership again into action. But the obvious response to another question is crystal clear - who is in charge for today? It's the EU leaders who will determine the date and nature of this delay - not the country that voted in an effort to pull back control.

"The first ever picture of a black hole: It's surrounded by a halo of bright gas Astronomers have taken the first ever image of a black hole, which is located in a distant galaxy. It measures 40 billion km across - three million times the size of the Earth - and has been described by scientists as ""a monster"". The black hole is 500 million trillion km away and was photographed by a network of eight telescopes across the world. Details have been published today in Astrophysical Journal Letters. It was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a network of eight linked telescopes. Prof Heino Falcke, of Radboud University in the Netherlands, who proposed the experiment, told BBC News that the black hole was found in a galaxy called M87. ""What we see is larger than the size of our entire Solar System,"" he said. ""It has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun. And it is one of the heaviest black holes that we think exists. It is an absolute monster, the heavyweight champion of black holes in the Universe."" This video can not be played M87: The significance of the first ever image of a black hole The image shows an intensely bright ""ring of fire"", as Prof Falcke describes it, surrounding a perfectly circular dark hole. The bright halo is caused by superheated gas falling into the hole. The light is brighter than all the billions of other stars in the galaxy combined - which is why it can be seen at such distance from Earth. The edge of the dark circle at the centre is the point at which the gas enters the black hole, which is an object that has such a large gravitational pull, not even light can escape. The woman behind the black hole photo Taking the temperature of black holes Hawking: Black holes store information Get BBC news in your inbox, each weekday morning Astronomers have suspected that the M87 galaxy has a supermassive black hole at its heart from false colour images such as this one. The dark centre is not a black hole but indicates that stars are densely packed and fast moving The image matches what theoretical physicists and indeed, Hollywood directors, imagined black holes would look like, according to Dr Ziri Younsi, of University College London - who is part of the EHT collaboration. ""Although they are relatively simple objects, black holes raise some of the most complex questions about the nature of space and time, and ultimately of our existence,"" he said. ""It is remarkable that the image we observe is so similar to that which we obtain from our theoretical calculations. So far, it looks like Einstein is correct once again."" But having the first image will enable researchers to learn more about these mysterious objects. They will be keen to look out for ways in which the black hole departs from what's expected in physics. No-one really knows how the bright ring around the hole is created. Even more intriguing is the question of what happens when an object falls into a black hole. A black hole is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape Despite the name, they are not empty but instead consist of a huge amount of matter packed densely into a small area, giving it an immense gravitational pull There is a region of space beyond the black hole called the event horizon. This is a ""point of no return"", beyond which it is impossible to escape the gravitational effects of the black hole Prof Falcke had the idea for the project when he was a PhD student in 1993. At the time, no-one thought it was possible. But he was the first to realise that a certain type of radio emission would be generated close to and all around the black hole, which would be powerful enough to be detected by telescopes on Earth. He also recalled reading a scientific paper from 1973 that suggested that because of their enormous gravity, black holes appear 2.5 times larger than they actually are. These two factors suddenly made the seemingly impossible, possible. After arguing his case for 20 years, Prof Falcke persuaded theEuropean Research Council,externalto fund the project. The National Science Foundation and agencies in East Asia then joined in to bankroll the project to the tune of more than Â£40m. The eventual EHT array will have 12 widely spaced participating radio facilities It is an investment that has been vindicated with the publication of the image. Prof Falcke told me that he felt that ""it's mission accomplished"". He said: ""It has been a long journey, but this is what I wanted to see with my own eyes. I wanted to know is this real?"" No single telescope is powerful enough to image the black hole. So, in the biggest experiment of its kind, Prof Sheperd Doeleman of the Harvard-Smithsonian Centre for Astrophysics led a project to set up a network of eight linked telescopes.

"Tony Meadows and his wife Paula were found dead on 2 April Burglars have raided the empty home of a former Concorde pilot and his wife days after they were found dead there. The bodies of Tony and Paula Meadows, both in their 80s,were discovered last Tuesday near the village of Bucklebury, Berkshire. Mr Meadows was part of the crew during Concorde's first passenger flight from Heathrow to New York in 1977. Concorde memorabilia, cufflinks and other related items belonging to Mr Meadows were taken, police said. The house in Chapel Lane was burgled between 23:00 on Sunday and 11:00 GMT on Monday. A blue forensics tent was set up outside the couple's house near Bucklebury Det Insp Alice Broad, of Thames Valley Police, said: ""We are investigating this burglary in which it's thought a number of items linked to Concorde and Anthony Meadows's work as a pilot were stolen. ""These items have sentimental value to the family who have recently lost both their mother and father just last week."" ""We would ask anyone who may have been offered these items for sale to please get in touch with Thames Valley Police."" There will be additional patrols around the house because of the burglary The family has since removed further valuables and memorabilia from the property into safe storage. Police said the attached property was still occupied and there would be additional patrols around the house. Det Insp Alice Broad appealed to the thieves to ""look into their conscience and return the items that hold valuable memories for the family"".

"This video can not be played New Zealand PM, Jacinda Ardern: ""These weapons were designed to kill"" New Zealand's parliament has voted to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons following the Christchurch attacks. The gun reform bill passed 119-1 after the final reading in parliament. It is expected to become law within the next few days after receiving royal assent from the governor general. PM Jacinda Ardern announced changes to the law after 50 people were killed last month by a suspected lone gunman at two mosques in Christchurch. Holding back tears, she told parliament on Wednesday that MPs were there ""because of the victims and families"". She said that when she had visited the injured in hospital none of them had had just one gunshot wound. ""They will carry disabilities for a lifetime and that's before you consider the psychological impact,"" she said. ""These weapons were designed to kill, and they were designed to maim and that is what they did on the 15th of March."" AustralianBrenton Tarrant, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, faces 50 murder chargesand 39 attempted murder charges. The new rules make changes to 1983 gun laws which have been the subject of several reform attempts. They prohibit military-style semi-automatic weapons and parts that can be used to assemble prohibited firearms. The gunman, armed with semi-automatic rifles including an AR-15, is believed to have modified his weapons with high-capacity magazines so they could hold more bullets. The magazine is the part of the gun which stores ammunition. How mass shootings have changed gun laws What are New Zealand's gun laws? Those breaking the new laws will face between two and ten years in jail. An amnesty will be in place until the end of September. David Seymour, leader of the ACT party, was the only MP to come out against the bill, although he did not oppose the proposed changes to gun laws. He said the bill was ""not an attempt to improve public safety"" but ""an exercise in political theatre"". He said he believed the rush to put the bill through the house had made the law worse than doing nothing. Jacinda Ardern said parliament was ""almost entirely united"". ""I cannot imagine circumstances where that is more necessary than it is now,"" she added.

"Descendants of the first students to take part in inter-university games are being sought as the annual Welsh Varsity is held 100 years on. Cardiff University was one of 10 founding members of the Inter-Varsity Board of England and Wales, which first competed in 1919. An expected 20,000 spectators will watch 900 athletes contest 46 events across Cardiff on Wednesday. Thousands of Swansea and Cardiff students will take part. Ranging from the traditional football, cricket and rowing, to the slightly more unusual canoe polo and ultimate frisbee, varsity also raises tens of thousands of pounds for charity. Cardiff University's 1925 hockey team followed on from the successes of the 1919 first inter-university games The day culminates with the flagship women's and then men's rugby matches at the Principality Stadium. It's all a far cry from the first Welsh Varsity 1997 competition, where the only sport on offer was rugby, watched by a modest crowd of just 974 at Cardiff Arms Park. However, head of sport at Cardiff University, Stuart Vanstone, explained sporting rivalries between Welsh universities went back much further than 1997. Playing canoe polo on a football field IOC recognises 'Ultimate Frisbee' Welsh bow on korfball world stage ""For Cardiff, this year's varsity marks 100 years since we first competed in inter-university sport. ""Then called University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, we were one of 10 founding members of the Inter-Varsity Athletics Board of England and Wales - which also included Bangor and Aberystwyth - and we took part in their inaugural games in Manchester in May 1919. ""We'd be delighted if we could track down the descendants of anyone who took part in those games."" Cardiff University's current women's football team Events included athletics, netball, tennis, as well as tug-of-war, and took place in front of a crowd of 2,000. The Manchester Guardian reported that BC Watson of Cardiff competed in the high jump and had ""by far the prettier style, but he appeared to tire at the critical moment and was placed third"". Hardly surprising he was tired as BC Watson had had a busy day; also coming third in the final of the 100 yards race. Swansea missed out on that event as they were not formed until the following year, but by the late 1920s they too were strong members of the Inter-Varsity Athletics Board, making their mark with a 2-0 hockey win over Bangor in 1924, and going on to excel in cricket, rugby and tennis in particular. Inter-university sport is now organised by BUCS (British Universities and Colleges Sport), who oversee 4,800 teams across 170 UK colleges and universities. The university had teams predating the inter-varsity board, such as this men's polo team from 1912..... .... and this tennis club from 1899. However, for Katie Davies - who has a foot in both camps, the Cardiff/Swansea rivalry eclipses all others. Final-year archaeology student Katie will be the lone striker for Cardiff in her third women's football varsity match, but plays her club football for Swansea City in the Welsh Women's Premier League. ""I've played for the Swans in the Champions' League, Welsh Cup finals and league deciders, but I can honestly say I never get more nervous than before a varsity match,"" she said. ""Everyone gets swept up in the whole derby day thing, the two city rivals coming together, and the atmosphere is incredible. ""I'll definitely be feeling the pressure as it's my final game and we've drawn the last two so I finally want to get one over on them, plus with having a foot in both camps, if we don't win I'll really get some ribbing off the Swansea girls."" The destination of the overall Varsity Shield is determined by points awarded for all 46 events, but none is more keenly contested than the two blue-ribbon Varsity Cups, awarded for the men's and women's  rugby matches. Cardiff's men look for their third win in a row against an injury-weakened Swansea side. Meanwhile Swansea's women are strong favourites, as they now compete in the BUCS Premier League, a division above Cardiff.

"(Top: L to R) David Traill, PC Kirsty Nelis, PC Tony Collins, Gary Arthur, Samuel McGhee (Bottom: L to R) Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Mark O'Prey, John McGarrigle, Joe Cusker The fatal accident inquiry into the Clutha helicopter crash in Glasgow has heard how each of the 10 victims died. A joint minute was read on the third day of the fatal accident inquiry at Hampden Park which agreed the times and causes of death. The Police Scotland helicopter crashed through the roof of The Clutha pub at about 22:22 on Friday 29 November 2013. The tragedy claimed the lives of the pilot, his two crew and seven customers in the busy city centre bar. Gary Arthur was carried from the bar through an open window The court heard Gary Arthur, 48, from Paisley, Renfrewshire, had no pulse when he was found trapped in rubble by firefighters. The sales adviser was carried to an open window and examined by a paramedic. Mr Arthur was pronounced dead at 22:50. A post mortem examination the following day determined the cause of death was a head injury due to an aircraft crash. Clutha helicopter pilot given five warnings Helicopter 'spluttered' before crashing on pub Follow the BBC's Paul O'Hare who is tweeting from the inquiry,external Anthony Collins, 43, from Clarkston in East Renfrewshire, was a police constable on board the helicopter. Anthony Collins was found in the rear passenger seat of the helicopter The police air observer was found in the rear passenger seat of the helicopter which, according to the joint minute, ""descended at a high rate onto the roof of the Clutha Vaults causing it to collapse"". PC Collins had no pulse when he was discovered by firefighters shortly after 23:00. The court heard he was positioned behind the pilot and trapped within the wreckage. PC Collins, who had 18 years' service, was formally pronounced dead at 10:49 the following day. A post mortem examination found the cause of death was head, neck and chest injuries. Joseph Cusker was found close to the entrance of the pub Joseph Cusker, 59, from Cambuslang, South Lanarkshire, was still alive when he was found with multiple injuries close to the entrance of the pub by fellow customers. The retired local authority housing manager was taken to the city's Royal Infirmary but he died at 11:25 on 12 December. Mr Cusker's cause of death was recorded as multiple organ failure due to neck and chest injuries. Colin Gibson was trapped in the debris Colin Gibson, 33, was an immigration officer from Ayr. He was trapped by rubble, debris and part of the helicopter when he was discovered by firefighters. Mr Gibson was formally pronounced dead at 13:35 the following day and his cause of death was recorded as ""traumatic asphyxia"". Robert Jenkins was trapped beneath the helicopter Robert Jenkins, 61, from East Kilbride, was a gas company customer services adviser. He was discovered in the Clutha by firefighters trapped in rubble and debris beneath the helicopter on 1 December, more than 36 hours after the crash. Mr Jenkins was formally pronounced dead at 14:34 that day and the cause of death was recorded as a head injury. John McGarrigle was dead when paramedics examined him John McGarrigle, 58, from Cumbernauld, North Lanarkshire, was a writer. He had a faint pulse when firefighters found him trapped underneath a large amount of debris and rubble, near the left front entrance door of the pub. Mr McGarrigle was found to be unconscious with a faint pulse but there was no sign of life when paramedics examined him. He was pronounced dead at 12:49 the following day and the cause of death was later found to be chest injuries. Samuel McGhee was found alive but was trapped beneath debris and rubble Samuel McGhee, 56, was a car wash maintenance man from Glasgow. He was found trapped in the pub by firefighters. Mr McGhee had a faint pulse but could not be freed due to the mass and weight of the debris. When paramedics examined him a short time later he had no pulse. He was formally pronounced dead at 10:22 the following day and the cause of death was recorded as chest injuries. PC Kirsty Nelis was found in the front passenger seat of the helicopter Kirsty Nelis, a police air observer from Inverkip in Inverclyde, was in the front passenger seat of the helicopter. The 36-year-old police constable, who had 13 years' service, was discovered strapped in the front seat of the helicopter. The court heard she was trapped within the wreckage and instrumentation. PC Nelis was pronounced dead at 10:46 the following day and the cause of death was recorded as head, chest and neck injuries. Mark O'Prey was trapped in the rubble from the crash Mark O'Prey, 44, was found trapped by rubble from the waist down. The window cleaner, from East Kilbride, was moving his head and mumbling but his breathing was shallow. He was given an oxygen mask and fitted with an airway but by 01:00 on 30 November there were no signs of life. Mr O'Prey was formally pronounced dead at 12:57 and the cause of death was recorded as head, chest and neck injuries. Pilot David Traill was found dead in the front seat of the helicopter David Traill, 51, was the pilot of the helicopter and employed by Bond Air Services. Shortly after 23:00 he was found in the front-right seat by firefighters compressed by wreckage and debris. He had no pulse. Mr Traill was pronounced dead at 10:35 the following day and the cause of death was found to be head, neck and chest injuries. The court heard samples taken for a toxicology report found negative results for alcohol or drugs. This was also the case for PC Collins and PC Nelis. The inquiry later heard a suggestion that Mr Traill could have been ""dangerously misled"" by an error in a maintenance manual. Marcus Cook, senior inspector at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) was questioned by Donald Findlay QC, representing the family of victim Robert Jenkins. Mr Findlay asked the witness if the pilot would have three to four minutes from one engine on the helicopter flaming out due to fuel shortage and the second doing so. Mr Cook said it would not be minutes, but kilograms of fuel. He said: ""The maintenance manual is incorrect. It would be three to four kilograms - hence about a minute."" Mr Cook said he did not know how the mistake occurred and the maintenance manual had since been changed. Mr Findlay asked: ""If the pilot Captain Traill knew about the gap and understood it to be three or four minutes, he had been badly misled? The witness replied: ""If he knew"". ""And dangerously misled,"" Mr Findlay added. Mr Cook said: ""Your words."" Mr Findlay asked: ""Is there anything wrong with my words?"" ""No,"" Mr Cook replied. Rescuers lift the police helicopter wreckage from the roof of The Clutha The witness said it was probable but ""maybe unlikely"" that the pilot was aware of the manual as it was for maintenance. The court also heard there would have been 32 seconds between the two engines flaming out. When the second engine flamed out, at a height of 500 to 600ft, the pilot would then have had less than 10 seconds to react. Mr Cook said there were indications the pilot attempted to have the helicopter auto-rotate to land with some degree of safety, but this did not work. The court heard the first low fuel light, of five fuel warnings, would have come on when the pilot was around Bothwell, which is about 11 road miles from Glasgow city centre. At that time he would have been expected to land within 10 minutes. But the inquiry heard the AAIB report indicates the helicopter then went to Uddingston and Bargeddie. Mr Findlay asked: ""Why would anyone with the warnings and the knowledge of the amount of fuel on board then carry out an operation at Uddingston, let alone going on to Bargeddie, in that situation? Mr Cook said: ""I've absolutely no idea."" Mr Findlay asked Mr Cook how the crash happened. He replied: ""Unfortunately we could not come to a positive conclusion apart from not landing in 10 minutes."" Mr Cook said he assumed the pilot was heading back to the heliport in Glasgow. The inquiry, which will resume next Wednesday, is expected to involve around three months of evidence spread over six calendar months.

"A painting made of Bonnie Prince Charlie in the 1740s and the new digital depiction of him as an older man A digital facial depiction of Bonnie Prince Charlie has been created using a death mask made of the prince after he died in 1788 aged 67. Prince Charles Edward Stuart sought to regain the Great British throne for his father in the Jacobite Rising of 1745. His army was defeated by government forces at the Battle of Culloden, near Inverness, on 16 April 1746. He has been celebrated in literature and art as a handsome charmer, but the new image portrays him as an older man. Culloden Battlefield protection reviewed Bonnie Prince Charlie 'was a tough guy' The myths of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Jacobites The prince died in Palazzo Muti, Rome. The death mask used by forensic artist Hew Morrison is held in the collection at High Life Highland's Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. Death masks are a likeness of a person, often created from a cast of plaster or wax of the person's face. Famous death masks include those of composer Ludwig van Beethoven, French military leader Napoleon Bonaparte and mathematician Sir Isaac Newton. The new digital depiction of Bonnie Prince Charlie has been put on display at the Inverness museum. Mr Morrison, who usually creates his images from skulls, researched other copies of the prince's death mask, as well as painted portraits and written histories. He said: ""There are several known copies of Charles Edward Stuart's death mask in museums and private collections within the UK, some of which show slight differences to the appearance of the bridge and tip of the nose. Art has depicted the prince as a handsome charmer ""Upon first seeing the mask that is held in Inverness Museum and Art Gallery, I was not aware of this variation in different copies of the mask and had considered it to be perhaps down to Charles Edward Stuart having had a crooked nose in life. ""It would seem most likely that when different casts of the face were made throughout time, the nose, which is the most protruding area of the face, shifted slightly during the casting process causing the crooked appearance. ""After doing some research, I discovered that Lochaber Museum in Fort William also holds a copy of the mask, but the nose on this copy has a straight nasal bridge and undamaged tip. ""I went to the museum and photographed their mask to scale, and then superimposed the nasal area over the scaled photograph of the Inverness Museum copy."" The forensic artist said that working on the project had been a great opportunity to recreate the face of a highly significant individual from Scottish history. ""As the work progressed, what was revealed was the face of a curious, strong, but heavily burdened character."" Mr Morrison's other work has included a digital depiction of Ava,a woman who died in the Scottish Highlands more than 4,250 years ago. Hew Morrison's other work has included a depiction of Early Bronze Age woman Ava A spokesman for High Life Highland said: ""Prince Charles Edward Stuart's image has appeared on everything from oil painting to shortbread tins, but there are only a handful of portraits which he was known to have sat for. ""Artists of the time often sought to flatter and produced portraits that conformed to ideals of contemporary beauty, a precursor to today's photo filters. ""The use of imagery as a propaganda tool to promote the Stuart claim to the throne sees a myriad of symbolism and hidden meaning conveyed in every aspect of portraiture. ""A portrait may not simply reflect a physical likeness of a person but also their politics, allegiances, wealth or even the image of what a King should look like. ""With this in mind, can we really be sure that these portraits are a true likeness of the prince?""

"The UK and the EU have agreed a ""flexible extension"" of Brexit until 31 October European Council President Donald Tusk has urged the UK to ""not waste this time"" and said the extension could be terminated if a withdrawal deal is agreed The PM said the UK would still aim to leave the EU as soon as possible She has been updating MPs on the extension in the Commons Talks between the government and Labour to try to find a way forward are continuing Paul Seddon, Richard Morris, Harriet Agerholm and Katie Wright Today, the big news is that Theresa May travelled back from Brussels after the emergency summit among EU leaders last night to agree a further delay to Brexit. She faced anger from some in her own party in the Commons, those who favoured leaving without a deal, while some on the Labour benches applauded her for putting country over party. The PM confirmed that another referendum has not been offered in talks with the Labour Party. That's it! MPs are now in recess and will return to Parliament on 23 April. Press Association Europe needs to listen to unionist concerns about theIrish backstop, Democratic Unionist leader Arlene Foster has said. In a meeting in Brussels, Mrs Foster told the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier unionists in the region opposed the Withdrawal Agreement because of the mechanism. Afterwards, she warned that the UK and EU would move ""inexorably towards a no-deal scenario"" unless changes to the backstop were made. Mrs Foster says the EU has ignored the views of unionists on the issue, and has instead been influenced by the pro-backstop lobbying of Irish nationalists. Press Association Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns is blaming Brexit uncertainty on those who voted against the government's withdrawal agreement. He hopes the Easter break will be a time of reflection by MPs, he says. ""I was most disappointed that Parliament didn't get a majority for the withdrawal agreement because even opposition parties had expressed support for elements of it,"" he says. ""The country wants to draw a line under this, the country wants to move on to new investments and new opportunities. ""Therefore I think it's incumbent on MPs to recognise the outcome of the referendum but do so in a smooth and orderly way."" This video can not be played IMF boss: Prolonged Brexit uncertainty would have negative impact on economy The further extension to Article 50 will hinder growth in the UK economy, the head of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde tells the BBC. Christine Lagarde tells the BBC that the delay to Brexit means businesses and investors will remain hesitant in the coming months. The government's Brexit talks with Labour could end by theEuropean electionson 23 June, Downing Street is suggesting. Discussions between the government and Labour are continuing today and a ministerial meeting is scheduled to take place on Friday. But a No 10 spokesman says the talks won't continue ""for the sake of it"". ""We have stressed the urgency because there is an opportunity to avoid European parliamentary elections and to bring a resolution so that businesses and people have greater certainty,"" he tells the Press Association. ""Bluntly, we won't continue to talk for the sake of it."" If talks fail, the next step would be to put options before MPs in another series of votes, the spokesman says. BBC Radio 5 Live BBC Radio 5 Livereporter Rowan Bridge is in Blackpool. He's been speaking to Nikki and Chris from Glasgow who are on a day trip with their two children. They both voted Remain. Nikki says: ""We're left really uncertain about our future, the future for our kids and future generations and it's just a bit unsettling really."" ""Nothing's really been agreed and we're not getting any further forward, so I've not really got confidence that it will be resolved, but you never know, they might surprise us. ""[Theresa May] is not giving me much confidence so far, but we'll wait and see how things go."" Chris says: ""I think it's a shambles... There's just been arrogance from the start and I'm really disappointed in all the parties. ""I don't really see an end point... I think we'll probably have to go back to a second referendum.

Here's what the President of the European Council Donald Tusk had to say about the delay (and what his speech actually means). Polling expert Sir John Curtice says it should be assumed the UK will take part in European elections as it has run out of time to agree a deal before the deadline. The prime minister has told MPs that backing her deal would
mean there was no need for European Parliament elections â which take place on
23 May. But Sir John, professor of politics at the University of
Strathclyde, tells the BBC: âThat three-week timetable - which is what sheâs
effectively got - looks terribly, terribly tight.â He adds: âIt doesnât look as though there is long enough to
complete the whole process by which we are going to withdraw from the EU by 22
May and for all practical purposes we should now assume that the European parliamentary
elections are going to happen.â  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The government is relient on aconfidence-and supply agreement with the DUPin the House of Commons. But the Northern Irish party, which wants changes to thebackstop, has repeatedly said it will not back Theresa May's Brexit deal.  Rob WatsonBBC political correspondent It is a longer delay than Prime Minister Theresa May asked for, but shorter than most EU leaders wanted. So what will happen next? With the clocking ticking again, Mrs May wants Parliament to finally agree on the UK's withdrawal from the EU preferably before 23 May, to avoid the UK taking part in elections to the European Parliament. Her plan is first to try to get a cross-party agreement with the opposition Labour Party. If that fails, there could be a series of votes in Parliament on alternatives to her deal, such as holding a second referendum. But agreement has so far proved elusive, so it's entirely possible the UK will be back where it started at the end of extra time. Read Rob's more detailed analysishere House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Alistair Burt, whoresignedto vote against the government over Brexit, calls on the PM to be as ""flexible as possible"" when it comes to alternatives to her deal. He calls for ""free votes"" in Parliament to determine which of those alternatives commands the most support. Theresa May replies that the government is working with Labour to find a compromise that could get through the Commons. If this is not possible, the government will work to ""take votes forward"" to identify a majority opinion in Parliament. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Netanyahu hails his party's election results Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu looks all but certain to stay in office for a record fifth term after his biggest election challenger, Benny Gantz, admitted defeat on Wednesday. With almost all votes counted, both men's parties are neck and neck. But a coalition between Mr Netanyahu's Likud and smaller right-wing and religious parties could form a 65 seat majority in the 120-seat Knesset. US President Donald Trump has already offered his congratulations. Mr Netanyahu tweeted that the president had called him,externalfrom Air Force One - the US presidential aircraft - on Wednesday. If he forms a new governing coalition, Mr Netanyahu would be on course to become Israel's longest-serving prime minister, overtaking the country's founding father David Ben-Gurion. 'Bibi the magician' pulls off another trick Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM Netanyahu: What are the corruption allegations? However, he could be indicted in three corruption cases in the coming months. Mr Gantz's deputy in the centrist party has vowed to make the government's life difficult after the close result. ""We didn't win in this round. We will make Likud's life hell in the opposition,"" Yair Lapid said. In a late-night speech to supporters on Tuesday, Mr Netanyahu claimed a ""colossal victory"". ""It will be a right-wing government, but I will be prime minister for all,"" Mr Netanyahu told cheering supporters at Likud's headquarters. ""I'm very touched that the people of Israel gave me their vote of confidence for the fifth time, and an even bigger vote of confidence than previous elections. ""I intend to be the prime minister of all citizens of Israel. Right, left, Jews, non-Jews. All of Israel's citizens."" The remaining ballots, cast at military bases, will be counted over the coming days, Reuters reports. President Reuven Rivlin will then chose a leader best placed to assemble a majority. No party has ever won a sole majority in Israel's parliament and it has always had coalition governments. Exit polls had earlier predicted a tight race with no clear winner, and after initial results Mr Gantz also claimed victory. By BBC Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman, Tel Aviv Early exit polls were positive for Mr Gantz There were roars of celebration at the election night party for Benny Gantz as the first exit poll was released. His supporters believed Israel was on the brink of a new centre-ground government. But as the votes were counted overnight, Benjamin Netanyahu's success became clearer. The incumbent PM's Likud party appears most likely to be able to form another coalition government with the help of right-wing nationalist and religious parties. He said history had given the people of Israel another chance as his supporters, using his nickname, chanted: ""Bibi, the King of Israel."" With left-wing and Arab-Israeli parties suffering heavy losses, his win appears decisive, despite the most serious challenge yet to his decade in office. In the end, the prime minister was able to rally his right-wing base to deliver the votes he needed. During the campaign, he pitched himself as the sole guarantor of Israel's security. He warned that Mr Gantz would set up a ""leftist"" government with the support of Israeli Arab parties that would allow the creation of a Palestinian state, which he said would pose a mortal threat to Israel. Mr Netanyahu also promoted his foreign policy credentials, travelling abroad to meet US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and hosting Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. In a final election-day push, he warned Likud's supporters that if they stayed at home and did not vote their opponents would win. Likud was meanwhile criticised for sending 1,200 observers equipped with hidden body cameras to polling stations in Arab communities. The Arab alliance, Hadash-Taal, said it was an ""illegal"" action that sought to intimidate Arabs. Likud said it wanted to ensure only ""valid votes"" were cast. Recent weeks have seen tensions flare between Israel and Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip, and US President Donald Trump is expected to publish his plan which aims to solve Israel's long-standing conflict with the Palestinians soon. However, ways to revive the moribund peace process were not a main subject of electoral debate. Many Israelis appear to see little hope in the longstanding international formula for peace - the ""two-state solution"". The phrase denotes a final settlement that would see Israel living peacefully alongside an independent state of Palestine, defined within pre-1967 ceasefire lines in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza. In the final days of the election campaign, Mr Netanyahu made a significant announcement suggesting a new government led by him would annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. 'Alternatives' to a two-state solution Israel's once-dominant Labour party, which sealed a breakthrough peace deal with the Palestinians in the 1990s, had its worst-ever performance in this year's elections - winning just six seats. The secretary general of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), Saeb Erekat, tweeted a downbeat view of the prospects for peace. Allow Twitter content?

At the end of February, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit informed Mr Netanyahu that he intended to indict him on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three cases, pending a final hearing. Now the election is over, evidence in those cases will be turned over to the lawyers of those involved. The prime minister is accused of accepting gifts from wealthy businessmen, and of dispensing favours to garner positive press coverage. Mr Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing and said he is a victim of a political ""witch-hunt"". A date for the final hearing, at which the prime minister and his lawyers would be able to argue against the allegations, has not yet been set. Mr Mandelblit has said the Supreme Court will determine whether Mr Netanyahu has to resign if he is charged. There have been reports that Mr Netanyahu will attempt to persuade potential coalition partners to pass legislation that would grant prime ministers immunity from prosecution while in office. The Jerusalem Post reports thatLikud and four other allied parties, who together will control 61 seats in the Knesset, have made it clear that they will not require Mr Netanyahu to resign if he is charged,external. President Reuven Rivlin will consult with political parties. Afterwards, a candidate will be chosen who is deemed able to form a government that controls at least 61 seats in the Knesset. The process could take several weeks. Mr Netanyahu has promised to speedily put together a coalition with his ""natural partners"". Some Israeli analysts have predicted that this could produce a government that will accelerate the nationalist and conservative policies pursued by the outgoing administration. The ultra-Orthodox parties Shas and United Torah Judaism, which each won eight seats, have said they would join a coalition led by Mr Netanyahu. The Union of Right-Wing Parties, which won five seats, and the centre-right Kulanu party, which came away with four seats, have also said they would back him. Avigdor Lieberman, the leader of the right-wing Yisrael Beiteinu party, has yet to announce his decision. The former defence minister has said he will either sit in opposition or support Mr Netanyahu, but not back Mr Gantz.

"Shares in drugmaker Indivior plunged 71% after the US Department of Justice charged it with fraudulent marketing. Afederal grand jury in Virginia,externalaccused Indivior of a ""truly shameful scheme to put profits over the health and well-being of patients"". It alleged the firm conducted an illicit scheme to increase sales of Suboxone Film, an opioid drug used to treat opioid addiction. Indivior has issued aneight-page rebuttal,externalcontesting the charges. The company, which calls itself the world leader in addiction treatment, is listed in London, with a research centre in Hull and a US headquarters. The Department of Justice (DoJ) has demanded at least $3bn in fines.Indivior had a market valueof Â£202m after the collapse of its shares on Wednesday. Indivior's research centre opened in Hull in 2017 Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt said: ""Indivior promoted it with a disregard for the truth about its safety and despite known risks of diversion and abuse."" According to the indictment, Indivior ""obtained billions of dollars in revenue from Suboxone Film prescriptions by deceiving health care providers and health care benefit programmes into believing that Suboxone Film was safer, less divertible, and less abusable than other opioid-addiction treatment drugs"". It said Indivior ""lacked any scientific evidence to support those claims"". Indivior said: ""Put simply, Indivior is not a contributor to the opioid epidemic. Rather, as acknowledged by government experts at the FDA [Food and Drug Administration]and CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], its medicines are a key part of combatting it. ""Key allegations made by the Justice Department are contradicted by the government's own scientific agencies, they are almost exclusively based on years-old events from before Indivior became an independent company in 2014, and they are wrong."" Indivior was spun off from Reckitt Benckiser in 2014. The company's shares had already lost some four-fifths of their value before today's news, as it faced increasing competition from generic drug makers such as Dr Reddy and Mylan. While Indivior is a treatment for opioid addiction, opioid manufacturers such as Purdue Pharma, Johnson & Johnson and Teva Pharmaceuticals are also facing lawsuits. The DoJ also alleged that Indivior used a ""Here to Help"" internet and telephone programme as part of its scheme to induce physicians to write prescriptions for Suboxone Film. The DOJ's indictment said Indivior touted ""Here to Help"" as a resource for opioid-addicted patients but used the programme in part to connect patients to doctors it knew were prescribing Suboxone and other opioids to more patients than were allowed by federal law, at high doses, and in ""suspect circumstances"". Indivior denied this and said: ""To the contrary, we have engaged in an extensive education campaign to teach doctors about recommended Suboxone dosing limits and patient caps and have developed a process to identify concerning prescribers, going beyond what the law requires.""

"Tony Meadows and his wife Paula were found dead on 2 April Burglars have raided the empty home of a former Concorde pilot and his wife days after they were found dead there. The bodies of Tony and Paula Meadows, both in their 80s,were discovered last Tuesday near the village of Bucklebury, Berkshire. Mr Meadows was part of the crew during Concorde's first passenger flight from Heathrow to New York in 1977. Concorde memorabilia, cufflinks and other related items belonging to Mr Meadows were taken, police said. The house in Chapel Lane was burgled between 23:00 on Sunday and 11:00 GMT on Monday. A blue forensics tent was set up outside the couple's house near Bucklebury Det Insp Alice Broad, of Thames Valley Police, said: ""We are investigating this burglary in which it's thought a number of items linked to Concorde and Anthony Meadows's work as a pilot were stolen. ""These items have sentimental value to the family who have recently lost both their mother and father just last week."" ""We would ask anyone who may have been offered these items for sale to please get in touch with Thames Valley Police."" There will be additional patrols around the house because of the burglary The family has since removed further valuables and memorabilia from the property into safe storage. Police said the attached property was still occupied and there would be additional patrols around the house. Det Insp Alice Broad appealed to the thieves to ""look into their conscience and return the items that hold valuable memories for the family"".

"Pop group Little Mix had a cover shoot with Asos magazine in November Online fashion retailer Asos has seen its profits plunge, after a difficult year caused by heavy discounting and website traffic issues. Asos' pre-tax profits fell 87% to Â£4m for the six months to 28 February against the same period in 2018. The firm said it had managed to stabilise sales, which rose 14% to Â£1.3bn for the period. Asos said marketing changes meant a fall in visits to its websites and a drop in its search engine rankings. Asos shares are up 13% in morning trading. Chief executive Nick Beighton said that Asos had identified a number of things it ""can do better"", and that heavy investment in its platforms gave the retailer ""increased confidence"" that its performance would improve in the second half of the year. He added that the global fashion industry was growing and now worth more than Â£220bn. ""We now have the tech platform, the infrastructure, a constant conversation with our growing customer base who love our own great product and the constantly evolving edit of brands we present to them,"" said Mr Beighton. Asos said its financial guidance for the year remained the same. In December,Asos warned on profits, saying that cutting prices to match rivals had not led to a significant increase in sales, sparking a 40% fall in the share price. The profit warning came as a shock to many, as Asos was seen as an online disrupter to the High Street fashion market. ""The company's current predicament shows people are simply spending less on goods, be it in physical or virtual shops,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Sophie Lund-Yates. Despite the heavy discounting, she feels that Asos is now on the right track, particularly if spending stabilises over the next year. ""Asos is still very much a growth story, and its vast customer base, and growing international proposition, mean it should be able to prosper from here on in,"" said Ms Lund-Yates. In early April, Asos announced thatit was changing its returns policy. The time allowed for returns of unwanted items has been lengthened from 28 days to 45 days. However, the retailer warned customers that if it suspected that individuals were actually wearing goods and then returning them, or ordering and returning ""loads"", it might deactivate the account. A popular rising trend has seen customers post pictures on social media of themselves in new outfits. Certain users do not like being seen in the same outfit twice, making it tempting to use an outfit once and return it. Asos said a new marketing strategy had an impact on web traffic to its website Asos said that initiatives designed to improve its business had hit profits, from decisions on short-term pricing and inventory, to new marketing strategies. To stay competitive, the retailer launched 200 versions of its website depending on which country the customer is in, which had a negative effect on Asos' search engine rankings. Asos also made changes to the way customers navigate around its main website, particularly in how new products were displayed. Asos has redesigned the customer navigation menus on its website, to make product categories clearer Asos said that the changes resulted in a slowdown in the growth of younger customers, but UK sales rose 16% due to orders from existing customers. Although US sales growth was below expectations, the retailer said that demand far exceeded its expectations in February, once its new warehouse in Atlanta went online. Sales rose by 80% in the first three days after the warehouse went into operation, to the extent that Asos did not have enough staff to cope with demand, and there was a delay in sending out packages to customers. According to Neil Wilson, chief market analyst for Markets.com, the price of Asos shares is rising because investors are willing to ""take a bet on the future"". Although the share price hasn't returned to the heights it reached prior to the December profit warning, Asos actually isn't doing that badly. ""Asos is still flying, it's still outperforming the market. It set itself a very high bar previously,"" Mr Wilson told the BBC. ""Asos has a lot going for it - if you look at the US, there's huge, huge growth about to happen, I think we saw that with the warehouse problem they had. ""That's a great problem to have.""

"Stockpiling by manufacturers ahead of Brexit helped the UK economy grow by 0.3% in the three months to February. The Office for National Statistics pointed to manufacturers ""changing the timing of their activities"" as the UK's exit from the EU approaches. Although growth was stronger than the 0.2% many economists forecast, Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS, said growth ""remained modest"". On a monthly measure, the economy grew by 0.2%, faster than the 0% forecast. The 0.3% rise in the three months to February, was the same as the three months to January, after previous estimate was revised higher. ""Services again drove the economy, with a continued strong performance in IT. Manufacturing also continued to recover after weakness at the end of last year with the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry, chemicals and alcohol performing well in recent months,"" said Mr Kent-Smith. Output in production and manufacturing rose for the second month in a row, with manufacturing  at its highest level since April 2008, the ONS said. The ONS said production industries expanded by 0.2% in the three months to February 2019. This was the first positive three-month growth since October 2018. It said there had been external evidence ""that some manufacturing businesses have changed the timing of their activity as we approached the original planned date for the UK's departure from the European Union"". ""Although the ONS does not routinely collect detailed data on the reasons behind the behaviour of businesses, as part of our survey validation we have found some qualitative evidence that supported this view but were unable to quantify its impact,"" it added. The ONS pointed to a closely-watched survey by IHS Markit/CIPSwhich showed UK factories were stockpiling goods for Brexit. This video can not be played Brexit: Cake factory would grind to halt without cream cheese Lola's Cupcakes is one company which decided it needed to build up stocks of essential items ahead of Brexit. In its case, it was cream cheese. Asher Budwig, managing director, said the company had identified the ingredient as one at risk from Brexit. Others might have been chocolate or butter. There would be ""no cheese cakes, no decorations on cupcakes"" if ferries stopped getting through ports, he told BBC. The company bought Â£35,000 of stock - that does not include storage costs - through its supplier which obtains the product from Germany. ""They [the supplier] spoke to the factory in Germany, they produced a lot more, ten times what we would normally go through in a given week,"" he said. ""It's being held down in Somerset,"" he said. Month-on-month growth in the industrial production sector was 0.6% in February, with manufacturing increasing 0.9%, the ONS said. Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the activity in this sector was the main reason the economy had grown more quickly than expected. He said this might be ""due to a temporary boost to production which will unwind"" in the second quarter of the year. Construction output also rose faster than expected, perhaps because of the warmer than usual weather in February, he added. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, also highlighted these areas as the main surprises in the data. But she said: ""Growth does not appear to have been significantly boosted by stockpiling ahead of Brexit."" Instead, she said that while businesses have been stockpiling it is because they have been importing more. Imports rose by 5.3% in the three months to February while exports rose just 0.8%, according to the ONS. She said: ""Admittedly, the Brexit chaos may have sapped the economy of its momentum in March, as that is when the Brexit uncertainty has been greatest. ""All told, though, the solid growth rate in the three months to February should ease immediate fears of the economy stalling or contracting in the first quarter and provides support to our view that the economy is well placed to cope with whatever Brexit throws up next,"" she said. Mr Tombs said he was revising up his forecast for growth in the first quarter to 0.4% from 0.3%, which indicates annual growth of between 1.8% and 2%. This could point to a rate rise from the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee. ""So the data, together with strong wage growth, put renewed pressure on the MPC to follow through on its commitment to an 'ongoing tightening of monetary policy', despite continued Brexit uncertainty,"" he said.

"This video can not be played New Zealand PM, Jacinda Ardern: ""These weapons were designed to kill"" New Zealand's parliament has voted to ban military-style semi-automatic weapons following the Christchurch attacks. The gun reform bill passed 119-1 after the final reading in parliament. It is expected to become law within the next few days after receiving royal assent from the governor general. PM Jacinda Ardern announced changes to the law after 50 people were killed last month by a suspected lone gunman at two mosques in Christchurch. Holding back tears, she told parliament on Wednesday that MPs were there ""because of the victims and families"". She said that when she had visited the injured in hospital none of them had had just one gunshot wound. ""They will carry disabilities for a lifetime and that's before you consider the psychological impact,"" she said. ""These weapons were designed to kill, and they were designed to maim and that is what they did on the 15th of March."" AustralianBrenton Tarrant, a self-proclaimed white supremacist, faces 50 murder chargesand 39 attempted murder charges. The new rules make changes to 1983 gun laws which have been the subject of several reform attempts. They prohibit military-style semi-automatic weapons and parts that can be used to assemble prohibited firearms. The gunman, armed with semi-automatic rifles including an AR-15, is believed to have modified his weapons with high-capacity magazines so they could hold more bullets. The magazine is the part of the gun which stores ammunition. How mass shootings have changed gun laws What are New Zealand's gun laws? Those breaking the new laws will face between two and ten years in jail. An amnesty will be in place until the end of September. David Seymour, leader of the ACT party, was the only MP to come out against the bill, although he did not oppose the proposed changes to gun laws. He said the bill was ""not an attempt to improve public safety"" but ""an exercise in political theatre"". He said he believed the rush to put the bill through the house had made the law worse than doing nothing. Jacinda Ardern said parliament was ""almost entirely united"". ""I cannot imagine circumstances where that is more necessary than it is now,"" she added.

"A painting made of Bonnie Prince Charlie in the 1740s and the new digital depiction of him as an older man A digital facial depiction of Bonnie Prince Charlie has been created using a death mask made of the prince after he died in 1788 aged 67. Prince Charles Edward Stuart sought to regain the Great British throne for his father in the Jacobite Rising of 1745. His army was defeated by government forces at the Battle of Culloden, near Inverness, on 16 April 1746. He has been celebrated in literature and art as a handsome charmer, but the new image portrays him as an older man. Culloden Battlefield protection reviewed Bonnie Prince Charlie 'was a tough guy' The myths of Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Jacobites The prince died in Palazzo Muti, Rome. The death mask used by forensic artist Hew Morrison is held in the collection at High Life Highland's Inverness Museum and Art Gallery. Death masks are a likeness of a person, often created from a cast of plaster or wax of the person's face. Famous death masks include those of composer Ludwig van Beethoven, French military leader Napoleon Bonaparte and mathematician Sir Isaac Newton. The new digital depiction of Bonnie Prince Charlie has been put on display at the Inverness museum. Mr Morrison, who usually creates his images from skulls, researched other copies of the prince's death mask, as well as painted portraits and written histories. He said: ""There are several known copies of Charles Edward Stuart's death mask in museums and private collections within the UK, some of which show slight differences to the appearance of the bridge and tip of the nose. Art has depicted the prince as a handsome charmer ""Upon first seeing the mask that is held in Inverness Museum and Art Gallery, I was not aware of this variation in different copies of the mask and had considered it to be perhaps down to Charles Edward Stuart having had a crooked nose in life. ""It would seem most likely that when different casts of the face were made throughout time, the nose, which is the most protruding area of the face, shifted slightly during the casting process causing the crooked appearance. ""After doing some research, I discovered that Lochaber Museum in Fort William also holds a copy of the mask, but the nose on this copy has a straight nasal bridge and undamaged tip. ""I went to the museum and photographed their mask to scale, and then superimposed the nasal area over the scaled photograph of the Inverness Museum copy."" The forensic artist said that working on the project had been a great opportunity to recreate the face of a highly significant individual from Scottish history. ""As the work progressed, what was revealed was the face of a curious, strong, but heavily burdened character."" Mr Morrison's other work has included a digital depiction of Ava,a woman who died in the Scottish Highlands more than 4,250 years ago. Hew Morrison's other work has included a depiction of Early Bronze Age woman Ava A spokesman for High Life Highland said: ""Prince Charles Edward Stuart's image has appeared on everything from oil painting to shortbread tins, but there are only a handful of portraits which he was known to have sat for. ""Artists of the time often sought to flatter and produced portraits that conformed to ideals of contemporary beauty, a precursor to today's photo filters. ""The use of imagery as a propaganda tool to promote the Stuart claim to the throne sees a myriad of symbolism and hidden meaning conveyed in every aspect of portraiture. ""A portrait may not simply reflect a physical likeness of a person but also their politics, allegiances, wealth or even the image of what a King should look like. ""With this in mind, can we really be sure that these portraits are a true likeness of the prince?""

"China sees the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist and claim the right to choose his successor The Dalai Lama has been admitted to hospital in the Indian capital, Delhi, with a chest infection, but is reported to be in a stable condition. His private aide Tenzin Taklha said he was flown to Delhi from his hill town base after complaining of discomfort. The Dalai Lama fled to India 60 years ago as Chinese troops crushed an attempted uprising in Tibet. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his opposition to violence in his quest for Tibetan self-rule. The Nobel peace laureate is a hugely popular speaker but has cut down his global engagements in recent years. ""Doctors have diagnosed him with a chest infection and he is being treated for that. His condition is stable now. He will be treated for two-three days here,"" Tenzin Taklha told Reuters news agency. China took control of Tibet in 1950 and sees the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist. Who will succeed the Dalai Lama when he dies remains both unclear and contentious. China says its leaders have the right to choose a successor. But last month, the Dalai Lama reiterated that any leader named by China would not be accepted by Tibetans.

"Sweat bees sometimes land on people to imbibe perspiration A Taiwanese woman was found by doctors to have four small sweat bees living inside her eye, the first such incident on the island. The 28-year-old woman, identified only as Ms He, was pulling out weeds when the insects flew into her eyes. Dr Hong Chi Ting of the Fooyin University Hospital told the BBC he was ""shocked"" when he pulled the 4mm insects out by their legs. Ms He has now been discharged and is expected to make a full recovery. Sweat bees, also known as Halictidae, are attracted to sweat and sometimes land on people to imbibe perspiration.They also drink tears,externalfor their high protein content, according to a study by the Kansas Entomological Society. Ms He was weeding around her relatives' graves when the insects flew into her left eye. She was visiting the grave as part of the annual Chinese Qing Ming tomb-sweeping festival, which is traditionally observed by sprucing up loved ones' graves. When a gust of wind blew into her eyes she assumed it was dirt that had entered, she told reporters. The tiny sweat bees were found inside her left eye But hours later, her eyes were still swollen and in pain, leading her to seek medical help at the hospital in southern Taiwan. The woman's eye was badly swollen when she went to seek medical treatment ""She couldn't completely close her eyes. I looked into the gap with a microscope and saw something black that looked like an insect leg,"" Dr Hong, an ophthalmology professor at the hospital told the BBC. ""I grabbed the leg and very slowly took one out, then I saw another one, and another and another. They were still intact and all alive."" Dr Hong added that the bees could have been blown inside her eye by a gust of wind and found themselves stuck inside. ""These bees don't usually attack people but they like drinking sweat, hence their name,"" he said. Mushrooms may 'reduce the risk of mild brain decline' Chickens 'gang up' to kill fox Last photos of Kenya's 'elephant queen' Dr Hong added that Ms He was ""lucky"" that she did not rub her eyes while the bees were inside. ""She was wearing contact lenses so she didn't dare to rub her eyes in case she broke the lens. If she did she could have induced the bees to produce venom... she could have gone blind."" But what's happened to the bees? ""They are still alive, they've been sent as specimens to another organisation and will be studied,"" said Dr Hong.

"Shana Grice was murdered by her ex-boyfriend who stalked her Three police officers are facing disciplinary action over the case of a woman who was fined for wasting police time when she reported the stalker ex who went on to murder her. Shana Grice, 19, reported Michael Lane five times before he slit her throat and tried to burn her body. Her parents slammed Sussex Police for ""treating her like a criminal"", adding the action was ""too little too late"". A report found stalking cases were not being properly investigated. Two officers - one retired - will face gross misconduct proceedings at public hearings in May. A third officer faces internal misconduct action. Sharon Grice and Richard Green said: ""Our daughter took her concerns to the police and instead of being protected was treated like a criminal. She paid for the police's lack of training, care and poor attitude with her life. ""It's only right that the police make changes, but it's too little, too late for Shana. ""Sussex Police should not be applauded for this."" Michael Lane was convicted of murdering Miss Grice in 2017 No further action will be taken against five officers investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), while six other force employees - three officers and three staff - have been given ""management advice and further training"". The independent report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) was commissioned after Miss Grice was killed in her bedroom in Portslade, near Brighton, East Sussex, in 2016. Stalking and harassment is more common in Sussex than the national average, it said. However, victims were often not referred to specialised support services and the force regularly failed to use powers including searching perpetrators' homes or seeking injunctions. Lane fitted a tracker to Miss Grice's car and stole a house key to sneak into her room as she slept. He was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 25 years in March 2017. It later emerged that 13 other women had reported him to police for stalking. Murdered teen's stalker ex-boyfriend jailed 'He said he was close enough to smell my hair' Police ordered to improve stalking probes At his sentencing, Mr Justice Nicholas Green said officers had ""jumped to conclusions"" and ""stereotyped"" Miss Grice. Assistant Chief Constable Nick May said: ""We deeply regret the tragic death of Shana Grice in 2016 and are committed to constantly improving our understanding of stalking and our response to it. ""When we looked at the circumstances leading to Shana's murder, we felt we may not have done the very best we could and made a referral to the IOPC."" Police found a tracking device on Miss Grice's car Sarah Green, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ""The police watchdog findings that Sussex Police failed and that there will be misconduct hearings are welcome, but much more is needed. ""Numerous inquests and inquiries have found that multiple police forces have failed to protect women who were murdered."" The report also called on the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) for a single definition for stalking to be adopted by police forces and government departments. Sussex Police has been given three months to make improvements.

"A whisky advert featuring a man leaping off a cliff has been banned for promoting ""risky behaviour"". The Macallan ad, which was broadcast on various platforms, showed the man falling towards the ground before sprouting wings and flying away. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that the advert was irresponsible. It said the opening scene could be seen as ""reminiscent of the extreme sport of base jumping"". The Macallan's owner Edrington had argued that its first global advertising campaign was a ""fantastical story"" which did not link alcohol with ""bravery, daring or toughness"". The regulator said it received six complaints after the advert was broadcast on TV, video on demand and Instagram in December.

"Profits at Tesco have jumped 28% in what the UK's biggest supermarket chain described as an ""uncertain"" market. Chief executive Dave Lewis said the group was on track to meet the ""vast majority"" of the turnaround goals he set when he was appointed four years ago after an accounting scandal. The group said its performance was ""strong"", and Tesco has almost doubled its dividend. Full-year pre-tax profits were Â£1.7bn, with Tesco's same store sales up 1.7%. ""After four years we have met, or are about to meet, the vast majority of our turnaround goals. I'm very confident that we will complete the journey in 2019/2020,"" said Mr Lewis, who oversaw the takeover of wholesaler Booker in 2017. ""I'm delighted with the broad-based improvement across the business,"" he said. Overall like-for-like sales (which strip out changes to stores) rose 2.9%, including the 1.7% at Tesco and 11.1% for Booker. Group sales fell in Asia. Tesco's new discount chain Jack's takes on Aldi and Lidl Tesco reports best Christmas in 10 years Jobs have been lost as he aims to save Â£1.5bn a year and up to 9,000 roles were put at risk in January when the chain announced it would close food counters in 90 stores. He has also launched a discount chain, Jack's, to take on German rivals Aldi and Lidl, which Tesco said had received a ""strong response"" in the eight new stores. The proposed tie-up between Sainsbury's and Asda, which is currently being investigated by the competition authorities, could further change the landscape, said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. ""External threats are also putting pressure on the retailer with continued uncertainty due to Brexit and the turbulent High Street conditions, evidenced by its decision to cut up to 9,000 jobs by shutting the fresh food counters at 90 stores. ""With Marks & Spencer's tie up with Ocado and Amazon's new grocery arm, Amazon Fresh, Dave Lewis will be wary of standing still and instead will want to keep moving,"" she said. The chain said it would set out some ""untapped value opportunities"" at a presentation in June. Booker ""bulk buys"" are already being offered in  70 Tesco stores and will be expanded this year, while Jack's will also be expanded. Mr Lewis has previously said that in the lead-up to Brexit Tesco was focusing on how to ensure movements of fresh food were not held up. As he presented the results on Wednesday, he said Tesco had been building stock of ""non-perishable"" goods such as canned food ahead of a possible no-deal exit from the European Union. But he added Tesco had not seen any ""discernible change in behaviour"" from customers during the period of Brexit uncertainty, with no evidence of stockpiling from customers. Mr Lewis said that Tesco's stockpiling was a ""sensible provision"" but that he hoped a no deal exit would not happen. The shares rose 2% in early trading while the dividend is increasing to 5.77p a share from 3p the previous year.

"A whisky advert featuring a man leaping off a cliff has been banned for promoting ""risky behaviour"". The Macallan ad, which was broadcast on various platforms, showed the man falling towards the ground before sprouting wings and flying away. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that the advert was irresponsible. It said the opening scene could be seen as ""reminiscent of the extreme sport of base jumping"". The Macallan's owner Edrington had argued that its first global advertising campaign was a ""fantastical story"" which did not link alcohol with ""bravery, daring or toughness"". The regulator said it received six complaints after the advert was broadcast on TV, video on demand and Instagram in December. It noted that the opening scene in all versions of the ad featured a man running and jumping off a cliff. The ASA said: ""We noted that at that point in the ads, there was no suggestion that the male character had any super-human attributes or powers, or that he was part of a mythical world"".

Greased Lightnin' has become a wedding staple and school productions of the show remain popular. The film when it came seven years later made a global star of Olivia Newton-John and confirmed John Travolta as one of Hollywood's most in-demand actors.

"More than 100 new HIV cases were identified among drug users in Glasgow city centre between 2015 and 2017 A rise in cocaine injecting and homelessness are behind a 10-fold increase in HIV infection among drug users in Glasgow, research suggests. The Glasgow city centre outbreak is the UK's largest in more than 30 years. The study - conducted between 2011 and 2018 - involved almost 4,000 people who inject drugs in Greater Glasgow and Clyde. More than 100 new cases of HIV were identified among drug users in the city between 2015 and 2017. Before that, the number of new cases among drug users across Scotland had ""remained stable"" at about 15 a year. Scientists at Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) said a seven-year study showed increased injecting and homelessness were key factors in producing ""a perfect HIV storm"". MP launches bid to legalise 'fix rooms' Are UK drug consumption rooms likely? MSPs support 'fix room' law change Dr Andrew McAuley, a senior research fellow in blood borne viruses at GCU, said there had been ""a hugely significant increase in the prevalence of HIV infection in the population of people who inject drugs in Glasgow"". This was ""largely driven by an outbreak of HIV first detected in 2015"", he added. Cocaine injecting was ""one of the strongest drivers"" behind the outbreak, and the phenomenon of cocaine injecting is ""fairly new to Scotland"", Dr McAuley explained. Elsewhere in the world, drug users tend to inject crack cocaine. In Scotland, however, powder cocaine injecting is more prevalent. He went on to say that ""puts users at particular risk of blood borne virus transmission"" because cocaine is a stimulant so users inject more frequently than they would inject heroin. ""With people who are injecting more frequently, their ability to access clean and sterile equipment for every injection is compromised so that certainly puts people at risk."" There have been calls for safe ""fix rooms"" to be set up Dr McAuley also claimed the study, published in the Lancet HIV medical journal,supported those arguing for a safe drugs consumption roomto be set up in Glasgow city centre. He pointed to more than nine out of 10 people diagnosed with HIV now being successfully engaged in treatment. Dr McAuley said: ""The prevalence of HIV has been low and stable in this population since major outbreaks of HIV in the 1980s in Edinburgh and Dundee. ""However, the prevalence of HIV in Glasgow has increased 10-fold among people who inject drugs in the past seven years, from just 1% to over 10% in the city centre. ""The key drivers of infection are an increase in cocaine injecting, and homelessness. ""We also have a large population of people who inject in public places in Glasgow at a time when HIV has re-emerged. ""A combination of these factors has created a perfect storm for rapid transmission of HIV among people who inject drugs in Glasgow."" The research, carried out together with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the University of the West of Scotland, found the number of drug users with HIV went from one in 87 in 2011-12 to 25 out of 231 in 2017-18. The proportion of users who were infected went up from from 1.1% to 10.8%. The HIV outbreak in Glasgow occurred ""despite the existence of a comprehensive harm reduction environment"", the research found. It highlighted that more than one million clean needles and syringes are distributed among drug injectors every year. Dr McAuley said the research ""provides further justification for interventions such as the proposed drug consumption room and heroin-assisted treatment services in Glasgow"". He added: ""Crucially, over 90% of the individuals diagnosed as part of the outbreak have been successfully engaged in HIV treatment as a result of the multidisciplinary response implemented by the health board."" Glasgow Health and Social Care Partnership (HSCP), which supports opening a ""safe"" injecting room, welcomed the findings of the study. Susanne Millar, the body's chief officer for strategy and operations, said it provided ""further credible evidence for looking beyond current methods for helping this very vulnerable group"". She added: ""We anticipate opening a Heroin Assisted Treatment facility in Glasgow later this year which will benefit heroin users who inject cocaine also, one of the groups most at risk of HIV transmission."" The Scottish government's public health minister, Joe FitzPatrick, said: ""We support Glasgow Health and Social Care Partnership's proposals to introduce a secure, medically supervised consumption facility. ""We must be willing to back innovative, evidence-based approaches that can make a real difference to people's lives."" He added that an expert group on drugs had been convened to examine what further changes ""either in practice or in the law, could help save lives and reduce harm"".

"This video can not be played Linzi Page: ""When you go through this the time with your family is so precious."" Linzi Page thinks her bowel cancer was not diagnosed because doctors do not expect people under 50 to get the disease. The 36-year-old first went to see her GP in January last year after weeks of ""strange"" bowel movements and rectal bleeding. Linzi, from Burntisland in Fife, toldBBC Scotland's The Ninethat her doctor was ""dismissive"" and said it was ""probably"" Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The doctor carried out a routine blood test and stool sample but nothing irregular showed up. Almost three months later Linzi went to see another doctor and was sent for an ""urgent colonoscopy"". Linzi said she was not diagnosed earlier because of her age At the end of April, she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic bowel cancer and has since been given two years' to live. Linzi, who has two young children, says: ""If I had been caught earlier I might be in a much better situation than I am currently. ""I think GPs need to be more aware that people under 50 are getting bowel cancer."" ""I spoke to my doctors and I was very frank and I said if I had gone with the same symptoms at 60, they would have sent me for a colonoscopy. ""But the fact I was 35, they just procrastinated and it was not dealt with quickly enough."" In response, NHS Fife said they were unable to comment on the care of individual patients for ""reasons of confidentiality"". Bowel cancer is Scotland's second biggest cancer killer. About 3,700 people are diagnosed with the condition every year but only about 200 are under 50 years old. Claire Donaghy, from Bowel Cancer UK, said it was difficult for GPs to recognise bowel cancer in younger people, particularly given the prevalence of IBS and other conditions. ""Most GPs in their lifetime might only see one person under 50 that has a bowel cancer,"" she says. ""It is difficult for them."" Ms Donaghy said younger patients needed to be reassured that they probably had nothing to worry about but they should keep a note of their symptoms and go back if they do not improve. Linzi Page says she was ""devastated"" by her diagnosis. She has since found that she has tumours on her liver and her cancer has spread to her lungs. ""I was told in December it was incurable and they have given me one to two years to live,"" Linzi says. Linzi called for greater awareness of the condition in the under 50s She is currently trying to raise funds for a drug called Avastin, which is not available on the NHS in Scotland but she hopes can prolong her life. Linzi would like to see doctors becoming more aware of the risk of bowel cancer among younger people. The NHS in Scotland currently runs a screening programme for people over 50. Linzi called for screening to be extended to people under 50 but the Scottish government said there was not enough evidence for lowering the age. Linzi says she does not want to waste her time complaining about doctors but wants to raise awareness of the condition among younger people. ""My life is really precious to me, my time with my kids is really precious to me,"" she says. ""It chokes me to think I might not be in my kids' lives. I can't think about that. I try to live day by day.""

"The government has announced the locations of 12 ""Institutes of Technology"" in England, intended to provide high-quality skills training. The aim is to offer young people a vocational alternative to universities. Employers will support the institutes, most of which will be based around existing colleges and universities. The dozen include three in London, two in the west Midlands and with others in Milton Keynes, Swindon, Durham, Exeter, York and Somerset. Prime Minister Theresa May said they would ""end outdated perceptions"" that were biased against vocational skills. But Labour said the plans were too small-scale and would not help the ""overwhelming majority"" of students in technical education. Vocational training has often been seen as being underserved by the education system, with more status attached to young people taking an academic pathway, through GCSEs, A-levels and university. The idea of introducing a network of Institutes of Technology is to create a high-quality route to gain skills and technical qualifications, comparable to going to university. They will begin opening from the autumn, supported by funding of Â£170m. The institutes, based in further education colleges and universities, will each have an industry specialism, and use the expertise of relevant employers. For instance, the planned institute in Durham will involve local colleges, Newcastle University and Nissan, with a specialism in ""digital advanced manufacturing"". In east London, Queen Mary, University of London will lead a group with Newham College and employers including Siemens, with specialisms of transport and engineering. Craft workers should have their own titles Firms re-labelling jobs as apprenticeships Starbucks offers to pay degree fees to keep staff There have been warnings that by international standards England has relatively low numbers of people trained for advanced vocational skills. The review of higher education funding, chaired by financier Philip Augar, is believed to have been looking at ways to improve access to student finance for those taking vocational courses. There are plans for a new technical qualification, the T-level, to be introduced next year, which is the latest attempt to create a vocational equivalent to A-levels. ""I firmly believe that education is key to opening up opportunity for everyone - but to give our young people the skills they need to succeed, we need an education and training system which is more flexible and diverse than it is currently,"" said the prime minister. ""These new institutes will help end outdated perceptions that going to university is the only desirable route, and build a system which harnesses the talents of our young people,"" said Mrs May. Matthew Fell, policy director of the CBI business group, said: ""Expanding high-quality technical education and training is a top priority for employers, who will welcome this extra investment."" The institutes will be the ""pinnacle of technical training"", said Education Secretary Damian Hinds. He hoped they would ""make sure young people have the skills they need to build a well-paid rewarding career, while the economy gains the skilled workers it needs to be more productive"". But Labour's shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said the institutes did not match the scale of the demand. ""While investment in further education is desperately needed, this announcement will do nothing for the overwhelming majority of providers and students in technical education,"" said Ms Rayner. She said the funding did not replace the money already lost to further and adult education budgets - and the proposed institutes did not cover enough of the country. ""When they first announced this policy years ago, the government said they would make higher-level technical education available in all areas, yet this list does not include a single university or college in the north-west,"" she said.

"Mr Trump on Tuesday denied reports that his administration was planning to separate migrant families US President Donald Trump has lashed out at a judge for blocking his policy of sending asylum seekers to Mexico to await court hearings in their cases. ""A 9th Circuit judge just ruled that Mexico is too dangerous for migrants,"" he tweeted. ""So unfair to the US."" His policy would have returned migrants back over the border while they sought a legal right to stay in the US. The legal defeat comes as migrant numbers at the US-Mexico border surged to their highest since 2008. Mr Trump was said to be livid after US immigration officials estimated border apprehensions in March had topped 100,000. The San Francisco federal judge's order on Monday against the migrant policy is not due to go into effect until this Friday. The White House said in a statement on Tuesday it would appeal the decision. ""This action gravely undermines the president's ability to address the crisis at the border with the tools Congress has authorised and disrupts the conduct of our foreign affairs,"" the White House said in a statement. ""We intend to appeal, and we will take all necessary action to defend the executive branch's lawful efforts to resolve the crisis at our southern border."" Allow Twitter content?

DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen quit on Sunday after being summoned to the White House by the president. This was followed by the resignation of the agency's acting deputy secretary, Claire Grady, on Wednesday. Ms Grady was legally supposed to take over from Ms Nielsen.

""He's pulling the rug out from the very people that are trying to help him accomplish his goal."" Last week Mr Trump rescinded his own nomination of Ronald Vitiello as director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

There are also reports that the president is preparing to toughen his stance on immigration. According to the New York Times,external, Mr Trump is considering implementing further limits on asylum seekers, ending birthright citizenship, and closing ports of entry at the Mexican border. But Mr Trump denied on Tuesday reports that his administration was planning once again to separate families caught crossing the border. ""We are not looking to do it,"" he said. He added: ""Once you don't have it [child separation], that's why you see many more people coming. They're coming like it's a picnic because let's go to Disneyland."" Trump retreats on threat to close border New border migrant separations revealed This video can not be played 'I thought we would be treated differently in US' More than 2,700 immigrant children were separated from their parents last year under a so-called zero tolerance US policy to prosecute anyone caught crossing the border illegally. According to US media, the White House has recently been considering a ""binary choice"" policy. This would give migrant parents awaiting immigration hearings two options: agree for their child to be held separately, or be detained together, possibly indefinitely, until their court date. A 1997 court decision known as the Flores agreement states that immigrant children are only allowed to be held for 20 days.

"Descendants of the first students to take part in inter-university games are being sought as the annual Welsh Varsity is held 100 years on. Cardiff University was one of 10 founding members of the Inter-Varsity Board of England and Wales, which first competed in 1919. An expected 20,000 spectators will watch 900 athletes contest 46 events across Cardiff on Wednesday. Thousands of Swansea and Cardiff students will take part. Ranging from the traditional football, cricket and rowing, to the slightly more unusual canoe polo and ultimate frisbee, varsity also raises tens of thousands of pounds for charity. Cardiff University's 1925 hockey team followed on from the successes of the 1919 first inter-university games The day culminates with the flagship women's and then men's rugby matches at the Principality Stadium. It's all a far cry from the first Welsh Varsity 1997 competition, where the only sport on offer was rugby, watched by a modest crowd of just 974 at Cardiff Arms Park. However, head of sport at Cardiff University, Stuart Vanstone, explained sporting rivalries between Welsh universities went back much further than 1997. Playing canoe polo on a football field IOC recognises 'Ultimate Frisbee' Welsh bow on korfball world stage ""For Cardiff, this year's varsity marks 100 years since we first competed in inter-university sport. ""Then called University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, we were one of 10 founding members of the Inter-Varsity Athletics Board of England and Wales - which also included Bangor and Aberystwyth - and we took part in their inaugural games in Manchester in May 1919. ""We'd be delighted if we could track down the descendants of anyone who took part in those games."" Cardiff University's current women's football team Events included athletics, netball, tennis, as well as tug-of-war, and took place in front of a crowd of 2,000. The Manchester Guardian reported that BC Watson of Cardiff competed in the high jump and had ""by far the prettier style, but he appeared to tire at the critical moment and was placed third"". Hardly surprising he was tired as BC Watson had had a busy day; also coming third in the final of the 100 yards race. Swansea missed out on that event as they were not formed until the following year, but by the late 1920s they too were strong members of the Inter-Varsity Athletics Board, making their mark with a 2-0 hockey win over Bangor in 1924, and going on to excel in cricket, rugby and tennis in particular. Inter-university sport is now organised by BUCS (British Universities and Colleges Sport), who oversee 4,800 teams across 170 UK colleges and universities. The university had teams predating the inter-varsity board, such as this men's polo team from 1912..... .... and this tennis club from 1899. However, for Katie Davies - who has a foot in both camps, the Cardiff/Swansea rivalry eclipses all others. Final-year archaeology student Katie will be the lone striker for Cardiff in her third women's football varsity match, but plays her club football for Swansea City in the Welsh Women's Premier League. ""I've played for the Swans in the Champions' League, Welsh Cup finals and league deciders, but I can honestly say I never get more nervous than before a varsity match,"" she said. ""Everyone gets swept up in the whole derby day thing, the two city rivals coming together, and the atmosphere is incredible. ""I'll definitely be feeling the pressure as it's my final game and we've drawn the last two so I finally want to get one over on them, plus with having a foot in both camps, if we don't win I'll really get some ribbing off the Swansea girls."" The destination of the overall Varsity Shield is determined by points awarded for all 46 events, but none is more keenly contested than the two blue-ribbon Varsity Cups, awarded for the men's and women's  rugby matches. Cardiff's men look for their third win in a row against an injury-weakened Swansea side. Meanwhile Swansea's women are strong favourites, as they now compete in the BUCS Premier League, a division above Cardiff.

"Spending on children's mental health services - such as school counsellors and drop-in centres - has fallen in real terms in more than a third of areas in England, a report shows. The study, by the Children's Commissioner, found spending had risen by 17% overall but many children faced a ""postcode lottery"" of provision. Anne Longfield said the figures were ""extremely worrying"". Officials said investing in these services was a priority. The report looked at spending on so-called ""low level"" mental health services - designed to prevent or treat problems such as depression, eating disorders or anxiety - preventing the need for intensive, specialist intervention. In general, half the funding comes from the NHS and half from local authorities. The report found that very high-spending areas were masking a larger proportion of low-spending areas, and that wide variations existed across the country. According to the report: Around Â£226m was spent on low-level children's mental health services in 2018-19 - an increase of 17% in real-terms (taking inflation into account) on the previous year While the top quarter of local areas spent Â£1.1m or more over the financial year, the bottom 25% spent Â£177,000 or less 58% of areas reported a real-terms increase in spending between 2018-19 But 37% saw a real-terms fall - often driven by a reduction in local authority spending In London, local authority spending was Â£17.88 per child compared with Â£5.32 in the East of England Ms Longfield said: ""This report reveals for the first time the postcode lottery facing the increasing number of children suffering from low-level mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. ""The children I speak to who are suffering from conditions like anxiety or depression aren't asking for intensive inpatient therapeutic treatment, they just want to be able to talk to a counsellor about their worries and to be offered advice on how to stop their problems turning into a crisis."" A statement from the Department of Health and Social Care said government plans would allow 70,000 more children a year to have access to specialist mental health care by 2020-21. ""Early intervention is vital and we're going further, piloting a four-week waiting time standard for treatment, training a brand new dedicated mental health workforce for schools across the country, and teaching pupils what good mental and physical health looks like."" The charity YoungMinds said some young people found support from youth workers and school counsellors life-saving and the situation was deeply concerning. Emma Thomas, the charity's chief executive, added: ""While extra money for specialist NHS services is of course welcome, it's better for everyone if young people can get help before their needs escalate or they hit crisis point.""

"Profits at Tesco have jumped 28% in what the UK's biggest supermarket chain described as an ""uncertain"" market. Chief executive Dave Lewis said the group was on track to meet the ""vast majority"" of the turnaround goals he set when he was appointed four years ago after an accounting scandal. The group said its performance was ""strong"", and Tesco has almost doubled its dividend. Full-year pre-tax profits were Â£1.7bn, with Tesco's same store sales up 1.7%. ""After four years we have met, or are about to meet, the vast majority of our turnaround goals. I'm very confident that we will complete the journey in 2019/2020,"" said Mr Lewis, who oversaw the takeover of wholesaler Booker in 2017. ""I'm delighted with the broad-based improvement across the business,"" he said. Overall like-for-like sales (which strip out changes to stores) rose 2.9%, including the 1.7% at Tesco and 11.1% for Booker. Group sales fell in Asia. Tesco's new discount chain Jack's takes on Aldi and Lidl Tesco reports best Christmas in 10 years Jobs have been lost as he aims to save Â£1.5bn a year and up to 9,000 roles were put at risk in January when the chain announced it would close food counters in 90 stores. He has also launched a discount chain, Jack's, to take on German rivals Aldi and Lidl, which Tesco said had received a ""strong response"" in the eight new stores. The proposed tie-up between Sainsbury's and Asda, which is currently being investigated by the competition authorities, could further change the landscape, said Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor. ""External threats are also putting pressure on the retailer with continued uncertainty due to Brexit and the turbulent High Street conditions, evidenced by its decision to cut up to 9,000 jobs by shutting the fresh food counters at 90 stores. ""With Marks & Spencer's tie up with Ocado and Amazon's new grocery arm, Amazon Fresh, Dave Lewis will be wary of standing still and instead will want to keep moving,"" she said. The chain said it would set out some ""untapped value opportunities"" at a presentation in June. Booker ""bulk buys"" are already being offered in  70 Tesco stores and will be expanded this year, while Jack's will also be expanded. Mr Lewis has previously said that in the lead-up to Brexit Tesco was focusing on how to ensure movements of fresh food were not held up. As he presented the results on Wednesday, he said Tesco had been building stock of ""non-perishable"" goods such as canned food ahead of a possible no-deal exit from the European Union. But he added Tesco had not seen any ""discernible change in behaviour"" from customers during the period of Brexit uncertainty, with no evidence of stockpiling from customers. Mr Lewis said that Tesco's stockpiling was a ""sensible provision"" but that he hoped a no deal exit would not happen. The shares rose 2% in early trading while the dividend is increasing to 5.77p a share from 3p the previous year.

"The DUP previously received Â£435,000 as a donation from the CRC The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) accepted a further Â£13,000 donation from a pro-Brexit group in the months after the EU referendum, documents have confirmed. The Constitutional Research Council (CRC)had previously donated Â£435,000 to the DUPduring the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign. The bulk of the Â£435,000 was spent by the DUP on pro-Brexit advertising. The DUP said it has complied with electoral law at all times. The party did not comment on how it spent the Â£13,000 donation but said it used donations to ""further the cause of unionism at home and abroad"". NI political donations plan 'not enough' DUP confirms Â£435,000 Brexit donation DUP's pro-Brexit money was 'permissible' Richard Cook is a former vice-chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party The details on the latest CRC donation are contained in internal Electoral Commission documents published by the campaign group the Good Law Project. The CRC is thought to be a group of pro-union business people chaired by Richard Cook. Mr Cook is a former vice chairman of the Scottish Conservatives. BBC News NI contacted Mr Cook about the Â£13,000 donation to the DUP but he was unavailable for comment. The names of those who donated the money to the CRC have never been released. Donor laws in Northern Ireland state that the Electoral Commission cannot publish any donations made before July 2017. In February 2017, the DUP confirmed it received a Â£435,000 donation from the CRC as part of the EU referendum campaign. The DUP took out a wraparound ad in the Metro urging voters to ""Take Back Control"" Most of that money was spent on the Brexit campaign, including a four-page ""Vote To Leave"" advertisement in the Metro newspaper, which is available in London and other cities but not in Northern Ireland. The DUP reported the donation to the Electoral Commission butBBC News NI previously revealed that the CRC was fined Â£6,000 by the commission for failing to report the donation. Following an investigation, the CRC declared the donation and the commission found the source of the money was permissible. However, the latest batch of Electoral Commission documents confirm that the CRC gave the DUP a further Â£13,000 after the EU referendum. A donation of Â£6,000 was made in October 2016 and a further Â£7,000 was given in March 2017. Both donations were correctly declared to the Electoral Commission. The details of the Â£13,000 donation were contained in an assessment by the Electoral Commission ofallegations made in a BBC NI Spotlight programme. It examined whether there was a common plan between the DUP and the referendum campaign group Vote Leave. Last August, the Electoral Commission announced it would not investigate the allegations contained in the programme, having made what it said was ""a thorough review of the programme"". Speaking to the Open Democracy website,some MPs have called on the Electoral Commission to re-open its investigation into the connections between Vote Leave and the DUP,external. Jolyon Maugham, from the Good Law Project, said it was ""inevitable"" that the Electoral Commission would need to re-examine donations to the DUP during the referendum campaign. He added: ""It's extraordinary that - almost three years on - real questions remain."" A DUP spokesperson said donations received by the party were reported to the Electoral Commission ""in accordance with our legal obligations"".

" On a cold night in February, residents of the battle-weary city of Srinagar woke up to the noise of fighter jets buzzing in the inky black skies. War, many feared, was now just a shot away. Residents of the city in Indian-administered Kashmir had begun stocking up on food. Petrol pumps had run dry. Hospital doctors were told to stockpile medicines. Anxious residents talked about building bunkers in their gardens. A prominent politician rued that he had bought a house near the airport, which now didn’t seem like a “good idea”. Within days, Indian Mirage 2000 fighter aircraft were crossing deep into Pakistan. An Indian Mirage 2000 aircraft on a practice run India said the jets - armed with laser-guided bombs - were targeting a militant training camp near Balakot in the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The air strikes were the first launched across the LoC (line of control) - the de facto border that divides Kashmir - and into Pakistan since a war between the two countries in 1971. Conventional wisdom rules that nuclear-armed neighbours  should tread carefully. This policy was now being upended by India’s Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. With characteristic bravado, the 68-year-old leader had ordered the strike as a “fitting, jaw-breaking response” to a deadly attack on Indian security forces in Kashmir earlier in the month. Modi told people he had given the army a “free hand”. “The blood of people is boiling,” he said at one meeting. At another, he said: “I feel the same fire in my heart that’s burning inside you.” Kashmir is the battleground of a protracted, debilitating rivalry between India and Pakistan. Both sides claim all of the breathtakingly scenic Muslim-majority region, but control only parts of it. Each side feels threatened by the other. They have fought two wars and a smaller conflict in the region. The latest “provocation” to India had been dire enough. On 14 February, a minivan packed with explosives was driven into a convoy of 78 buses carrying Indian paramilitary troops on a heavily guarded highway, about 19km (12 miles) from Srinagar. The blast killed 46 troops, the deadliest attack on Indian forces in the region in decades. Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad promptly said it was behind the attack. February 2019: Wreckage from the attack which killed 46 Indian troops Modi’s response upped the ante. His party, the BJP, has always maintained that “nationalism, and national unity” are an “article of faith” in the party. Modi has energised the base with his muscular, unabashed nationalism. Modi’s supporters believed he had kept his word and delivered a “crushing blow” to Pakistan. The truth, however, was more complicated. Less than 24 hours after the air strike, Pakistan shot down an Indian fighter jet in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and captured an Indian pilot. With both sides under immense pressure to calm tensions, Pakistan offered to release the pilot. A day later, Wing Cdr Abhinandan  was returned to India. A man watches the televised release of Indian Wing Cdr Abhinandan At home, Modi wasted no time moulding the narrative to his own advantage. “The country is in safe hands,” he announced. It was a victory for Modi in more ways than one. His approval ratings, which had declined after a series of setbacks in state elections,recovered appreciably. Modi had swept to power in 2014, leading the Hindu nationalist BJP to an unprecedented win. It was the first time since 1984 a party had won an absolute majority in a general election. But despite the massive mandate, the verdict on Modi’s performance has been mixed. There have been some gains – more roads, rural works, cheap cooking gas for the poor, village toilets, a uniform sales tax, a promising health insurance scheme which could end up benefiting 500 million families, and a new bankruptcy and insolvency law. But the economy is underperforming. India’s farms, where most of its people work, are beset by a crisis of low crop prices. Unemployment is rising, and a controversial currency ban ended up hurting the poor. Socially, the BJP’s strident Hindu nationalism has left the country polarised and minorities nervous. India is in the grip of a fake-news epidemic, partly due to cheap phones and data. Some dissenters have been labelled as “anti-nationals” and thrown into prison. Modi has now won a second general election. In some ways, it has been a referendum on the man himself. Many believe he wants to fashion India in his image - forcefully nationalist, socially conservative, openly patriotic. For nearly 40 days in April and May, more than 600 million people have voted in 543 parliamentary seats in a marathon staggered election. It has been the biggest, longest and possibly most expensive ballot ever. For one of India’s leading public intellectuals, Pratap Bhanu Mehta, it has been a “high stakes election with very low expectations”. Has this election been, as some have said, “a battle for the soul of India”? It's a bright day in March. Ranjanben Dhananjay Bhatt’s election campaign swings through the sun-baked streets of Vadodara, also known as Baroda, in Gujarat state in western India. Fifty-six-year-old Bhatt is the BJP’s candidate for the seat. She stands atop a shiny black jeep, her hands folded in a traditional Indian greeting. Knots of men, women and children gather on the road to welcome her. They shower her with marigolds, bless her with prayers and offer homemade sweets and juice. They crowd  verandahs and rooftops and cheerfully return the victory sign Bhatt flashes at them. The streets are awash with saffron, the BJP’s signature colour. Motorcycle outriders wearing saffron turbans, scarves, caps and bandanas, lead the way. A flatbed truck with a smiling DJ plays upbeat music. Firecrackers burst. In this merry festival of cacophony and colour, the air is thick with cries. They invoke one man. “Modi, Modi, Modi,” young party workers chant in frenzied unison. Modi’s face is emblazoned on T-shirts, caps, campaign hoardings and car stickers. He is everywhere, except in body - BJP workers are not sure whether he will find time to campaign in the seat. “Modi is not contesting here. But he’s larger than life, and a vote for me is also a vote for Modi,” says Bhatt, an indefatigable campaigner. In 2014, Modi won Vadodara by a mammoth 570,128 votes. He vacated Vadodara after winning  a second seat in Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh (candidates can stand for more than one seat in Indian elections, and choose which one to take up if successful). Bhatt, a former municipal councillor and a deputy mayor, swept to victory in the by-election a few months later. Ranjanben Dhananjay Bhatt is the BJP candidate in Vadodara In this BJP heartland, it is hardly a fight. The party has been in power here since 1996, and the opposition these days is pretty much invisible. “This election is not about my winning, but the margin of victory. I am aiming to win by at least 600,000 votes and set a new record in Gujarat,” says Bhatt. Two months later, she will go on to win a convincing victory. “Everything we do here is finally dedicated to Narendra bhai [brother]. Votes here are given to Modi. Gujarat is his birthplace and Vadodara is his workplace.” Surprisingly little is known about the man who became India’s most powerful politician. Modi was born the son of a tea-stall owner in Vadnagar, a grubby town some 200km (124 miles) from Vadodara. According to one biographer, Modi did not have any special bond with either family or friends in Vadnagar and “virtually abandoned” the place in his youth. As a teenager he was married in a traditional ceremony - a fact only confirmed in 2014 when he filed his election nomination papers. He lived with his wife, Jashodaben, for just three years. Early in his life, Modi joined the right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), widely regarded as the parent organisation of the BJP, and became a full-time worker. RSS volunteers on parade in Bhopal, 2015 The RSS (which translates as National Volunteer Corps) was founded in 1925 and believes in the unity and protection of India’s majority Hindus. The organisation does not present itself as primarily political - its mission statement “emphasises culture and patriotism”, according to one study. Nevertheless, the RSS has been the mainstay of Hindu nationalism since the days of British rule. Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated in 1948 by a former member. Today, the RSS has some 6,000 full-time workers. Some two million people participate in nearly 80,000 branches  (known as shakhas) across India. The BJP is a political affiliate of the RSS. It believes in Hindutva, an ideology seeking to establish the supremacy of the Hindus and the Hindu way of life. During his early days with the RSS, say BJP workers, Modi lived for extended periods of time in Vadodara, sharing an austere one-bedroom RSS-owned property. “He would sometimes go around on a bike, meeting workers. He knows every street here, and he still has friends in the city,” says one party official. Modi earned his spurs as a business-friendly, efficient chief minister during the 13 years he ruled Gujarat before moving to Delhi in 2014. He was credited with making Gujarat an economic powerhouse, although the success of so-called “Modinomics” isa subject of keen debate among economists. Modi was also accused of not doing enough to stop religious riots in 2002 when more than 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed. The violence was sparked by a train fire in the town of Godhra in which 60 Hindu pilgrims died. The fire was widely blamed on Muslim arsonists. More than 1,000 people were killed in the Gujarat riots of 2002 Modi was named leader of the BJP in 2013. A year later he became  prime minister. His supporters see him as a hard-working, no-nonsense doer who does not “pamper the minorities”, alluding mainly to India’s 170 million Muslims. They say he is a self-made man with humble roots, and contrast him with what they describe as the entitled and privileged Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, which has led the main opposition Congress party and ruled India for nearly half a century. Priyanka Gandhi is the latest member of her family to become involved in the Congress party “Modi is more popular than the BJP here. He’s a phenomenon. He was Gujarat’s most successful chief minister, and now he’s India’s tallest leader. Gujaratis are proud of him,” says a senior BJP official. Amit Dholakia, a professor of political science in Vadodara’s MS University, says Gujarat has a long history of political Hinduism, which has helped Modi. But he adds: “Modi understands that political Hinduism has its limitations because of divisions among the Hindus. Even in Gujarat, the BJP has never got more than 48% of the popular vote. So now he talks more about nationalism and development. Hindutva is a campaign filler. “Modi is more of a pragmatist than an ideologue. He loves power. And the people here love him.” Ambarish Nag Biswas was returning home from work near the eastern city of Kolkata on a balmy November evening in 2016 when his mobile phone rang. It was his friend, and he sounded panic-stricken. “Narendra Modi is on TV, and he’s taking away our money!” he shrilled. “What do you mean?” asked Biswas. His hyperventilating friend calmed down and explained. Prime Minister Modi had announced that his government was abolishing high denomination notes. In four hours, the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes would be banned from circulation. These two notes accounted for more than 80% of the currency circulating in India’s sprawling and messy cash-driven economy  (500 rupees would buy seven litres of petrol in Delhi). The drastic move, according to Modi, was intended to crack down on corruption by exposing billions of dollars in unaccounted-for wealth, which would now have to be presented to banks to change into the new currency notes. It was also intended to help resolve the problem of counterfeit currency, and to meet the long-held aspiration of successive governments to move India away from a cash-dependent economy (the shadow economy, according to the World Bank, makes up a fifth of India’s GDP.) That night Biswas remained wide awake. Ambarish Nag Biswas The 48-year-old, who worked for a dairy farm, had 24,000 rupees stashed away at home for emergencies. Now he had to go to a bank, deposit the defunct notes, and withdraw fresh currency for his family. His wife, Rinku, was a homemaker, and his daughter, Saborni, was in high school. When Biswas arrived at the bank the next morning, it was shut. A huge crowd had gathered, and nobody quite knew how the money would be exchanged. Biswas queued all day without success. The next day he tried another bank where he had a separate savings account, but the queue was even longer. He returned to the first bank. Suddenly, he heard a commotion. An elderly man in the queue, with a walking stick and a plastic bag containing his cash savings and bank papers, had collapsed from exhaustion. He had been standing under the boiling sun for hours. Biswas rushed ahead, picked up the man and, flagging down a car, took him to a hospital. Two hours later, the man had still not regained consciousness. “I had lost two days at work standing in the queue. I still hadn’t been able to exchange and get money.” He called his boss and asked for another day’s leave. After queuing eight hours without food and water, Biswas deposited his notes, but managed to withdraw only 2,000 rupees. The banks were fast running out of cash. “It was strange. There were only people like us in the cash queues. Where were the rich and influential who were supposed to be hoarding cash?” he says. Modi’s announcement had plunged India into chaos. Cities and towns were filled with panic-stricken people who were thronging banks to deposit money and withdraw lower denominations. Cash machines ran dry. There were stories of people burning sacks of illegal cash and of people unable to pay for cremations and hospital admissions. A man was said to have walked into a mobile phone store near Delhi with three million rupees in expired cash, offering to buy its entire stock of iPhones. A politician in Bihar was reported to have spent 20 million rupees on gold ornaments. A dengue patient settled his hospital bills in coins, since bills were in short supply. There was what was called a thriving “discount scam” where people offered to buy scrapped notes for less than their value, before laundering the expired money. Reports said more than 100 people had died of heart attacks in the bank queues. For Biswas, and the many others like him, the ordeal and indignity would continue for months. “I was always lying at work, so I could sneak out and withdraw my own money,” says Biswas. “After work, I would go out looking for cash. I took my bike travelling to villages all the time looking for an ATM with cash. I would go to more than a dozen cash machines every day to look for cash. “I bribed a guard to enter a dental college where I heard there was a less-used ATM. Even that had run out of cash.” Modi had promised that the hardship would only last 50 days. “Please, 50 days, just give me 50 days. After 30 December, I promise to show you the India that you have always wished for,” he said. But 2017 arrived and the banks still didn’t have enough cash to give out. It took months for things to return to normal. A year later, analysts concluded Modi’s currency gamble had been an “epic failure”. It had dealt a body blow to India’s informal economy, which ran mainly on cash. Small factories had shut, and poor workers had been laid off. One academic compared demonetisation in a booming economy to “shooting at the tyres of a racing car”. One of Modi’s own economic advisers called demonetisation a “massive, draconian, monetary shock”. The US-based National Bureau of Economic Research found it had lowered economic growth by at least two percentage points in the last quarter of 2016. January 2017: Congress politician Mamata Banerjee addresses a protest against demonetisation in Kolkata By the central bank’s own admission, more than 99% of the “demonetised” money had been returned to the banks. Either there had not been much illicit money circulating in the system to begin with, or the owners had found ways to convert it into legal tender. Counterfeit currency accounted for a negligible amount of withdrawn notes. Modi’s move to clean up the economy had yielded very little and made many suffer. Many believed that state elections in Uttar Pradesh in March 2017 would be a judgement on demonetisation - and that the BJP would suffer. They were wrong. The party won its biggest majority in nearly 40 years. March 2017: Modi celebrates BJP victory in the state elections Not everyone finds this surprising. A young student I speak to in Uttar Pradesh tells me: “In a divided and unequal society, the poor are willing to suffer if they are convinced that the rich are being hurt. It took them a long time to realise they were wrong.” In other words, the currency ban was a moment of schadenfreude – feeling joy at another’s pain - for India’s masses. But in Kolkata, Biswas finds it hard to forgive the prime minister. “The humiliation I had to go through to access my own hard earned money was unbelievable,” he says. “All this happened because we trusted Modi. We had believed him when he said this was to teach the corrupt rich a lesson. We believed that ordinary people had to sacrifice a little to help punish the dishonest. “After that time, I don’t trust Modi any more. He has persistently lied to the people. This is not befitting of a prime minister.” Rajasthan is an internationally feted tourist destination. It evokes images of gorgeous forts, colourful bazaars, art deco hotels and camel rides in stark deserts. But the state is also a base of violent “cow vigilantism”, stoked by Hindu nationalist rhetoric. Rajasthan is one of India's biggest tourist destinations Many of India’s majority Hindus worship the cow as a sacred animal. Cow protection movements date back to the 1870s. Conflicts over cow slaughter in the distant past have provoked deadly religious riots, protests outside the parliament, and even a hunger strike. Cow vigilante groups have mushroomed since the BJP came to power in 2014. To Modi’s supporters, the cow is totemic. Slaughter laws have been toughened and punishments made dire. In Rajasthan, cattle slaughter - or exporting cattle for slaughter - can attract a 10-year prison sentence. In parts of north and west India, vigilante groups are a law unto themselves, setting up highway checkpoints, checking vehicles for cows, and roughing up dairy farmers, cattle traders and herders, mostly Muslims. Cow protection has become an extortion racket. A cow vigilante group in Rajasthan, photographed in 2015 Human Rights Watch says at least 44 people – 36 of them Muslims – have been killed in vigilante incidents since 2015.  Hundreds more have been injured. Modi himself has condemned such attacks, and accused vigilante groups of being “anti-social” groups masquerading as cow protectors. But BJP lawmakers close to the prime minister have sent out different signals. A cabinet colleague was photographed garlanding men who had been convicted for lynching a meat trader. A senior RSS official said the lynchings would stop if the Muslims stopped eating beef. A photograph of dairy farmer Pehlu Khan Pehlu Khan was killed for trying to take his cows home. The 55-year-old dairy farmer lived in Nuh, a district of the northern state of Haryana with his wife and five children. A nondescript place comprising a dusty town and a smattering of Muslim-majority villages and verdant farms, the people here till their land and sell cow milk for a living. In April 2017, Pehlu was driving home in a hired pick-up with his two sons and two fellow villagers. They were transporting livestock they had bought at a cattle fair in neighbouring Rajasthan. After driving a few hours and clearing some checkpoints, they realised they were being followed by six men on motorcycles, who overtook Pehlu and stopped the truck. “We showed them the sale papers. They tore up the papers. They said they were from the Bajrang Dal (a radical Hindu right-wing group),” says Pehlu's son Arif. Pehlul Khan's son Arif survived the attack “Then they just dragged us down from the vehicle. They beat up my father most. They punched him, and beat him up with whatever they could lay their hands on - sticks, belts. Soon a mob gathered and joined the lynching.” “They are Muslims. Just beat them up,” the mob howled. By the time, the police arrived and rescued the men,  Pehlu was already unconscious. The mob had snatched the cows, three phones and 45,000 rupees in cash. The police took the victims to hospital. Pehlu died two days later. His sons survived the attack. Villagers remember Pehlu as a devout, hardworking man. “He worked hard to provide a decent life for all of us,” says his wife, Jaibuna. Pehlu's widow, Jaibuna, and one of their sons After his death, his family sold off their cows to pay for their legal expenses. The family did not receive any compensation. “We barely survive now,” says Arif. When it comes to cow lynchings, justice has been patchy in Modi’s India. As he drifted in and out of consciousness before haemorrhaging to death, Pehlu Khan named six men as his attackers. But before arresting them, the police filed a complaint against the victims, including Pehlu, for allegedly smuggling cows. In September, the two brothers and two other witnesses to the attack were on their way to court to give evidence, when an unmarked SUV began following their vehicle. “They drove up and shouted at us to turn back. When we refused, a man in the vehicle fired in the air. We turned our vehicle back and returned home,” says Arif. I don’t hope for justice - I just want to live Since then, he says, they have not responded to the court summons. The brothers say they will only do so if the case is moved out of Rajasthan. “I am too scared. We lost our father. Now I don’t want to die. I don’t hope for justice. I just want to live,” he says. Five months after the attack, charges against the six accused men were dropped by Rajasthan police. An independent report later accused state authorities of working to “diminish the enormity of the crime”. Last December, the main opposition Congress party defeated the BJP and took power in Rajasthan. “But nothing has changed,” says Arif. “The vigilantes still man the checkpoints. We are still scared to go out with our cows.” Job seekers line up for interviews at a job fair in Chinchwad, India, 7 February, 2019 In an apartment building tucked away in a warren of narrow lanes in the northern city of Lucknow, three young men have been studying up to 10 hours a day for months on end. All they want is a job. The young men are children of small farmers. They are first generation literate and part of an increasing number of Indians migrating to cities in search of jobs. All of them are from Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, with nearly as many people as Brazil. Mithilesh Yadav, Karunesh Jaisawal and Ram Sagar Gupta Armed with diplomas in engineering, the three men have sat exams for more than two-dozen jobs in the past year. They head to exam halls on buses and second-class trains, sleeping in railway and bus stations to save money. They sit for gruelling exams, competing against tens of millions for a few thousand jobs.  More than 20 million people applied last year for 63,000 jobs in the state-run railways, one of India’s largest employers. Pune, February 2019: Candidates sleep out ahead of army job tests The three men have been trying for jobs as train drivers, technicians, linesmen, engineers, clerks, government admin staff and even police officers. They have sat exams held by power stations, public works, and the railways. These are government jobs which offer dignity and security. But the competition is intense, and vacancies are few. Hopes are dashed quickly. The three men want to work as engineers, but are now reconciled to accepting whatever government job they can get. Job security is precarious. Karunesh Jaiswal, one of the three men, worked as a contract engineer for an aviation oil company last year and earned 17,000 rupees a month. Since  his contract ended - and despite the experience - he hasn’t found another job. “I don’t have a choice. I have to keep trying. When you are jobless in India, you are not alone,” says the 22-year-old. Karunesh Jaiswal: “I don’t have a choice. I have to keep trying” On the campaign trail five years ago, Narendra Modi fired the imagination of the young by promising plenty of jobs. But as he seeks a second term in office, India is in the throes of a massive unemployment crisis. According toa leaked government report, the unemployment rate is at a 45-year-high. More than 30 million people were looking for jobs in February, according to a study by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE), an independent think tank. A class at Dhyeya Coaching Institute in Lucknow, where students prepare for civil service examinations Despite decades of brisk growth, vacancies have remained scarce. India’s fastest growing industries – telecoms, banking, finance – do not offer enough jobs to absorb the country’s teeming army of poorly educated, low-skilled workers. Under Modi, private investment has slowed down and growth has sputtered, further hurting job creation. More than 80% of India’s workforce are trapped in low paying, benefits-scarce “unorganised or informal” workplaces. Fewer than 10% of Indians actually work in the formal economy with full benefits. Not surprisingly, getting a job is a Sisyphean struggle. In their basic two-room, rented apartment, Jaiswal, Ram Sagar Gupta and Mithilesh Yadav wake up at five in the morning.  After a quick breakfast, they sit on a bed and “self-study”. A map of India adorns the whitewashed walls. Books on engineering, maths, English grammar and general knowledge are strewn all over the place. Sometimes their parents call from the villages, and ask whether they have got a job yet. Ram Sagar Gupta “Those calls are the most difficult. I feel very sad to tell them the truth. But they always support me. The family keeps us going,” says Gupta. He believes Modi will deliver the jobs one day. He still holds out hope. “At least he talks about the dreams and aspirations of the young. He himself works hard. We still have lot of hopes from him.” His jobless flatmates are not so sure. “Where are the factories he promised to build?” asks one. Mithilesh Yadav Yadav says one of his uncles finally cracked a test for a policeman’s job after 10 years of trying. The uncle was 27 when he joined the force. “One day, I will also possibly get a job. But patience also takes a heavy toll,” says Yadav. A plot of government land is the venue of Modi’s inaugural campaign meeting in the northern Indian city of Meerut. Minutes after entering a flower-bedecked stage and acknowledging the lusty cheering from several thousand people in the audience, Modi launches into his speech with gusto. “The 1.3 billion people of India have made up their mind,” he says. “Once again India will have a Modi sarkar (government).” Modi is a preternaturally confident politician. Although his powerful aide Amit Shah has stitched up some smart alliances, he has made 2019 a verdict on his performance. He is a tireless campaigner. In 2014, according to the BJP, he travelled more than 300,000km (186,000 miles) across 25 states to “connect to people”. This year, according to the BJP, he has travelled the entire country over 51 days and addressed 142 public meetings - a third of those in the two crucial states of Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. Modi is also pugnacious, deftly mixing nationalism, dog-whistle politics and populism. He’s adept at creating binaries: the nationalists (his supporters) versus the anti-nationals (his political rivals and critics); the watchman (Modi himself, protecting the country on “land, air, and outer space”) versus the entitled and the corrupt (an obvious dig at the main opposition Congress party). Sometimes his campaign has sounded like he’s blaming previous governments for all ills - rather than a vision for the present. 2019 has been a bruising and brutal campaign. India’s Grand Old Party, the Congress, led by a resurgent Rahul Gandhi, has unsuccessfully tried to re-establish itself as a credible opposition after sinking to its lowest tally in 2014. The BJP has also fought off the threat from a host of regional parties which are powerful in a number of states. Arvind Panagariya, a professor of economics at Columbia University who served as the vice-chairman of a government think tank under Modi, has always believed that the prime minister would win a second term, despite what critics said. He says Modi remains intensely popular with people and has “enormous energy and ability to communicate with the masses”. “He has successfully conveyed to the average Indian that he is sincere, hard-working and decisive.” Some analysts believe India is headed for a second “dominant party system”, this time led by the BJP. Previously, Congress led the country for more than four decades. But one thing is clear - 2019 has proved that the power of Modi endures for now. Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.63347405
"The DUP previously received Â£435,000 as a donation from the CRC The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) accepted a further Â£13,000 donation from a pro-Brexit group in the months after the EU referendum, documents have confirmed. The Constitutional Research Council (CRC)had previously donated Â£435,000 to the DUPduring the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign. The bulk of the Â£435,000 was spent by the DUP on pro-Brexit advertising. The DUP said it has complied with electoral law at all times. The party did not comment on how it spent the Â£13,000 donation but said it used donations to ""further the cause of unionism at home and abroad"". NI political donations plan 'not enough' DUP confirms Â£435,000 Brexit donation DUP's pro-Brexit money was 'permissible' Richard Cook is a former vice-chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party The details on the latest CRC donation are contained in internal Electoral Commission documents published by the campaign group the Good Law Project. The CRC is thought to be a group of pro-union business people chaired by Richard Cook. Mr Cook is a former vice chairman of the Scottish Conservatives. BBC News NI contacted Mr Cook about the Â£13,000 donation to the DUP but he was unavailable for comment. The names of those who donated the money to the CRC have never been released. Donor laws in Northern Ireland state that the Electoral Commission cannot publish any donations made before July 2017. In February 2017, the DUP confirmed it received a Â£435,000 donation from the CRC as part of the EU referendum campaign. The DUP took out a wraparound ad in the Metro urging voters to ""Take Back Control"" Most of that money was spent on the Brexit campaign, including a four-page ""Vote To Leave"" advertisement in the Metro newspaper, which is available in London and other cities but not in Northern Ireland. The DUP reported the donation to the Electoral Commission butBBC News NI previously revealed that the CRC was fined Â£6,000 by the commission for failing to report the donation. Following an investigation, the CRC declared the donation and the commission found the source of the money was permissible. However, the latest batch of Electoral Commission documents confirm that the CRC gave the DUP a further Â£13,000 after the EU referendum. A donation of Â£6,000 was made in October 2016 and a further Â£7,000 was given in March 2017. Both donations were correctly declared to the Electoral Commission. The details of the Â£13,000 donation were contained in an assessment by the Electoral Commission ofallegations made in a BBC NI Spotlight programme. It examined whether there was a common plan between the DUP and the referendum campaign group Vote Leave. Last August, the Electoral Commission announced it would not investigate the allegations contained in the programme, having made what it said was ""a thorough review of the programme"". Speaking to the Open Democracy website,some MPs have called on the Electoral Commission to re-open its investigation into the connections between Vote Leave and the DUP,external. Jolyon Maugham, from the Good Law Project, said it was ""inevitable"" that the Electoral Commission would need to re-examine donations to the DUP during the referendum campaign. He added: ""It's extraordinary that - almost three years on - real questions remain.""

"Belfast's Union Theological College is run by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland Queen's University in Belfast (QUB) is to formally end its link with the Presbyterian-run Union Theological College (UTC). The university's governing body - the senate - approved the move on Tuesday. UTC trains some students for the Presbyterian ministry but the majority of its students are studying theology degrees at Queen's. The Presbyterian Church said it ""deeply regrets"" the university's decision. QUB will not admit new students to theological college Queen's University to review theological college link The teaching arrangement between the two institutions has been in place since 1927. Queen's hadpreviously decided not to admit any new theology students in 2019. That followedtwo separate university reviews in 2016 and 2018, which had raised a number of concerns about UTC. A further university review, carried out in recent months, recommended that the awarding of theology degrees by Queen's should end. With regard to UTC, it said: ""Serious concerns remain unresolved and are contributing to an increasingly unsustainable and unsatisfactory position. ""It is recommended that the university disengage from the current arrangement for the delivery of theology. ""All undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in theology should be withdrawn and no further intake of students should be permitted."" It concluded that the collaboration with UTC should be ""discontinued"". The senate has approved the recommendations in that review. Last year, Queen's University suspended admissions to UTC undergraduate courses However, arrangements will be made to ensure that current Queen's theology students will continue be taught at UTC until they complete their course of study. UTC is the only affiliated college to teach Queen's undergraduate theology students and also teaches a number of postgraduates. However, a small number of Queen's students are also taking postgraduate degrees through Edgehill Theological College, the Irish Baptist College and Belfast Bible College. The university's link to those colleges is also set to end once those students complete their degrees. Aspects of religion will in future be taught within Queen's departments like English, history, sociology, politics and philosophy. The university's pro-vice chancellor Prof Richard English said Queen's had taken the decision due to concerns raised over a number of years. ""This was about the diversity and breadth of curriculum and it was about the range of opinions that people were exposed to,"" he said. ""We've taken the decision that having tried to work with UTC to get a more flexible curriculum, we feel they haven't been able to deliver that.

"The DUP previously received Â£435,000 as a donation from the CRC The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) accepted a further Â£13,000 donation from a pro-Brexit group in the months after the EU referendum, documents have confirmed. The Constitutional Research Council (CRC)had previously donated Â£435,000 to the DUPduring the 2016 Brexit referendum campaign. The bulk of the Â£435,000 was spent by the DUP on pro-Brexit advertising. The DUP said it has complied with electoral law at all times. The party did not comment on how it spent the Â£13,000 donation but said it used donations to ""further the cause of unionism at home and abroad"". NI political donations plan 'not enough' DUP confirms Â£435,000 Brexit donation DUP's pro-Brexit money was 'permissible' Richard Cook is a former vice-chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party The details on the latest CRC donation are contained in internal Electoral Commission documents published by the campaign group the Good Law Project. The CRC is thought to be a group of pro-union business people chaired by Richard Cook. Mr Cook is a former vice chairman of the Scottish Conservatives. BBC News NI contacted Mr Cook about the Â£13,000 donation to the DUP but he was unavailable for comment. The names of those who donated the money to the CRC have never been released. Donor laws in Northern Ireland state that the Electoral Commission cannot publish any donations made before July 2017. In February 2017, the DUP confirmed it received a Â£435,000 donation from the CRC as part of the EU referendum campaign. The DUP took out a wraparound ad in the Metro urging voters to ""Take Back Control"" Most of that money was spent on the Brexit campaign, including a four-page ""Vote To Leave"" advertisement in the Metro newspaper, which is available in London and other cities but not in Northern Ireland. The DUP reported the donation to the Electoral Commission butBBC News NI previously revealed that the CRC was fined Â£6,000 by the commission for failing to report the donation. Following an investigation, the CRC declared the donation and the commission found the source of the money was permissible. However, the latest batch of Electoral Commission documents confirm that the CRC gave the DUP a further Â£13,000 after the EU referendum. A donation of Â£6,000 was made in October 2016 and a further Â£7,000 was given in March 2017. Both donations were correctly declared to the Electoral Commission. The details of the Â£13,000 donation were contained in an assessment by the Electoral Commission ofallegations made in a BBC NI Spotlight programme. It examined whether there was a common plan between the DUP and the referendum campaign group Vote Leave. Last August, the Electoral Commission announced it would not investigate the allegations contained in the programme, having made what it said was ""a thorough review of the programme"". Speaking to the Open Democracy website,some MPs have called on the Electoral Commission to re-open its investigation into the connections between Vote Leave and the DUP,external. Jolyon Maugham, from the Good Law Project, said it was ""inevitable"" that the Electoral Commission would need to re-examine donations to the DUP during the referendum campaign. He added: ""It's extraordinary that - almost three years on - real questions remain."" A DUP spokesperson said donations received by the party were reported to the Electoral Commission ""in accordance with our legal obligations"".

"Belfast's Union Theological College is run by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland Queen's University in Belfast (QUB) is to formally end its link with the Presbyterian-run Union Theological College (UTC). The university's governing body - the senate - approved the move on Tuesday. UTC trains some students for the Presbyterian ministry but the majority of its students are studying theology degrees at Queen's. The Presbyterian Church said it ""deeply regrets"" the university's decision. QUB will not admit new students to theological college Queen's University to review theological college link The teaching arrangement between the two institutions has been in place since 1927. Queen's hadpreviously decided not to admit any new theology students in 2019. That followedtwo separate university reviews in 2016 and 2018, which had raised a number of concerns about UTC. A further university review, carried out in recent months, recommended that the awarding of theology degrees by Queen's should end. With regard to UTC, it said: ""Serious concerns remain unresolved and are contributing to an increasingly unsustainable and unsatisfactory position. ""It is recommended that the university disengage from the current arrangement for the delivery of theology. ""All undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in theology should be withdrawn and no further intake of students should be permitted."" It concluded that the collaboration with UTC should be ""discontinued"". The senate has approved the recommendations in that review. Last year, Queen's University suspended admissions to UTC undergraduate courses However, arrangements will be made to ensure that current Queen's theology students will continue be taught at UTC until they complete their course of study. UTC is the only affiliated college to teach Queen's undergraduate theology students and also teaches a number of postgraduates. However, a small number of Queen's students are also taking postgraduate degrees through Edgehill Theological College, the Irish Baptist College and Belfast Bible College. The university's link to those colleges is also set to end once those students complete their degrees. Aspects of religion will in future be taught within Queen's departments like English, history, sociology, politics and philosophy. The university's pro-vice chancellor Prof Richard English said Queen's had taken the decision due to concerns raised over a number of years. ""This was about the diversity and breadth of curriculum and it was about the range of opinions that people were exposed to,"" he said. ""We've taken the decision that having tried to work with UTC to get a more flexible curriculum, we feel they haven't been able to deliver that. ""So to be fair to our students and to the integrity of education Queen's has decided now to desist from that connection."" Prof English said it was ""regrettable"" that degrees in theology at Queen's would therefore end.

"This video can not be played Linzi Page: ""When you go through this the time with your family is so precious."" Linzi Page thinks her bowel cancer was not diagnosed because doctors do not expect people under 50 to get the disease. The 36-year-old first went to see her GP in January last year after weeks of ""strange"" bowel movements and rectal bleeding. Linzi, from Burntisland in Fife, toldBBC Scotland's The Ninethat her doctor was ""dismissive"" and said it was ""probably"" Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The doctor carried out a routine blood test and stool sample but nothing irregular showed up. Almost three months later Linzi went to see another doctor and was sent for an ""urgent colonoscopy"". Linzi said she was not diagnosed earlier because of her age At the end of April, she was diagnosed with stage 4 metastatic bowel cancer and has since been given two years' to live. Linzi, who has two young children, says: ""If I had been caught earlier I might be in a much better situation than I am currently. ""I think GPs need to be more aware that people under 50 are getting bowel cancer."" ""I spoke to my doctors and I was very frank and I said if I had gone with the same symptoms at 60, they would have sent me for a colonoscopy. ""But the fact I was 35, they just procrastinated and it was not dealt with quickly enough."" In response, NHS Fife said they were unable to comment on the care of individual patients for ""reasons of confidentiality"". Bowel cancer is Scotland's second biggest cancer killer. About 3,700 people are diagnosed with the condition every year but only about 200 are under 50 years old. Claire Donaghy, from Bowel Cancer UK, said it was difficult for GPs to recognise bowel cancer in younger people, particularly given the prevalence of IBS and other conditions. ""Most GPs in their lifetime might only see one person under 50 that has a bowel cancer,"" she says. ""It is difficult for them."" Ms Donaghy said younger patients needed to be reassured that they probably had nothing to worry about but they should keep a note of their symptoms and go back if they do not improve. Linzi Page says she was ""devastated"" by her diagnosis. She has since found that she has tumours on her liver and her cancer has spread to her lungs. ""I was told in December it was incurable and they have given me one to two years to live,"" Linzi says. Linzi called for greater awareness of the condition in the under 50s She is currently trying to raise funds for a drug called Avastin, which is not available on the NHS in Scotland but she hopes can prolong her life. Linzi would like to see doctors becoming more aware of the risk of bowel cancer among younger people. The NHS in Scotland currently runs a screening programme for people over 50. Linzi called for screening to be extended to people under 50 but the Scottish government said there was not enough evidence for lowering the age. Linzi says she does not want to waste her time complaining about doctors but wants to raise awareness of the condition among younger people. ""My life is really precious to me, my time with my kids is really precious to me,"" she says. ""It chokes me to think I might not be in my kids' lives. I can't think about that. I try to live day by day.""

"Spending on children's mental health services - such as school counsellors and drop-in centres - has fallen in real terms in more than a third of areas in England, a report shows. The study, by the Children's Commissioner, found spending had risen by 17% overall but many children faced a ""postcode lottery"" of provision. Anne Longfield said the figures were ""extremely worrying"". Officials said investing in these services was a priority. The report looked at spending on so-called ""low level"" mental health services - designed to prevent or treat problems such as depression, eating disorders or anxiety - preventing the need for intensive, specialist intervention. In general, half the funding comes from the NHS and half from local authorities. The report found that very high-spending areas were masking a larger proportion of low-spending areas, and that wide variations existed across the country. According to the report: Around Â£226m was spent on low-level children's mental health services in 2018-19 - an increase of 17% in real-terms (taking inflation into account) on the previous year While the top quarter of local areas spent Â£1.1m or more over the financial year, the bottom 25% spent Â£177,000 or less 58% of areas reported a real-terms increase in spending between 2018-19 But 37% saw a real-terms fall - often driven by a reduction in local authority spending In London, local authority spending was Â£17.88 per child compared with Â£5.32 in the East of England Ms Longfield said: ""This report reveals for the first time the postcode lottery facing the increasing number of children suffering from low-level mental health conditions like anxiety and depression. ""The children I speak to who are suffering from conditions like anxiety or depression aren't asking for intensive inpatient therapeutic treatment, they just want to be able to talk to a counsellor about their worries and to be offered advice on how to stop their problems turning into a crisis."" A statement from the Department of Health and Social Care said government plans would allow 70,000 more children a year to have access to specialist mental health care by 2020-21. ""Early intervention is vital and we're going further, piloting a four-week waiting time standard for treatment, training a brand new dedicated mental health workforce for schools across the country, and teaching pupils what good mental and physical health looks like."" The charity YoungMinds said some young people found support from youth workers and school counsellors life-saving and the situation was deeply concerning. Emma Thomas, the charity's chief executive, added: ""While extra money for specialist NHS services is of course welcome, it's better for everyone if young people can get help before their needs escalate or they hit crisis point.""

"Amsterdam is well known for its De Wallen red light area, but campaigners say the prostitutes are exploited A petition is to be handed into the Dutch parliament demanding that visiting a prostitute be made illegal. Some 42,000 young people have added their signatures, which means the issue will be debated by politicians in a country that has some of the most relaxed laws around paying for sex. ""I am priceless"" is the name of the social media-led campaign. Activists want buyers to be penalised, under the so-called Nordic model. Partly inspired by Christian and feminist views, the group have posted Instagram photos showing supporters clasping boards with words in black and white bearing the message ""Ik ben onbetaalbaar"" (I'm priceless) along with ""what if it was your sister?"" and ""prostitution is both a cause and consequence of inequality"".

However, in response to the images, one person wrote: ""I'm a voluntary sex worker. There's many people like me. This campaign will make my job much, much more dangerous."" In the Netherlands, buying and selling sex is legal,externalas long as it involves ""sex between consenting adults"". Under the Nordic model, adopted by Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Northern Ireland and France, buyers are penalised. Read Anna Holligan's report from Amsterdam's red light zone here The young activists argue more should be done to protect vulnerable women. According to the ""I am priceless"" petition, the Netherlands' facilitation of the sex industry is outdated, exploitative and the Dutch should look to countries like Sweden for inspiration. They say countries in which the model has been introduced have seen: fewer people going to buy sex the country becoming less attractive for human traffickers fewer people being exploited by prostitution. Among the founders of the Exxpose movement behind the petition is social worker Sara Lous,external, who used to work in a rehabilitation centre with former sex workers. ""We are feminists and Christians and some of us are neutral,"" she says. France outlaws paying for sex The ""I am priceless"" campaigners say their proposal would stop people buying sex legally ""The idea is of course that the Netherlands has a safer policy, that decriminalising is safer and it's a freedom to sell sex. But so much is going wrong. we have so much human trafficking and Amsterdam is most vulnerable because of the high demand for cheap sex."" She argues that women are given a signal that prostitution is an easy way to make money, whereas they need to have other options. ""There are only a few who are incapable of finding another job. They should have help to find other skills,"" she says. Amsterdam's Red Light Zone is one of the capital's most popular attractions, in a country where prostitution has been traditionally framed as a reflection of the value placed on freedom of choice. ""If a women wants to sell her body then that's her choice,"" is an argument pushed by politicians and public alike. The Dutch coalition government has pledged to provide more funds to help women seeking to leave prostitution Women working behind the red light windows have told me it is their free choice - but deeper conversations reveal it's often based on circumstances which they felt left them with no alternative. They include single mothers struggling to ensure that their children in Romania receive a decent education, and young women who have experienced abuse, leaving them with low self-esteem. But Foxxy, a board member on the sex-workers' collective Proud, warns that any attempt to criminalise clients would harm the prostitutes themselves. ""This petition is not in the sex workers' interest. It's people who read the Bible who are trying to stop us,"" she argues. ""If this happens sex workers will work illegally. Then we're more likely to be victims of violence. Clients will know we can't go to the police. We will be much more at risk, clients will try to take condoms off, we're more at risk of being exposed to HIV. It happened in France when they started this Nordic model."" In response to the petition, a justice ministry spokesman told the BBC thatthe government had plans to step up measures against human trafficking,externalas well as provide funds to help sex workers trying to leave prostitution. The plans were going into consultation and would be put to parliament later this year, he said. But any drastic overturn of the Netherlands' current liberal laws will face opposition from those in politics and society who see prostitution as a symbol of freedom rather than repression.

"Schools across Walsall said children struggled with basic skills such as communication and toilet training, the councillor said An infant school has employed someone to change nappies because so many pupils are not toilet-trained, a councillor has said. Chris Towe, Walsall Council's portfolio holder for education, said: ""We are talking about five-year-olds here and it is not acceptable."" He said it was among many examples of children in the West Midlands borough starting school without basic skills. Schools told him many pupils could not communicate or hold a pencil properly. Head teachers had also raised concerns that school starters could not use cutlery or dress themselves. Mr Towe told the BBC he had spoken to the heads of 80 infant and primary schools and found the lack of basic skills to be a ""massive issue"". ""I was quite shocked really,"" he said. ""If they haven't got basic skills, how can they be educated? ""This cannot go on. If it doesn't stop it is going to get even worse."" Latest news from the West Midlands Mr Towe told a meeting of the Conservative-run council that head teachers believed many children were two or three years behind where they should be,the LDRS reported. ""Clearly, over the years, many parents have not been taking responsibility in making sure their children are ready for school,"" he said. The council plans to send letters informing parents of the skills children need and where they can get help. Diane Coughlan, a Labour councillor, said the borough had a lot of vulnerable families with a range of issues. She said: ""For many parents, school readiness is simply not a priority for them, so apart from simply sending a letter what other support will they be given?""

"Shana Grice was murdered by her ex-boyfriend who stalked her Three police officers are facing disciplinary action over the case of a woman who was fined for wasting police time when she reported the stalker ex who went on to murder her. Shana Grice, 19, reported Michael Lane five times before he slit her throat and tried to burn her body. Her parents slammed Sussex Police for ""treating her like a criminal"", adding the action was ""too little too late"". A report found stalking cases were not being properly investigated. Two officers - one retired - will face gross misconduct proceedings at public hearings in May. A third officer faces internal misconduct action. Sharon Grice and Richard Green said: ""Our daughter took her concerns to the police and instead of being protected was treated like a criminal. She paid for the police's lack of training, care and poor attitude with her life. ""It's only right that the police make changes, but it's too little, too late for Shana. ""Sussex Police should not be applauded for this."" Michael Lane was convicted of murdering Miss Grice in 2017 No further action will be taken against five officers investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), while six other force employees - three officers and three staff - have been given ""management advice and further training"". The independent report by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services (HMICFRS) was commissioned after Miss Grice was killed in her bedroom in Portslade, near Brighton, East Sussex, in 2016. Stalking and harassment is more common in Sussex than the national average, it said. However, victims were often not referred to specialised support services and the force regularly failed to use powers including searching perpetrators' homes or seeking injunctions. Lane fitted a tracker to Miss Grice's car and stole a house key to sneak into her room as she slept. He was given a life sentence with a minimum term of 25 years in March 2017.

Murdered teen's stalker ex-boyfriend jailed 'He said he was close enough to smell my hair' Police ordered to improve stalking probes At his sentencing, Mr Justice Nicholas Green said officers had ""jumped to conclusions"" and ""stereotyped"" Miss Grice. Assistant Chief Constable Nick May said: ""We deeply regret the tragic death of Shana Grice in 2016 and are committed to constantly improving our understanding of stalking and our response to it. ""When we looked at the circumstances leading to Shana's murder, we felt we may not have done the very best we could and made a referral to the IOPC."" Police found a tracking device on Miss Grice's car Sarah Green, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ""The police watchdog findings that Sussex Police failed and that there will be misconduct hearings are welcome, but much more is needed. ""Numerous inquests and inquiries have found that multiple police forces have failed to protect women who were murdered."" The report also called on the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) for a single definition for stalking to be adopted by police forces and government departments.

"Schools across Walsall said children struggled with basic skills such as communication and toilet training, the councillor said An infant school has employed someone to change nappies because so many pupils are not toilet-trained, a councillor has said. Chris Towe, Walsall Council's portfolio holder for education, said: ""We are talking about five-year-olds here and it is not acceptable."" He said it was among many examples of children in the West Midlands borough starting school without basic skills. Schools told him many pupils could not communicate or hold a pencil properly. Head teachers had also raised concerns that school starters could not use cutlery or dress themselves. Mr Towe told the BBC he had spoken to the heads of 80 infant and primary schools and found the lack of basic skills to be a ""massive issue"". ""I was quite shocked really,"" he said. ""If they haven't got basic skills, how can they be educated? ""This cannot go on. If it doesn't stop it is going to get even worse."" Latest news from the West Midlands Mr Towe told a meeting of the Conservative-run council that head teachers believed many children were two or three years behind where they should be,the LDRS reported. ""Clearly, over the years, many parents have not been taking responsibility in making sure their children are ready for school,"" he said. The council plans to send letters informing parents of the skills children need and where they can get help. Diane Coughlan, a Labour councillor, said the borough had a lot of vulnerable families with a range of issues. She said: ""For many parents, school readiness is simply not a priority for them, so apart from simply sending a letter what other support will they be given?"" Research by children's charity Eric and the National Day Nurseries Association suggestedchildren were being toilet-trained later,external. The issue was discussed onBBC Breakfast in February.

"A whisky advert featuring a man leaping off a cliff has been banned for promoting ""risky behaviour"". The Macallan ad, which was broadcast on various platforms, showed the man falling towards the ground before sprouting wings and flying away. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that the advert was irresponsible. It said the opening scene could be seen as ""reminiscent of the extreme sport of base jumping"". The Macallan's owner Edrington had argued that its first global advertising campaign was a ""fantastical story"" which did not link alcohol with ""bravery, daring or toughness"". The regulator said it received six complaints after the advert was broadcast on TV, video on demand and Instagram in December. It noted that the opening scene in all versions of the ad featured a man running and jumping off a cliff. The ASA said: ""We noted that at that point in the ads, there was no suggestion that the male character had any super-human attributes or powers, or that he was part of a mythical world"". It also noted that the character was seen clenching his fists as he peered over the edge of the cliff, giving ""the impression that he was nervous about jumping and was building up the courage to do so"". The regulator continued: ""In that context, we considered that the act of jumping off the cliff was very dangerous, potentially fatal, and consisted of extreme risk-taking behaviour. ""That impression was compounded by the text 'Would you risk falling for the chance to fly?'"" The ASA said that while it acknowledged that some elements of the ad were fantastical, it considered that its central message was ""one of promoting risky or daring behaviour to reap possible rewards"". It added: ""Although the character was not seen consuming alcohol at any point, we considered the ads made a clear association between an alcoholic product and potentially very dangerous, daring behaviour and concluded that they were irresponsible."" Reacting to the ruling, a spokesperson for The Macallan said the company had co-operated fully with the ASA in response to ""a small number of complaints about our brand's global awareness campaign"". He said: ""In light of the ASA ruling, we have acted to address their concerns and removed the campaign film from relevant channels accessible by the UK audience. ""As phase one of the campaign is now complete, we will take onboard the ruling as we plan for next phase of the campaign. ""The overall theme of the global campaign is about bold decision-making and targeting a new generation of luxury consumers. ""This will continue to be the focus of the global campaign, though we will of course take on board the ASA's comments in relation to the film elements in the UK market as we develop the campaign in the future.""

"Harry Kane was replaced in the second half after a challenge with Fabian Delph Son Heung-min's late goal gave Tottenham a crucial and well-deserved advantage over Manchester City in a thunderous Champions League quarter-final first leg. In a searing atmosphere in their vast new stadium, Spurs overcame the loss of Harry Kane to a serious looking ankle injury - sustained when he challenged Fabian Delph in the second half. And they made the breakthrough with 12 minutes left as Son twisted and turned on the byeline before shooting low past Ederson. Spurs had survived the concession of an early penalty, awarded on a pitchside video review by the referee after Danny Rose was judged to have handled Raheem Sterling's shot. Sergio Aguero stepped up, but keeper Hugo Lloris saved. Manchester City were never at their best and must now overturn this narrow deficit at Etihad Stadium on 17 April to keep alive their hopes of a historic quadruple of Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup. Kane could be out for season - Pochettino Football Daily: Son stars for Spurs and Liverpool pounce on Porto Champions League and Europa League: Who will qualify in various scenarios? How you rated the players - Tottenham v Man City This was the sort of night Spurs' new stadium was built for - and how Mauricio Pochettino's side delivered in front of their exultant supporters. Spurs rode out Aguero's penalty miss and another Kane injury setback to knock an off-colour Manchester City out of their usual stride. No-one can dispute that this was a first-leg advantage the home team totally merited. The much-maligned Lloris, understandably criticised after his late error at Liverpool recently, was a hero here but Spurs had them all over the pitch. Harry Winks gave a performance of real maturity in midfield and when Kane went off it was the talismanic figure of Son who again showed his liking for his new surroundings with the winner - after scoring the first Premier League goal here against Crystal Palace. The South Korean is the ideal modern attacker: tireless, unselfish but with an eye for goal and a willingness to take responsibility, which he did here as he led the charge after Kane's departure, culminating in the turn back from the byeline and shot underneath Ederson to give Spurs a precious lead to protect at Etihad Stadium. Spurs look certain to have to overcome the absence of Kane in the second leg but a lead - and of great significance, a clean sheet - will see them travel north with justified optimism. Pep Guardiola cut an agitated figure throughout as Manchester City spluttered and failed to find anything near top gear. City and their manager can have no complaints about this outcome. Guardiola's team selection raised plenty of eyebrows and the selection of Delph at left-back left City with a huge flaw. He struggled to cope with Son all night, switching off to great cost as the South Korean chased a ball to the byeline unchallenged. Riyad Mahrez looks poor value at Â£60m and the introductions of Leroy Sane and Kevin de Bruyne smacked of too little too late. Can City turn this tie around and keep their quadruple bid on track? Yes they can - and while it is of little consolation, it is at least better than the 3-0 deficit that proved too much to overhaul in another all-English Champions League quarter-final last season against Liverpool last season. However, they must show more urgency and more of their trademark attacking brilliance to succeed. Spurs will almost certainly be missing Kane but they also have a clean sheet so City must attack while also being aware they must not slip up at the back and risk falling foul of the away goals rule. The stage is set for a dramatic second leg. Son Heung-Min had more shots (four) and more shots on target (two) than any other player on the pitch This video can not be played Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Manchester City: Mauricio Pochettino concerned about Harry Kane Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking to BT Sport:""It was an unbelievable game. It was so tough. But it is still Manchester City and there is a second leg. We are happy as we showed great quality. The performance was good but there's still 90 minutes to go. ""It was a really good game. We were all excited. It's a quarter-final of the Champions League. The penalty save I think gave the belief to us. I think there were many positive things. In the spirit we played today, everything possible. On Harry Kane's injury: ""We need to check tomorrow but looks like it is the same ankle and similar injury. It is very sad and very disappointing. We are going to miss him - maybe for the rest of the season. It is a worry for us. We hope it is not a big issue. But there is not to much time to recover. He twisted his ankle so we will see how it reacts in a few hours."" ""Fabian Delph was very disappointed but he didn't realise Harry's intention was not to tackle him. In the action, both were very strong. But both didn't have the intention to make damage to another. That was why Fabian was trying to talk to him. Both were fighting for the ball."" This video can not be played Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola pleased with City performance Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to BT Sport:""There are always key moments in football. It is the Champions League and the result is what it is. ""We played well and we were controlling the game. We had our chances with the penalty so it was a good performance but it is the Champions League and that is the challenge."" On Sergio Aguero's penalty miss:""Next time we will score. Now we have to prepare for Crystal Palace. We do not have time to think about Tottenham."" Spurs have progressed to the next round on each of the past nine occasions in which they have won the first leg of a European knockout match (excluding qualifiers). Manchester City have lost all five of their European matches against English opposition, including all three in the Champions League. Son Heung-min has scored as many goals in 40 games in all competitions this season for Spurs as he managed in 53 appearances in the whole of 2017-18 (18 goals). Tottenham have won 13 of their past 16 home matches in all competitions (D1 L2). Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has missed more Champions League penalties than any other player since his debut season in the competition in 2008-09 (four). Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has saved all three of the penalties he has faced in all competitions in 2019, saving efforts against Leicester City, Arsenal and now Manchester City. City have been eliminated from all three of their previous Champions League knockout matches when they have lost the first leg. There were eight Englishmen in the starting XI for this match - Rose, Trippier, Winks, Alli and Kane for Spurs, Delph, Walker and Sterling for City - the most in a Champions League match since the 2008 final between Chelsea and Manchester United (10). Tottenham host Huddersfield Town in the Premier League at lunchtime on Saturday, 13 April (12:30 BST), while Manchester City travel to Crystal Palace on Sunday (14:05).

"The famed Doolittle Raiders led an attack against Japan at a critical point in WWII Dick Cole, the last veteran of a World War Two bombing raid on Japan in retaliation for the attack on Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 103 years old. The famed Doolittle raid was named for then Lt Col Jimmy Doolittle, who led the first US strikes against Japan during the war in 1942. Retired Lt Cole was Lt Col Doolittle's co-pilot in the lead plane. The raid, which included 16 B-25 bombers and 80 crew members, helped boost morale after Pearl Harbor. ""There's another hole in our formation"", Air Force chief of staff General David L Goldfein said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The Legacy of the Doolittle Raiders - his legacy - will live forever in the hearts and minds of Airmen,"" he continued. Born in 1915 in Dayton, Ohio, Mr Cole enlisted in the military in November 1940, after two years of college at Ohio University. WW2 codebreaking machine reconstructed Veteran gets to wear bearskin for birthday How Great Escape veteran was foiled He was on a training mission in Oregon with the 17th Bombardment Group when he heard that Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor, according to a news release from the Air Force. After he was transferred to Columbia, South Carolina, Mr Cole and his entire group volunteered for a secret mission with no known details - what would become the Doolittle Raid. It wasn't until two days into the group's voyage to begin the raid that the men were told they were on their way to Tokyo. On 18 April, 1942, the US Army Air Force and the Doolittle Raiders launched an attack on Japan in retaliation for its devastating bombing of Pearl Harbor. Though it only caused minor damage, the attack dealt a critical blow to the Japanese, undermining its assurances that the country was safe from an American air attack. Members of the Doolittle raiders lead ship Of the 80 men who participated in the raid, eight were captured by Japanese forces. Six of these men died by execution or while imprisoned. Many had to parachute out of their planes after they were unable to refuel as planned in China, including Mr Cole who jumped out at around 9,000 ft (2,743m). Mr Cole retired from the Air Force in 1966, after logging more than 5,000 flight hours in 30 different aircraft. He remained familiar at Air Force events, including the Doolittle Raiders' annual reunions. ""We will miss Lt Col Cole, and offer our eternal thanks and condolences to his family,"" wrote Gen Goldfein.

Riyad Mahrez looks poor value at Â£60m and the introductions of Leroy Sane and Kevin de Bruyne smacked of too little too late. Can City turn this tie around and keep their quadruple bid on track? Yes they can - and while it is of little consolation, it is at least better than the 3-0 deficit that proved too much to overhaul in another all-English Champions League quarter-final last season against Liverpool last season. However, they must show more urgency and more of their trademark attacking brilliance to succeed. Spurs will almost certainly be missing Kane but they also have a clean sheet so City must attack while also being aware they must not slip up at the back and risk falling foul of the away goals rule. The stage is set for a dramatic second leg. Son Heung-Min had more shots (four) and more shots on target (two) than any other player on the pitch This video can not be played Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Manchester City: Mauricio Pochettino concerned about Harry Kane Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino speaking to BT Sport:""It was an unbelievable game. It was so tough. But it is still Manchester City and there is a second leg. We are happy as we showed great quality. The performance was good but there's still 90 minutes to go. ""It was a really good game. We were all excited. It's a quarter-final of the Champions League. The penalty save I think gave the belief to us. I think there were many positive things. In the spirit we played today, everything possible. On Harry Kane's injury: ""We need to check tomorrow but looks like it is the same ankle and similar injury. It is very sad and very disappointing. We are going to miss him - maybe for the rest of the season. It is a worry for us. We hope it is not a big issue. But there is not to much time to recover. He twisted his ankle so we will see how it reacts in a few hours."" ""Fabian Delph was very disappointed but he didn't realise Harry's intention was not to tackle him. In the action, both were very strong. But both didn't have the intention to make damage to another. That was why Fabian was trying to talk to him. Both were fighting for the ball."" This video can not be played Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Manchester City: Pep Guardiola pleased with City performance Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola, speaking to BT Sport:""There are always key moments in football. It is the Champions League and the result is what it is. ""We played well and we were controlling the game. We had our chances with the penalty so it was a good performance but it is the Champions League and that is the challenge."" On Sergio Aguero's penalty miss:""Next time we will score. Now we have to prepare for Crystal Palace. We do not have time to think about Tottenham."" Spurs have progressed to the next round on each of the past nine occasions in which they have won the first leg of a European knockout match (excluding qualifiers). Manchester City have lost all five of their European matches against English opposition, including all three in the Champions League. Son Heung-min has scored as many goals in 40 games in all competitions this season for Spurs as he managed in 53 appearances in the whole of 2017-18 (18 goals). Tottenham have won 13 of their past 16 home matches in all competitions (D1 L2). Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has missed more Champions League penalties than any other player since his debut season in the competition in 2008-09 (four). Spurs goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has saved all three of the penalties he has faced in all competitions in 2019, saving efforts against Leicester City, Arsenal and now Manchester City. City have been eliminated from all three of their previous Champions League knockout matches when they have lost the first leg. There were eight Englishmen in the starting XI for this match - Rose, Trippier, Winks, Alli and Kane for Spurs, Delph, Walker and Sterling for City - the most in a Champions League match since the 2008 final between Chelsea and Manchester United (10). Tottenham host Huddersfield Town in the Premier League at lunchtime on Saturday, 13 April (12:30 BST), while Manchester City travel to Crystal Palace on Sunday (14:05).

"The famed Doolittle Raiders led an attack against Japan at a critical point in WWII Dick Cole, the last veteran of a World War Two bombing raid on Japan in retaliation for the attack on Pearl Harbor, has died. He was 103 years old. The famed Doolittle raid was named for then Lt Col Jimmy Doolittle, who led the first US strikes against Japan during the war in 1942. Retired Lt Cole was Lt Col Doolittle's co-pilot in the lead plane. The raid, which included 16 B-25 bombers and 80 crew members, helped boost morale after Pearl Harbor. ""There's another hole in our formation"", Air Force chief of staff General David L Goldfein said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The Legacy of the Doolittle Raiders - his legacy - will live forever in the hearts and minds of Airmen,"" he continued. Born in 1915 in Dayton, Ohio, Mr Cole enlisted in the military in November 1940, after two years of college at Ohio University. WW2 codebreaking machine reconstructed Veteran gets to wear bearskin for birthday How Great Escape veteran was foiled He was on a training mission in Oregon with the 17th Bombardment Group when he heard that Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor, according to a news release from the Air Force. After he was transferred to Columbia, South Carolina, Mr Cole and his entire group volunteered for a secret mission with no known details - what would become the Doolittle Raid. It wasn't until two days into the group's voyage to begin the raid that the men were told they were on their way to Tokyo. On 18 April, 1942, the US Army Air Force and the Doolittle Raiders launched an attack on Japan in retaliation for its devastating bombing of Pearl Harbor. Though it only caused minor damage, the attack dealt a critical blow to the Japanese, undermining its assurances that the country was safe from an American air attack. Members of the Doolittle raiders lead ship Of the 80 men who participated in the raid, eight were captured by Japanese forces. Six of these men died by execution or while imprisoned. Many had to parachute out of their planes after they were unable to refuel as planned in China, including Mr Cole who jumped out at around 9,000 ft (2,743m). Mr Cole retired from the Air Force in 1966, after logging more than 5,000 flight hours in 30 different aircraft. He remained familiar at Air Force events, including the Doolittle Raiders' annual reunions. ""We will miss Lt Col Cole, and offer our eternal thanks and condolences to his family,"" wrote Gen Goldfein.
