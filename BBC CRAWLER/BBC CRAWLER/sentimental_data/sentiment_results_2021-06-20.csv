"Ade Goodyear was among the pupils at Treloar's College treated with contaminated blood A public inquiry has begun hearing from former students after more than 120 pupils at a school for disabled children were caught up in what has been called the worst treatment disaster in NHS history. From 1974 to 1987, those children were offered treatment for haemophilia at Treloar's College. At least 72 died after being given a drug contaminated with HIV and viral hepatitis. ""We've lost so many friends from Treloar's and it's absolutely heartbreaking,"" Richard Warwick, a pupil at the Hampshire school in the late 1970s who was later diagnosed with HIV, told the BBC ahead of the hearing. The inquiry into the use of infected blood began taking evidence from people connected to the school on Monday. Former headmaster, Alec Macpherson, is one of those due to answer questions. ""It caused those boys a lot of anxiety and a lot of upset,"" he told the BBC. ""It put a rage inside them - why me, why has this happened to me, why have I got this dreadful disease?"" Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood The secret in my blood Liz Hooper: The woman who lost two husbands to the scandal Lord Mayor's Treloar's College was a boarding school for physically disabled children with a specialist NHS haemophilia centre on site, run by a dedicated medical team. Treloar's College By the mid 1970s, a new treatment for haemophilia, known as factor VIII/IX, became available for the first time. It meant those with a serious form of the blood disorder could live a normal life without the risk of a bleed. The NHS was not self-sufficient in the blood plasma used to make the drug so it was imported from overseas, most notably the US. Batches were widely contaminated with hepatitis A, B, C and later HIV, infecting thousands of haemophiliacs across the UK. Ade Goodyear joined Treloar's in 1980 at the age of 10. He described life as ""wonderful"" with supportive teachers, nurses and good friends. Like dozens of other boys at the school, he was given factor VIII to help control his bleeding. Ade Goodyear received treatment for haemophilia, along with his two older brothers ""With one of my very first shots, I got hepatitis and was placed in isolation for two weeks,"" he said. In 1985 he was taken into a small office with a group of boys to be told he had tested positive for HIV - then a newly discovered virus with no known treatment and a short life expectancy. ""The doctor was upset and pointed at us and said, you have it, and you haven't. And I was back in science by 1.50pm. I didn't even get the afternoon off,"" he said. ""A friend of mine picked up a pot plant and threw it against the wall of the haemophilia centre. It was a beautiful summer's day and I remember thinking, how many more sunrises like this am I going to see?"" Ade's two older brothers died after treatment with factor VIII - Jason from Aids in 1997 and Gary from health problems linked to hepatitis C in 2015. For pupils like Ade and Richard it meant living with the stigma of what was then a little-known disease. Students were followed by newspaper reporters outside the school gates and shouted questions about their HIV status. Just 32 of the 122 haemophiliacs who attended the school from 1974 to 1987 are still alive today. Most died after contracting HIV or viral hepatitis. It's hoped the public inquiry will be able to answer questions about what happened at Treloar's and the NHS haemophiliac centre run from the site. Ex-pupils Stephen Nicholls and Richard Warwick wear ties with the colours they use to support those who died - red for HIV, yellow for hepatitis, black for death Families want to know why they were not told about the potential risks of Factor VIII earlier and why it took many years until the drug was heat treated to kill viruses and other contaminants. ""What happened at the school comes back to haunt us every day,"" said Stephen Nicholls, a former pupil who was infected with hepatitis C after his treatment. ""We will never forget the Treloar's story and those memories of what happened here."" It is a rare genetic condition in which the blood does not clot properly. It mostly affects men. People with the condition produce lower amounts of the essential blood-clotting protein known as factor VIII and IX. Former students are giving evidence this week, some anonymously, along with the parents of children who lost their lives. The haemophilia centre on the site was run by NHS doctors and nurses and not staff directly employed by the school, which still cares for physically disabled children today. ""Although no-one has at any point suggested that Treloar's was at fault, it is a tragic part of our past,"" the school said in a statement. ""It was, and still is, a very difficult time for our affected alumni, their families and staff who were here at the point. ""We are completely supportive of the campaign for truth, answers and justice by our former pupils."" Have you been affected by the issues raised in this story?

"Boris Johnson said he would provide direction on how research is harnessed for the ""public good"". The prime minister has set out plans to cement the UK's place as a ""science superpower"". Boris Johnson announced how increases in the research budget would be spent. And Sir Patrick Vallance, the chief scientific adviser, will lead a new Office for Science and Technology Strategy. An expert on research policy said the move risked taking decision-making out of scientists' hands; Labour said government cuts had damaged research. The prime minister is said to want to build on the success of the UK's coronavirus vaccine programme and apply it to other areas. These include developing technology to reach net zero carbon emissions and curing cancer rather than simply treating it. ""There can't have been a time in modern memory where every family has owed so much to British scientists (in developing a vaccine),"" Mr Johnson said during a visit to a laboratory in Hertfordshire on Monday. Calling science ''the great liberator'', he added: ""I've long believed that we can invest more in science as a country. And we want to use that public investment to trigger waves of private investment."" This government plans to put its money where its mouth is as it talks about plans to reinforce the UK's position as a global science leader. It aims to increase research spending from nearly Â£15bn a year to Â£22bn by 2025. The stated aim is to use the extra money to tackle societal challenges, such as the impact of climate change, level up across the country and boost prosperity around the world. As ever though, with greater budgets, comes greater ministerial supervision - in the form of a new committee chaired by the prime minister. On the one hand, it puts science at the heart of government, but on the other there's concern that there will be more political control on research budgets that could mean money being diverted toward pet projects - rather than spent on what is independently judged by experts to be the best science - as is currently the case. The stated aim of the new Office for Science and Technology Strategy will be to push forward the government's research priorities. It will also identify resources needed to secure the UK's science capability. Sir Patrick will take up the position of the new national technology adviser, alongside his other roles. These will include chairing a new National Science and Technology Council to help harness research for the ""public good"". He said the changes would put science and technology ""right at the heart of policy making"" and said he looked forward to helping identify ""cutting-edge research and technologies"". But James Wilsdon, who is digital science professor of research policy at Sheffield University, said the reorganisation carried risks: ""Ministers and civil servants might have a bigger say over direction and priorities, at the expense of researchers themselves, who are typically better-placed to know where opportunities lie. ""It also raises questions about how much of the extra investment that the government has promised by 2025 will be channelled towards Whitehall projects, and how much will go through (the science funding body) UK Research and Innovation and into the mainstream of university research funding."" Chi Onwurah MP, Labour's Shadow Science Minister, said that research cuts this year had damaged UK science. ""Ministers have cut the budget for science this year leaving researchers and programmes in the lurch, and medical research charities have been left to fend for themselves during the pandemic,"" she explained. ""More government structures cannot disguise the fact the government has no long-term plan for UK science and is letting our country's researchers down."" ""Boris Johnson blowing his own trumpet won't protect the UK's status as a science superpower - only a proper plan backed with long-term investment can do that.""

"Burger giant McDonald's says it ""is looking to fill 20,000 roles"" across the UK and Ireland this year as part of plans to open 50 new outlets. However, boss Paul Pomroy has warned it is becoming increasingly difficult to recruit, echoing problems in the wider restaurant and hospitality sector. He told the Sunday Telegraph,externalit ""is getting harder and harder to recruit"". Also on Sunday, restaurant chain Itsu announced a five-year expansion, with 100 new outlets creating 2,000 UK jobs. McDonald's already has 1,400 restaurants across the UK and Ireland employing 130,000 staff - which it calls ""crew members"". The firm insisted the new roles were not to replace jobs lost throughout the pandemic, but to prepare for the re-opening of the economy after lockdown. It said the new posts were driven by both the new restaurant openings ""and the fact crew capacity will increase alongside government restrictions relaxing"". A spokesperson said: ""The business voluntarily closed ahead of the first government lockdown, and then reopened the majority of sites carefully."" Burger giant McDonald's hit by customer data breach Burger giant Wendy's in UK return after 20 years Mr Pomroy, McDonald's chief executive for UK and Ireland, added in a statement: ""It's fantastic to be able to offer an additional 20,000 people an opportunity to work with us. ""There is no doubt the pandemic has had a huge impact on many people's employment opportunities and threatened the future of High Streets up and down the country."" But Mr Pomroy told the Telegraph that attracting the right ""talent will be critical"". McDonald's said it pays everyone under 21 more than the national minimum wage, and everyone over 21 more than the national living wage (Â£8.91 an hour). The US is also seeing a staff shortage in some areas, and in May McDonald's said it would raise the hourly wages for its company-owned restaurants by an average of 10%. As part of the expansion, McDonald's said it would add more restaurants ""in the regions"" of the UK, although a spokesperson did not expand on the details. Despite changing working patterns and debate over the future of the High Street, Mr Pomroy told the Telegraph that the High Street would continue ""to be part of the fabric of the UK"". He said: ""It's up to us to make sure there are reasons for people to visit."" In addition to opening more outlets, McDonald's said it was introducing new menu options, including a Grab & Go set breakfast option. The company also said in a statement it was ""trialling more flexible restaurant layouts to adapt to the different ways customers use its restaurants at different times of the day"", but gave no further details. Itsu - which sells sushi, noodle soups and other Asian-inspired meals - is also expanding, with new backing from investment firm Bridgepoint. Itsu's founder, Julian Metcalfe, said: ""We've spent months in lockdown working with [Bridgepoint] to ensure Itsu will be well-funded for long-term growth"". Itsu's founder Julian Metcalfe said business was ""buoyant"" again Bridgepoint previously invested in Pret-a-Manger, another pre-packed lunch chain, founded by Mr Metcalfe in 1986, which they subsequently sold on. Itsu said Bridgepoint had bought ""a meaningful minority stake"" in the group, which was recovering from the impact of lockdown measures. ""We are slowly getting back to pre-pandemic customer visits. Outside London, we are already busier than before,"" Mr Metcalfe said in a statement. But he said the industry was facing ""the looming challenge of a severe shortage of young European chefs and huge food inflation"". Benoit Alteirac, partner at Bridgepoint, pointed to the focus on healthy food, in particular the high proportion of plant-based food on Itsu's menus, as one reason they were backing the company.

"This video can not be played Andy Burnham accuses the Scottish government of hypocrisy over travel ban Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has accused the Scottish government of ""hypocrisy"" after it announced a travel ban to parts of the region. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidon Friday that non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford would be banned from Monday. Mr Burnham said the decision was ""announced out of the blue"" and was ""completely disproportionate"". The Scottish government said it was made after ""careful consideration"". A spokesman said Scottish rules on travel were ""kept under active review"" and could ""sometimes happen at short notice"" after receiving the latest data. He added Covid rates in Manchester and Salford were ""particularly high at the moment and these restrictions are intended to minimise the risk of either exacerbating the situation there or indeed allowing more virus to come back here to Scotland"". Nicola Sturgeon spoke about the latest travel rules on Friday The decision to add Manchester and Salford wasannounced in the Scottish Parliament,externalon Thursday. Mr Burnham said different arrangements could have been made ""if the first minister had been in touch with us"". He said he would write to Ms Sturgeon and ask the Scottish government to compensate local people who had planned to travel to Scotland and businesses that could lose bookings. Non-essential travel was banned between Scotland and Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen on 24 May, while travel restrictions with Bedford were lifted on Friday. The pandemic has shone a light on devolved decision making across the UK. Scottish ministers have flexed their legislative muscles to at times take a different approach to Downing Street when it comes to tackling the spread of Covid. The UK government's decision last year to impose tougher restrictions on Greater Manchester sparked more debate over regional devolution, and prompted an angry response from the mayor Andy Burnham. Now he's turned that anger towards the first minister, arguing Nicola Sturgeon's doing to Greater Manchester what she has criticised UK Ministers for doing to Scotland - taking decisions without consultation or warning. The Scottish government insists the travel ban was carefully considered, and that as the virus moves fast, so must the government. A flexing of devolved powers not everyone is happy about. On Sunday, the UK recorded another 9,284 Covid cases - including 7,778 cases for England and 1,205 for Scotland - and a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Both nations have seen a rise in the the seven-day infection rate with the Scottish infection rate at 128 per 100,000 people and 86 per 100,000 people in England. Nearly 43 million people in the UK have had their first coronavirus vaccine, while 31.3 million of them have had their second jab - 59.5% of the adult population - according to latest government figures. North-west England had thehighest proportion of people in Englandwho are likely to test positive for the virus in the week to 12 June, at a rate of about one in 180 Scotland, which has the highest infection rate in Europe but also one of the highest vaccination rates, haspaused the lifting of Covid restrictionsthis summerdue to rising cases. Appearing on BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Burnham said: ""I was really disappointed on Friday that the first minister of Scotland just announced out of the blue - as far as we were concerned - a travel ban saying that people couldn't travel from Scotland to Manchester and Salford, and people couldn't go the other way. ""That is exactly what the SNP always accuse the Westminster government of doing - riding roughshod over people. ""The SNP are treating the north of England with the same contempt in bringing that in without any consultation with us."" He added: ""I just think it's double standards, it's hypocrisy. ""Why should a couple from Salford - who are double jabbed - who are about to go on a walking holiday in Scotland, not be able to go? ""The Scottish government can't just impose things on parts of the north of England with no discussion with us - that is simply wrong and they need to live by the same standards that they always call from others."" Speaking on BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, Scottish government trade minister Ivan McKee said a decision had to be made quickly. ""The virus, as we know, moves very fast, decisions are made very fast and those decisions are communicated at a four-nations level,"" he said. He said Mr Burnham's decision to write to the first minister was ""absolutely fine and I'm sure there will be a conversation about how we can keep him better informed in future"".

Edited by Julian Joyce That's all from the live team but we will be back tomorrow. Your updates today were written by Jennifer Meierhans, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett and Victoria Lindrea and edited by Julian Joyce and Marie Jackson. Have a good evening. We are going to be drawing our live updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the days coronavirus news:  A balance of restrictions and vaccinations would be required ""for the foreseeable future"" to tackle coronavirus in Wales, the first minister has said. More than 80% of Wales' population - not just adults - will need to be vaccinated or been infected with Covid-19 to prevent the spread of the Delta variant, Welsh government scientists have said. About70% of the populationhas had at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. An estimated eight in 10 adults in Wales have antibodies, according to officialanalysisat the start of June. First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Wales the country must not rely ""wholly and exclusively on vaccination as the only thing we can do to prevent coronavirus from overwhelming the health service again. ""The social distancing, the mask-wearing, the hand-washing, all those things are a defence against coronavirus - as is vaccination. ""First of all, we press ahead with the vaccination programme to try to get as close to that 80% figure as we can. ""The more we push the vaccination numbers up, we hope, the fewer other restrictions we will need. ""And for the time being, it's going to be a balance between those two things,"" he added. Wales has recorded 176 new cases and no Covid-related deaths today. Pfizer will supply the Philippines with 40 million doses of vaccine, after the government there signed its biggest coronavirus vaccine deal to date. Deliveries of the Pfizer jab, one of a number of vaccines signed off for emergency use in the Philippines, will begin in late September, according to Carlito Galvez, head of vaccine procurement. In late March, a second Covid surge left hospitals and crematoriums in the South East Asia country struggling to cope - and triggered a recession too.  This video can not be played Philippines Covid surge throws country into disarray Andy Burnham called the travel ban - announced by Nicola Sturgeon on Thursday - 'disproportionate' A spokesperson for the Scottish government has defended their decision to bannon-essential travel from Scotland to Salford and Manchesterfrom Monday. It followsaccusations of ""hypocrisy"" by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, following the ""out of the blue"" decision- announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to parliament on Thursday. The spokesperson said the decision had only been taken ""after extremely careful consideration, and in the same way we have previously done in relation to a number of other areas in England"". Non-essential travel is already banned from Scotland to Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen, while there has been an easing of travel restrictions with Bedford and the Republic of Ireland. ""Nobody wants travel restrictions in place for any longer than is absolutely necessary,"" the spokesperson said. ""But rates of Covid in these cities are particularly high at the moment and these restrictions are intended to minimise the risk of either exacerbating the situation there or indeed allowing more virus to come back here to Scotland."" Mr Burnham told the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday that he would be writing to Ms Sturgeon to ask for compensation, for local holidaymakers who had booked to travel to Scotland and for businesses. The spokesperson said rules on travel between Scotland and other parts of the Common Travel Area were subject to sudden change - depending on the latest data - and advised those booking holidays to check their travel insurance. ""We are taking a four nations approach wherever possible and are always willing to work across all levels of government to protect our local economies whilst, critically, ensuring we minimise the risk of Covid-19 spreading.""

A furthersixcoronavirus-related deaths have been recorded in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external These deaths all happened in England, as data released earlier by the devolved nations showed there had been no deaths in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the last 24 hours. It takes the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK to127,976. There were also9,284new infections recorded in the UK. This is down slightly after the figures had stayed above 10,000 for three days in a row. Reports of daily deaths are often lower at weekends and at the start of the week because less counting takes place while statisticians are off. Many queued at a mass vaccination clinic at Spurs football grounds on Sunday Professor Kevin Fenton, regional director for London at Public Health England (PHE), says the capital is entering a ""summer sprint"" to get as many people vaccinated as possible by 19 July. ""We're working with local authorities to get the rates up among everybody over age 18, but especially those aged over 40,"" he said. ""That's our number one focus in the city now."" He told LBC London had lower rates of vaccine take-up than other regions because of the size and diversity of its population: ""We have pockets of poverty, deprivation, we have people who travel and move across the city."" He added that PHE staff  were ""really dealing with hesitancy that people may have about getting vaccinated, it's safety, or where to get it done"". On the possibility of mandatory vaccines for care home workers, he did not sanction government plans, but said PHE would work with local authorities, visiting all the city's care homes, to help ensure ""that all staff are as well protected as possible"". Prof Fenton conceded it would be hard to get everyone over 30 in London vaccinated by so-called Terminus Day, on 19 July, given the size of the younger population in London. He said many young adults would not get their second dose until late July or early August, but he urged them to ""get the first dose in as soon as possible"". ""Even with the first source, there is some protection that you will receive.""  Actor Peter Capaldi, known for playing the famously abrasive Malcolm Tucker in satirical comedy The Thick of It, shared what he thought the character would think about revelations from former No 10 aide Dominic Cummings. Boris Johnson's former chief adviser has made aseries of explosive claims about mistakes made by the government during the Covid pandemic. Speaking on the Andrew Marr programme, Capaldi says the behaviour of the top people in government was ""beyond a joke"" and says Tucker would be ""too good"" to exist in the current political world.

More than half of them think they will be unable to appeal, after teacher assessments replaced cancelled exams. The charity wants governments across the UK to allow all pupils in the final year of sixth form to repeat a year, if their schools approve. ""We cannot afford to get this wrong again,"" said Alan Milburn, chairman of the Social Mobility Foundation (SMF), who ran the survey. ""Levelling up cannot happen without a level playing field,"" said Mr Milburn. ""If the government is truly committed to prioritising the most disadvantaged, they must have an appeals process that recognises that the pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on those from poorer backgrounds."" Scotland has made a special dispensation for those who have faced greater disadvantage - and say pupils opting to take exams in the autumn instead of accepting teacher-assessed grades should be able do so free of charge. A Department for Education spokesperson said students would have the chance to resit in the autumn, and those in Year 13 ""will be able to repeat part or all of the year if they feel they have been adversely impacted by the pandemic"".

This video can not be played Hundreds queue for vaccine at White Hart Lane The Indian government is concerned about a third wave of infections The Indian government has urged states to take great care in easing coronavirus restrictions imposed during the country's deadly second wave of the pandemic. Covid-19 infections and deaths are falling in India, which saw record-breaking numbers in May. On Sunday, India reported another 58,419 cases, the lowest single-day rise since March. The decline in cases means restrictions are being eased. But there's concern that people are flouting Covid-19 protocols such as social distancing and wearing masks. Several states have seen streets packed with crowds and traffic. The head of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has warned that a third wave is inevitable within weeks if lessons are not learnt. Given this, the government is clearly worried. The Home Secretary, Ajay Kumar, has warned against complacency in a letter asking regional ministers to take action should infections increase again. He said testing a vaccinations were crucial. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) is to take part in an industry-wide day of action on Wednesday, calling on the UK Government to allow international travel to return safely and in a risk-managed way. Abta said this can be done by expanding the green list ""in line with the evidence and making restrictions more proportionate"". A review of the current travel guidance - as set out by the Global Travel  Taskforce - is expected by 28 June, including any updates to the quarantine-free 'green list'. Pilots are expected to join travel industry colleagues on Wednesday's day of action at Heathrow, Bristol, Edinburgh and Manchester airports. As we said in a previous post, the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) is calling for urgent help because of the ""devastating"" impact of the pandemic. Abta wants ministers to bring forward a package of tailored financial support, including extension of furlough support, recognising that the sector's ability to trade is ""much slower than first anticipated and more gradual than for businesses in the domestic economy"". A Government spokesman said: ""We recognise the challenging times facing all sectors of transport as a result of Covid-19, which is why we have put in place an economy-wide support package, including around Â£7bn of support expected to benefit the air transport sector by September 2021. ""We continue to work with the aviation sector to help them navigate this period, and encourage them to draw on the unprecedented package of support measures available.""  Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent There is a lot of conversation around living with coronavirus and what that actually means. We now know a study is looking at the idea of daily tests instead of quarantine for people who have been double jabbed and might have come into contact with the virus. I understand there are some early-stage conversations as well around whether something similar could be applied to foreign travel. Although Downing Street sources are very insistent that it's not policy and I don't think any of this is about to happen tomorrow but there's clearly a direction of travel here. It does raise the issue of fairness because not everybody will have been double vaccinated. But one argument that is playing out in government is, is the balance of fairness shifting because in England all over-18s can now book a jab? Either way, it is clear that whether it's rules around travel or more generally rules around quarantine, when we talk about so-called Freedom Day, currently pencilled in for 19 July in England, it won't be freedom as we knew it. The new normal will not be the same as  the old one. Russia has reported 17,611 new coronavirus cases today, including 8,305 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,316,826. The government coronavirus task force said 450 people had died of coronavirus-linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 129,361. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and says Russia recorded around 270,000 deaths related to COVID-19 from April 2020 to April 2021. Queues for vaccines formed outside West Ham's London Stadium Here are some of the queues that have been forming outside pop-up vaccination centres this weekend as a major push to offer coronavirus jabs to every adult in England gets under way. In London, clinics have been set up at sports grounds, including the London Stadium, Tottenham Hotspur FC and Selhurst Park. Charlton Athletic opened its Valley stadium in south-east London as a walk-in centre focused on giving over-40s their second doses. Anyone aged 18 or over can book a jab in England and it is hopedall adults will have had their first jab by 19 July. West Ham's London Stadium is offering pre-booked appointments only A mass vaccination centre for 18-and-overs has opened at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium A person receives a Pfizer jab at Tottenham stadium Queues outside a NHS vaccination clinic at West Ham's stadium in Stratford, east London All coronavirus restrictions could be lifted in England on 5 July thanks to the huge numbers of people getting their jabs, a vaccine expert says. Brendan Wren, professor of vaccinology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says it is ""very encouraging"" that more than 700,000 vaccine appointments were booked on Friday when jabs became available to people aged 18 to 20 in England. Asked whether the success of the vaccine programme means England will not need to wait until 19 July to fully open up,he told Sky News:,external""We'd still need to be vigilant - but vigilance and vaccination are the two words. ""So, I think if the numbers continue to be promising then I think there's great hope we could open up on 5 July."" Official figures show the UK has recordedmore than 10,000 daily Covid cases for three consecutive days,external. But Prof Wren says the rise in cases seem to be ""flattening off"" and the number of people in hospital with coronavirus and ""certainly the severe cases"" have ""not crept up in line"" with the number of infections. He says he does not particularly think that the UK is experiencing a third wave of coronavirus and he does not expect to see a ""huge peak like we've had in January and last year."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"More than a year into the pandemic, deaths in Brazil are now at their peak. But despite the overwhelming evidence that Covid-19 rarely kills young children, in Brazil 1,300 babies have died from the virus. One doctor refused to test Jessika Ricarte's one-year-old son for Covid, saying his symptoms did not fit the profile of the virus. Two months later he died of complications from the disease. After two years of trying, and failed fertility treatments, teacher Jessika Ricarte had all but given up on having a family. Then she fell pregnant with Lucas. ""His name comes from luminous. And he was a light in our life. He showed that happiness was much more than we imagined,"" she says. Lucas with his parents Israel and Jessika on his first birthday She first suspected something was wrong when Lucas, always a good eater, lost his appetite. At first Jessika wondered if he was teething. Lucas's godmother, a nurse, suggested that he might just have a sore throat. But after he developed a fever, then fatigue and slightly laboured breathing, Jessika took him to hospital, and asked for him to be tested for Covid. ""The doctor put on the oximeter. Lucas's levels were 86%. Now I know that is not normal,"" says Jessika. But he was not feverish, so the doctor said: ""My dear, don't worry. There's no need for a Covid test. It's probably just a minor sore throat."" He told Jessika that Covid-19 was rare in children, gave her some antibiotics and sent her home. Despite her misgivings, there was no option to have Lucas tested privately at the time. Jessika says that some of his symptoms dissipated at the end of his 10-day antibiotics course, but the tiredness remained - as did her concerns about coronavirus. ""I sent several videos to his godmother, my parents, my mother-in-law, and everyone said that I was exaggerating, that I should stop watching the news, that it was making me paranoid. But I knew that my son was not himself, that he was not breathing normally."" Jessika sent videos of Lucas to her family because she was concerned This was May 2020, and the coronavirus epidemic was growing. Two people had already died in her town, Tamboril in CearÃ¡, north-east Brazil. ""Everyone knows each other here. The town was in shock."" Jessika's husband Israel was worried that another hospital visit would increase the risk that she and Lucas would become infected with the virus. But the weeks went by, and Lucas became sleepier and sleepier. Finally on 3 June, Lucas vomited over and over again after eating lunch, and Jessika knew she had to act. They returned to their local hospital, where the doctor tested Lucas for Covid, to rule it out. Lucas's godmother, who worked there, broke the news to the couple that his test result was positive. ""At the time, the hospital did not even have a resuscitator,"" says Jessika. Lucas was transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit in Sobral, over two hours away, where he was diagnosed with a condition calledmulti-system inflammatory syndrome,external(MIS). This is an extreme immune response to the virus, which can cause inflammation of vital organs. Experts say the syndrome, whichaffects children up to six weeks after they are infected with coronavirus, is rare, but leading epidemiologist Dr Fatima Marinho from the University of SÃ£o Paolo, says that, during the pandemic, she is seeing more cases of MIS than ever before. Although it doesn't account for all deaths. When Lucas was intubated, Jessika wasn't allowed to stay in the same room. She rang her sister-in-law to try and distract herself. ""We could still hear the sound of the machine, the beep, until the machine stopped and there was that constant beep. And we know that happens when the person dies. After a few minutes, the machine started working again and I started to cry."" The doctor told her Lucas had suffered a cardiac arrest but they had managed to revive him. Dr Manuela Monte, the paediatric doctor who treated Lucas for over a month in the ICU in Sobral, said she was surprised that Lucas's condition was so serious, because he did not have any risk factors. Most children affected by Covid have comorbidities - existing conditions such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease - or are overweight, according to Lohanna Tavares, a paediatric infectologist at Albert Sabin Children's Hospital in Fortaleza, the state capital. But that wasn't the case with Lucas. During the 33 days Lucas was in the ICU, Jessika was only allowed to see him three times. Lucas needed immunoglobulin  - a very expensive medication - to deflate his heart, but luckily an adult patient who had bought his own had donated one leftover ampoule to the hospital. Lucas was so ill that he went on to receive a second dose of immunoglobulin. He developed a rash on his body and was running a persistent fever. He needed support to breathe. Then Lucas began to improve and the doctors decided to take out his oxygen tube. They video-called Jessika and Israel so that he wouldn't feel alone as he regained consciousness. ""When he heard our voices he started to cry,"" says Jessika. It was the last time they were to see their boy react. During the next video call ""he had a paralysed look"". The hospital requested a CT scan and discovered Lucas had had a stroke. Still, the couple were told Lucas would make a good recovery with the right care and would soon be moved out of ICU and into a general ward. When Jessika and Israel went to visit him, the doctor was just as hopeful as they were, she says. ""That night, I put my cell phone on silent. I dreamed Lucas came up to me and kissed my nose. And the dream was a great feeling of love, gratitude and I woke up very happy. Then I saw my cell phone and saw the 10 calls that the doctor had made."" The doctor told Jessika that Lucas's heart rate and oxygen levels had dropped suddenly, and he had died early that morning. She feels sure that if Lucas had been given a Covid test when she had requested it back in early May he would have survived. ""It is important that doctors, even if they believe it is not Covid, do the test to eliminate the possibility,"" she says. ""A baby does not say what he is feeling, so we depend on tests."" Jessika believes that the delay in proper treatment made his condition more serious. ""Lucas had several inflammations, 70% of the lung was compromised, the heart increased by 40%. It was a situation that could have been avoided."" Dr Monte, who treated Lucas, agrees. She says that although MIS cannot be prevented, treatment is much more successful if the condition is diagnosed and treated early. ""The earlier he would have received specialised care, the better,"" she says. ""He arrived at the hospital already critically ill. I believe he could have had a different outcome if we could have treated him earlier."" Jessika now wants to share Lucas's story to help others who may miss critical symptoms. ""Every child I know was saved by some warning and the mother says: 'I saw your posts, I took my son to the hospital and he is now at home.' It's as if it were a little bit of Lucas,"" she says. ""I have been doing for these people what I wish they had done for me. If I had had information, I would have been even more cautious."" There is a misconception that children are at zero risk for Covid, says Dr Fatima Marinho, who is also a senior adviser to the international health NGO Vital Strategies. Marinho's research has found that a shockingly high number of children and babies have been affected by the virus. Between February 2020 and 15 March 2021, Covid-19 killed at least852 of Brazil's children up to the age of nine,external, including 518 babies under one year old, according to figures from the Brazilian Ministry of Health. But Dr Marinho estimates that more than twice this number of children died of Covid. A serious problem of underreporting due to lack of Covid testing is bringing the numbers down, she says. Dr Marinho calculated the excess of deaths by unspecified acute respiratory syndrome during the pandemic, and found that there were 10 times more deaths by unexplained respiratory syndrome than in previous years. By adding these numbers, she estimates that the virus in fact killed 2,060 children under nine years old, including 1,302 babies. This video can not be played Looking after the babies and children in Brazil's Covid ICU Experts say the sheer number of Covid cases in the country -the second-highest number in the world,external- have increased the likelihood that Brazil's babies and young children are affected. ""Of course, the more cases we have and, as a result, the more hospitalisations, the greater the number of deaths in all age groups, including children. But if the pandemic were controlled, this scenario could evidently be minimised,"" says Renato Kfouri, president of the Scientific Department of Immunisations of the Brazilian Society of Pediatrics. Such a high infection rate has overwhelmed Brazil's entire health care system. Across the country, oxygen supplies are dwindling, there is a shortage of basic medicines and in many ICUs across the country there are simply no more beds. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro continues to oppose lockdowns and the infection rate is being driven by a variant called P.1 which emerged in Manaus, in northern Brazil, last year, and is thought to be much more contagious. Twice the number of people died last month than in any other month of the pandemic, and the upward trend is continuing. Covid-19: Why have deaths soared in Brazil? Covid: Younger Brazilians fall ill as cases explode Brazil's health system has 'collapsed' with Covid Another problem driving the high rates in children is a lack of testing. Marinho says that for children often the Covid diagnosis comes too late, when they are already seriously ill. ""We have a serious problem detecting cases. We don't have enough tests for the general population, even fewer for children. Because there is a delay in the diagnosis, there is a delay in care for the child,"" she says. This is not just because there is little testing capacity, but also because it is easier to miss, or misdiagnose, the symptoms of children suffering from Covid-19, as the disease tends to present differently in younger people. Medical staff have bought tablets and phones to make video calls between parents and children ""A child has a lot more diarrhoea, a lot more abdominal pain, and chest pain, than the classic Covid picture. Because there is a delay in diagnosis, when the child arrives at the hospital they are in a serious condition and can end up complicating - and dying,"" she says. But it's also about poverty and access to health care. An observational study of 5,857Covid-19 patients under the age of 20,external, carried out by Brazilian paediatricians led by Braian Sousa from the SÃ£o Paolo school of medicine, identified both comorbidities and socioeconomic vulnerabilities as risk factors for the worst outcome of Covid-19 in children. Marinho agreesthis is an important factor,external. ""Most vulnerable are black children, and those from very poor families, as they have the most difficulty accessing help. These are the children most at risk of death."" She says this is because crowded housing conditions make it impossible to socially distance when infected, and because poorer communities do not have access to a local ICU. These children are also at risk of malnutrition, which is ""terrible for the immune response"", Marinho says. WhenCovid payments stopped, millions were plunged back,externalinto poverty. ""We went from7 million to 21 millio,externaln people below the poverty line in one year. So people are also going hungry. All of this is impacting mortality."" Sousa says his study identifies certain risk groups among children that should be prioritised for vaccination. Currently, there areno vaccines available,externalfor children under 16 years of age. Visits by relatives to children in ICU have been restricted since the beginning of the pandemic, for fear of infection. Dr Cinara Carneiro, an ICU doctor at Albert Sabin Children's Hospital, says this has been immensely challenging, not just because parents are a comfort to their children, but because they can also help in a clinical sense - they can tell when their child is in pain or in psychological distress and when they need soothing rather than medicating. Dr Cinara Carneiro And she says the parents' absence intensifies their own trauma when they hear their child's condition has deteriorated and they haven't been there to witness it. ""It hurts to see a child dying without seeing their parents,"" says Dr Carneiro. In an attempt to improve the communication between parents and their children, staff at Albert Sabin hospital clubbed together to buy phones and tablets to facilitate video calls. Dr Carneiro says this has helped immensely. ""We have made over 100 video calls between family members and patients. This contact has greatly reduced the stress."" Scientists stress the risk of death in this age group is still ""very low"" - the current figures suggest only 0.58% of Brazil's 345,287 Covid deaths to date have been of 0-9 year olds - but that is more than 2,000 children. ""The numbers are really scary,"" says Dr Carneiro. While coronavirus is infectious to children, it is rarely serious. If your child is unwell it is likely to be a non-coronavirus illness, rather than coronavirus itself. The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health advises parents seek URGENT help (call 111 or go to A&E)  if their child is: Becoming pale, mottled and feeling abnormally cold to the touch Has pauses in their breathing (apnoeas), has an irregular breathing pattern or starts grunting Has severe difficulty in breathing, becoming agitated or unresponsive Is going blue round the lips Has a fit/seizure Becomes extremely distressed (crying inconsolably despite distraction), confused, very lethargic (difficult to wake) or unresponsive Develops a rash that does not disappear with pressure (the 'Glass test') Has testicular pain, especially in teenage boys Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Judge sentencing Trump in historic New York criminal case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"The virus continues to spread in Brazil amid a lack of co-ordinated measures The number of deaths related to Covid-19 has passed 500,000 in Brazil, the second-highest in the world, as experts say the outbreak could worsen amid slow vaccination and the start of winter. The virus continues to spread as President Jair Bolsonaro refuses to back measures like social distancing. The health institute Fiocruz says the situation is ""critical"". Only 11% of adults are fully vaccinated. Tens of thousands of Brazilians joined anti-government protests on Saturday. President Bolsonaro has been heavily criticised for not implementing a co-ordinated national response and for his scepticism toward vaccines, lockdowns and mask-wearing requirements, which he has sought to loosen. Covid - what's gone wrong in Brazil? Why are so many babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil? What happened when a whole town got Covid jabs? The country has reported, on average, 70,000 cases and 2,000 deaths daily in the past week. Most of the new infections and deaths were among people aged 20-59, Fiocruz said, warning that the start of winter in the southern hemisphere, next week, could result in more infections. Despite this, governors and mayors have already relaxed the restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the virus. In many cities, restaurants, bars and shops have reopened while many people in the streets do not wear face masks or follow social distancing. ""People in Brazil are tired and they normalise death now so I think we still have a long way to go,"" Dr Natalia Pasternak Taschner, a microbiologist at the Question of Science Institute, told the BBC. ""If we're not successful in changing the behaviour of people and if we don't have campaigns for mask wearing, social distancing and vaccinations coming directly from the central government we're not going to be able to control it."" There have been protests across Brazil, including in the city of Cuiaba On Saturday, protests against President Bolsonaro were held in cities across the country, with demonstrators accusing him of delaying the purchase of vaccines while prioritising unproven treatments, such as hydroxychloroquine. In rallies in Rio de Janeiro, BrasÃ­lia and elsewhere, furious Brazilians carried banners with slogans like ""Bolsonaro must go"" or simply ""500,000"". ""His position on Covid and his denialism are absurd. He has abandoned reality and common sense. There is no explaining this, it is surreal,"" Robert Almeida, a 50-year-old marching in Rio, told AFP. Protester Denise Azevedo told Reuters: ""Herd immunity won't do any good. The only immunity you can get is with the vaccine. There is no early treatment. I have lost many friends, almost lost a cousin... people are orphans, fatherless, motherless, and childless."" The outbreak in Brazil has been fuelled by more transmissible variants of the virus, including the one first identified in the Amazon region and now known as Gamma. The rate of occupancy of intensive care unit beds remains at or above 80% in most states, while cities struggle with short supplies of vaccines. This video can not be played Looking after the babies and children in Brazil's Covid ICU A parliamentary inquiry at the Brazilian Senate is looking into President Bolsonaro's handling of the pandemic. The opposition accuses him of delaying vaccine orders for political reasons, as he has consistently played down the severity of the pandemic. But the president, whose popularity has plummeted, says he has done all he can to buy vaccines from several countries. He also insists the impact of lockdowns on the economy would be worse than the virus, a position shared by his supporters. President Bolsonaro has not commented on the 500,000 deaths. On Twitter, Health Minister Marcelo Queiroga expressed solidarity with the ""fathers, mothers, friends and relatives"" of those who had died.

"The crisis caused by the pandemic has forced a growing number of people to depend on food donations The queue snakes around the block and each day it gets longer: hungry residents of Heliopolis, SÃ£o Paulo's largest favela, waiting in line for the handout that will keep them going until the next morning. They are given a bowl of pasta with meat and a portion of rice, two packets of biscuits and a carton of milk, shared between a whole household and usually their only meal of the day. Before the pandemic, 300 people would queue up here. Now it is over 1,000, and the charity that runs it has 650 others across SÃ£o Paulo. ""The vast majority of people who live in the favelas work in the informal economy, as cleaners in homes or helping to bake cakes, so when businesses close or houses stop using them, they feel the impact,"" says Marcivan Barreto, the local co-ordinator. ""You see people queuing up at 03:00 for food. I'm very worried that as the pandemic continues, a hungry father will start looting supermarkets. When you're starving, despair hits."" Why are so many babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? What is the Brazil variant and do vaccines work against it? During the first wave of the pandemic, Brazil's government introduced emergency relief, known as ""coronavouchers"". More than 67 million people received a monthly sum of 600 reais (Â£83; $107, at the time). It was the biggest single injection of financial aid in Brazil's history, introduced by a president, Jair Bolsonaro, who had previously railed against welfare spending. It pushed extreme poverty to its lowest level since the 1970s - and boosted the president's support. But the relief was temporary. With ballooning public debt,the government first suspended the programmeand then reintroduced it but at a far lower level of 250 reais and for fewer people. Marcivan Barreto, who helps co-ordinate the food distribution, says he is worried: ""When you're starving, despair hits"" The drop in aid has hit Luciana Firmino and her family hard. She and her husband now depend on the food handout to feed their five children, living in a cramped couple of rooms in one of the favela's narrow alleyways. When the pandemic hit, she lost her job in a manicure studio and her husband's occasional work dried up. Clutching her nine-month-old daughter, she says each day is a decision whether to pay for milk or diapers. ""We can't afford the rent anymore. So we will soon be out in the streets or under a bridge."" Then she breaks down. ""I was hoping for a good life,"" she says through tears. ""Sometimes I think I should give my children away to social services."" Luciana with her nine-month-old daughter breaks down: ""Sometimes I think I should give my children away to social services"" Brazil is in the grip of a health and social emergency. It has the world's second-highest death toll from the pandemic at over 370,000, and hospitals are near collapse. A study last week found that 60% of Brazilian households have food insecurity, lacking sufficient access to enough to eat. President Bolsonaro - who once dismissed the virus as ""just a little flu"", opposed lockdowns and failed to secure vaccine supplies in time - has lost support, particularly as the food handouts have declined. Attempts at impeachment are stirring. But he still has his devoted fans, who insist ""the establishment"" are trying to destroy him. This video can not be played Brazil's Covid crisis: 'I thought it was the end' Three hours' drive out of SÃ£o Paulo, the corn harvest is underway on Frederico D'Avila's farm. He has 1,300 hectares of the crop, as well as soybean, barley and fava, nestled beside dense pine forests. And as the harvester cuts through the stalks of corn, he talks of how the president is slashing ""the system of kleptocracy - chains of corruption - that have run here for 35 years"". ""President Bolsonaro wants to preserve liberty; he wants people to get out, work, feed their children,"" he says. ""He wants people to decide if they want the vaccine, not to be obligated by the state. Freedom in Brazil has always been under threat."" I put it to him that the price of that policy is the public health disaster that Brazil is living through. ""It's not a disaster"", he replies. ""We don't have all the data from other countries so we don't know true numbers of dead."" Frederico D'Avila says the president's hands were tied by other institutions, a claim repeated by Bolsonaro supporters Supporters of the president echo the same line, hammered home by the effective Bolsonaro communication machine with claims that if other institutions, including the Supreme Court, had not tied his hands, he could have managed the pandemic fully. To the charge that Brazil was desperately slow to order vaccines, they reply that the shots could not have been ordered earlier as they had not yet been approved by Brazil's health regulator. When I remind him that many countries ordered large quantities of vaccines pending regulatory approval so they could then be rolled out quickly, Mr D'Avila tells me the Supreme Court could have sued the president if the shots were ordered and then not approved. ""If he had unlimited power like a king, it would be better. He wouldn't need to deal with the Supreme Court and pressure groups,"" he says. Brazil has become the epicentre of the pandemic, with thousands of deaths every day President Bolsonaro is on the back foot. Under fire for mishandling what is becoming a humanitarian crisis and facing a threat from former President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva, whose conviction for corruption was recently overturned, paving the way to challenge the president in next year's election. And all the while hospitals fill up, the food queues grow longer, and this shattered country watches helplessly as fresh graves are dug. Why are so many babies dying of Covid-19 in Brazil?

"This video can not be played Andy Burnham accuses the Scottish government of hypocrisy over travel ban Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has accused the Scottish government of ""hypocrisy"" after it announced a travel ban to parts of the region. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidon Friday that non-essential travel between Scotland and Manchester and Salford would be banned from Monday. Mr Burnham said the decision was ""announced out of the blue"" and was ""completely disproportionate"". The Scottish government said it was made after ""careful consideration"". A spokesman said Scottish rules on travel were ""kept under active review"" and could ""sometimes happen at short notice"" after receiving the latest data. He added Covid rates in Manchester and Salford were ""particularly high at the moment and these restrictions are intended to minimise the risk of either exacerbating the situation there or indeed allowing more virus to come back here to Scotland"". Nicola Sturgeon spoke about the latest travel rules on Friday The decision to add Manchester and Salford wasannounced in the Scottish Parliament,externalon Thursday. Mr Burnham said different arrangements could have been made ""if the first minister had been in touch with us"". He said he would write to Ms Sturgeon and ask the Scottish government to compensate local people who had planned to travel to Scotland and businesses that could lose bookings. Non-essential travel was banned between Scotland and Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen on 24 May, while travel restrictions with Bedford were lifted on Friday. The pandemic has shone a light on devolved decision making across the UK. Scottish ministers have flexed their legislative muscles to at times take a different approach to Downing Street when it comes to tackling the spread of Covid. The UK government's decision last year to impose tougher restrictions on Greater Manchester sparked more debate over regional devolution, and prompted an angry response from the mayor Andy Burnham. Now he's turned that anger towards the first minister, arguing Nicola Sturgeon's doing to Greater Manchester what she has criticised UK Ministers for doing to Scotland - taking decisions without consultation or warning. The Scottish government insists the travel ban was carefully considered, and that as the virus moves fast, so must the government. A flexing of devolved powers not everyone is happy about. On Sunday, the UK recorded another 9,284 Covid cases - including 7,778 cases for England and 1,205 for Scotland - and a further six deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Both nations have seen a rise in the the seven-day infection rate with the Scottish infection rate at 128 per 100,000 people and 86 per 100,000 people in England. Nearly 43 million people in the UK have had their first coronavirus vaccine, while 31.3 million of them have had their second jab - 59.5% of the adult population - according to latest government figures. North-west England had thehighest proportion of people in Englandwho are likely to test positive for the virus in the week to 12 June, at a rate of about one in 180 Scotland, which has the highest infection rate in Europe but also one of the highest vaccination rates, haspaused the lifting of Covid restrictionsthis summerdue to rising cases. Appearing on BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Burnham said: ""I was really disappointed on Friday that the first minister of Scotland just announced out of the blue - as far as we were concerned - a travel ban saying that people couldn't travel from Scotland to Manchester and Salford, and people couldn't go the other way. ""That is exactly what the SNP always accuse the Westminster government of doing - riding roughshod over people. ""The SNP are treating the north of England with the same contempt in bringing that in without any consultation with us."" He added: ""I just think it's double standards, it's hypocrisy. ""Why should a couple from Salford - who are double jabbed - who are about to go on a walking holiday in Scotland, not be able to go? ""The Scottish government can't just impose things on parts of the north of England with no discussion with us - that is simply wrong and they need to live by the same standards that they always call from others."" Speaking on BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show, Scottish government trade minister Ivan McKee said a decision had to be made quickly. ""The virus, as we know, moves very fast, decisions are made very fast and those decisions are communicated at a four-nations level,"" he said. He said Mr Burnham's decision to write to the first minister was ""absolutely fine and I'm sure there will be a conversation about how we can keep him better informed in future"".

"Verstappen wins after taking lead from Hamilton on penultimate lap Hamilton had led after Verstappen pitted for fresher tyres to fight late in race Hamilton had taken lead from Verstappen off start before Verstappen retook lead after first pit stops Get involved #bbcf1 Gary Rose The emotions can change quickly in Formula 1 - one minute you are feeling like everything is against you, the next you are on top of the world (or your car). I don't think many of us expected that race to be quite as good as it was! The wait isn't long for the next one with the Styrian Grand Prix taking place next Sunday. That's all from us! See you later - if you still fancy some more racing the Formula E is on later with the Puebla E-Prix.You will be able to watch here from 18:00 with qualifying up first. Allow Twitter content?

Max Verstappen fought back to pass Lewis Hamilton and take a brilliant win in the French Grand Prix to extend his championship lead. Verstappen's Red Bull team gambled on an extra pit stop, sacrificing the lead to come back at Hamilton on fresher tyres to pass the Mercedes with two laps to go. And Mercedes were ruing a strategic blunder in which they left Hamilton out one lap too long and lost the lead. That came after Verstappen had himself gifted Hamilton first place with a mistake at the first corner of the race. After a thrilling see-saw battle between the two title contenders and their teams, Verstappen moves into a 12-point championship lead after seven races following Red Bull's third victory in a row. Red Bull's Sergio Perez took the final podium position from Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas in the closing laps as the Finn's tyres faded. Read Andrew Benson's full report here.

Mercedes boss Toto Wolff, speaking to Sky Sports:""The race went back and forward today. Our pace was good but then we
had three seconds gap for the undercut - to protect it - but it wasn't enough."" ""When it comes to Valtteri, we gambled and we lost. It was between getting a penalty for
going outside the track limits or trying to get the fastest lap."" It was an eventful one... Alain Prost won it for McLaren (below) in 1989. You might notice the unfortunate Mauricio Gugelmin in the March being launched into the air in the crash that the race is actually remembered for. That's pretty much the only thing that happened at Paul Ricard until today, to be honest. He was uninjured, by the way. Source: Forix  Mercedes' Valtteri Bottas, speaking to Sky Sports:""The winning strategy was a two-stop. As a team, we were too focused on the one-stop. I had no tyres, so I was just trying to get the car home. It was no fun today. ""You feel like a sitting duck. Quite simple. I tried to get a podium but no joy. ""Another learning point this weekend. We thought with the cooler temperatures the tyres would last, but they didn't. ""If I did a two-stop, I would've been fighting for the race and for the podium. For sure."" Red Bull boss Christian Horner, speaking to Sky Sports:""It was interesting with the wind. I think that caught Max out. We thought before the race the undercut wasn't going to be powerful. Max's pace on his outlap [after the pit stop] was phenomenal. ""It's been a great race today. You only having to look how close it is between the teams. It's nip and tuck for the championship."" ""Today was payback for Barcelona!""  Jolyon PalmerFormer Renault driver on BBC Radio 5 Live Verstappen was stalked the whole race by two Mercedes, who looked quicker, to be honest. In the end Red Bull called the strategy very well and Mercedes had a slight error in theirs - and that's what won the race. It's so tight between the two and even though Mercedes didn't win, they are back in race-winning contention. Ben EdwardsF1 commentator on BBC Radio 5 Live The season is just fascinating. We have two teams at the height of their powers. We had the rivalry between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at Mercedes - which was great - but I think fans enjoyed it when it's between two great drivers from two separate teams. Sergio Perez, who finished third:""It was important to stay within the leaders. The first five-10 laps, the car was pretty undriveable with the wind. ""We were running less downforce today, so it was hard to keep up but then the track was getting better and I started to pick up and we managed to go quite long in the end, so I think that paid off. ""We did a great race and a great strategy from the team. I'm happy that [Verstappen] won the race today amd good points for the team."" Second place finisher Lewis Hamilton: ""Congrats to Max he did a great job today, they had the
better strength all weekend. ""Considering we had such a difficult Friday I am really
happy with todayâs result of course we didnât win and we was in the lead but I had no tyres left at the end so unfortunately lost the position but still it
was a good race. ""I mean we have to find some pace that is for sure. Most of
the time we lost today was on the straights. We have to dig deep and find where
that is whether that is power or drag. Weâve still got a good package and Iâm
not sure how we lost position today. ""We didnât know how strong [the  undercut] would be. What was surprising
was the run out of that front tyre early on in the race. Obviously they had a
good strategy and it worked well for them. ""[Max] was already quite far ahead and the only option was to
stay out as long as possible and hope the tyres hold together."" Race winner Max Verstappen:""Towards the end I enjoyed it! At the beginning it was super difficult out there with the wind. ""One lap you had balance then the next lap, you were just sliding everywhere. Really difficult to keep the car stable. Once we made the first pit stop, you could clearly see the hard tyres, they were pushing me hard from behind. ""But then when we made the call to do a two stop, luckily it paid off - but we had to work hard for it. Very rewarding. ""It was difficult because there were quite a lot of backmarkers to go through, but we were able to fight until the end. ""I just lost the rear [at the start]. so just tried to correct it. The whole race me and Lewis were fighting each other, so it will be like this the rest of the season."" #bbcf1 Rachel T:As a Lewis fan, massively disappointed he didnât get the win - but what a tyre magician to take it that far. Josh Earl:as a Hamilton fan that was painful to watch. Gutted. One stop almost paid dividends. Credit to Max though, great drive. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Andy Burnham accuses the Scottish government of hypocrisy over travel ban Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham has accused the Scottish government of ""hypocrisy"" after it announced a travel ban to parts of the region.

Edited by Julian Joyce That's all from the live team but we will be back tomorrow. Your updates today were written by Jennifer Meierhans, Joseph Lee, Joshua Nevett and Victoria Lindrea and edited by Julian Joyce and Marie Jackson. Have a good evening. We are going to be drawing our live updates to a close soon so here's a recap of the days coronavirus news:  A balance of restrictions and vaccinations would be required ""for the foreseeable future"" to tackle coronavirus in Wales, the first minister has said. More than 80% of Wales' population - not just adults - will need to be vaccinated or been infected with Covid-19 to prevent the spread of the Delta variant, Welsh government scientists have said. About70% of the populationhas had at least one dose of the Covid vaccine. An estimated eight in 10 adults in Wales have antibodies, according to officialanalysisat the start of June. First Minister Mark Drakeford told BBC Wales the country must not rely ""wholly and exclusively on vaccination as the only thing we can do to prevent coronavirus from overwhelming the health service again. ""The social distancing, the mask-wearing, the hand-washing, all those things are a defence against coronavirus - as is vaccination. ""First of all, we press ahead with the vaccination programme to try to get as close to that 80% figure as we can. ""The more we push the vaccination numbers up, we hope, the fewer other restrictions we will need. ""And for the time being, it's going to be a balance between those two things,"" he added. Wales has recorded 176 new cases and no Covid-related deaths today. Pfizer will supply the Philippines with 40 million doses of vaccine, after the government there signed its biggest coronavirus vaccine deal to date. Deliveries of the Pfizer jab, one of a number of vaccines signed off for emergency use in the Philippines, will begin in late September, according to Carlito Galvez, head of vaccine procurement. In late March, a second Covid surge left hospitals and crematoriums in the South East Asia country struggling to cope - and triggered a recession too.  This video can not be played Philippines Covid surge throws country into disarray Andy Burnham called the travel ban - announced by Nicola Sturgeon on Thursday - 'disproportionate' A spokesperson for the Scottish government has defended their decision to bannon-essential travel from Scotland to Salford and Manchesterfrom Monday. It followsaccusations of ""hypocrisy"" by Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham, following the ""out of the blue"" decision- announced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to parliament on Thursday. The spokesperson said the decision had only been taken ""after extremely careful consideration, and in the same way we have previously done in relation to a number of other areas in England"". Non-essential travel is already banned from Scotland to Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen, while there has been an easing of travel restrictions with Bedford and the Republic of Ireland. ""Nobody wants travel restrictions in place for any longer than is absolutely necessary,"" the spokesperson said. ""But rates of Covid in these cities are particularly high at the moment and these restrictions are intended to minimise the risk of either exacerbating the situation there or indeed allowing more virus to come back here to Scotland."" Mr Burnham told the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday that he would be writing to Ms Sturgeon to ask for compensation, for local holidaymakers who had booked to travel to Scotland and for businesses. The spokesperson said rules on travel between Scotland and other parts of the Common Travel Area were subject to sudden change - depending on the latest data - and advised those booking holidays to check their travel insurance. ""We are taking a four nations approach wherever possible and are always willing to work across all levels of government to protect our local economies whilst, critically, ensuring we minimise the risk of Covid-19 spreading.""

A furthersixcoronavirus-related deaths have been recorded in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external These deaths all happened in England, as data released earlier by the devolved nations showed there had been no deaths in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland in the last 24 hours. It takes the total number of deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test across the UK to127,976. There were also9,284new infections recorded in the UK. This is down slightly after the figures had stayed above 10,000 for three days in a row. Reports of daily deaths are often lower at weekends and at the start of the week because less counting takes place while statisticians are off. Many queued at a mass vaccination clinic at Spurs football grounds on Sunday Professor Kevin Fenton, regional director for London at Public Health England (PHE), says the capital is entering a ""summer sprint"" to get as many people vaccinated as possible by 19 July. ""We're working with local authorities to get the rates up among everybody over age 18, but especially those aged over 40,"" he said. ""That's our number one focus in the city now."" He told LBC London had lower rates of vaccine take-up than other regions because of the size and diversity of its population: ""We have pockets of poverty, deprivation, we have people who travel and move across the city."" He added that PHE staff  were ""really dealing with hesitancy that people may have about getting vaccinated, it's safety, or where to get it done"". On the possibility of mandatory vaccines for care home workers, he did not sanction government plans, but said PHE would work with local authorities, visiting all the city's care homes, to help ensure ""that all staff are as well protected as possible"". Prof Fenton conceded it would be hard to get everyone over 30 in London vaccinated by so-called Terminus Day, on 19 July, given the size of the younger population in London. He said many young adults would not get their second dose until late July or early August, but he urged them to ""get the first dose in as soon as possible"". ""Even with the first source, there is some protection that you will receive.""  Actor Peter Capaldi, known for playing the famously abrasive Malcolm Tucker in satirical comedy The Thick of It, shared what he thought the character would think about revelations from former No 10 aide Dominic Cummings. Boris Johnson's former chief adviser has made aseries of explosive claims about mistakes made by the government during the Covid pandemic. Speaking on the Andrew Marr programme, Capaldi says the behaviour of the top people in government was ""beyond a joke"" and says Tucker would be ""too good"" to exist in the current political world.

More than half of them think they will be unable to appeal, after teacher assessments replaced cancelled exams. The charity wants governments across the UK to allow all pupils in the final year of sixth form to repeat a year, if their schools approve. ""We cannot afford to get this wrong again,"" said Alan Milburn, chairman of the Social Mobility Foundation (SMF), who ran the survey. ""Levelling up cannot happen without a level playing field,"" said Mr Milburn. ""If the government is truly committed to prioritising the most disadvantaged, they must have an appeals process that recognises that the pandemic has had a disproportionate effect on those from poorer backgrounds."" Scotland has made a special dispensation for those who have faced greater disadvantage - and say pupils opting to take exams in the autumn instead of accepting teacher-assessed grades should be able do so free of charge. A Department for Education spokesperson said students would have the chance to resit in the autumn, and those in Year 13 ""will be able to repeat part or all of the year if they feel they have been adversely impacted by the pandemic"".

This video can not be played Hundreds queue for vaccine at White Hart Lane The Indian government is concerned about a third wave of infections The Indian government has urged states to take great care in easing coronavirus restrictions imposed during the country's deadly second wave of the pandemic. Covid-19 infections and deaths are falling in India, which saw record-breaking numbers in May. On Sunday, India reported another 58,419 cases, the lowest single-day rise since March. The decline in cases means restrictions are being eased. But there's concern that people are flouting Covid-19 protocols such as social distancing and wearing masks. Several states have seen streets packed with crowds and traffic. The head of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has warned that a third wave is inevitable within weeks if lessons are not learnt. Given this, the government is clearly worried. The Home Secretary, Ajay Kumar, has warned against complacency in a letter asking regional ministers to take action should infections increase again. He said testing a vaccinations were crucial. The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) is to take part in an industry-wide day of action on Wednesday, calling on the UK Government to allow international travel to return safely and in a risk-managed way. Abta said this can be done by expanding the green list ""in line with the evidence and making restrictions more proportionate"". A review of the current travel guidance - as set out by the Global Travel  Taskforce - is expected by 28 June, including any updates to the quarantine-free 'green list'. Pilots are expected to join travel industry colleagues on Wednesday's day of action at Heathrow, Bristol, Edinburgh and Manchester airports. As we said in a previous post, the British Airline Pilots Association (Balpa) is calling for urgent help because of the ""devastating"" impact of the pandemic. Abta wants ministers to bring forward a package of tailored financial support, including extension of furlough support, recognising that the sector's ability to trade is ""much slower than first anticipated and more gradual than for businesses in the domestic economy"". A Government spokesman said: ""We recognise the challenging times facing all sectors of transport as a result of Covid-19, which is why we have put in place an economy-wide support package, including around Â£7bn of support expected to benefit the air transport sector by September 2021. ""We continue to work with the aviation sector to help them navigate this period, and encourage them to draw on the unprecedented package of support measures available.""  Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent There is a lot of conversation around living with coronavirus and what that actually means. We now know a study is looking at the idea of daily tests instead of quarantine for people who have been double jabbed and might have come into contact with the virus. I understand there are some early-stage conversations as well around whether something similar could be applied to foreign travel. Although Downing Street sources are very insistent that it's not policy and I don't think any of this is about to happen tomorrow but there's clearly a direction of travel here. It does raise the issue of fairness because not everybody will have been double vaccinated. But one argument that is playing out in government is, is the balance of fairness shifting because in England all over-18s can now book a jab? Either way, it is clear that whether it's rules around travel or more generally rules around quarantine, when we talk about so-called Freedom Day, currently pencilled in for 19 July in England, it won't be freedom as we knew it. The new normal will not be the same as  the old one. Russia has reported 17,611 new coronavirus cases today, including 8,305 in Moscow, taking the official national tally since the pandemic began to 5,316,826. The government coronavirus task force said 450 people had died of coronavirus-linked causes in the past 24 hours, pushing the national death toll to 129,361. The federal statistics agency has kept a separate count and says Russia recorded around 270,000 deaths related to COVID-19 from April 2020 to April 2021. Queues for vaccines formed outside West Ham's London Stadium Here are some of the queues that have been forming outside pop-up vaccination centres this weekend as a major push to offer coronavirus jabs to every adult in England gets under way. In London, clinics have been set up at sports grounds, including the London Stadium, Tottenham Hotspur FC and Selhurst Park. Charlton Athletic opened its Valley stadium in south-east London as a walk-in centre focused on giving over-40s their second doses. Anyone aged 18 or over can book a jab in England and it is hopedall adults will have had their first jab by 19 July. West Ham's London Stadium is offering pre-booked appointments only A mass vaccination centre for 18-and-overs has opened at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium A person receives a Pfizer jab at Tottenham stadium Queues outside a NHS vaccination clinic at West Ham's stadium in Stratford, east London All coronavirus restrictions could be lifted in England on 5 July thanks to the huge numbers of people getting their jabs, a vaccine expert says. Brendan Wren, professor of vaccinology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says it is ""very encouraging"" that more than 700,000 vaccine appointments were booked on Friday when jabs became available to people aged 18 to 20 in England. Asked whether the success of the vaccine programme means England will not need to wait until 19 July to fully open up,he told Sky News:,external""We'd still need to be vigilant - but vigilance and vaccination are the two words. ""So, I think if the numbers continue to be promising then I think there's great hope we could open up on 5 July."" Official figures show the UK has recordedmore than 10,000 daily Covid cases for three consecutive days,external. But Prof Wren says the rise in cases seem to be ""flattening off"" and the number of people in hospital with coronavirus and ""certainly the severe cases"" have ""not crept up in line"" with the number of infections.
