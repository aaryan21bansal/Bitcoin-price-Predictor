"Trudy and Barclay Patoir met during World War Two at a time when mixed-race relationships were still taboo. More than 70 years later they reveal the obstacles they had to overcome to stay together. When Trudy Menard and Barclay Patoir told friends and family they were going to get married, no-one thought it was a good idea - because Trudy was white and Barclay was black. ""When I told them at work they thought I was daft marrying a black man. They all said, 'It won't last you know,' because it was a mixed-race marriage,"" says Trudy. ""I think some people thought I was marrying beneath myself."" When the couple had first met, a year or so earlier, Trudy admits she too had been uneasy. Barclay (bottom right) with fellow volunteers in the US en route to Britain ""I had been working at Bryant and May's match factory, but it got bombed in the Blitz,"" says Trudy, now 96. ""I needed a new job and was told they wanted girls at the Rootes aircraft factory in Speke. We were paired up with engineers and they told me to go with Barclay. I said, 'I'm not going with a coloured man. I've never seen one before.' But they told me if I didn't I'd be sacked so I just got on with it."" Barclay, 97, was an apprentice engineer who had travelled to the UK from British Guiana in South America, now known as Guyana. ""There was a shortage of engineer skills in Britain in World War Two so young men from the Caribbean volunteered to help the mother country,"" he says. Between 1941 and 1943, 345 civilians from the Caribbean region travelled to Liverpool under a scheme to increase war production. Barclay was assigned to work on Halifax bombers at the factory in Speke and Trudy was chosen to work as his assistant. Barclay (left) pictured with the Duke of Devonshire at Downing Street ""He stood on one side of the wings with a drill and I stood on the other side with the dolly.  I was frightened to death of him - I'm not frightened of him now!"" says Trudy, laughing. ""We didn't speak for a while and then he started to bring me a cup of tea, and then he started bringing me sandwiches."" Over time the pair became firm friends. ""We used to talk about Liverpool and history. And she was very inquisitive about Guiana,"" Barclay says. ""The others at work used to say, 'They're never going to come down now, they're talking too much,'"" Trudy adds. The couple worked together on the wings of Halifax bombers They went out for the first time when production at the factory slowed down and staff were given a chance to take time off. ""I took him to Southport on the train. We got some dirty looks then. I could tell some people were talking about us on the train but we took no notice, did we dear? ""When we got there we had something to eat and on the way back we went to his place, the hostel, for a cup of tea. And all the lads were so happy to meet me,"" Trudy says. Liverpool had the longest-established black community in the country, however racism was still very much apparent in the 1940s. A study of West Indian workers' experiences in Liverpool found that while many white women would talk to black colleagues at work, they would ignore them in public. They feared ""the attitude their friends or their family would adopt if they found out that she had been out with a coloured man,"" writes the author of the study, Anthony Richmond. It was a prejudice that Trudy and Barclay were all too aware of. ""I didn't tell my mother when I was going to see Barclay,"" Trudy says. ""She thought I was going in to town to meet the girls. She had noticed I was very happy but she didn't know why. ""When she did find out she threatened to throw me out the house."" Trudy and Barclay went to watch the Austrian tenor, Richard Tauber, perform The couple would go to tea rooms and sit in the park together. One special date was to a concert by the Austrian tenor Richard Tauber, who was touring the country. ""We saw him at the Empire Theatre. He sang 'My heart and I.' That's our song,"" Trudy says. ""I knew then that I couldn't live without Barclay, but I didn't dare tell anybody for months."" Eventually, in 1944, after they had known each other for about a year, Trudy decided she was ready to take the plunge and told Barclay she would like to marry him. ""He said to me: 'It's going to be very hard, you know that don't you?' And I said: 'Yes, I know.'"" Trudy was keen to have a church wedding but the priest at the local Catholic church in Liverpool refused to perform the service. ""He said, 'There's so many coloured men coming over here and going back home leaving the women with children. So I'm not marrying you.' We were upset about that,"" says Trudy. However, they were determined to marry and settled for a brief ceremony at the Liverpool Register Office. ""Only Barclay's friend and one of my sisters went. The four of us went for a meal afterwards,"" Trudy says. Trudy and Barclay playing tennis, and Trudy's mother Margaret Shortly afterwards they decided to leave Liverpool. ""I had a friend who told me: 'Come to Manchester. It's more hospitable and there aren't as many racial problems,'"" Barclay says. ""But it was difficult to find accommodation because nobody would have you if you were a mixed marriage."" They eventually got a room in a boarding house where Barclay's friend lived. ""The landlady had lodgers in but she took us in anyway and gave us her big front room,"" Trudy says. ""She was a prostitute herself but what a good woman she was."" Barclay continued to work in Liverpool, returning to Manchester at night. When the war ended he took the option offered to volunteers from British colonies to remain in the UK. However, it took him some time to adapt to his new home. ""You've got to have a good mentality to survive. I missed my family for about 10 years - I used to dream about them. And I found the freezing cold hard. I was used to a tropical climate,"" he says. ""He had more clothes on in bed than he took off!"" Trudy adds. ""He couldn't get warm in bed at all."" Barclay missed the family he left behind in Georgetown, British Guiana, pictured here in 1941 Barclay found it difficult to find a new job and ended up walking the streets of Manchester looking for work. He was eventually hired by the Manchester Ship Canal dry dock. The couple settled in to their new life in Manchester. They joined the local sports club, where they played tennis. ""We won a set of cutlery in the doubles,"" Barclay says. The local Catholic priest agreed to perform a second wedding ceremony for them in his church. Two daughters - Jean and Betty - followed, and the young family were desperate to get a home of their own. ""The priest mentioned that they were building houses in Wythenshawe,"" Barclay says. ""Nobody from Manchester wanted to live there, as there we no shops, just fields."" This video can not be played Trudy and Barclay on the secrets of a happy marriage Trudy went to have a look at the new housing development. ""There was thick mud everywhere and I had a baby in my arms as I stood looking at the place. I couldn't get inside to look but I didn't care. I couldn't live in one room any more."" She went straight to the Town Hall and told them they would take one of the new houses. ""We were jumping for joy when we got the key,"" Trudy says. Jean and Betty Patoir. Trudy made sure her daughter always looked neat and tidy The Patoirs were one of the first families to move into the area. ""We were the only mixed-race couple there but we didn't have any trouble in the community,"" Trudy says. ""When this place filled up everyone loved our girls."" However, their daughter Jean did encounter bullying on her first day at primary school. ""The teacher sent her home and asked me to keep her home while she had a chance to talk to the school about how God loved all his children. Jean didn't have problems after that,"" Trudy says. Trudy's mother Margaret also changed her attitude towards Barclay after her granddaughters were born. ""She would come every weekend to stay - she loved seeing the girls,"" Trudy says. Trudy and Barclay celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in September 2014. They received congratulations from the Pope (above) Both Trudy and Barclay think attitudes to mixed-race relationships have improved dramatically over the decades. ""Before people would stop and watch you, or whisper and laugh as you passed and now they're not bothered,"" Barclay says. ""People don't walk on the other side of the street like they used to,"" Trudy adds. Barclay has been very active in the community over the years. He has been president of the local social club, a school governor and sat on the local hospital board. He got involved in local politics after he stopped working at the dry dock in 1979. The couple now have two children, three grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. ""It's hard to keep track of them all,"" Trudy says. They received congratulations from the Queen and the Pope on their 70th wedding anniversary in 2014. ""We discuss things if we don't agree. We never really had a big argument,"" Trudy says. ""We're so used to each other, we don't aggravate each other,"" Barclay agrees. While Trudy says she ""can't put her finger on"" what she loves most about Barclay, her husband has a ready answer. ""Trudy is genuine, she's a partner,"" he says. ""Every morning I wake up I thank the Lord for having such a good wife.""

"This video can not be played President Trump: ""What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit"" At least for one night, Donald Trump put aside the bombast and bellicosity of a campaign that seemed to bleed into his presidency. On a presidential stage, he acted and sounded not unlike presidents of the past. Presidential, even. In his first address to a joint session of Congress, after a tumultuous first month in office, Mr Trump delivered a conventional speech in a conventional manner. That it was unexpected, and that the bar for success was knee-high at best, is life in the age of Trump. Yes, much of the content was the same - the calls for a border wall, the (unfounded) allegations that undocumented immigrants are prone to crime, the full-throated exposition of an ""America first"" economic nationalism and the warning that US allies must pay their fair share - but the delivery was smooth and polished. There was a moment before the speech when cameras captured Mr Trump in his armoured limousine, rehearsing his lines. Practice, it seems, made good, if not perfect. For once, Donald Trump's delivery was spoken, not shouted. He appeared poised, not petulant; forceful, not forced. This video can not be played President Trump: ""Real and positive immigration reform is possible"" As this was largely a traditionally crafted speech, there were some painful cliches and political pabulum to which a typical politician might be prone, of course. The line ""we just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls and the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action"" likely induced cringes from high-school English teachers across the nation. Also typical of such addresses was a text light on policy, touching on most of Mr Trump's agenda in vague generalities. There were several key moments that defined his speech, however, which could have a lasting impact. After spending a few paragraphs blasting Obamacare, including motioning directly at the Democrats during his sharpest condemnations, the president laid down a few markers for what he wanted to see replace the current system. Americans with pre-existing medical conditions should be able to get coverage. The transition from the current government-exchange system of insurance for those who don't have employer-based health insurance must be ""stable"". Insurance subsidies should be morphed into tax credits and health savings accounts, which let Americans put aside tax-free dollars for medical expenses. Democrats in Congress were not impressed by Donald Trump's healthcare reform ideas States need the ""resources and flexibility"" to provide insurance for the poor. Drug prices must go down, and doctors should have greater legal protections. Provisions preventing the purchase of insurance across state lines - which allow places like California to more stringently regulate their insurance industries - should be repealed. All of those provisions will be resisted by Democrats. A few will be questioned by some Republicans. For the first time, however, the president has staked out ground in the fight. If his detailing was productive, it was somewhat undermined by a final, typical Trumpian flourish of pie-in-the-sky rhetoric. ""Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed,"" he said. ""Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope."" Just a few days earlier, the president had remarked that ""nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated"". Now he's promising rainbows and unicorns. The Republicans in Congress have their work cut out for them. It was easily the most moving portion of evening. It may also end up being one of the most contentious. The president, toward the end of his speech pointed to Carryn Owens, the widow of US soldier Ryan Owens, who was killed during a commando raid in Yemen just days after Mr Trump took office. As the Congress applauded the grieving woman, Mr Trump said her husband's ""legacy is etched into eternity"". This video can not be played Carryn Owens, the widow of fallen Navy Seal, Ryan Owens, is brought to tears As a standalone moment, it was powerful. Viewed in the context of an ongoing controversy over the overall success and wisdom of the raid, which resulted in 25 civilian casualties including nine children (one of whom was a US citizen), the moment becomes infused with politics. Mr Trump quoted his Defence Secretary, James Mattis, as saying the raid produced ""vital intelligence"" - although earliernews reports,externalindicated that was not the case. Arizona Senator John McCain has called the operation a failure, and the slain soldier's father, William Owens, refused to meet with president and called for a formal investigation into the incident. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Trump appeared to lay the blame for Owens' death at the feet of the military. ""They came to see me, and they explained what they wanted to do,"" he said. ""My generals are the most respected that we've had in many decades, I believe, and they lost Ryan."" By highlighting the raid, and putting a spotlight on Carryn Owens, the president has offered a high-profile response to the criticisms. The move may only lead to greater scrutiny and sharper questioning, however. During his 1996 State of the Union Address, Bill Clinton asserted that the era of big government was over. Toward the end of his speech on Tuesday, Donald Trump said it was the ""time for small thinking"" that was over. Big government, it seems, is making a comeback. Defence spending, as promised last week, is headed for a $54bn boost. Now Mr Trump has revealed the size of his planned infrastructure programme, and it's a whopping $1 trillion. Although he said that some of the amount would be funded by ""private capital"" (an idea that has some Democrats fearful of corruption or abuse), the goal is still remarkable and the impact on the public purse will surely be sizeable. Throw in Mr Trump's promise of a ""great, great wall along our southern border"" - with estimates starting at $12bn - and ""massive tax relief for the middle class"", and the price tag for his speech proposals is on an express elevator to astronomical. ""Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope,"" Mr Trump said. ""American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear - schools where children learn in peace - and jobs where Americans prosper and grow - are not too much to ask."" Nowhere in the president's speech, however, was there mention of how these programmes would be financed. While the Trump officials spoke of cuts to federal agencies and departments last week, talk of ""tough choices"" was notably absent on Tuesday night. The only reference to the national debt - the reduction of which was once a top priority for Republicans of all stripes - was a passing mention of the subject during a litany of Barack Obama's economic failings. Back in the early days of the George W Bush administration, Vice-President Dick Cheney memorably said ""deficits don't matter"". After an eight-year absence, those days are here again. Back in the early hours of 9 November, as he took the stage to claim his improbable presidential victory, Donald Trump issued a call for national unity and healing. ""Now is the time to bind the wounds of division,"" he said. ""I say to Democrats and Republicans it is time to come together as one united people."" Since that moment, Mr Trump has seemed more attuned to the needs and desires of his core base of supporters, and less interested in reaching out to Democrats and independents. In his inaugural address, the new president railed against the establishment, many of whom were seated uncomfortably behind him. In his first month in office, the president has been mostly confrontational in word and deed. Then, on Tuesday night, his November rhetoric resurfaced at last. ""Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people,"" the president said. Perhaps it's a reflection of a change in strategy. Perhaps it's a recognition that he will need at least some Democratic support in Congress if he wants to pass the more ambitious portions of his legislative agenda. On immigration in particular, the change of tone was jarring, even from within the speech itself. Amidst warning of the threats posed by illegal immigration to jobs and safety, the president seemingly extended an olive branch to his opponents. ""I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws,"" he said. ""If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades."" Earlier in the day Trump himself had told journalists - on background - that he was open to providing normalised status for undocumented immigrants who had committed no serious crime, which would represent a significant reversal from past statements. He didn't go nearly as far in his speech, but the door was opened. It could, of course, slam shut tomorrow, and all the talk of unity could vanish in a flurry of tweets.

"Tanveer Ahmed claimed that he murdered Mr Shah as he had ""disrespected"" Islam When Tanveer Ahmed was sentenced to a minimum of 27 years in jail for murder last August, Judge Lady Rae said he had committed a ""brutal, barbaric and horrific crime"". Ahmed stabbed to death Glasgow shopkeeper Asad Shah - who belonged to the persecuted Ahmadi sect - because he believed he was committing blasphemy by uploading online videos in which he claimed to be a prophet. But in Pakistan, Ahmed is developing a growing number of supporters who see him as a ""defender of Islam"" for having killed someone they believed to be disrespecting the Prophet Muhammad. On Monday evening, about 400 gathered outside his family's home in the city of Mirpur, in Pakistan-administered Kashmir for a rally in his honour. The crowd chanted slogans praising Ahmed as ""brave"" and ""courageous"". One man attending said: ""Because of what he did, the whole of Pakistan knows who he is."" Supporters champion Tanveer Ahmed for killing a man they accuse of blasphemy Another speaker told supporters Ahmed could help mediate their prayers. ""You should close your eyes, raise your hand towards the sky and pray, making Ghazi [warrior] Tanveer your representative,"" he said. The event was organised by the anti-blasphemy religious lobby group Labaik Ya Rasool Ullah (Here I am present, o Prophet of Allah). The same group has championed another killer - Mumtaz Qadri - who in 2011 shot dead a high profile Pakistani politician for trying to reform the country's blasphemy laws. Mumtaz Qadri on the day of his arrest in 2011 - he was later executed Blasphemy is an emotive issue in Pakistan, where it is legally punishable by death. After Qadri was executed last year, tens of thousands of his supporters attended his funeral, and a shrine housing his tomb has been built in Rawalpindi. Hardline cleric Khadim Rizvi is one of the leading figures in Labaik Ya Rasool Ullah, and is the most prominent supporter of Tanveer Ahmed. As well as images of Mumtaz Qadri, Rizvi now uses images of Ahmed to promote his rallies and talks. Ahmed had cited Qadri as his inspiration for killing his victim, and their supporters often compare the two killers. In a BBC interview Rizvi said support for Ahmed was not as widespread as that for Qadri - but that Ahmed was held in particularly high esteem for having killed someone accused of blasphemy in a non-Muslim country. Ahmed's image is now used alongside Qadri to promote the rallies Over the past few months a Facebook page run by Rizvi's followers has released a number of audio messages from Ahmed whilst in jail. The messages included Ahmed justifying his own actions - and repeating slogans that ""the penalty for blasphemers is for their heads to be cut off"". Rizvi was prevented from attending the rally in Mirpur by police, but I met him earlier this month after another rally. He said that until recently he would talk to Tanveer Ahmed on the phone ""every couple of weeks"", and that he was proud of his friendship with him. ""I'm proud of the fact that we are in contact - and this pride will remain until the day of judgement and beyond."" Rizvi added that his conversations with Ahmed included discussions on the topic of blasphemy, and chants in support of the Prophet Muhammad. After a BBC report in January 2017 on Ahmed's audio messages from jail, the Scottish Prison Service banned him from using the phone. Khadim Rizvi said ""real Sufis"" cannot simply allow insults to the Prophet Rizvi said since the ban he had not spoken to Ahmed - but was confident they would resume contact. ""God willing it won't change anything - phonecalls have been banned - letters haven't - he will write to us."" Rizvi, Ahmed and Qadri all come from the Sufi Barelvi sect of Sunni Islam, one normally associated with more spiritual interpretations of the religion. Rizvi, for example, is vocal in his condemnation of recent attacks in Pakistan, and of militant groups like the so-called Islamic State. But in Pakistan, Barelvis have been at the forefront of anti-blasphemy campaigns. ""A Sufi is someone who devotes his life to the Prophet Muhammad - if someone insults the Prophet and they just let it go - they are not a real Sufi,"" Rizvi said. Other Sufi Barelvi scholars strongly disagree with Rizvi's position - but he is an influential figure in Pakistan. At the mosque in Glasgow that Asad Shah used to attend, there is concern at how hardline views on blasphemy from Pakistan are being spread in the UK. Abdul Abid, former president of the Scottish Ahmadiyya community, said: ""Pakistan has got a problem - and this problem is being exported outside of Pakistan."" Now it seems Tanveer Ahmed - from a jail cell in Scotland - is helping strengthen the anti-blasphemy movement back in Pakistan.

"The decline that is on the horizon for the Bridgend engine plant is the latest phase of a shift in gear that has been going on since the early 1990s. The change in emphasis goes back to 2008 and the ""one Ford Plan"" - the decision at Ford HQ in Dearborn  in the States to ""go global."" This meant operating as a global company and no longer having Ford UK and Ford Europe making different designs of cars compared with the USA and rest of the world. Stand-alone engine plants are a rarity in Ford's global operations In contrast it would become a more centralised global operation with the same models selling across the world and investment going to the plants that can prove they are the most efficient. For Wales, and the Bridgend engine plant, that meant it would not just have to compete to be more efficient than Ford's engine plants in Valencia and Cologne - which it had done successfully for decades - it would in future have to compete globally. Bridgend is one of a number of plants in Ford's European operations When Ford decided to cease car assembly in the UK, that made the landscape more challenging for Bridgend. The Halewood plant in Liverpool,externalstopped assembling cars for Ford in 1997 and concentrated on Jaguar and later vehicles for Jaguar Land Rover. Ford also stopped assembling cars at itsDagenham plant in Essex in 2002,external, concentrating on engines instead. In 2013, the Transit van factory in Southampton closed, marking the end of Ford making vehicles in the UK. Now engines made in Bridgend are shipped all over the world to be put into  cars before being sent back to showrooms in the UK . You may well be driving around Wales in a Ford car with a Welsh engine but the car will probably have been built in Germany. With Ford's European car assembly also based in Romania, Russia and Turkey, it is now a long  and less efficient way of supplying engines to production lines. With Brexit now on the agenda and the possibility of trade barriers, duties - taxes in effect being put on UK products entering the EU and also goods flowing from the EU to the UK - factories making engines here will have to be even more efficient to be kept open by Ford. For the Bridgend engine plant all these factors coming together is increasing the pressure. If an engine entering Valencia had a tariff added to its cost only to be then shipped back to the UK with another tariff put on it then it is easy to see why Ford might consider in the future using engines made in Valencia in cars assembled in the same plant. This video can not be played The story behind how the Ford engine plant in Bridgend was built between 1977 and 1980. HOW FORD CAME TO BRIDGEND Ford chose Bridgend for its new engine plant in the summer of 1977 after competition from elsewhere in Europe, chiefly from Ireland. The company had gone back to the Welsh Development Agency, which it impressed despite rejecting deals for two smaller projects. It needed an engine for its new model - code-named Erika - which was designed to rescue the company from the doldrums, especially in Europe and America. The car became the next generation Ford Escort, and would be built at Halewood on Merseyside and at Saarlouis in Germany from 1980. The Ford factory being built in the late 1970s The mark III Ford Escort - which was nearly called the Ford Erika after its development name The American company looked at sites in Briton Ferry, Shotton and was close to choosing Llantrisant before opting for development land in Bridgend. The deal was finalised after the then Labour Prime Minister James Callaghan - also a Cardiff MP - entertained the Ford Europe chairman at Chequers and then also invited Henry Ford - the grandson of the company's founder - to lunch at No 10. The firm had concerns about strikes and Britain's industrial relations record. But the deal was worth Â£36m in government money out of the Â£180m total cost - although there was also investment at other plants in the UK tied in. The grants for buildings and equipment also included Â£1m towards a new rail link to the plant. By the mid 1970s and the fuel crisis, Ford was adapting its cars to be economical and for the family The promise was 2,500 jobs but by the time it opened in May 1980, Ford had decided to take on only 1,400 workers. Some of the work had already been switched to Valencia. The new Escort would have three different sized engines, not all made at Bridgend. Some would also go into the smaller Ford Fiesta. Executives had also been to Japan to see production techniques and the same number of engines could be produced there by just 800 workers. But with industries like steel and mining in difficulty, there was still a big response in south Wales - 22,000 people applied for the new jobs and it would become one of the most important employers along the ""M4 corridor"". The ""Erika"" and her successor would by the end of the 1980s be arguably the UK's most popular car with more than 1.6m models on the roads. When Ford announced in 2015 that Bridgend has secured investment for the next petrol engine project called Dragon it said 250,000 engines would be made a year. The plant has a capacity for three times that and at the timethere were those who were concerned that this signalled the start of a run down of the plant. The news in September that theproposed engine production was to be reduced to 125,000was even more concerning, andhas built up in recent months to unions looking for clarity from Ford about its intentions. At the moment 1,850 people work at Ford Bridgend making the Sigma engine and also engines for Jaguar. It has  planned to cease making engines for Jaguar in 2019 - the same year as production of the Sigma engine for Ford is due to end. It is hard to see how Ford can retain anywhere near the existing level of workers when it is no longer making engines for Jaguar and with a relatively small turnover of new Dragon engines.

"Ed Sheeran: ""I think this year is going to be a high point."" In the first instalment of an exclusive online two-part interview, Ed Sheeran takes BBC Music reporter Mark Savage behind the scenes of his third album, Ã· (Divide). In the lobby of Atlantic Records in West London, a poster of Ed Sheeran's massive face peeks out from behind a chandelier, smiling beatifically at you. As you get in the lift, there he is again. And when you walk past the boardroom, he's present in puppet form - the marionette from his Sing video is stood upright in a glass presentation case. We're ushered into the press office, where Ed's magazine covers have all been framed and hung on the wall. There's the NME, Q magazine, Rolling Stone, Billboard... and someone has stuck googly eyes on them all. It encapsulates him perfectly: Ed Sheeran is pop's most self-deprecating megastar. According to film director Sharon Maguire, who shot his cameo in Bridget Jones' Baby, ""the more insulting we made it, the more he loved it"". And when he sold outthree nights at Wembley, he delighted in the Big Issue's description of him as ""the world's first stadium busker"". ""I didn't have a guitar case in front of the stage, though,"" Sheeran laughs. ""Although that probably would have been fun."" When he arrives, Sheeran saunters into the room in regulation scruffy jeans and a hoodie, his mop of ginger hair squashed haphazardly under a baseball cap. The scar on his cheek, a result of Princess Beatriceslicing him open with a swordwhile pretending to knight fellow pop singer James Blunt, is much deeper than it appears in photos. The star released two singles simultaneously to announce his comeback - but he has more up his sleeve But he's not here to talk about that. There's the small matter of his third album,  Ã· (Divide). Already tipped to be one of the year's biggest sellers, it finds the singer-songwriter in a new position: having to live up to expectations. After his unassuming debut, Sheeran's second album, 2014's x, was a revelation: from the Pharrell Williams produced beats ofSing,externalto the heart-melting balladThinking Out Loud,external, it was the sound of a writer flexing his muscles and realising he could punch above his weight. The album sold 13 million copies worldwide - but if there was pressure to follow it up, Sheeran took no notice. ""I felt that with the first album,"" he says. ""I remember thinking I would never write a song as good asA Team,external. And then Thinking Out Loud came, and I was like, 'Oh, OK, well maybe it's not impossible.' ""So going into this album, there was no worry at all because I knew I'd done it before. It's not like Thinking Out Loud will be the peak of my career. It's definitely happened on this album. There's definitely one that's better."" The song he's referring to is Perfect. A swoonsome waltz-time ode about his ""beautiful and smart"" girlfriend, Cherry Seaborn, that's guaranteed to soundtrack thousands of first dances before the year is out. He says the song was inspired by ""being in love"" - but then he gives a glimpse of his alter-ego: the ambitious and astute music industry businessman. Thinking Out Loud, he points out, was co-written with folk singer Amy Wadge, ""and if I had another song as big as that, I wanted it to just say my name on the credits"". ""So I did a lot of solo writing, and that was one of the things that came out of it."" Elaborating on the theme, he explains how the entire album was constructed according to a blueprint. ""I had in my mind what sound should be on what song, and which subject matter would be on which song - so I'd write 10 songs for that [idea]. ""So there's six or seven songs about Suffolk, butCastle On The Hill,externalwas the best one. And then there was a bunch of wedding songs, I guess, and Perfect was the best one."" His approach impressed one of pop's most seasoned writers. ""Ed is super-intelligent and he's savvier than just about anyone I've ever met,"" says OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder, whose hits include Beyonce's Halo and Adele's Rumour Has It. ""He's just laser-focused."" Together, Tedder and Sheeran wrote more than two dozen songs during the Ã· (Divide) sessions. ""We'll do, like, 15 or 16 in a day,"" says Sheeran. ""We might do one finished song, and then we'll put loads of ideas down - because we've got so many ideas, it doesn't make sense to spend five hours working on just one."" While the album contains only one of those songs, a ballad called Happier, Tedder isn't worried. ""I have all these voice notes of different songs with him that, if I was smart, I would be pitching to Justin Bieber,"" he laughs. The singer frames Sheeran's success in the context ofMalcolm Gladwell's theorythat genius takes at least 10,000 hours of hard work. He says: ""Ed said to me, 'Look, all things considered, you and I both know people that are more talented than us, but you know what they say about 10,000 hours? How many guys do you know that have put in 30,000?' ""There aren't a lot of us. We both are obsessed."" Sheeran was the first artist to headline Wembley Stadium solo, without a backing band It sounds like incredibly hard work - but Sheeran's songs never come across as tired or forced. Take his U2-style stomper Castle On The Hill. The lyrics effortlessly evoke his childhood in Framlingham - ""Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes, Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends"" - but he didn't spend hours labouring over them in a notebook. ""I never write anything down,"" he says. ""That was literally just done line by line, just then and there with a microphone. I put down things that rhyme in my head, and then it forms into a song. ""Listening back to it, I was like, 'Oh wow, it actually makes a lot of sense.' But that isn't how I approached it at all."" Castle On The Hill was released on 6 January, at the same time as the more up-tempo, BBC Radio 1 friendlyShape Of You,external. Both records have dominated the charts since, shifting two million copies. Shape Of You has been at number one for the duration; so did Sheeran know in advance which would do better? Of course he did. ""I've always said Shape Of You is going to be the biggest now, but Castle On The Hill is going to be the biggest in 20 years,"" he states matter-of-factly. ""Castle On The Hill is a heritage song that I'll be remembered for."" Sheeran has sold more than 22 million albums worldwide The new album splits between these two extremes - slipping smoothly between beat-driven pop hits and acoustic stadium anthems. If, as is rumoured, he headlines the third night of Glastonbury this summer, the tracks have already been road-tested with his trusty loop pedal; meaning he'll continue to play solo, armed with nothing more than his travel-sized guitar. ""I don't feel like if I suddenly got a band, everyone would go, 'Wow,'"" he says. ""I actually feel it'd take away from me."" ""When you've got a band and it's quite rehearsed, it can get quite monotonous night after night. ""Whereas with a loop pedal, you're on edge the whole time because it might go wrong in front of 87,000 people - so it makes it more exciting."" As you might have worked out by now, Sheeran is supremely confident. Yet he never betrays the sort of ego that derails other artists. This is evident in his songs, too, remaining relatable even when he sings about visiting ""four cities, two planes, the same day"". That lyric is from Don't  - a song which, like the rest of his previous album, he described as being about ""drunken regret"". On Ã· (Divide), there's no such theme. ""At first, it was a really happy album,"" he says, ""then I thought it was too happy so I took some of the happy songs off it. ""So it's just a well-rounded view of me right now. Not drunken regret. There's actually no drunken regret on it at all."" Has he stopped drinking, then? ""No. But I've stopped regretting things.""

"In a note that she titled ""Needs to be said"", South Indian actress Varalaxmi Sarathkumar opened up on Twitter, about the issue of sexual harassment within the film business. Varalaxmi, who works in the Tamil film industry, wrote that in a recent working meeting she had been propositioned by a programming head of a leading TV channel. ""Towards the end of the half hour meeting, he asked me, 'So when can we meet outside?' To which I replied, 'Regarding some other work?' He said, 'No... for other things',"" she saidin a post,externalthat has been liked thousands of times. She declined the offer, writing: ""I didn't come to the industry to be treated like a piece of meat."" ""Women in the film industry have accepted the fate of the 'casting couch',"" Varalaxmi told BBC Trending, referring to the widely alleged practice whereby actresses are given parts in films in return for granting sexual favours. ""They act like it's like normal,"" she says. ""So when I spoke to people about my experience they said, 'But, the film industry is this way, why did you enter it?' ""But I and the other actresses in the industry have entered it because we're passionate about acting. I don't think it means if you're passionate about acting you have to sleep with someone."" The actress didn't reveal the identity of the alleged harasser, but said the incident was only the ""tip of the iceberg"". Varalaxmi's words received support from many on social media - including from fellow actress Rupa Manjari. The post was published two days afterthe alleged abduction and rapeof a fellow popular Indian actress in the southern Indian state of Kerala. The actress, who has not been named, told police that she had been attacked inside her car by three strangers who flagged down her vehicle as she was being driven to work. The news sparked outrage on social media, as well as at a rally attended by some of the most prominent members of the Indian film industry, demanding that more be done to protect women. Fellow South Indian actress Manju Warrier expressed her outrage on her Malayalam Facebook page, saying ""I pray to god that it doesn't happen to any other girl."" ""It's very unfortunate what happened to her. No woman should be violated the way she was,"" Varalaxmi says. ""But there is hypocrisy within the film industry, because while we condemn the act, people are reluctant to say that part of the industry is also like this. ""When something happens to a celebrity, justice is immediate,"" Varalaxmi tells Trending. ""The police find the culprits immediately, the verdicts are passed really, really fast. But if it happens to a laywoman, it takes twice as long."" Laljy.K., the Assistant Police Commissioner of Ernakulam, near where the alleged rape took place, told BBC Trending that Sarathkumar's assertion was mistaken, and that police in the region were committed to the safety of all women. He added that ananti-harassment help number,externalhad been opened and more police cars assigned since the incident, in order to assist all women. Sarathkumar's campaign to help the Indian women who are subject to harassment is called Shakti, meaning ""to be able"" Varalaxmi is also campaigning, organising her own rally in Chennai on 8 March, International Women's Day, in order to raise awareness and demand for tougher punishments for those who harass women in India. ""Probably abroad women are taught to be a little more liberal, but down in India, although we say we're liberal, we're not there yet,"" she says. ""Women are taught that if anything goes wrong, we are supposed to feel ashamed of it. ""It's the mindset that we have to change."" Varalaxmi and her actor father Sarathkumar are prominent members of the South Indian film industry Varalaxmi, whose father Sarathkumar is also a prominent actor, adds that her family's standing and security meant she could say no. But she tells BBC Trending she's aware that is not a privilege afforded to other actresses. ""I was fortunate that I could say no, but there are other women who may have to give in to the request, because they come from backgrounds where you need the work."" But how big a problem within the film industry is this? ""It happens all the time, but we've been conditioned not to talk about it. We are taught to feel shame if it happens to us. ""I'm not playing victim here. I'm just speaking out about my experience in order to stand up for all the women who can't stand up for themselves.""

"The Hammonia Grenada was sold for scrap at the start of this year In January 2010, the container ship Hammonia Grenada was delivered from a Chinese yard to its new owners, reportedly priced at about $60m (about Â£37m at that time). Just seven years later - at the start of this year - it was sold for scrap. The price: an estimated $5.5m (Â£4.4m today). It's not the only vessel to suffer this fate. Last year container ships were sold at rock-bottom prices for scrap in record numbers. The simple reason is that there are too many ships for too little cargo. The most dramatic casualty wasSouth Korean group Hanjin, which collapsed last August weighed down by debts. Hanjin collapsed last year after a massive spending spree The container shipping industry, and Hanjin in particular, has been spectacularly wrong about the financial crisis - twice. There was not one but two waves of container ship ordering in 2010, and then again in 2013-14. Interest rates were low and money was cheap. The result - a massive oversupply of vessels. ""The attitude in the industry was when you were not making profits the best thing to do was to cut costs, and the best way to cut costs is to increase scale, buying bigger and more fuel-efficient ships,"" explains Rahul Kapoor, director at shipping consultancy Drewry Financial Research Services. ""Before 2008 and 2009 the world had been growing consistently, and after 10 years of growth no-one in the shipping industry expected demand to shrink so fast. ""To start with they thought it was just a blip. But in reality it was structural, and they totally missed the structural problems."" And there was another reason to buy - and to buy big: the Panama Canal. Last year it gota serious upgrade. The old locks could take container ships up to only 5,000 TEU (Twenty-Foot Equivalent Unit, roughly one container). These are known as Panamaxes. But the new locks, with gates weighing 700 tonnes or more, are designed to take so called Neo-Panamaxes. These are giants, equivalent to the width and length of three football pitches laid end to end, and can carry about 13,000 TEU. The new lock gates on the Panama Canal weigh up to 700 tonnes and measure almost 30 metres high So shippers looking to carry cargoes from Asia to the American east coast ports, can now take Neo-Panamaxes through the new canal - and sell off their smaller Panamaxes. That's why Panamaxes like the Hammonia Grenada are going cheap - in fact, they're going nowhere. If you want to charter one,according to research group Clarksons,external, it will cost you less than half of what it did a year ago. Andrew Scorer of S&P Platts says: ""You have a steady trickle of ships going to the scrap yard under the blowtorch, but you have these bigger TEU ships with bigger capacity, and they're going to be ruling the waves for now."" Meanwhile, ports are modernising to take the bigger cargoes. Baltimore, Charleston, Miami, New York and Savannah are all updating facilities to accommodate the Neo-Panamaxes. Baltimore container port - due an upgrade For instance, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey plans to spend $2.7bn on enlarging its terminals and shipping lanes, and a further $1.3bn to raise a bridge by 20 metres to get the monsters through. But the fundamental problem of oversupply has not gone away. According toClarksons,,externalthe global fleet of all types of commercial shipping is 50% larger than it was before the financial crisis. In contrast, theWorld Trade Organization,externalsays growth in global trade has been much smaller, creeping up from $14.3 trillion in 2007 to $16.7tn in 2015, an increase of just 15%. It's not necessarily all doom and gloom. In fact, Drewry's latestShipping Outlook,externalsuggests the market could actually be at a turning point. It believes the problem of too many ships for too little cargo is now set to improve, and forecasts global freight rates will increase by 12% this year after four years of decline. Container ships may not be so relevant in an electronic world But the reality is that the slowing in global trade may have more profound causes - not to do with shipping or economic growth, but to do with how and what we consume. Last year, Mr Kapoor wrote a report for Drewry's using the example of his son's excitement at buying the Pokemon Go app and comparing his own habits 15 years earlier. While his son was happy to buy something electronic, back in Mr Kapoor's youth he would have bought something physical that may well have been shipped in a container from Asia. ""In an increasingly knowledge based and services driven global economic expansion, the trade expansion is stagnating,"" he wrote. ""The global manufacturing engines, world trade, credit driven GDP growth model is being increasingly challenged and world trade seems to be stuck in a time warp, barely growing.""

"Saudi Arabia's king is visiting Indonesia for the first time in 47 years. And while his official business in the world's largest Muslim-majority nation is receiving a lot of attention, so is the holiday to Bali and the luxury goods going with him. King Salman bin Abdul Aziz al-Saud is in Jakarta from Wednesday as part of a month-long Asia tour that includes Malaysia, Brunei, Japan, China and the Maldives. BBC Indonesian's Christine Franciska takes a look at why people are fascinated by the royal visit. King Salman will come to Indonesia with 459 tonnes of equipment, including two Mercedes-Benz S600s and two electric lifts, Indonesian media reports said. Airfreight firm PT Jasa Angkasa Semesta, which said it had been appointed to handle the king's cargo, told Antara news agency that 63 tonnes would be unloaded in Jakarta and 396 tonnes would be brought to Bali. There will be 620 people coming as part of his entourage as well as 800 delegates, including 10 ministers and 25 princes. It will take 27 flights to transport them all to Jakarta and nine flights to get them to Bali, the freight firm said. Two Mercedes-Benz S600 cars will be flown to Indonesia during the visit Although it's quite common for monarchs and heads of states to travel with luxury goods and a huge numbers of people, for some Indonesians it's all quite lavish. ""A lot of Indonesian feel proud of King Salman and his luxurious lifestyle. I am more proud with our President Jokowi and his modesty,"" said one user on Twitter, referring to President Joko Widodo's famous man-of-the-people style. The last time a Saudi king went to Indonesia was in 1970, when King Faisal bin Abdul Aziz met President Suharto on his state visit to Jakarta. King Salman's visit comes after President Widodo visited Saudi Arabia in 2015 to promote Indonesia as an investment destination. ""This is a very close, tight, and friendly relation,"" Indonesian Cabinet Secretary Pramono Anung told reporters last week. ""My selfie with King Salman,"" said Malaysiaâs Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak. King Salman started the multi-nation tour on Monday in Malaysia, which his predecessor had visited more recently, in 2006. And he took a diplomatic selfie with Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak. The Indonesian government has said the country will see about $25bn (Â£20bn) worth of investment during King Salman's visit. The deals that will be signed include an investment of $6bn by Saudi's oil company Aramco. On Tuesday, Aramco signed a deal to invest $7bn into a Malaysian oil company. King Salman's holiday trip to Bali island is also expected to boost national tourism. ""It is an extraordinary visit from Indonesian perspective,"" Zuhairi Misrawi, Middle East observer and a member of Indonesia's largest Islamic organization, Nahdlatul Ulama told the BBC. ""They will discuss many things from economy, culture, and tourism. What we need to see is how serious their commitment is to invest in Indonesia."" Read more on:Why does Saudi Arabia invest in South East Asia? While it may bring a lot of economic benefit to Indonesia, analysts say the Saudis are getting a lot out of it too. As part of a diversification strategy, which is aimed at moving the kingdom away from its dependence on oil, Saudi Arabia has started to focus on pilgrimage services, which has now become the country's second most important industry after oil and gas. Indonesia is the world's largest Muslim-majority nation but mainstream Islam tends to be moderate and pluralistic ""Indonesia has already become the biggest income contributor for both the annual Hajj and the lesser rite of Umrah. Saudi Arabia has increased visa fees for Islamic pilgrims, but I don't think it will discourage Indonesians from going there,"" Zuhairi Misrawi explained. Some Indonesians have also been expressing concern over Saudi Arabia's increasing religious influence on Muslim countries in the region. Mr Misrawi echoed that sentiment. ""From Indonesia's perspective, we need to be careful not to swallow their concept of 'moderate Muslim' wholly, because what's considered moderate for Saudi is different from Indonesia. ""The Indonesian government needs to anticipate this. We need them to be firm to say to Saudi: Don't intervene in our ideology.""

""So I did a lot of solo writing, and that was one of the things that came out of it."" Elaborating on the theme, he explains how the entire album was constructed according to a blueprint. ""I had in my mind what sound should be on what song, and which subject matter would be on which song - so I'd write 10 songs for that [idea]. ""So there's six or seven songs about Suffolk, butCastle On The Hill,externalwas the best one. And then there was a bunch of wedding songs, I guess, and Perfect was the best one."" His approach impressed one of pop's most seasoned writers. ""Ed is super-intelligent and he's savvier than just about anyone I've ever met,"" says OneRepublic's Ryan Tedder, whose hits include Beyonce's Halo and Adele's Rumour Has It. ""He's just laser-focused."" Together, Tedder and Sheeran wrote more than two dozen songs during the Ã· (Divide) sessions. ""We'll do, like, 15 or 16 in a day,"" says Sheeran. ""We might do one finished song, and then we'll put loads of ideas down - because we've got so many ideas, it doesn't make sense to spend five hours working on just one."" While the album contains only one of those songs, a ballad called Happier, Tedder isn't worried. ""I have all these voice notes of different songs with him that, if I was smart, I would be pitching to Justin Bieber,"" he laughs. The singer frames Sheeran's success in the context ofMalcolm Gladwell's theorythat genius takes at least 10,000 hours of hard work. He says: ""Ed said to me, 'Look, all things considered, you and I both know people that are more talented than us, but you know what they say about 10,000 hours? How many guys do you know that have put in 30,000?' ""There aren't a lot of us. We both are obsessed."" Sheeran was the first artist to headline Wembley Stadium solo, without a backing band It sounds like incredibly hard work - but Sheeran's songs never come across as tired or forced. Take his U2-style stomper Castle On The Hill. The lyrics effortlessly evoke his childhood in Framlingham - ""Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes, Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends"" - but he didn't spend hours labouring over them in a notebook. ""I never write anything down,"" he says. ""That was literally just done line by line, just then and there with a microphone. I put down things that rhyme in my head, and then it forms into a song. ""Listening back to it, I was like, 'Oh wow, it actually makes a lot of sense.' But that isn't how I approached it at all."" Castle On The Hill was released on 6 January, at the same time as the more up-tempo, BBC Radio 1 friendlyShape Of You,external. Both records have dominated the charts since, shifting two million copies. Shape Of You has been at number one for the duration; so did Sheeran know in advance which would do better? Of course he did. ""I've always said Shape Of You is going to be the biggest now, but Castle On The Hill is going to be the biggest in 20 years,"" he states matter-of-factly. ""Castle On The Hill is a heritage song that I'll be remembered for."" Sheeran has sold more than 22 million albums worldwide The new album splits between these two extremes - slipping smoothly between beat-driven pop hits and acoustic stadium anthems. If, as is rumoured, he headlines the third night of Glastonbury this summer, the tracks have already been road-tested with his trusty loop pedal; meaning he'll continue to play solo, armed with nothing more than his travel-sized guitar. ""I don't feel like if I suddenly got a band, everyone would go, 'Wow,'"" he says. ""I actually feel it'd take away from me."" ""When you've got a band and it's quite rehearsed, it can get quite monotonous night after night. ""Whereas with a loop pedal, you're on edge the whole time because it might go wrong in front of 87,000 people - so it makes it more exciting."" As you might have worked out by now, Sheeran is supremely confident. Yet he never betrays the sort of ego that derails other artists. This is evident in his songs, too, remaining relatable even when he sings about visiting ""four cities, two planes, the same day"". That lyric is from Don't  - a song which, like the rest of his previous album, he described as being about ""drunken regret"". On Ã· (Divide), there's no such theme. ""At first, it was a really happy album,"" he says, ""then I thought it was too happy so I took some of the happy songs off it. ""So it's just a well-rounded view of me right now. Not drunken regret. There's actually no drunken regret on it at all."" Has he stopped drinking, then? ""No. But I've stopped regretting things.""

"Newcastle are only the second visiting team to win at Brighton this season Mohamed Diame and Ayoze Perez scored in the last 10 minutes as Newcastle came from behind to snatch a dramatic victory at Brighton and move back to the top of the Championship. The Seagulls looked set to open a four-point lead over the Magpies at the top thanks to a penalty from Glenn Murray. But Diame equalised when Christian Atsu's shot looped up off his boot. And then Atsu crossed from the left for substitute Perez, who had only come on seven minutes earlier, to fire home. The victory moves Newcastle two points above Brighton as they attempt to return to the Premier League at the first time of asking. Relive Newcastle's dramatic win at Brighton Listen - Football Daily Podcast The Seagulls were fired up for this top-of-the table contest and made a terrific start, camping in the Newcastle half and forcing Karl Darlow into two saves before he was beaten by the spot-kick from Murray. But the penalty was controversial, with Murray and Ciaran Clark appearing to wrestle each other, but Bobby Madley pointed to the spot. Glenn Murray's goal was his 17th of the season Soon after, left-back Sebastien Pocognoli was forced off with an injury to be replaced by Chelsea loanee Fikayo Tomori and Newcastle took advantage of the disruption. They started to dominate possession with Atsu looking dangerous on the right, but failed to really trouble David Stockdale until first-half stoppage time when the Brighton goalkeeper had to deny Matt Ritchie and Atsu. Although Paul Dummett brilliantly cleared off the line from Lewis Dunk at the start of the second half, Brighton became careless with Yoan Gouffran failing to capitalise on mistakes by Steve Sidwell and Stockdale. Brighton had their moments but Newcastle looked the more dangerous side, even though they were let down by poor finishing, before they finally broke through. Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez, involved in some dramatic comebacks during his career, masterminded another one with his two late substitutions. The first replacement, Daryl Murphy, had already become the latest player to be denied by Stockdale when the Magpies finally equalised with one of the most bizarre goals of the season. Atsu, who had been a constant menace to Brighton all night, tried his luck from the edge of the area and the ball ricocheted off not one, but two colleagues, Diame being the second, before finding its way into the roof of the net. Mo Diame's lucky goal left the home crowd stunned A minute later, Benitez threw on Spanish striker Perez for the wasteful Gouffran, and within seven minutes he had hit the winner. Atsu led the defence on a merry dance once again, after a superb sweeping 60-yard pass from Matt Ritchie, before crossing firmly from the left for Perez to slam home from close range. Given their next few fixtures, it could be a vital victory for Newcastle as they face every other team in the current top seven in the next few weeks. They travel to third-placed Huddersfield, who now trail them by eight points, on Saturday and then go to Reading next Tuesday. By the middle of April they also have to face Fulham, Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds. By contrast, Leeds, Derby and Norwich are the only other sides in the top half of the table who Brighton will face in their remaining 12 games. The Seagulls are trying to return to the top flight for the first time since they were relegated in 1982-83 after missing out so cruelly last season. Having been pipped on goal difference by Middlesbrough to finish third, they then lost to Sheffield Wednesday in the play-off semi-finals. This video can not be played Chris Hughton: Brighton boss ""hard done by after defeat Brighton manager Chris Hughton:""Was it [the equaliser] a sickener? Yes, and I don't think it was a result we deserved. ""I've seen the penalty and there is no doubt Clark has his hands all over him. The referee was in a good position to see it. I think it was a penalty. ""But then it's one of those really unfortunate goals. I wondered at the time how it had gone in. ""But that gives Newcastle momentum going into that last period. I didn't think we were at our best today but I still thought we would go on to win."" Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez:""It was difficult when you play against a good team and with the advantage of goal from penalty that wasn't, it was more difficult. ""Watching the replay of the penalty he was pushing our player. But the reaction of the team was good. ""We were creating chances and you have to be pleased with the performance of everyone, on the pitch and off the bench. ""We created a lot of good situations before we got a little bit lucky.

"This video can not be played President Trump: ""What we are witnessing today is the renewal of the American spirit"" At least for one night, Donald Trump put aside the bombast and bellicosity of a campaign that seemed to bleed into his presidency. On a presidential stage, he acted and sounded not unlike presidents of the past. Presidential, even. In his first address to a joint session of Congress, after a tumultuous first month in office, Mr Trump delivered a conventional speech in a conventional manner. That it was unexpected, and that the bar for success was knee-high at best, is life in the age of Trump. Yes, much of the content was the same - the calls for a border wall, the (unfounded) allegations that undocumented immigrants are prone to crime, the full-throated exposition of an ""America first"" economic nationalism and the warning that US allies must pay their fair share - but the delivery was smooth and polished. There was a moment before the speech when cameras captured Mr Trump in his armoured limousine, rehearsing his lines. Practice, it seems, made good, if not perfect. For once, Donald Trump's delivery was spoken, not shouted. He appeared poised, not petulant; forceful, not forced. This video can not be played President Trump: ""Real and positive immigration reform is possible"" As this was largely a traditionally crafted speech, there were some painful cliches and political pabulum to which a typical politician might be prone, of course. The line ""we just need the courage to share the dreams that fill our hearts, the bravery to express the hopes that stir our souls and the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action"" likely induced cringes from high-school English teachers across the nation. Also typical of such addresses was a text light on policy, touching on most of Mr Trump's agenda in vague generalities. There were several key moments that defined his speech, however, which could have a lasting impact. After spending a few paragraphs blasting Obamacare, including motioning directly at the Democrats during his sharpest condemnations, the president laid down a few markers for what he wanted to see replace the current system. Americans with pre-existing medical conditions should be able to get coverage. The transition from the current government-exchange system of insurance for those who don't have employer-based health insurance must be ""stable"". Insurance subsidies should be morphed into tax credits and health savings accounts, which let Americans put aside tax-free dollars for medical expenses. Democrats in Congress were not impressed by Donald Trump's healthcare reform ideas States need the ""resources and flexibility"" to provide insurance for the poor. Drug prices must go down, and doctors should have greater legal protections. Provisions preventing the purchase of insurance across state lines - which allow places like California to more stringently regulate their insurance industries - should be repealed. All of those provisions will be resisted by Democrats. A few will be questioned by some Republicans. For the first time, however, the president has staked out ground in the fight. If his detailing was productive, it was somewhat undermined by a final, typical Trumpian flourish of pie-in-the-sky rhetoric. ""Everything that is broken in our country can be fixed,"" he said. ""Every problem can be solved. And every hurting family can find healing and hope."" Just a few days earlier, the president had remarked that ""nobody knew that healthcare could be so complicated"". Now he's promising rainbows and unicorns. The Republicans in Congress have their work cut out for them. It was easily the most moving portion of evening. It may also end up being one of the most contentious. The president, toward the end of his speech pointed to Carryn Owens, the widow of US soldier Ryan Owens, who was killed during a commando raid in Yemen just days after Mr Trump took office. As the Congress applauded the grieving woman, Mr Trump said her husband's ""legacy is etched into eternity"". This video can not be played Carryn Owens, the widow of fallen Navy Seal, Ryan Owens, is brought to tears As a standalone moment, it was powerful. Viewed in the context of an ongoing controversy over the overall success and wisdom of the raid, which resulted in 25 civilian casualties including nine children (one of whom was a US citizen), the moment becomes infused with politics. Mr Trump quoted his Defence Secretary, James Mattis, as saying the raid produced ""vital intelligence"" - although earliernews reports,externalindicated that was not the case. Arizona Senator John McCain has called the operation a failure, and the slain soldier's father, William Owens, refused to meet with president and called for a formal investigation into the incident. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Trump appeared to lay the blame for Owens' death at the feet of the military. ""They came to see me, and they explained what they wanted to do,"" he said. ""My generals are the most respected that we've had in many decades, I believe, and they lost Ryan."" By highlighting the raid, and putting a spotlight on Carryn Owens, the president has offered a high-profile response to the criticisms. The move may only lead to greater scrutiny and sharper questioning, however. During his 1996 State of the Union Address, Bill Clinton asserted that the era of big government was over. Toward the end of his speech on Tuesday, Donald Trump said it was the ""time for small thinking"" that was over. Big government, it seems, is making a comeback. Defence spending, as promised last week, is headed for a $54bn boost. Now Mr Trump has revealed the size of his planned infrastructure programme, and it's a whopping $1 trillion. Although he said that some of the amount would be funded by ""private capital"" (an idea that has some Democrats fearful of corruption or abuse), the goal is still remarkable and the impact on the public purse will surely be sizeable. Throw in Mr Trump's promise of a ""great, great wall along our southern border"" - with estimates starting at $12bn - and ""massive tax relief for the middle class"", and the price tag for his speech proposals is on an express elevator to astronomical. ""Cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope,"" Mr Trump said. ""American footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream. Millions lifted from welfare to work is not too much to expect. And streets where mothers are safe from fear - schools where children learn in peace - and jobs where Americans prosper and grow - are not too much to ask."" Nowhere in the president's speech, however, was there mention of how these programmes would be financed. While the Trump officials spoke of cuts to federal agencies and departments last week, talk of ""tough choices"" was notably absent on Tuesday night. The only reference to the national debt - the reduction of which was once a top priority for Republicans of all stripes - was a passing mention of the subject during a litany of Barack Obama's economic failings. Back in the early days of the George W Bush administration, Vice-President Dick Cheney memorably said ""deficits don't matter"". After an eight-year absence, those days are here again. Back in the early hours of 9 November, as he took the stage to claim his improbable presidential victory, Donald Trump issued a call for national unity and healing. ""Now is the time to bind the wounds of division,"" he said. ""I say to Democrats and Republicans it is time to come together as one united people."" Since that moment, Mr Trump has seemed more attuned to the needs and desires of his core base of supporters, and less interested in reaching out to Democrats and independents. In his inaugural address, the new president railed against the establishment, many of whom were seated uncomfortably behind him. In his first month in office, the president has been mostly confrontational in word and deed. Then, on Tuesday night, his November rhetoric resurfaced at last. ""Democrats and Republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the American people,"" the president said. Perhaps it's a reflection of a change in strategy. Perhaps it's a recognition that he will need at least some Democratic support in Congress if he wants to pass the more ambitious portions of his legislative agenda. On immigration in particular, the change of tone was jarring, even from within the speech itself. Amidst warning of the threats posed by illegal immigration to jobs and safety, the president seemingly extended an olive branch to his opponents. ""I believe that real and positive immigration reform is possible, as long as we focus on the following goals: to improve jobs and wages for Americans, to strengthen our nation's security, and to restore respect for our laws,"" he said. ""If we are guided by the well-being of American citizens, then I believe Republicans and Democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades."" Earlier in the day Trump himself had told journalists - on background - that he was open to providing normalised status for undocumented immigrants who had committed no serious crime, which would represent a significant reversal from past statements. He didn't go nearly as far in his speech, but the door was opened. It could, of course, slam shut tomorrow, and all the talk of unity could vanish in a flurry of tweets.

"Artwork: The Earth's magnetosphere protects the planet from a continuous flow of cosmic radiation What does a sensational scientific discovery about asolar storm in the Earth's magnetic fieldhave to do with old, recycled steel pipes which lay buried for more than a decade under a now-defunct gold mine in India? Almost everything. More than 3,700 such pipes are actually at the heart of a most significant scientific finding. A team of Indian and Japanese scientists recently published aninternationally-feted paper,externalwhich recorded  the events that unfolded after a breach in the Earth's magnetic shield. Using the GRAPES-3 muon (a sub-atomic particle) telescope - the world's largest of its kind - at the Cosmic Ray Laboratory in Ooty, a hill station in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the scientists recorded a two-hour burst of galactic cosmic rays that invaded the atmosphere on 22 June 2015. The magnetic field breach was the result of charged particles from the Sun striking the Earth at high speed. Solar storms of such high magnitudes can knock out satellites and aircraft autopilots, cause catastrophic power outages, and take us, according to one of the scientists leading the research, Dr Sunil Gupta, ""back to the Stone Age"". Auroras are one of the consequences of geomagnetic storms The sudden release of magnetic energy stored in the Sun's atmosphere can cause a bright flare This can also release bursts of charged particles into space These solar ""eruptions"" are known as coronal mass ejections or CMEs When headed in our direction, the charged gas collides with the magnetic ""sheath"" around Earth The subsequent disturbances in the Earth's magnetic envelope are called solar storms They caninterfere with technology,external: satellites, electrical grids and communications systems They can also cause aurorae - Northern and Southern Lights - to be seen at lower latitudes The largest such solar storm in recorded history took place in 1859 and disrupted a robust and new communication system involving telegraph lines Scientists record breach in magnetic field The world's largest and most sensitive cosmic ray telescope located in Ooty is made up of four-decades old recycled zinc-coated steel pipes. ""Necessity is the mother of invention. When you don't have the money to buy new, expensive stuff, you look within the system to find out your own solutions to reduce costs. India's scientists have mastered the art of recycling and coming up with their own inexpensive solutions,"" Pallava Bagla, India correspondent for Science magazine, told me. A notable example: India's 2014 operation mission to Mars, cost the exchequer 4.5bn rupees ($67m;Â£54m),almost 10 times less than the American Maven orbiter.(This prompted Prime Minister Narendra Modi to quip that India's real-life Martian adventure cost less than Hollywood film Gravity.) The Ooty laboratory's annual budget is about $375,000. The zinc-coated steel pipes once lay under one of the deepest gold mines in the world The 6m (19.65 ft) long pipes, which acted as sensors in the telescope, lay in underground caverns below the centuries-oldKolar Gold Fieldsin southern Karnataka state, home to one of the world's deepest gold mines, for nearly two-decades. The pipes were imported from Japan - where they are normally used at building construction sites - to help a team of Indian and Japanese scientists examineneutrinos,sub-atomic particles produced in high energy interactions in the galaxy and beyond. The scientists had laid them 2km (1.24 miles) below the earth for their experiment. When gold prices fell to unprofitable levels and the fields began shutting down in the early 1990s, authorities planned to remove the pipes and dispose them off as scrap. ""We said we want to re-use them for our experiments,"" Dr Gupta told me. Eventually, some 7,500 of the pipes were transported by truck to a hilly 100-acre campus that the laboratory shares with a radio astronomy centre. The place skirts a forest populated by deer, bison, tigers and wild boars. Recently, CCTV cameras captured a tiger strolling past the sensors at night. Work on recording cosmic rays in Ooty began in right earnest in 1998, when the scientists began making muon sensors from the discarded pipes to research high energy cosmic rays. The Sun periodically ejects vast clouds of charged particles into space Mohammad Haroon, a gardener at the facility, has learnt to weld the old pipes Today, 3,712 steel tubes, stacked up against layers of concrete, are housed across 560 sq m in four squat brown-and-white colour buildings, home to the world's largest such muon telescope. There are a couple of dozen such telescopes in the world, but none as powerful as the one in Ooty. At the laboratory, a small group of scientists and assorted helpers - local gardeners and carpenters, for example - continue to recycle the old pipes, so that they can be used as cosmic ray detectors. To do this, they open the pipes and clean them with high pressure water jets. They insert a 100 micron - as thick as a strand of human hair - tungsten wire into the pipe and anchor it at both ends with hermetic seals. The pipes are then filled with a gas comprising methane and argon and an electric potential run through it to enable it to become an effective sensor. Finally, they are laid out in rows - below two metres of concrete, which act as absorbers - to become a muon telescope. The fabledjugaad- an Indian colloquial word that means ingenious improvisation in the face of scarce resources - extends to using the pipes as sensors. When the scientists at the laboratory wanted to make doubly sure that the old pipes were not leaking, they modified a helium spray gun by attaching a 7-cent injection syringe needle to the nozzle of the gas jet to help them to carry out the precise leak tests. A cosmic ray signal captured on an oscilloscope at the laboratory The opening in the magnetic shield was detected with the GRAPES-3 muon telescope ""Every day, we make 10 such recycled pipes ready for our experiments. The plan was to make very sensitive sensors to detect the weakest of signals. We wanted to measure cosmic rays with higher sensitivity than ever done before"", says Atul Jain, a scientist at the facility. The laboratory itself is a shining example of home-grown innovation. The majority of the electronic equipment is designed, assembled and manufactured in-house. The software for the computer programmes is locally made. The 40GB of raw data from cosmic rays that it generates every day is stored and processed by a cluster of computers which has been largely assembled in-house, cutting costs and saving hefty maintenance fees. Old computers are stripped for parts. A locally developed cooling system using fans saves electricity and protects the computers. A spray gun modified in house for the precise locations of leaks by attaching a syringe needle At the moment, the scientists plan to pore over 17 years of data on cosmic rays recorded by the lab's sensors to find out whether they offer more clues about forecasting space weather and advance warnings about solar flares. They say there have been some 38 severe solar storms in the past 17 years. ""We should be able to sift through our data to find out more about them. For us, they are a gift from the Sun, because they add to our knowledge on space weather,"" says Dr Gupta.

"Joseph Ombimbo Nyakwaka and his wife Beatrice used their cash transfer to buy seeds and improve their home What is the best way of ensuring aid money is used effectively and efficiently? In Kenya, charities are experimenting with direct cash transfers, allowing individual recipients to spend the money on whatever they like. Thousands of groups spend billions of dollars every year helping tens of millions of people. Whether it's a response to a humanitarian crisis or trying to lift communities out of poverty, aid accounts for a hefty chunk of the budgets of governments, UN agencies and international organisations. It takes many different forms: sacks of grain delivered to hungry people, tents provided to the homeless or displaced, and increasingly it's cash - delivered electronically to a phone or credit card. Some cash comes with conditions - allowing the bearer to buy only certain things for example, but there's a surge of support for unconditional direct cash transfers, because the research shows it can be incredibly effective. This video can not be played What happens when aid is given in cash? How would you spend $1,000? ""Cash transfers are one of the social programmes that have been most extensively studied and we know that they can be very effective,"" said Francesca Bastagli from the Overseas Development Institute, which published a detailed report on the subject. ""Cash transfers increase people's income, people's consumption, particularly food consumption, but also improve dietary diversity. ""We find strong evidence linking cash transfers to increasing school attendance, health care visits, household savings, and increasing investments in productive assets."" In Kisumu, western Kenya, a charity called GiveDirectly has spent more than five years giving out large lump sums of money. With the strapline ""We aim to reshape international giving"", it was started by a group of Harvard and MIT economics students and its impact has been closely researched. Each recipient is sent about $1,000 (Â£800) in two or three instalments and they can spend the money on whatever they like. ""We find strong evidence linking cash transfers to increasing school attendance, health care visits, in household savings, and increasing investments in productive assets."" Francesca Bastagli, Overseas Development Institute A new roof was a popular purchase in Kakojo village two years ago when the cash popped up on the phones of those selected. ""We use a variety of different indicators like asset ownership, the size of the house, the number of kids, that kind of thing,"" said Will Lee, the charity's country director for Kenya. Emily Aeino Otieno's new tin roof not only helps her collect runoff water when it rains, but it saves her the money she was using to repair thatch twice a year. ""I'm happy because I'm not using any more money on my roof,"" she said. ""I can use that money to buy my clothes, food, pay school fees and other expenses."" And she also has a little business buying cooking fat in bulk and selling it off in small packets. Joseph Ombimbo Nyakwaka and his wife Beatrice bought some seed and fertiliser and were harvesting maize to eat and sell. They also paid for two cows and two calves as an investment, some wooden beams to improve their home, school fees for one of the children and even had some left over to pay a dowry - more than 30 years after they were married. GiveDirectly claims 91% of the money people donate goes directly to those in need - taking out many of the overheads. And it's not just charities or non-governmental organisations which are increasingly turning to the direct payment route. The UK government's Department for International Development (DfID) funds them elsewhere in Kenya - in the drought-hit counties in the arid north and north-east. In Wajir County, the cattle graze on whatever scraps of grass they can find as they plod through sand under a burning sun. The pastoralists here are mainly nomads, leading their cattle, sheep, goats and camels to the water holes, but struggling to find them pasture. Abdullahi Haji Abdi used to have 100 head of cattle, but the last big drought took many of them, and now he's trying to hold on to the few he has left. The UK's Department for International Development has experimented with cash transfers in some parts of Kenya affected by severe drought When times are tough the animals are sold to pay the bills - often when the price is at its lowest - and when the rains return the assets are gone and people just get poorer. ""If it wasn't for these cash payments I'd have to sell the livestock to pay for school fees, food for the family and the basic things,"" he told me. When the credit is remotely added to his plastic card he pops it into one of those machines that normally takes debit card payments, and the teller checks his identity by scanning his fingerprint. She then hands over the $25 or so he receives each month from a black plastic bag full of cash. It's called the Hunger Safety Net Programme and provides regular payments to more than half a million people - 34% of that money was provided by Kenya last year, the rest funded by DfID. The Kenyan government's National Drought Management Authority also makes payments to hundreds of thousands more people when drought starts to bite - all that money is provided by UK taxpayers. In the UK, there has been criticism of government aid payments - especially in relation to direct cash transfers - with suggestions people would waste it or abuse the system. ""There is no evidence that recipients of cash transfers are using this cash on goods such as alcohol or tobacco,"" said Ms Bastagli from the Overseas Development Institute. ""There's a common claim that cash transfers can make people lazy or make them work less, but there's no evidence to suggest cash transfers lead to a reduction in people working.""
