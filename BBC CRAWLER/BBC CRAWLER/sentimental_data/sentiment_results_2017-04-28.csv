"This video can not be played Paul Nuttall: We are only halfway through the war Paul Nuttall has said Brexit is a ""job half done"" and UKIP MPs are needed to ""see this through to the end"" as he launches his party's election campaign. Mr Nuttall accused the prime minister of ""backsliding"" on immigration and said a ""whopping Conservative majority"" would ""put Brexit in peril"". UKIP would fight seats across ""the vast majority of the country"" but would stand not against some pro-Brexit MPs. The party won 3.9m votes in 2015 which resulted in only one seat. Mr Nuttall said ditching the ""antiquated"" and ""unfair"" first-past-the-post voting system would be among ""radical"" domestic policies in a ""fully-costed"" manifesto which would show UKIP was not just about Brexit.

Analysis: Deals, pacts and alliances General election: What you need to know But he added: ""In many ways it is an election which is on our turf. It is a Brexit election"". He accused Prime Minister Theresa May of ""flagrant opportunism"" in calling the snap election for 8 June because the Conservatives were so far ahead of Labour in the polls. ""A whopping Conservative majority will only serve to put Brexit in peril,"" he said at his campaign launch in London. ""Hordes of Tory lobby fodder will allow the prime minister to backslide, safe in the knowledge she has the votes banked."" He accused the prime minister, who campaigned for a Remain vote, of ""backsliding"" on immigration, not ruling out a ""divorce bill"" from the EU and not protecting fishermen's rights, questioning whether she will ""get the deal that the British people want"". ""UKIP goes into this snap election determined to hold the government's feet to the fire on Brexit. We will act as the government's backbone in these negotiations."" He added: ""I believe we have to see this through to the end. We are only halfway through the war. It is a job half done. We must continue to fight."" Mr Nuttall says only his party can ensure the type of Brexit people voted for is delivered Earlier Mr Nuttall told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would do his ""duty to lead the party into battle"" and stand for election to the Commons although he has yet to confirm which constituency he will contest. Asked about speculation that he may stand in Boston and Skegness Mr Nuttall told the BBC: ""There's been strong rumours about everything - I've also heard Hartlepool, I've heard Southport, I think branches across the country"". Boston in Lincolnshire had the highest majority of Brexit voters in the country in last year's referendum - more than 75% of voters wanted to leave the EU. Mr Nuttall said he had asked ""a number"" of branches to consider not standing in areas currently represented by prominent Leave campaigners from all parties, if they were at risk from a challenge by a pro-Remain candidate. ""I'm not talking about five-to-midnight Brexiteers, or people who have just come to this opinion recently, I'm talking about people who have campaigned with us for many years,"" he said. But he said UKIP would ""be standing in the vast majority of the country"" adding: ""We've got 350 candidates already selected, there will be a lot more selected over the weekend."" He said his predecessor Nigel Farage would ""play a front-of-house role in this election"" and said he believed the party was ""in with a chance of winning a number of seats at this election"". ""We will be targeting sensibly in terms of financial resources and manpower."" Other policies mentioned during his launch speech were replacing the House of Lords with an elected chamber, cutting the foreign aid budget to fund the NHS, campaigning for an English parliament and tackling the ""repulsive"" practice of female genital mutilation. Full-face veils are banned in public in some European countries On the accusation from former party donor Arron Banks that UKIP's proposed burka ban was effectively a ""war on Muslim religion"", Mr Nuttall told the BBC the policy would merely bring the UK into line with countries like France and Belgium. ""We are not at war with Muslims. What we want to see is equality, we want to see integration."" On Thursday, Prime Minister Theresa May warned that ""tough"" Brexit negotiations ahead meant the Conservatives needed the strongest possible mandate to  ""strengthen my hand when I negotiate with the prime ministers, presidents and chancellors of Europe in the months ahead"". Labour set out its approach to Brexit on Tuesday, saying it would scrap Mrs May's plans and unilaterally guarantee the rights of EU residents before talks start. For the Liberal Democrats, Tom Brake said: ""Paul Nuttall is campaigning on a near-identical platform to Theresa May. It's surprising he's chosen to stand instead of going to help draft the Conservative manifesto."" He said the party was now part of a ""regressive alliance"" supporting ""a hard Brexit"".

"Independent candidates are turning to crowdfunding to fish for their Â£500 deposits It is the favourite money-raising tool for crazy dreams and passion projects, as well as more worthy causes - and now would-be MPs are getting on board. Crowdfunding - asking lots of people to each donate a small sum of money online - has been around since the 1990s, when fans of cult rock bands got together to fund new albums and tours for their idols. The sites are now used by a vast array of different fundraisers. Currently, Â£25 might buy you a lamb for an Indian village, de-worming tablets for 500 children, or a ukulele. On former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg's website, though, it'll buy 1000 A4 leaflets for his election campaign.  He is not alone. Sites like GoFundMe, Crowdfunder and Crowdpac are brimming with politicians. Crowdfunder says that in the week since the UK election was called, more than Â£200,000 was raised for political projects on its site. It is expecting a 50% increase in the number of candidates using crowdfunding compared to 2015. Conservatives in Wirral South, UKIP candidate Phil Eckersley and sitting Labour MPs like Peter Kyle, Maria Eagle and Rachel Reeves are among those turning to the technique. There is nothing new about politicians raising money online - but the snap election has left them very little time to raise money through traditional methods, forcing them to get creative. Supporters raised over Â£16,000 for Stephen Lloyd's campaign in a week Lib Dem Stephen Lloyd, who is trying to regain the Eastbourne seat he lost to Conservative Caroline Ansell in 2015, said: ""Where you have more time, I have fundraising dinners, I've gone to more quizzes and raffles and tombolas than you could shake a stick at. ""I instantly realised I didn't have time to do ten fundraisers over the next month."" The internet offered an answer. He set up a page on his website asking for donations, and shared it on Facebook. Within a week, 551 donors had raised over Â£16,000. He says the response touched him. ""The truth of it is I could almost cry. When I've gone out and asked people, they've stepped up. It makes me feel like I'm part of something."" Businesswoman Gina Miller has crowdfunded over Â£300,000 to organise tactical voting and support up to 100 candidates opposed to a ""hard Brexit"". That's alongside numerous pages for SNP and Green candidates. There's even someone calling themselves ""Mr Fish Finger"" raising money to stand against Lib Dem leader Tim Farron. Anyone who wants to take part in the election has to stump up a Â£500 deposit. Green MEP Molly Scott Cato is hoping to become an MP in Bristol West. Both she and her party have crowdfunding pages. ""Greens have been using this model for a number of years. To be honest, it wasn't that we preferred it - it was our only choice. We're not a very well-funded party and so candidates needed to get hold of enough funds to put up for the deposit."" Green candidate Molly Scott Cato says crowdfunding is a more democratic way of raising funds But isn't it a bit odd to ask the public to fork out even more for the election? After all, June's poll will cost the taxpayer tens of millions of pounds to administer. Molly Scott Cato disagrees. ""It's a democratic approach. It allows everybody to support the party with their money, and later on support it with their vote as well, hopefully. ""It's a way of people making obvious their investment in the campaign and their commitment to a Green candidate."" Up and down the country, politicians are turning to you, the public, for help with their campaigning costs. But they need to be careful. The Electoral Commission regulates election spending and political donations. It says candidates must collect enough information from donors to be able to check they are allowed to accept their cash. In a statement, the elections watchdog said: ""When crowdfunding, campaigners must only accept donations over a certain value from a permissible source. ""For candidates that means donations exceeding Â£50, for political parties and non-party campaigners it is Â£500. ""Candidates, parties and non-party campaigners can only accept donations from permissible, mainly UK sources. ""They must therefore collect information from every donor to ensure that they can properly check that each donation is from a permissible source. If a donation is not from a permissible source, it must be returned within 30 days."" So while it's an effective way of raising cash quickly,  if you're crowdfunding, make sure you're keeping tabs on who's donating. Which MPs are quitting - and who might stand?

"The 2017 general election looks set to see more co-operation between political parties than ever before. The Liberal Democrats, Greens, UKIP, DUP and UUP have all said they'll stand aside in at least one constituency. There won't be national deals though. Co-operation will be limited to local agreements. And it's difficult to be sure how big the impact will be. Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system means that lots of MPs are elected on fewer than half of the votes cast in their constituencies. At the last election, 333 out of 650 winning candidates received less than 50% of the vote. Those MPs could have been defeated if all the people who voted against them had gone for the same alternative candidate. Clearly, that would never happen everywhere. But parties who agree on some of the main issues potentially have a lot to gain if they can co-ordinate their supporters. The Greens are keen to forge alliances One option is to encourage tactical voting. A more direct approach is to enter some sort of alliance or pact which sees parties choosing not to put forward candidates in certain seats. Even without an agreement, parties can try to affect the result simply by choosing not to contest some constituencies. There's going to be more co-ordination of this kind in 2017 than we've seen at previous elections. As a strategy, though, it does rely on voters being prepared to vote for a candidate from a party which would not have been their first choice. One part of the country where electoral deals have been used before is Northern Ireland. In 2015, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) agreed a pact not to stand against each other in four constituencies: Belfast North, Belfast East, Fermanagh & South Tyrone, and Newry & Armagh. The deal was pretty successful. The unionist candidate won in three of the four seats. And the Sinn Fein majority was halved in Newry and Armagh. General election: What you need to know The seats that could decide the election This year, the UUP have said they won't put up candidates in Belfast North, Belfast West and Foyle. And the DUP won't stand in Fermanagh & South Tyrone once again. The parties have held discussions about the possibility of extending the pact but without agreement so far. There's also been talk of an ""anti-Brexit alliance"" which could include the main nationalist parties, Sinn Fein and the SDLP. But that plan now looks unlikely after the Green Party leader, Steven Agnew, said they wouldn't take part. In the rest of the UK, this kind of deal has been very rare in recent years but it looks as though there will be more co-operation between parties this time. One reason is Brexit. It's a crucial issue for all of the parties and, significantly, an issue which cut across parties but cleanly divided voters into two camps. Philip Hollobone has done a deal with UKIP UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said he would put ""country before party"" by not standing candidates in some seats where there is a strongly pro-Brexit MP or where a pro-Brexit candidate has a chance of ousting a pro-Remain MP. UKIP are standing aside in Christchurch and Bournemouth West. In Kettering, they've gone further by reaching a ""memorandum of understanding"" with Conservative MP Philip Hollobone. The deal includes plans for a regular forum where Mr Hollobone will meet UKIP members if he's re-elected. On the other side of the debate, former Prime Minister Tony Blair has also said that he was prepared to ""work with anyone"" to stop candidates who back ""Brexit at any cost"" although he didn't suggest a formal electoral pact. Brexit isn't the only issue. The Green Party is seeking support for what they call a ""progressive alliance"". Co-leaders Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley have written to Labour and the Liberal Democrats calling for a meeting ""to discuss ways to beat the Tories at the general election and deliver a fairer voting system"". That's been rebuffed at a national level but in some places local parties have decided to co-operate. Liberal Democrats in Brighton agreed to stand aside in the Greens' only seat - Brighton Pavilion. Former Lib Dem MP, Sir Vince Cable, who is seeking re-election, had tweeted his support for the idea. The Greens have also unilaterally decided not to contest Labour-held Ealing Central and Acton and Brighton Kemptown, just as they did at the Richmond Park by-election in December where the Lib Dems overturned Zac Goldsmith's 23,000 majority. Some Labour figures are calling on the party to respond in kind, stepping down Labour candidates in two seats - Brighton Pavilion and the Isle of Wight - where the Greens could win. In an open letter from members including MPs Clive Lewis, Jon Cruddas and Tulip Siddiq,published in the Guardian,external, they said it was ""important to maximise progressive votes"" in order to avoid ""the danger of a Tory landslide."" They've also suggested a deal which would see them stand aside in Plymouth Sutton and Devonport if Labour returned the favour in Totnes. All of this negotiating will only be worth it if voters are prepared to back a party that isn't their first choice. There can be no guarantee that the Green voters will agree to switch en masse to the Labour candidate if the Greens stand aside. The evidence from Northern Ireland is that pacts can work. But in that case they're based on a long-established division between unionist and nationalist voters. In the rest of the country it's harder to split the parties into two blocs so neatly. However, voters do not identify as strongly with individual parties as they did in the past so there is probably more scope than previously for switching between parties. And Brexit may well give voters a reason to vote for a candidate from a party that they wouldn't previously have considered.

"The claim:""Last year alone a city the size of Newcastle came to this country net. The gross figure is roughly the cities of Liverpool and Aberdeen put together"" Reality Check verdict:Mr Nuttall is about right on the net figure but the gross figure is lower than he says, according to the best estimates we have. Launching his party's general election campaign on Friday, UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said ""last year alone a city the size of Newcastle came to this country net"". When he talks about the net figure, he means the number of people who have come to live in the UK planning to stay for at least a year, minus those who have left for at least a year. The figures for the whole of 2016 will not be released until 25 May, but we know around 596,000 people came to the UK in the year to the end of September 2016 while about 323,000 people left the country, according to thelatest set of numbers from the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS), giving a net figure of 273,000. According to themost recent set of official figures,external, the population of Newcastle upon Tyne is 292,883, so these two figures are similar. But Mr Nuttall's second claim is more questionable. He said the number of people moving to the UK was: ""roughly the cities of Liverpool and Aberdeen put together"". Official estimates suggest that it is lower than that. Liverpool's population is 478,580 according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), while Aberdeen's is 230,350. The combined total is 708,930, so there is an clear difference between that and the gross immigration figure of 596,000. These migration numbers areestimates based on the international passenger survey. Hundreds of thousands of people a year are interviewed at airports, sea ports and the Channel Tunnel and asked if they are planning either to enter the UK to stay for at least a year or leave for at least a year, which would make them long-term migrants. About 4,000 people interviewed a year are long-term migrants. The rest are passengers travelling for shorter periods, such as tourists and business travellers. From speaking to these 4,000 people, the ONS extrapolates the total numbers of people entering or leaving the UK for at least a year. Lots of the UK's most important statistics come from surveys like this. It means the figures are estimates and there is a margin of error in them. The ONS is 95% confident that net migration is no more than 41,000 higher or lower than 273,000. Mr Nuttall's Newcastle comparison falls comfortably within this, and is therefore a reasonable comparison. However, on the gross figure, the ONS is 95% confident that it is no more than 34,000 higher or lower than 596,000. Therefore, it is unlikely the number is as high as 708,930, the population of Liverpool and Aberdeen put together. UKIP has in the past suggested that the official migration statistics are an underestimate.

"It's really rather easy to see why Boris Johnson believes a hypothetical US request for British help in bombing Syria might be hard to turn down. It's far less easy to see why a British foreign secretary might choose the early stages of a general election campaign to speculate on the matter aloud. Unless, of course, you remind yourself that the foreign secretary and Boris Johnson happen to be the same man. Asked - just theoretically, you understand - whether UK missiles might fly alongside American ones in a future strike on Syria if President Assad's blamed for another chemical attack on his own people, a more, well, normal minister; a politician more sensitive to the risks of giving interesting answers to direct questions, would have said little or nothing. Might even have dismissed the question as ""hypothetical"". That was Theresa May's choice of word. It's now the official line. David Davis, the Brexit Secretary, was the latest minister to be challenged in the aftermath of Boris Johnson's remarks. He said: ""There's no option on the table at the moment to do anything in Syria. We've got six weeks when we're not sitting in Parliament. ""But when an option comes we'll look at it properly."" The US fired 59 cruise missiles at the Shayrat airbase He added: ""The US is an ally of ours. If they come and ask for help we'll look at it as we always do with a sympathetic eye."" So, the approved line goes so far as to suggest an inclination in government to help the US out when, and if, necessary. But the operative word here is ""if"". And ministers seem not to be going out of their way to encourage closer interrogation. Conservative ministers are keen to keep as close alongside the Trump administration as possible. Leaving aside the UK government's keenness to work up a closer trading relationship. And leaving aside the reports that Britain may be falling behind the EU in the queue for a trade deal (and these things might, arguably, be usefully kept in mind), Britain has long wished to act as a close partner to America in matters of global security. Remember, Mrs May was part of the Cabinet that tried, and failed, to win Parliamentary approval for military action against the Assad regime after the chemical attack in 2013, long before a Trump administration, and for that matter, Brexit, were considered serious possibilities. But did the foreign secretary need to get this debate started now, and in the way he did? After all, the chances of nerve-agents being rained so horribly on innocent Syrian men, women and children anytime soon must surely seem limited. The White House has been clear it has no plan for further action. Encouraging speculation about British involvement in military action against Assad - let alone answering the question with a clear yes - could only open tricky questions of Parliamentary accountability and UN involvement, which is exactly what has happened. A more cautious minister, Theresa May, say, might calculate that these issues and the case for military action itself divide public opinion. And they, or she, would be right. Rightly or wrongly, Conservatives are daring to dream optimistically of an election victory on a huge scale. If they're right, the prime minister need not fear the verdict of the Commons on a hypothetical future request to support US military action. Just now, Theresa May, being a naturally cautious politician, is disinclined to pick unnecessary arguments with sections of the British voting public. Boris Johnson is different. He tends to err on the side of being interesting. What he said was certainly interesting. From a conventional point of view at election time - and, I suspect we may assume Theresa May's - he erred in saying it now.

"This video can not be played Joshua & Klitschko face off before heavyweight boxing showdown Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko Date:Saturday, 29 April Venue: Wembley StadiumTime:22:00 BST Coverage:Live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live from 21:00 BST and text updates on the BBC Sport website and app from 20:00 BST. IBF heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua believes he will take ""another step towards greatness"" when he meets Wladimir Klitschko in the richest bout in British boxing history. Joshua, 27, will defend his title and bid for the vacant WBA strap in front of a post-war record boxing crowd of 90,000 at Wembley Stadium in just his 19th professional fight. Klitschko, 41, was unbeaten in 11 years prior todefeat to Tyson Furyin his last fight in November 2015 and says he is ""obsessed"" with overcoming the Briton. ""I will always stand up to the competition,"" said Joshua. ""There is no fear at all which trembles through the body."" ""You can talk about experience but even when I faced guys with less experience I took them as world championship fights. I have prepared since day one for this. ""April 29 is just another stepping stone towards greatness."" Joshua weighed in at 17st 12lbs on Friday - the heaviest of his career and some 10lbs more than Klitschko, who came in 5lbs lighter than when he faced Tyson Fury in November 2015. Anthony Joshua: The Road to Klitschko Radio 5 live boxing podcast: 'Great British fight nights' Klitschko's memory stick mind games won't faze me - Joshua Is Joshua the perfect heavyweight? This video can not be played Joshua v Klitschko: Crowds packed in to Wembley Arena for open workout The Â£30m showdown between the former sparring partners has been dubbed a fight for ""the history books"" by Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn. It will be expected to sell roughly a million times on pay-per-view television in the UK, is being broadcast in Germany and has achieved a rare feat in the US market as rival broadcasters Showtime and HBO will both transmit the bout. ""Only twice before have they done it - Lennox Lewis versus Mike Tyson and Floyd Mayweather versus Manny Pacquiao,"" said Hearn. Klitschko has already fought in the US a dozen times but Joshua, who looks destined to follow the likes of Lewis into US-based super bouts, is yet to fight professionally outside of the UK. ""He has the ultimate test,"" added Hearn.  ""A test which should come maybe after 27 or 28 fights. Why risk it now? He wants to challenge himself. Is he the guy everyone talks about as the future of boxing?"" Joshua's calorie intake varies on training Joshua's procession to a world title - captured in just 34 career rounds when hefloored American Charles Martin in 2016- has led to him being installed as odds-on-favourite against Klitschko with bookmakers. He has contested just 44 rounds as a professional, a tally surpassed by Klitschko in his last five fights alone, with the 41-year-old Ukrainian hardened by 358 rounds as a pro, spanning 68 fights, 64 wins and more than 20 years. Indeed, London 2012 gold medallist Joshua was only six when Klitschko topped the podium at the 1996 Atlanta Games. In the pro game, he has felt the heat of a world title fight three times, this will be Klitschko's 29th. With both men similar in stature, the gap in age and experience has been central to much of the pre-fight debate. Joshua's trainer Rob McCracken said: ""As good as Klitschko has been, Father Time is a terrible person when he shows up and I think he already has. ""It is going to be tough for Wladimir, he doesn't know himself if it's still there or not. He's against a ferocious opponent on Saturday night, that's for sure."" Klitschko can be destructive too. His tally of 53 knockouts surpasses the great Joe Louis by one and the wrecking ball that was Mike Tyson by nine. In 2013, he dropped the respected Alexander Povetkin four times. The Russian had never lost and has not done so since. Klitschko is adamant his career will not fade after defeat to Fury and he has come back from torment before after losing world title fights to the likes of Corrie Sanders in 2003 and Lamon Brewster a year later. ""Nobody is perfect,"" Klitschko's brother Vitali told BBC Radio 5 live. ""Everyone has strong sides and weak sides. Wladimir's weak side is his concentration. ""That cost him the title against Fury. I've never seen him focused like this. If he is concentrating 100%, Joshua does not have a chance. Wladimir understands this is the fight of his life."" This video can not be played Klitschko records Joshua fight prediction on USB Radio 5 live boxing boxing pundit Steve Bunce Can Joshua go seven, eight, nine rounds, hard rounds? Will he still look as invincible in round seven or eight as he has in 18 fights? Can Wladimir look like any of the old Wladimirs? Even a bad old Wladimir should be enough to beat this kid Anthony Joshua. The worst Wladimir you've seen win a 12-round stinking fight should be enough. I think an awful lot has been placed on the assumption, the dream, hope, that Wladimir, at 41 has nothing left. If that's not the case then we are in for a tricky night. Joshua has documented his gruelling training regime on social media While Joshua's social media offerings have showcased chats with celebrities such as Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and American rap artist Dr. Dre in recent weeks, footage of his gruelling training regime has also been free flowing. Reaction drills such as dodging agility sticks to chase tennis balls, intense sessions on a watt bike and workouts in a leg-sapping sand pit have all been captured on camera. The hard work calls fora diet,externalof between 4,000 and 5,000 calories a day - a stark difference to NHS guidelines of 2,500 for men. Smoothies form a key part of his diet in order to increase his calorie intake and replace fluids lost when sweating, as it is not uncommon for Joshua to lose 3kg through sweat alone during a session. So if you want to start your Saturday in the same way the champion begins a training day, opt for a healthy smoothie, workout and then follow up with as many as five eggs on wholemeal bread.

"Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho will have learned a lot about their clubs this season - and both face busy summers Pep Guardiola and Jose Mourinho were brought to Etihad Stadium and Old Trafford this season to claim major titles - and the attritional goalless draw in Thursday's Manchester derby leaves their hopes of Champions League qualification via league placing still in the balance. United have at least claimed the Capital One Cup and could reach the Champions League by winning the Europa League, with a semi-final against Celta Vigo to come. But Man City manager Guardiola has suffered the first trophy-less season of his managerial career after the FA Cup semi-final defeat by Arsenal. Both managers will be expected to fight for the Premier League title next season - so what areas must they address? Match report - Man City 0-0 Man City Aguero was ""smart"" over red card - Mourinho Bravo's season could be over - Guardiola In Short - why Mourinho should sign John Terry Goalkeeper conundrum Guardiola's big decision on arrival was to send England goalkeeper Joe Hart packing to Torino on loan and signClaudio Bravo from Barcelona in a Â£17.5m deal- a move that cannot be described as a success. In Guardiola's defence, 34-year-old Bravo had a fine reputation at Barcelona and had been impressive in helping Chile to win the Copa America as captain on home soil in 2015. Guardiola says Claudio Bravo may not play again this season after the keeper was carried off on a stretcher during Thursday's match against United Bravo, however, has looked uncertain, had spells out of the side and has not looked like the answer to City's goalkeeping dilemma. It was almost ironic that he sustained a calf injury against United as he confidently claimed a cross in a manner rarely seen this season. He has not even been convincing with the ball at his feet, something that was almost regarded as his unique selling point when replacing Hart. Willy Caballero is 35, and with no likelihood of Hart reviving his Manchester City career, Guardiola must decide whether to maintain faith in Bravo, very much his man and signing, or accept this move has failed and move on. Guardiola would be gambling if he sticks with Bravo, a goalkeeper who earned an unwanted reputation for not making saves. He may need to cast his net elsewhere as few teams win titles with an average goalkeeper. Age is Man City's defensive barrier Manchester City were reportedly linked with Tottenham'sEngland right-back Kyle Walker,externalbefore Thursday's derby and have also been mentioned in connection with his team-mate, left-backDanny Rose.,external The chances of signing both are highly unlikely but these positions look certain to be two areas of interest for Guardiola in the summer. City have talented defenders in those positions who have all been fine servants - but who are all much nearer the end of their careers than the beginning. Man City's more ""mature"" full-backs: Pablo Zabaleta (32), Bacary Sagna (34), Aleksandar Kolarov (31), and Gael Clichy (31) Pablo Zabaleta has been a magnificent player for City but is now 32. Bacary Sagna is 34 while Gael Clichy and Aleksandar Kolarov are both 31. This is an area in urgent need of young blood and renewal. John Stones has had a tough introduction since hisÂ£47.5m move from Evertonbut has the quality to be a top-class City central defender for years to come. And the current return to form and fitness of inspirational captain Vincent Kompany - outstanding against Manchester United - is a welcome bonus. The 31-year-old can save City money in the markets should he stay fit, but the form ofNicolas Otamendimeans Guardiola is likely to be looking for central defensive reinforcements. Former England forward Chris Waddle watched the Manchester derby as a BBC Sport pundit and said: ""It is easy to see what the biggest thing is that needs to change for City to get closer to winning the title. Their defence. ""That starts with the goalkeeper. Whether Pep Guardiola likes Bravo or not, I don't think he is the top-class keeper you need to win the league and neither is Caballero. ""I know he wants someone there who can use the ball with his feet and play the way he wants, but he also has to be able to stop the ball from going in the net because they concede too many goals. ""He also needs three defenders - a centre-back and two full-backs."" Guardiola's team must get ruthless Manchester City - for a team of such enviable attacking riches - often suffer from a frustrating failure to make superiority count. It was seen, albeit with large slices of bad luck, in theFA Cup semi-final loss to Arsenalat Wembley and also against Manchester United, when they could not break through despite camping out in their half for almost the entire second period. In the league, City dominated at home toSpurs but drew 2-2in January, and earlier in April they failed to build on dominance and an early Leroy Sane goal in a2-2 draw at the Gunners. After Sergio Aguero's 30 goals, City's next top scorers are Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling (nine each). By comparison, four Chelsea players have hit 10 or more Guardiola must believe that with the likes of Sergio Aguero, with 30 goals in all competitions, and the creativity of Kevin de Bruyne, Sane, Raheem Sterling and the emerging brilliance of Gabriel Jesus to call on, this problem will eventually solve itself. David Silva is still an outstanding player and City will hope Ilkay Gundogan can build on his fine start once he recovers from a serious knee injury. The talent is there but Guardiola will know City simply cannot be as generous next season as they have been in this campaign. Keep De Gea or replace with world class? It's that time again - when United goalkeeper David de Gea is linked with a return to his native Spain with Real Madrid. De Gea's proposed Â£29m move to Real broke down in August 2015 but now the rumour mill is awash with talk it could be revived, although United would not even pick up the phone at the price agreed first time around. At 26, De Gea is not even at his peak with years of quality and improvement to come. He is already in the elite group of the world's best keepers. United will demand twice as much as that initial fee if any potential move is to get off the ground. David de Gea's Â£29m move to Real Madrid collapsed last summer because the necessary paperwork was not submitted in time United's preference would be to keep De Gea, who has maintained a superb level of consistency after he became accustomed to the demands of United and the Premier League following his Â£18.9m move fromAtletico Madrid in June 2011. If he does leave, though, his importance means United can only move at the top end of the market for a replacement. Sergio Romero is a fine deputy but the Argentine is just that - a deputy. United could return to Atletico for 24-year-old Slovenian Jan Oblak, but being as though they are already linked with strikerAntoine Griezmann,Atletico manager Diego Simeone is unlikely to want two prize assets presented to Old Trafford. Another Slovenian, Inter Milan's 32-year-old Samir Handanovic, has a good reputation while AC Milan's brilliant 18-year-old Gianluigi Donnarumma is regarded as the world's best young keeper and is reportedly involved incontract negotiations with his club.,external United's preference will surely be to keep De Gea - but if he goes there must be a high-end replacement. Ditch the draws to find success One statistic stands out when it comes to analysing Manchester United's failure to mount a title challenge - 13 draws from 33 league games. United's run of 24 unbeaten league games stretching back to October should have them in the title mix with Chelsea and Spurs, but a lack of wins has sabotaged those ambitions. And nine of those have come at Old Trafford, with the likes of Stoke City, Burnley, West Ham United, Hull City, Bournemouth and West Bromwich Albion all leaving ""The Theatre Of Dreams"" unbeaten. The margins are fine and many of those games could and should have been wins, but Mourinho must find a way to cure a serious problem. Sprinkle stardust on Old Trafford Zlatan Ibrahimovic, at 35, has proved a magnificent, charismatic addition on a free transfer with 28 goals following his move from Paris St-Germain. Sadly, there must be doubts over his future after sustaining a serious knee injury in the Europa League quarter-final win against Anderlecht. Wayne Rooney, an unused substitute at Manchester City, is also surely coming to the end of his 251-goal Manchester United career at the end of the season. He is 31 and his time at United, stretching back to 2004, looks done. Mourinho has attacking resources in the exciting Marcus Rashford and Antony Martial, as well as goal threat from the likes of Henrikh Mkhitaryan. But he needs another a game-changing superstar to add gold dust and goals to raise United's level - and maybe stop those damaging draws. Manchester United have been linked with Atletico Madrid star Antoine Griezmann, who has scored 27 goals this season One man stands out as a potential target - 26-year-old Griezmann. The France striker would cost a fee in the region of the Â£89m it required to bring Paul Pogba from Juventus, and there must be questions about whether the he would even entertain a move to United if they were not in the Champions League next season. 'Let Manchester United off the leash' Is the fact United have drawn so many games a sign that Jose Mourinho applies the handbrake to his players? Waddle thinks so and told BBC Sport after the derby: ""There is a reason they have drawn too many games. Next season, Mourinho has got to know when to be a little bit more attack-minded against certain teams. ""It is against the lesser sides that United have struggled, and that is where Mourinho needs to change. He has got to have more players in his team who can open doors and score goals. ""He might argue that his side dominate possession every time they play at Old Trafford without getting the rewards. ""Mourinho is great at organising his teams against the top sides but he has to let them off the leash more if he wants to get results. Creativity is the hardest thing to bring to a team. ""The way he sets up, his wide men are not luxury players - he wants them up and down that flank and it is hard work for a winger to do that all game, making 70, 80 yard runs all the time."" City and United are locked in a battle for places in the league's top four - but managers of the pedigree of Guardiola and Mourinho must deliver more.

"You can read an updated version of this pagehere. Donald Trump is a man who prefers plain speaking to the language of diplomacy. Find out what he has said about your country, which foreign leaders he has met or called since taking office, and which countries he has mentioned in his tweets. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001.On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country.Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated.Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat,targeting a tunnel complexnear Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in thehuge blastand President Trumppraisedhis armed forces for ""another successful job"".Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzaisaidthe country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"".Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied.Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House.Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia.A Washington Postreportsaid Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer,footageleaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before â maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump'sfirst visitto Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit.Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"".He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious""Belgium is a beautiful city"". Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far.The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela.Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.As the African Union expressed ""shock, dismay and outrage"" and demanded an apology, Botswanasummoned the US ambassadorand asked the envoy ""to clarify if Botswana is regarded as a 'shithole' country given that there are Botswana nationals residing in the US.""According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump'sfierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada.Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec.When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade beforetweetingthat the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president.With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. Mr Trump spoke to President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative like himself, in January to congratulate him on his election win. President Trump emphasised his desire to work with President Pinera on ""issues of mutual interest,"" according to a read-out of the call.The two billionaire presidents - Mr Pinera's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (Â£2bn) - also discussed their ""desire to see democracy restored for the Venezuelan people."" Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned intoa meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US.Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"".He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power andbannedthe Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off.President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"".The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June.But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods.""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" hetweetedin March.China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake.The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017.Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. Mr Trump said he was ""cancelling"" President Barack Obama's deal to thaw relations with Cuba, saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor.But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation.Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still return home with Cuban goods.During a speech in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible"" and ""misguided"".He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House.Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence.The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him.Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013.Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group.Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on aglowing orbat the meeting also set social media abuzz.The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administrationannouncedin January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US.They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001.Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president .Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in atweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckledhandshakewith Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"".But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"".President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel.But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence.During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world.Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017.President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, hetook to Twitterto describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year.The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"".The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit withone eye-catching moment of awkwardness- butsome reportssuggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.On immigration, Mr Trumptweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, hetweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"".While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix,according to BBC Reality Check. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"".He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation.""The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Hetweetedthat he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'""Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In 2017, the Department of Homeland Securityannouncedthat Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019.Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidortold the BBCthe idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In June of this year, the Trump administration announced that it was ending the temporary protection status that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US, meaning they could be forced to leave the the country by 5 January 2020.Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster.The move came a couple of months after Mr Trump has complained that a ""caravan"" of migrants from Honduras were making their way towards the US,tweeting: ""Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the US is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL."" President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November.At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"".She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authoritiesreportedto have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017.The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting.Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US.Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country.One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities.The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trump labelled it a ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless.During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr Trump said Iran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias.""He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.Then in May this year, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran, saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal.""Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015.Continuing his hardline stance, in June the US threatened to enforce sanctions on countries that have not stopped importing Iranian oil by November 2018. Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives.However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq.The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trumpover the phoneon 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters.Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trumptold reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year,sayingthere were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear.Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends â fast friends â over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders alsodiscussedtheir continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.In August, Mr Trumptweetedthat ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers.The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough.But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June.After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Amid the NFL national anthem controversy, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow.He tweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!""Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan.Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions.The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he tooka tumble into a bunkeron the course.Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea.Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis.Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now.In June, hetweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation.King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well.Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help.""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. US relations with Kenya are likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan.Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country.The two leadersdiscussedsecurity in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia.The US in Maysuspended$21m of funding to Kenya's ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. Kenya has said it would strengthen its accounting. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according toPolitico. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS.But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!""It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency.Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017.Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall.""More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall.""Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president.The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall.Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump.How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda ArderndeniedMr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" shetoldthe website newsroom.co.nz. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administrationannouncedin November 2017 that it would remove the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation for Nicaragua, introduced in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America.Thousands of Nicaraguans living in the US will now have until 5 January 2019 to seek ""an alternative lawful immigration status"" or leave. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year.During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade.Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader.It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US.The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk.President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed.In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting.""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trumptweetedin March.Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"".The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US presidenttweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" When Prime Minister SolbergmetMr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jetonly available in Call of Duty, a computer game.A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Tensions between the US and its historical ally have been strained for years, but they reached a new low in January 2018, when Mr Trump threatened to withdraw US assistance. Previously he had put Pakistan on notice as he unveiled his new Afghan strategy in August 2017.""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace.""But he had warmer words when Islamabad helped secure the release of an American-Canadian couple held hostage in the country for five years. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017.He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During avisitto Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace.In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"".The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914.""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"".During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House.As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (Â£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.""Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila.His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far.After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people.During avisitthere in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance.""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition.Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initialcreditfor applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"".In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism,tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar â look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia.At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election.""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia.A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton.Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia.In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thingâ¦""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump.Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (Â£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when hetook partin a ceremonial sword dance during the trip.Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June.Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder.Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America.Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion.Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US.The proposed ban has beenpartly reinstatedby the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days.He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year.The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa,tweetingthat the country was a ""mess"".He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries.The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table.After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well.Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US.In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel.South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (Â£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year.Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year.At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence.Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"".Pedro SÃ¡nchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump has included on his travel ban list.The Supreme Court partly reinstated the ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US.It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry.More recently, Mr Trump postponed a deadline on whether to permanently lift US sanctions against Sudan so he could have more time to ""establish that the government of Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action"" on counter-terrorism efforts, providing humanitarian relief and securing a ceasefire in conflict areas.The US has issued sanctions against Sudan since the 1990s, when it was accused of state-sponsored terrorism.Mr Trump has yet to appoint a special envoy for Sudan. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February.""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes.It later emerged that Mr Trumphad been referringto a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013.But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context anddatadidn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape.Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he didphonethe Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. Syria is another country that Donald Trump has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the US president.When his predecessor was considering military action in Syria back in 2013, Mr Trump was a vocal critic against intervention.""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing,"" Mr Trumptweetedin September 2013.But just over two months into his presidency, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action.""Using a deadly nerve agent, [Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trumpsaid. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror.""Two US Navy shipsfired 59 Tomahawk cruise missilesat a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean. It was the first direct US military action against the Syrian president's forces.Mr Trump deployed his military again in April this year, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack on the town of Douma.After the strikes, Mr Trump tweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trumpon the phonein February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"".One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"",according to the New York Times.The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list.The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality.President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi is important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" ina phone callwith its leader in February. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on.Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012.Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point).But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, whenclashesbroke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel.US Congress has called for criminalchargesagainst those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC.Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State.Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdoganreaffirmed their rejectionof the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017.The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments.Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say.But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift thesanctionswould be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko andencouragedthe European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trumpon the phonejust a few days after the former businessman became the new US president.The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East.The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move.Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al NahyandescribedMr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with.In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July.His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication ofan interviewthe US president gave to The Sun newspaper.In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead.""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"".Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit.He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (Â£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled.Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" Mr Trumpspoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyevin December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate theNew York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. Human rights have not been at the top of President Trump's agenda so far, but he has called for the release of a political prisoner in Venezuela.""Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori out of prison immediately,"" hetweetedin mid-February.Venezuela is in the middle of an economic and political crisis, with the country deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President Nicolas Maduro and those who blame him.Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone with leaders of neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro.In anOctober tweet, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela."" The tweet reflectedstatements made by Mr Trumpat a dinner with Latin American leaders in which he thanked them for supporting the Venezuelan people and condemning the Maduro ""dictatorship"".Mr Maduro, however, has sent aword of warningto President Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America.""In April 2017 it emerged that Citgo Petroleum, the state oil company,gave half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committeeand a General Motors plant in the country was seized by the state.Mr Trump celebrated the release of an American man in Venezuela in May this year, tweeting: ""Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela."" The man, a Mormon missionary from Utah, had been held without trial on weapons charges since 2016. Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.Mr Trumptweeted his thanksfor ""a wonderful visit"".Mr Trump waskeen to highlighta $12bn (Â£9bn)purchase of Boeing aircraftin a joint statement after the visit. President Trump's main focus in Yemen has been his ban on its citizens from travelling to America.In December 2017, the US Supreme Court ruledPresident Donald Trump's travel banon six mainly Muslim countries could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.Mr Trump has alsocalled on Saudi Arabiato ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,"" in response to the humanitarian crisis linked to the ongoing Saudi campaign and blockade against Houthi rebels.Yemen was the site of thefirst military operationauthorised by Mr Trump, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader.The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed.It later emergedthat a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump.In aninterview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders.""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan.""ANew York Times articleclaimed the Navy Seals found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting AQAP communications but they ""pressed on toward their target"" nonetheless.Mr Trump responded to criticism bytweetingthat it had been ""a winning mission... not a failure"". A White House statement said it was a ""successful raid"" that yielded ""important intelligence"".Carryn Owens, the widow of the Navy Seal, was invited to Mr Trump's joint address to Congress. She gota standing ovationand as the room applauded, the president said her husband's legacy was ""etched into eternity"". Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan.Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions.The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he tooka tumble into a bunkeron the course.Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea.Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis.Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now.In June, hetweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July.His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication ofan interviewthe US president gave to The Sun newspaper.In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead.""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"".Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit.He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (Â£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled.Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president .Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in atweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckledhandshakewith Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"".But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"".President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel.But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders alsodiscussedtheir continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.In August, Mr Trumptweetedthat ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world.Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017.President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, hetook to Twitterto describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year.The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"".The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit withone eye-catching moment of awkwardness- butsome reportssuggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.On immigration, Mr Trumptweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, hetweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"".While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix,according to BBC Reality Check. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned intoa meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US.Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"".He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power andbannedthe Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off.President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"".The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June.But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods.""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" hetweetedin March.China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump'sfierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada.Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec.When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade beforetweetingthat the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president.With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation.King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well.Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help.""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June.Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder.Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America.Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion.Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers.The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough.But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June.After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him.Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013.Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group.Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on aglowing orbat the meeting also set social media abuzz.The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House.Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia.A Washington Postreportsaid Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer,footageleaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before â maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table.After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well.Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US.In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel.South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (Â£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year.Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017.He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During avisitto Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace.In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"".The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia.At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election.""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia.A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton.Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia.In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thingâ¦""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump.Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (Â£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when hetook partin a ceremonial sword dance during the trip.Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017.The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments.Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say.But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift thesanctionswould be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko andencouragedthe European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on.Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012.Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point).But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, whenclashesbroke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel.US Congress has called for criminalchargesagainst those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC.Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State.Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdoganreaffirmed their rejectionof the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year.At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence.Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"".Pedro SÃ¡nchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November.At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"".She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authoritiesreportedto have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year.During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade.Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.Mr Trumptweeted his thanksfor ""a wonderful visit"".Mr Trump waskeen to highlighta $12bn (Â£9bn)purchase of Boeing aircraftin a joint statement after the visit. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914.""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"".During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition.Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initialcreditfor applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"".In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism,tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar â look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake.The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017.Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year,sayingthere were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear.Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends â fast friends â over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!""It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency.Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017.Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall.""More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall.""Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president.The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall.Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump.How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far.The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela.Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February.""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes.It later emerged that Mr Trumphad been referringto a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013.But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context anddatadidn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape.Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he didphonethe Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence.During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001.On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country.Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated.Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat,targeting a tunnel complexnear Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in thehuge blastand President Trumppraisedhis armed forces for ""another successful job"".Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzaisaidthe country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"".Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"".He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation.""The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according toPolitico. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS.But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied.Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda ArderndeniedMr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" shetoldthe website newsroom.co.nz. Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump'sfirst visitto Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit.Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"".He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious""Belgium is a beautiful city"". Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House.Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence.The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader.It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US.The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk.President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed.In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting.""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trumptweetedin March.Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"".The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US presidenttweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" When Prime Minister SolbergmetMr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jetonly available in Call of Duty, a computer game.A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa,tweetingthat the country was a ""mess"".He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries.The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. Mr Trumpspoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyevin December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate theNew York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017.The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting.Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US.Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House.As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (Â£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.""Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila.His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far.After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people.During avisitthere in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance.""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives.However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq.The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trumpover the phoneon 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters.Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trumptold reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trumpon the phonejust a few days after the former businessman became the new US president.The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East.The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move.Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al NahyandescribedMr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with.In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US.The proposed ban has beenpartly reinstatedby the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days.He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year.The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president .Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in atweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckledhandshakewith Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"".But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"".President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel.But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan.Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions.The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he tooka tumble into a bunkeron the course.Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea.Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis.Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now.In June, hetweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July.His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication ofan interviewthe US president gave to The Sun newspaper.In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead.""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"".Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit.He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (Â£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled.Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table.After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well.Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US.In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel.South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (Â£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year.Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump.Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (Â£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when hetook partin a ceremonial sword dance during the trip.Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump'sfierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada.Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec.When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade beforetweetingthat the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president.With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world.Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017.President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, hetook to Twitterto describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year.The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"".The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit withone eye-catching moment of awkwardness- butsome reportssuggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.On immigration, Mr Trumptweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, hetweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"".While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix,according to BBC Reality Check. Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned intoa meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US.Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"".He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power andbannedthe Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off.President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"".The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June.But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods.""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" hetweetedin March.China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him.Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013.Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group.Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on aglowing orbat the meeting also set social media abuzz.The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition.Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initialcreditfor applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"".In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism,tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar â look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia.At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election.""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia.A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton.Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia.In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thingâ¦""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on.Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012.Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point).But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, whenclashesbroke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel.US Congress has called for criminalchargesagainst those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC.Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State.Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdoganreaffirmed their rejectionof the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!""It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency.Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017.Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall.""More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall.""Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president.The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall.Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump.How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied.Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. The Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan spoke with Donald Trumpon the phonejust a few days after the former businessman became the new US president.The two leaders spoke about the fight against international terrorism and according to the White House, the crown prince backed Mr Trump's idea of safe zones for refugees in the Middle East.The UAE was not one of the countries that Mr Trump tried to ban people travelling to the US from, and the state's foreign minister was one of the few Middle East officials to defend the move.Sheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al NahyandescribedMr Trump's proposed ban as a ""sovereign decision"" and said some of the countries on the list ""face structural problems"" that need to be dealt with.In May last year, Mr Trump met the Crown Prince at the White House, where the two leaders discussed ""bilateral defense cooperation, counterterrorism, resolving the conflicts in Yemen and Syria, and the threat to regional stability posed by Iran."" Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has already had a substantial amount of contact with President Trump. The two men have spoken several times over the phone and Mr Kuczynski has also visited the White House.As well as discussing regional security and trade between the two countries, the Peruvian president is particularly interested in persuading the US to deport its fugitive ex-leader Alejandro Toledo.Mr Toledo, who is believed to be in San Francisco, is accused of taking $20m (Â£16m) in bribes. He denies that and says he is the victim of a witch-hunt. Mr Kuczynski is understood to have asked Mr Trump to ""evaluate"" the situation.In March, Mr Kuczynski spoke to Mr Trump about tackling the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders alsodiscussedtheir continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.In August, Mr Trumptweetedthat ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November.At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"".She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authoritiesreportedto have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives.However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq.The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trumpover the phoneon 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters.Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trumptold reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation.King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well.Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help.""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake.The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017.Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June.Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder.Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America.Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion.Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001.On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country.Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated.Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat,targeting a tunnel complexnear Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in thehuge blastand President Trumppraisedhis armed forces for ""another successful job"".Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzaisaidthe country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"".Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according toPolitico. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House.Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia.A Washington Postreportsaid Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer,footageleaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before â maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017.He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During avisitto Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace.In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"".The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. Did Mr Trump mistake New Zealand's prime minister for the wife of Canadian leader Justin Trudeau at November's APEC meeting in Vietnam?PM Jacinda ArderndeniedMr Trump had made that error, telling TVNZ that ""Someone observed that they thought that it happened, but in all my interactions, certainly President Trump didn't seem to have confused me when I interacted with him. But someone else observed this.""Mr Trump certainly seems to have recognised her when he patted her on the shoulder at a gala dinner during the summit and declared ""This lady caused a lot of upset in her country"".""I said, 'You know', laughing, 'no-one marched when I was elected',"" shetoldthe website newsroom.co.nz. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers.The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough.But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June.After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year.At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence.Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"".Pedro SÃ¡nchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Mr Trump spoke to President Sebastian Pinera, a conservative like himself, in January to congratulate him on his election win. President Trump emphasised his desire to work with President Pinera on ""issues of mutual interest,"" according to a read-out of the call.The two billionaire presidents - Mr Pinera's estimated personal fortune is about $2.7bn (Â£2bn) - also discussed their ""desire to see democracy restored for the Venezuelan people."" Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.Mr Trumptweeted his thanksfor ""a wonderful visit"".Mr Trump waskeen to highlighta $12bn (Â£9bn)purchase of Boeing aircraftin a joint statement after the visit. Mr Trump has held one meeting with Indonesian President Joko Widodo so far, on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017.The two leaders also attended the Riyadh Summit in Saudi Arabia in May 2017, but they did not have a one-on-one meeting.Mr Widodo didn't get an invitation to Mr Trump's inauguration, but Indonesian businessman Hary Tanoesoedibjo reportedly did and the president's relationship with him has raised eyebrows in the US.Mr Tanoesoedibjo is overseeing the development of a Trump Hotel in West Java and another resort in Bali and recently told an Indonesian magazine that he has ""close access"" to the US president. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year.During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade.Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914.""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"".During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.""Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila.His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far.After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year,sayingthere were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear.Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends â fast friends â over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. Donald Trump the businessman didn't have much positive to say about South Africa,tweetingthat the country was a ""mess"".He took a slightly different approach as president though, telling President Jacob Zuma that he hopes to ""expand cooperation and trade"" between the two countries.The two leaders spoken once on the phone, mainly to discuss new opportunities to boost trade. According to the President Zuma's government, there are 600 US companies operating in South Africa.Mr Zuma also met President Trump once, before he was forced to resign in February. Mr Trump held a working lunch for African leaders, including Mr Zuma, in New York in September. During the meeting, Mr Trump reportedly said: ""Africa has tremendous business potential. I have so many friends going to your countries, trying to get rich.""South Africa's new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, is yet to meet Mr Trump. US relations with Kenya are likely to be very different under Donald Trump to how they were under Barack Obama, whose father was Kenyan.Mr Trump's decision to speak to the leaders of three African nations - Egypt, Nigeria and South Africa - before speaking to Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta was taken as a snub by some in the country.The two leadersdiscussedsecurity in the region and President Trump praised Kenya's ""significant contributions"" to the African Union force fighting against the al-Shabaab group in neighbouring Somalia.The US in Maysuspended$21m of funding to Kenya's ministry of health over corruption allegations and weak account procedures, according to the state department. Kenya has said it would strengthen its accounting. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February.""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes.It later emerged that Mr Trumphad been referringto a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013.But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context anddatadidn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape.Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he didphonethe Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Perhaps the unlikeliest country to have made our list, Trinidad and Tobago Prime Minister Keith Rowley spoke to Donald Trumpon the phonein February 2017 to discuss ""shared priorities"".One of those priorities is terrorism, with some US officials worried that the small Caribbean island could become a ""breeding ground for extremists"",according to the New York Times.The island's former US ambassador John Estrada told the newspaper that more than 100 people have travelled from there to fight with the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. When Donald Trump announced a ban on people entering the US from several predominantly Muslim countries, some analysts were surprised not to see Tunisia on the list.The Arab Spring began there in 2010, but it has become a breeding ground for the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in recent years - more Tunisians have joined them to fight in Iraq and Syria than any other nationality.President Trump appears to have decided that a close relationship with Tunisian President Beji Caid Essebsi is important in the fight against IS and he praised the country's ""stability and security"" ina phone callwith its leader in February. Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017.The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments.Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say.But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift thesanctionswould be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko andencouragedthe European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Despite being South America's most influential country, Mr Trump has had little to say about Brazil so far.The president has met Michel Temer, his Brazilian counterpart, just once  - at a working dinner he hosted in New York with representatives from Colombia, Panama and Argentina to discuss the situation in Venezuela.Vice-President Mike Pence did speak to Mr Temer on the phone in June this year but the topic of conversation was not Venezuela but rather ""Brazil-US cooperation on the peaceful uses of outer space"". Mr Trumpspoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyevin December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate theNew York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. No US relationship with a country has been more scrutinised than Donald Trump's ties to Russia.At a summit with Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, Mr Trump defended Russia over claims of interference in the 2016 US election.Speaking with the Mr Putin at his side, Mr Trump was asked if he believed his own intelligence agencies or the Russian president when it came to allegations of meddling in the election.""President Putin says it's not Russia. I don't see any reason why it would be,"" he replied.But a day later, Mr Trump said he had misspoke.""The sentence should have been: 'I don't see any reason why I wouldn't' or 'why it wouldn't be Russia'. Sort of a double negative,"" he explained to reporters when he arrived back in the US.The US intelligence agencies have accused Russia of being behind the hacking of the Democratic Party's email server. A dossier has also emerged containing unsubstantiated claims about Mr Trump's ties to Russia.A special counsel was set up in May 2017 to investigate whether there was any collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's campaign and whether the president unlawfully tried to obstruct the inquiry after the election.President Trump has dismissed the entire Russia scandal as ""fake news"" and accused Democrats of launching a political witch-hunt against him because they are angry he defeated Hillary Clinton.Mr Trump has tweeted more and more about Russia and the investigation in recent months - a sign that the allegations have got under his skin.Since becoming president in January 2017, he has sought to improve relations with Russia.In March, he tweeted: ""I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thingâ¦""In June, he alarmed allies by saying Russia should be readmitted to the G7 group of industrialised nations. Russia was suspended from what was then the G8 after it annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. President Trump made history in June when he became the first sitting US president to meet with a North Korean leader.It was an event few could have imagined just a few months after Mr Trump had threatened to unleash ""fire and fury"" against North Korea if it endangered the US.The heated rhetoric from Mr Trump was in response to North Korea's repeated testing of long-range missiles in its pursuit to establish itself as a nuclear power. North Korea responded by vowing to launch a ""nuclear pre-emptive strike"" if it felt at risk.President Trump and Kim Jong-un then traded insults for a few months as military conflict began to look inevitable. But then all of a sudden, the tone changed.In January, Mr Trump signalled that he would be willing to sit down and talk with Mr Kim and a couple of months later the two sides said they had agreed to a meeting.""Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea. For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned. The World is watching and waiting! May be false hope, but the U.S. is ready to go hard in either direction!"" Mr Trumptweetedin March.Although the mooted summit was briefly cancelled by Mr Trump, it did eventually happen in Singapore in June, with the US president describing it as a ""tremendous success"".The pair signed an agreement that while historic, was a little short on details. It commits North Korea to work towards ""the complete denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula"" and promises ""new relations"" between Washington and Pyongyang.In a sign of possible trouble ahead though, North Korea accused the US of using ""gangster-like"" tactics to push it towards nuclear disarmament after a fresh round of high-level talks in July.But this was followed by a letter sent to Mr Trump by Mr Kim, which the US presidenttweeted. Part of it read: ""I firmly believe that the strong will, sincere efforts and unique approach of myself and Your Excellency Mr President aimed at opening up a new future between the DPRK and the US will surely come to fruition."" Donald Trump mentioned China so frequently on the campaign trail it turned intoa meme. He repeatedly called the Communist state a ""currency manipulator"" and even accused them of ""raping"" the US.Since the election, however, most of the interactions between the two leaders have focused on the threat posed by North Korea's nuclear ambitions.Mr Trump welcomed Chinese President Xi Jinping to his Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida with open arms and described the pair's relationship as ""outstanding"".He decided against a round of golf with China's leader though - Mr Xi has shut down several golf courses since coming into power andbannedthe Communist Party's 88 million members from teeing off.President Xi also welcomed Mr Trump to China in November last year for discussions on North Korea and international trade. The trip appeared to go well, with Mr Trump describing the Chinese leader as a ""very special man"".The US president called on China to be tougher on North Korea until they agreed to come to the negotiating table - a stance that paid off when Mr Trump met Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June.But away from North Korea, US-China relations have been more complicated with Mr Trump going on the offensive over trade and imposing tariffs on over $30bn of Chinese goods.""When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win,"" hetweetedin March.China responded by putting its own tariffs on US goods in place and at the moment, it's difficult to predict how the trade war will develop. No Donald Trump rally during the presidential campaign was complete without the crowd chanting ""Build the wall, build the wall!""It was the policy that defined Mr Trump's insurgent run for office, so it was little surprise that who would pay for the wall caused a diplomatic dispute just days into his presidency.Mr Trump, who has said repeatedly that Mexico will pay it, officially announced his intention to build the wall in an executive order signed on 25 January 2017.Two days later, Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto used a televised address to tell Mr Trump: ""I've said time and again: Mexico won't pay for any wall.""More than a year later, Mr Trump is still tweeting about it: ""Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall.""Construction on the wall is yet to start because Mr Trump needs Congress to pass the funding for it, but there is evidence that law enforcement agencies on the border have been given more power.Mr Pena Nieto, who has now been replaced, met Mr Trump once on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany last July. He was due to visit the White House but twice cancelled planned trips because of disagreements with the US president.The most recent one came in February when Mr Trump is said to have lost his temper during a phone call with Mr Pena Nieto when he refused to change his position on the wall.Mr Trump appears to have changed tack with Mexico's new leader, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador. They spoke for the first time at the beginning of July and, according to Mr LÃ³pez Obrador, the wall was not brought up by Mr Trump.How long the cordial tone lasts is unclear, but Mr Trump is sending a delegation to meet the new leader, including his son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has developed a strong relationship with President Trump, with the pair having met several times both in the US and in Japan.Mr Abe has visited Mr Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida twice so far, playing golf with the president on both occasions.The pair also found time for a round of golf when President Trump visited Japan in November last year - although Mr Abe may want to forget about that after he tooka tumble into a bunkeron the course.Mr Trump has described US-Japan relations as a ""very crucial alliance"" and it has proved to be just that as the president has embarked on negotiations with neighbouring North Korea.Mr Abe will be hoping that his relationship with the president will keep Japan at the front of his mind as he pursues a diplomatic solution to the North Korean crisis.Away from North Korea, Mr Trump has also been talking to Mr Abe about trade between the two countries but the tone appears more amicable than it is with others - for now.In June, hetweeted: ""PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the US and Japan, something we have to do. The US seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity."" While Donald Trump hasn't spoken to Iran's leader since coming to power, he has spent a lot of his time talking about the country.One of his administration's first moves was to impose new sanctions against the country in response to a ballistic missile test, which Tehran said had not violated a UN resolution on its nuclear activities.The US confirmed that Tehran was continuing to comply with the UN agreement but Mr Trump labelled it a ""terrible deal"" and ordered a review into it nonetheless.During a trip to Israel in 2017, Mr Trump said Iran ""must never be allowed to possess a nuclear weapon - never, ever - and must cease its deadly funding, training and equipping of terrorists and militias.""He later claimed in a tweet that Iran was working with North Korea to develop nuclear weapons.Then in May this year, President Trump finally decided to pull out of the UN agreement with Iran, saying: ""It is clear to me that we cannot prevent an Iranian nuclear bomb under the decaying and rotten structure of this deal.""Going against advice from European allies, he said he would reimpose economic sanctions that were waived when the deal was signed in 2015.Continuing his hardline stance, in June the US threatened to enforce sanctions on countries that have not stopped importing Iranian oil by November 2018. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was among the first dozen or so world leaders to visit the White House under Donald Trump and could be pleased with how it went.Not only did he deal with President Trump'sfierce handshake, he also got a guarantee that the White House would only be making ""tweaks"" to its relationship with Canada.Mr Trudeau, meanwhile, admitted that the two men had several differences, most notably on accepting refugees, but said the ""last thing Canadians expect is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves"".The relationship between the two leaders has become strained since that first meeting though and tensions came to the surface in June at a G7 summit in Quebec.When Mr Trudeau said he would not be pushed around by the US at a post-summit press conference, Mr Trump responded by refusing to sign the joint G7 communique on trade beforetweetingthat the Canadian leader ""acts hurt when called out"". Mr Trump's top economic aide later said Mr Trudeau had ""stabbed us in the back"" while another adviser said there was ""a special place in Hell for any leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy"" with the president.With Mr Trump set to continue his tough stance on trade, it's unclear how US-Canada relations will develop during the rest of his term. President Trump accepted an invitation to attend 2017's Bastille Day celebrations in France after a somewhat rocky start with the French president .Before Emmanuel Macron was elected in May 2017, Mr Trump suggested in a tweet that a deadly attack on a police bus in Paris would ""have a big effect"" on the election.Many thought Mr Trump was referring to National Front leader Marie Le Pen, the anti-immigrant and anti-globalisation candidate who lost to Mr Macron. But Mr Trump later refused to comment on the election and congratulated Mr Macron in atweet.Mr Macron described his white-knuckledhandshakewith Mr Trump at their first meeting in May last year in Brussels as ""not innocent"".But since then their relationship has warmed, with Mr Trump describing the Bastille Day parade as ""one of the greatest parades I've ever seen"" and saying the US relationship with France was ""stronger than ever"".President Macron visited the White House in April this year and was also given the honour of making an address to the US Congress. His speech was described as a ""thinly veiled rebuke"" to President Trump by the BBC's North America editor, Jon Sopel.But despite that and the various differences the two men have on policy, they appear to get on well and Mr Trump has spoken to President Macron on the phone more than any other world leader. Syria is another country that Donald Trump has changed his views on quite substantially since becoming the US president.When his predecessor was considering military action in Syria back in 2013, Mr Trump was a vocal critic against intervention.""Again, to our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria - if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the US gets nothing,"" Mr Trumptweetedin September 2013.But just over two months into his presidency, President Trump said he was so moved by images of children in the aftermath of a chemical attack by Syrian forces that he was taking military action.""Using a deadly nerve agent, [Syrian President] Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children,"" Mr Trumpsaid. ""No child of God should ever suffer such horror.""Two US Navy shipsfired 59 Tomahawk cruise missilesat a Syrian air base from their positions in the Mediterranean. It was the first direct US military action against the Syrian president's forces.Mr Trump deployed his military again in April this year, with 100 missiles targeting suspected government chemical weapons facilities in response to a suspected deadly chemical attack on the town of Douma.After the strikes, Mr Trump tweeted: ""A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!"" President Trump's tough rhetoric towards North Korea had many in the South feeling worried for much of 2017. But there is hope that tensions on the peninsular have been diffused since the US president brought Kim Jong-un to the negotiating table.After President Moon Jae-in's historic meeting with Mr Kim in April, Mr Trump tweeted: ""After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place. Good things are happening, but only time will tell!""Mr Moon, for his part, said Mr Trump ""deserves big credit"" for getting North Korea to agree to talks.Away from the issue of North Korea, there have been lots of talks on trade between the two countries as well.Donald Trump had long wanted to renegotiate the ""horrible"" free trade agreement the US struck with South Korea in 2012, claiming it had ""destroyed"" the US.In March, the two sides reached an agreement on changes to that deal, allowing US carmakers greater access to the South Korean market while protecting Seoul from some of the tariffs that the US introduced on steel.South Korea is a major US trade partner, with the US exchanging about $144.6bn (Â£112bn) in goods and services with the country last year.Mr Trump visited the country in November last year and his daughter, Ivanka, also made the trip to South Korea for the Winter Olympics there in February. When Donald Trump won the US election he did so with the isolationist slogan of ""America First"", leading many to declare German Chancellor Angela Merkel as the new leader of the free world.Her pivotal role in global politics could be seen clearly on the White House call sheet during Mr Trump's first few months in office - she was one of the world leaders he spoke to most frequently and she also paid the new president a visit in March 2017.President Trump's tone towards Mrs Merkel has changed significantly since he took office. In 2015, hetook to Twitterto describe her as the ""person who is ruining Germany"" after Time magazine picked her as their person of the year.The German leader clearly noticed Mr Trump's disparaging comments, saying at their joint press conference that she's ""always said it's much, much better to talk to one another and not about one another"".The meeting appeared amicable enough - albeit withone eye-catching moment of awkwardness- butsome reportssuggested Mrs Merkel was unimpressed with Mr Trump's command of policy details.The pair have met several times and spoken on the phone regularly since that first meeting, but there has been a more adversarial tone to Mr Trump's comments on Germany recently.On immigration, Mr Trumptweeted: ""The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition.""On Nato and trade, hetweeted: ""Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich Nato Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade!""At the latest Nato summit in July, Mr Trump accused Germany of being ""totally controlled by Russia"" because it imports ""so much of its energy"" from the country and has a new pipeline planned. Mrs Merkel responded by saying Germany ""can make our own policies and make our own decisions"".While Mr Trump was right that Germany imports most of its gas from Russia, gas makes up less than 20% of its overall energy mix,according to BBC Reality Check. President Trump looked set to follow a fairly traditional path in his relationship with America's closest ally, Israel.He was quick to invite Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to the White House and during a visit to Tel Aviv in May 2017, he said he came to ""reaffirm the unbreakable bond"" between the US and Israel and that there was a ""rare opportunity to bring security and stability and peace"" to the region.At the UN General Assembly in September, Mr Trump stressed America's commitment to Israel's security and fair treatment at the United Nations. The two leaders alsodiscussedtheir continuing efforts to achieve an enduring Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.In August, Mr Trumptweetedthat ""Peace in the Middle East would be a truly great legacy for ALL people!""But by December he had chosen a new path, recognising Jerusalem as Israel's capital, to the amazement of much of the international community.The UN General Assembly backed a resolution calling on the US to withdraw the decision, leading to Trump threatening to cut financial aid to those who backed the resolution. President Trump has met Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong three times so far, the most recent time being during his visit to the country in June.Last year, Mr Trump said of Singapore: ""We're very close, the relationship is very close, and we expect to do some excellent things together in many ways. And we have a very big relationship now. It will probably get much bigger.""After Mr Trump's first meeting with Mr Lee, his social media team posted a photo of the two leaders on Instagram and mistakenly identified the prime minister as Indonesian President Joko Widodo, but later corrected the blunder.Singapore and the US have had a friendly relationship in the past, though some Singapore officials have criticized the rising sentiment of economic protectionism in America.Mr Lee was welcomed to the White House in October last year during a visit in which Singapore Airlines signed a deal with Boeing for new aircraft worth more than $13.8 billion.Reacting to the deal, Mr Trump said: ""I want to thank the Singaporean people for their faith in the American engineering and American workers."" Donald Trump said he had ""very, very good discussions"" with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko during the foreign leader's White House visit in June 2017.The pair discussed ""support for the peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine"", where government forces have been fighting Russian-backed rebels since 2014.In July last year, Mr Trump called on Russia to stop ""destabilising"" Ukraine and ""join the community of responsible nations"". The Kremlin brushed off the comments.Mr Trump has previously accused Barack Obama of having been weak on Russia and allowing them to ""pick off"" the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine.The US president's calls for better ties to Russia have worried Ukrainian authorities, observers say.But Mr Trump announced sanctions against Russia for its role in the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria would remain even after his meeting with President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Hamburg.The president said he would work ""constructively"" with Russia, but to lift thesanctionswould be premature.At the United Nations General Assembly in September, Mr Trump met with Mr Poroshenko andencouragedthe European leader to improve his nation's business and political climates. Mr Trump also reiterated his support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Mr Trump arrived for his first visit to the UK as president on 12 July.His first event was a black-tie dinner with Mrs May and British business leaders, but it was overshadowed by the publication ofan interviewthe US president gave to The Sun newspaper.In it, he said the UK would ""probably not"" get a trade deal with the US if the prime minister's Brexit plan goes ahead.""If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal,"" he told the paper, adding that Mrs May's plan ""will definitely affect trade with the United States, unfortunately in a negative way.""He also said Mrs May's blueprint for its post-Brexit relations with the EU was ""a much different deal than the people voted on"".But at a joint news conference on the second day of his visit, he changed his tone and said a trade deal ""will absolutely be possible"" after the UK leaves the EU. He also said Brexit was an ""incredible opportunity"".Mr Trump also met the Queen, although there was no open carriage ride with her through the streets of the capital as the trip was designated a ""working visit"" rather than an official state visit.He had been expected to visit in February to open the new $1bn (Â£738m) embassy but, having voiced his displeasure, that trip was cancelled.Asked about the protests that greeted his arrival in the UK, he insisted many people were ""delighted"" he was visiting, adding: ""I get thousands of notifications from people in the UK that they love the President of the United States."" Saudi Arabia has had a close relationship with the US for decades and that appears to be continuing under President Trump.Mr Trump made his first foreign trip as president to meet King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, where the White House said it signed deals worth more than $350bn (Â£270bn) with Saudi Arabia.Mr Trump appeared a little out of his comfort zone when hetook partin a ceremonial sword dance during the trip.Relations had soured somewhat under President Obama after his administration's nuclear deal with Iran, but Mr Trump appeared to restore the partnership after he sided with Saudi Arabia in a diplomatic standoff with Qatar.Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations cut off ties with Qatar over allegations that it funds terror groups. But Mr Trump told King Salman that it was ""important that the Gulf be united for peace and security in the region"".When Saudi Arabia's leaders launched a purge of allegedly corrupt officials last November, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, they know exactly what they are doing... Some of those they are harshly treating have been ""milking"" their country for years!""More recently, Mr Trump has called on the king to increase the kingdom's oil production, complaining that the price of a barrel of oil had risen too high. Vietnam played host to Trump with a lavish two-day state visit around the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders' Meeting in November 2017.Mr Trumptweeted his thanksfor ""a wonderful visit"".Mr Trump waskeen to highlighta $12bn (Â£9bn)purchase of Boeing aircraftin a joint statement after the visit. Australia has been one of America's closest allies in recent years, with its troops fighting alongside the US in Iraq and Afghanistan. But that relationship came under strain almost as soon as President Trump entered the White House.Mr Trump was said to have had a ""contentious"" phone call with Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the end of January, reportedly over a deal agreed with President Obama that the US would take in about 1,200 refugees who had been denied entry into Australia.A Washington Postreportsaid Mr Trump abruptly ended the planned one-hour phone call after just 25 minutes having condemned the refugee agreement as ""the worst deal ever"". President Trump, who later publicly criticised the deal as ""dumb"", insisted the phone call had been ""civil"" while Mr Turnbull said it was a ""very frank and forthright"" conversation.Last summer,footageleaked to the media showing Mr Turnbull poking fun at his US counterpart at a dinner for media but both US and Australia dismissed the incident as harmless fun.The pair have held three meetings since Mr Trump came into office. During the latest, at the White House in February, Mr Trump said: ""The relationship we have with Australia is a terrific relationship, and probably stronger now than ever before â maybe because of our relationship, our friendship."" Donald Trump made defeating the so-called Islamic State group (IS) the focus of much of his campaign, so Iraq is central to his foreign policy objectives.However, his relationship with Iraq's leaders got off to a bumpy start when he called for a ban on the travel of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, including Iraq.The ban was eventually blocked by US judges, and when the Trump administration tried to implement a similar order a few weeks later, Iraq was left off the list - and judges blocked it again anyway.That omission came after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi spoke to President Trumpover the phoneon 10 February amid a large-scale offensive by his army to retake the city of Mosul from IS fighters.Mr Abadi travelled to the US a few weeks later for a meeting at the White House, when President Trumptold reporters: ""Our main thrust is we have to get rid of [IS]. We're going to get rid of [IS]. It will happen. It's happening right now.""In July last year, Mr Abadi formally declared victory over IS in Mosul and Mr Trump congratulated his Iraqi counterpart, saying the city had been ""liberated from its long nightmare"" under the rule of IS. Jordan's King Abdullah was the first Arab leader to meet President Trump and has had three further meetings since.The first occasion came in February on the sidelines of the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event held in Washington DC, and appeared to be little more than a brief conversation.King Abdullah was invited back to the capital in April last year for an official meeting with President Trump at the White House and he was back in Washington DC in June this year as well.Jordan is a key member of the US-led coalition in the fight against the so-called Islamic State group (IS) in Iraq and Syria and Mr Trump has praised the king and his armed forces for their help.""Jordanian service members have made tremendous sacrifices in this battle against the enemies of civilisation, and I want to thank all of them for their, really, just incredible courage,"" Mr Trump said. Donald Trump's relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is one that his critics will be keeping a close eye on.Mr Trump had business links to Turkey before he was elected president, licensing his name to a Turkish businessman in 2008 who opened a Trump Tower complex in Istanbul in 2012.Mr Trump was at the launch of the property, as was Mr Erdogan (who was prime minister at that point).But tensions were high after Mr Erdogan's White House visit in May last year, whenclashesbroke out between protesters and the Turkish president's supporters and members of security personnel.US Congress has called for criminalchargesagainst those involved in the brawl outside the Turkish ambassador's residence in Washington DC.Relations have also been strained with the Nato ally by Mr Trump's decision to arm the Syrian Kurds in the battle against the so-called Islamic State.Turkey views the YPG (Popular Protection Units) as a terrorist group linked to the PKK, a Kurdish separatist group.While at the United Nations General Assembly in September, together, Mr Trump and Mr Erdoganreaffirmed their rejectionof the planned Kurdistan referendum planned for later that month. Donald Trump is a big fan of Poland and its people.During avisitthere in July last year, he described Poland as an example of a country ready to defend Western freedoms, warning against the threats of ""terrorism and extremism"".Mr Trump spoke of ""the triumph of the Polish spirit over centuries of hardship"" as an inspiration ""for a future in which good conquers evil, and peace achieves victor over war"" during his speech in Warsaw.He also thanked the country for buying Patriot missile defence systems from the US in a multi-billion dollar contract as well as its investments in the Nato alliance.""America loves Poland, and America loves the Polish people,"" he declared. Argentina's President Mauricio Macri is a relative newcomer to politics, but his relationship with Donald Trump dates back decades to when he and his father were doing business in 1980s New York.That relationship came under scrutiny when Mr Macri called the US president-elect in November 2016 to congratulate him on his victory.According to reports in Argentina, Mr Trump asked the Argentine president for help with a stalled building project by one of his companies in Buenos Aires - a claim both men denied.Since then the pair have spoken on the phone a few times, most recently in May, to discuss Argentina's role in the region and the political crisis in Venezuela. They've also met once at the White House. Donald Trump first met Abdul Fattah al-Sisi - a ""fantastic guy"" - in September 2016 and when he won the election two months later, Mr Sisi was reportedly the first foreign leader to call him.Their close relationship has continued since Mr Trump's inauguration and President Sisi visited the White House at the start of April for the first time since he led a military coup in Egypt in 2013.Human rights groups, however, have criticised the US president for meeting a man who led a violent crackdown against the Muslim Brotherhood group which left more than 1,000 people dead.But officials say Mr Trump is seeking to ""reboot"" relations between the two countries because he sees a stable Egypt as an invaluable ally in the battle against the so-called Islamic State group.Mr Sisi, who wants to ensure Egypt continues to receive US military aid worth about $1.3bn a year, has praised President Trump as someone who has a ""deep and great understanding"" of the Middle East.The two met again during Mr Trump's first foreign visit to Saudi Arabia, where the US president said he hoped to visit Cairo soon. At a summit in Riyadh, Mr Trump said Mr Sisi had ""done a tremendous job under trying circumstance"".An image of Mr Trump, Mr Sisi and Saudi King Salman placing their hands on aglowing orbat the meeting also set social media abuzz.The pair also held another meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in November last year. In a sign of how fast politics moves in the country, President Trump has already met two Italian prime ministers.The first, Paolo Gentiloni, was welcomed to the White House in April last year and his relationship with Mr Trump appeared amicable enough.But the president was clearly more excited when he met Giuseppe Conte, the leader of a populist coalition who became Italy's 58th prime minister in June.After the brief meeting at the G7 summit in Canada, during which Mr Conte backed Mr Trump's call for Russia to be readmitted to the group, the US president called Mr Conte a ""great guy"" and announced he would be visiting the White House in July. Human rights have not been at the top of President Trump's agenda so far, but he has called for the release of a political prisoner in Venezuela.""Venezuela should allow Leopoldo Lopez, a political prisoner & husband of @liliantintori out of prison immediately,"" hetweetedin mid-February.Venezuela is in the middle of an economic and political crisis, with the country deeply divided between those who support the government of the socialist President Nicolas Maduro and those who blame him.Mr Trump has discussed the situation in Venezuela on the phone with leaders of neighbouring countries, including Brazil and Colombia, but he has not spoken directly to President Maduro.In anOctober tweet, Mr Trump called ""for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela."" The tweet reflectedstatements made by Mr Trumpat a dinner with Latin American leaders in which he thanked them for supporting the Venezuelan people and condemning the Maduro ""dictatorship"".Mr Maduro, however, has sent aword of warningto President Trump, saying in a televised speech: ""Don't repeat the errors of Obama and Bush when it comes to Venezuela and Latin America.""In April 2017 it emerged that Citgo Petroleum, the state oil company,gave half a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committeeand a General Motors plant in the country was seized by the state.Mr Trump celebrated the release of an American man in Venezuela in May this year, tweeting: ""Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela."" The man, a Mormon missionary from Utah, had been held without trial on weapons charges since 2016. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy held one face-to-face meeting with Donald Trump before he was ousted by a vote of no confidence in June this year.At the White House meeting, Mr Trump said he thought Spain was ""a great country"" and that he hoped it would remain ""united"" despite a push from people in the Catalonia region for independence.Mr Trump was also ridiculed for referring to Mr Rajoy as ""president"" twice during their joint press conference. But it turns out Mr Trump may not have made an error as Mr Rajoy's official title in Spain is ""president of the government"" despite the role being known internationally as prime minister.In June, Mr Trump and his wife Melania welcomed Spain's King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia to the White House to celebrate ""over 300 years of historic and cultural ties between our two great countries"".Pedro SÃ¡nchez, Spain's new prime minister, met Donald Trump for the first time at the Nato summit in Brussels in July, but there was no one-on-one meeting this time. Afghanistan has been near the top of every president's in-tray since US forces invaded the country in 2001.On the campaign trail, Mr Trump repeatedly described the war in Afghanistan as a ""disaster"" and talked about pulling the remaining 10,000 or so US troops out of the country.Back in 2013, he tweeted: ""We have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure in Afghanistan. Their government has zero appreciation. Let's get out!""But in September 2017, he agreed to send 3,000 extra troops to bolster the US contingent there as the Taliban gained ground and security deteriorated.Earlier that year, the US used the largest non-nuclear bomb ever deployed in combat,targeting a tunnel complexnear Afghanistan's border with Pakistan that was said to have been used by the so-called Islamic State group (IS).Around 100 IS militants were thought to have been killed in thehuge blastand President Trumppraisedhis armed forces for ""another successful job"".Afghan officials said the attack had been carried out in co-ordination with the government in Kabul, but former President Hamid Karzaisaidthe country should not be used as a ""testing ground for new and dangerous weapons"".Mr Trump and Mr Ghani met during the UN General Assembly in September 2017 to discuss their commitment to combating terrorism and improving economic development opportunities for American companies in Afghanistan. Mr Trump said he was ""cancelling"" President Barack Obama's deal to thaw relations with Cuba, saying he was re-imposing certain travel and trade restrictions eased by his predecessor.But the president's approach has not scrapped all of the Obama-era policy regarding the island nation.Both countries will keep their embassies open in each other's capitals, commercial flights will continue and US tourists can still return home with Cuban goods.During a speech in Miami's Little Havana neighbourhood, where Mr Trump signed a directive outlining his policy, he lambasted the deal with the ""brutal"" Castro government as ""terrible"" and ""misguided"".He said the US would not lift sanctions on Cuba until ""all political prisoners are freed"" and vowed to ""help the Cuban people themselves form businesses and pursue much better lives"". President Trump has met Prime Minister Narendra Modi twice, once at the White House and once at the Association of South East Nations summit in the Philippines last November.At the White House, the two leaders shared a warm embrace in front of reporters before vowing to fight terrorism together and praising US-India relations.""The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger, never been better,"" said Mr Trump, who describes himself and Mr Modi as ""world leaders in social media"".President Trump has yet to visit India himself, but he dispatched his daughter, Ivanka, there last November for what was described by local media as a ""royal visit"".She was given the red-carpet treatment in Hyderabad, one of India's tech hubs, with local authoritiesreportedto have removed beggars from the streets before her arrival as well as rushing through repairs to roads. President Donald Trump called Thailand's Prime Minister Prayut Chan-ocha, who took control of the country in a 2014 coup, to state his commitment to the US alliance with the country.Thailand's relationship with the US had been somewhat strained in the past because of human rights complaints. Former President Barack Obama did not invite Mr Chan-ocha to visit Washington.Mr Trump seems to have warmer feelings toward Thailand's prime minister. According to a White House statement, the two leaders discussed ""a strong shared interest in strengthening the trade and economic ties between the two countries."" Mr Trump also invited Mr Chan-ocha to visit the White House for the first time since Mr Chan-ocha assumed power.In September, Mr Chan-ocha visited the White House for the first time. During the visit, the two leaders released a joint statement that outlined ""their shared commitment to promoting peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific region and beyond"". Tensions between the US and its historical ally have been strained for years, but they reached a new low in January 2018, when Mr Trump threatened to withdraw US assistance. Previously he had put Pakistan on notice as he unveiled his new Afghan strategy in August 2017.""We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilisation, order and peace.""But he had warmer words when Islamabad helped secure the release of an American-Canadian couple held hostage in the country for five years. Mr Trump met the president before his face-to-face meeting in Helsinki with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin on 16 July. President Trump caused a bit of a stir about Sweden during one of his regular attacks on the media at a rally in February.""Look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this. Sweden. They took in large numbers [of migrants]. They're having problems like they never thought possible,"" the new US president told the crowd in Florida.The only problem was that no-one seemed to know what incident Mr Trump was referring to - not least lots of baffled Swedes.It later emerged that Mr Trumphad been referringto a report on Fox News about gun violence and rape in Sweden since it opened its doors to large numbers of asylum-seekers in 2013.But police officers interviewed for the feature said their comments had been taken out of context anddatadidn't appear to back up claims that there had been a surge in gun crimes or rape.Although Mr Trump did not speak to Prime Minister Stefan Lofven during this saga, he didphonethe Swedish leader in April to express condolences over an attack in Stockholm. Mr Trump first met President Mahmoud Abbas during the Palestinian Authority leader's White House visit at the beginning of May 2017.He said there was a ""very good chance"" of a Middle East peace deal, telling Mr Abbas during a joint news conference: ""We will get this done"".During avisitto Bethlehem to meet Mr Abbas again in May last year, Mr Trump said he would ""do everything"" to help Israelis and Palestinians achieve peace.In September, Mr Trump and Mr Abbas met in New York during the UN General Assembly. Mr Trump noted his personal commitment to ""improving the economic opportunities available to the Palestinian people"".But Mr Trump's recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital led to a sharp deterioration in relations as did his threats to withdraw financial support.The move led to a draft UN Security Council resolution being put forward by Egypt, which called on all states to ""comply with Security Council resolutions regarding the Holy City of Jerusalem"".The US vetoed the resolution, but in a sign of its isolation on the issue, the four other permanent members of the Security Council - China, France, Russia and the UK - and 10 non-permanent members voted in favour of it. Events passed off without incident on Mr Trump'sfirst visitto Belgium as president in May 2017, when he met King Philippe and Queen Mathilde before taking part in a Nato summit.Mr Trump met Prime Minister Charles Michel at the summit, praising Belgian contributions the fight against the Islamic State group and noting the ""critical importance of Belgian F-16s flying missions in Iraq and Syria"".He also took the chance to remind him of ""the responsibility of all nations to share our common defense burden,"" and to meet Nato spending commitments - a topic Mr Trump raised again at the 2018 Nato summit in Brussels.No one seems to have mentioned his campaign trail claims that Brussels was a ""hellhole"" or the geographically dubious""Belgium is a beautiful city"". The first phone call with the Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, came in February 2017 amid an attempted travel ban by Mr Trump that affected several Middle Eastern countries, but not Qatar itself.The two men are said to have discussed the fight against the so-called Islamic State group, with Qatar being a prominent member of the US-led coalition.Earlier this year, several Gulf countries cut travel and embassy links with Qatar over its alleged support for militants. Qatar strongly denies supporting radical Islamism.Mr Trump took initialcreditfor applying pressure on Qatar in the longstanding Arab-world rift, saying it could mark ""the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism"".In June last year, he again accused Qatar of funding terrorism,tweeting:""During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar â look!""But Washington would stand to benefit most from a resolution with Qatar as the US ally is home to the largest American military facility in the Middle East. Mr Trump's strategy on Qatar lies in encouraging Qatar's neighbours to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict, as well as implementing the United States-Qatar bilateral memorandum of understanding on counterterrorism cooperation. The visit of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras to the White House in October could have been awkward, after he openly criticized Mr Trump during the campaign and even called him ""evil"".But the two held a cordial joint press conference and Trump joked about the Greek leader's past remarks: ""I wish I knew before my speech"".He added: ""The American people stand with the Greek people as they recover from the economic crisis that recently afflicted their nation.""The Greek leader said the two had a productive exchange and he shared common values with the US. The Trump administration's plans to toughen America's immigration laws have been focused on Mexico and the Middle East, but they could also affect thousands of unregistered Irish immigrants in the US.Former Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny raised this issue with President Trump when he visited the White House in March last year,sayingthere were ""millions out there who want to... make America great.""The taoiseach traditionally presents the new US president with a bowl of shamrocks and Mr Kenny did so while making his views on President Trump's immigration policies clear.Mr Trump avoided mentioning immigration during the pair's joint remarks, but he did tell reporters: ""We love Ireland and we love the people of Ireland.""Mr Trump met the new taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, at the White House's St Patrick's Day celebrations in March, saying the two had ""become friends â fast friends â over a short period of time.""Mr Varadkar was confirmed as Ireland's youngest and first openly gay leader in June 2017.After the meeting at the White House, Mr Varadkar said there was ""enthusiasm from the administration to work on a solution"" for the thousands of undocumented Irish immigrants that are in the US.Mr Trump has business interests in Ireland in the form of a golf course and resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin said Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In June of this year, the Trump administration announced that it was ending the temporary protection status that had granted nearly 60,000 Hondurans the right to live in the US, meaning they could be forced to leave the the country by 5 January 2020.Hondurans were granted this status after Hurricane Mitch hit the Central American country in 1998, but the Department of Homeland Security said conditions in the country had ""notably improved"" since the disaster.The move came a couple of months after Mr Trump has complained that a ""caravan"" of migrants from Honduras were making their way towards the US,tweeting: ""Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the US is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL."" While President Trump has not spoken to Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, he has tried to ban Somalis from entering the US.The proposed ban has beenpartly reinstatedby the Supreme Court after it was twice by rejected judges in the US, allowing Mr Trump to bar visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days.He has described the affected nations as ""terror-prone countries"".In May last year, a member of the US military was killed in Somalia, the first confirmed combat death there since the 1993 disastrous Black Hawk Down incident. There was another fatality in June this year.The deaths came after the US announced in April 2017 that it was sending dozens of troops to Somalia to train forces fighting Islamist group al-Shabab. President Trump has yet to formally meet with or call the Georgian Prime Minister Giorgi Kvirikashvili, though he did pose for a photo and tweeted a welcome message when the leader visited Washington and met with Vice-President Mike Pence.During his White House visit, the Trump Administration thanked Mr Kvirikashvili for Georgia's sacrifices fighting with NATO forces in Afghanistan and also vowed to explore better trade relations between the two countries. President Trump met President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June, discussing illegal immigration, organised crime and drug gangs.But perhaps the strangest part of the visit was Mr Trump's focus on the Panama Canal, which was opened by the US in 1914.""The Panama Canal is doing quite well,"" he said at the White House meeting. ""I think we did a good job building it.""Mr Trump also praised US-Panama relations, saying ""things are going well"" and ""the relationship has been very strong"".During a working dinner in New York with leaders from Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Panama, the group reaffirmed the principles of the Lima Declaration from August 2017 and their commitment to the priority of restoring democracy to Venezuela.Mr Varela met the US president again in September last year, at a working dinner in New York with South American leaders to discuss the ""importance of working together to help restore democracy to Venezuela"". Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos visited the White House in May last year after reports of a secret meeting between Mr Trump and two former Colombian presidents.The White House brushed off the claims, saying the two former Colombian leaders were invited to the president's Mar-a-Lago Club by one of its members and the leaders shared a handshake.The pair also discussed the Colombian government's peace process with the Farc rebel group, which gave up its weapons in June 2017.Mr Trump also met President Santos in New York in September, along with other South American leaders, to discuss the Venezuela crisis. President Trump's has only had a couple of interactions with President Rodrigo Duterte, but they have caused much controversy in the US.Mr Trump first spoke to Mr Duterte over the phone in April 2017, in what was a ""very friendly conversation"" about North Korea and ""the fact that the Philippine government is fighting very hard to rid its country of drugs, a scourge that affects many countries throughout the world.""Mr Duterte has been widely criticised for human rights violations in the Philippines, after he authorised police and vigilantes to maim and kill drug users on the streets of Manila.His relationship with the US had been rocky in the past, in part because former President Barack Obama criticised the extrajudicial executions. Mr Obama cancelled a trip to the Philippines in September 2016 after Mr Duterte called him a ""son of a whore"".Mr Trump, however, has had a warmer relationship with his Philippine counterpart so far.After meeting Mr Duterte during a visit to the Philippines in November 2017, Mr Trump hailed their ""great relationship"" and their joint statement pledged to ""further deepen the extensive United States-Philippine economic relationship"".Mr Trump was understood to have invited Mr Duterte to the White House but that meeting has yet to take place. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Hetweetedthat he had ""never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country. Never said 'take them out.'""Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump reportedly asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language.According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.In 2017, the Department of Homeland Securityannouncedthat Temporary Protected Status (TPS) designation, granted to Haiti following the 2010 earthquake, would end in July 2019.Haiti's US Ambassador Paul Altidortold the BBCthe idea that ""we're simply immigrants who come here to take advantage of the US"" is wrong. Mr Trumpspoke to Uzbekistan's President Shavkat Mirziyoyevin December 2017 to discuss ""discuss regional security and to explore opportunities for improved cooperation.""That came after Mr Mirziyoyev told Mr Trump his country was ready to ""use all forces and resources"" to help investigate theNew York truck attack, in which eight people were killed, and where the suspect arrested by police was an Uzbek immigrant.The two leaders met for the first time in May at the White House. President Trump caused some controversy when he first spoke to Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari over the phone in February last year.During the call, Mr Trump signalled his intention to renew a deal to sell military aircraft put on hold by the Obama administration after Nigerian forces mistakenly bombed a refugee camp in the country's north-east, killing more than 100 people.The deal needs to be approved by the US Congress, but if it goes ahead it will raise questions over how important human rights concerns are to President Trump when it comes to trade.Meeting President Buhari for the first time at the White House in April, Mr Trump said the pair were working on a ""very big trade deal"" that included ""helicopters and the like"". President Trump met the emir of Kuwait, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, during his May visit to Saudi Arabia.During his visit, he called the leader a ""special person"" and said Kuwait's purchasing of ""tremendous amounts of our military equipment"" means ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" for Americans.The emir then visited the White House in September 2017 and held a joint press conference, during which Mr Trump claimed the relationship between the US and Kuwait ""has never been stronger - never, ever"".President Trump also referenced the ""tremendous investments"" that Kuwait has made in the US, especially in plane sales. Mr Trump lamented to New York and New Jersey politicians after the press conference that his plane was not as big as the emir's, according toPolitico. When Prime Minister SolbergmetMr Trump in Washington he may have been surprised to be told Norway had bought a fighter jetonly available in Call of Duty, a computer game.A day later Norway was reportedly mentioned by Mr Trump as an example of the sort of country the US should be taking migrants from in a meeting with lawmakers from both parties to propose a bipartisan immigration deal.Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics.According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told the lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, or Asian nations. Mr Trump cited Libya as an example of the failure of Western military intervention regularly on his way to winning the US election, but the record shows he backed it at the time.The country has been beset by chaos since Nato-backed forces helped rebel fighters overthrow long-serving ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011. Fighters aligned to the so-called Islamic State group (IS) have threatened to cause further chaos in recent years.President Trump held a meeting with Libya's prime minister, Fayez Al-Sarraj, at the White House in December last year during which they discussed political reconciliation in the country and the threat from IS.But the US leader is keen to take a less engaged approach to the country, telling reporters he did not ""see a role"" there for the US. Amid the NFL national anthem controversy, President Trump singled out Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt as an example for other sportspeople to follow.He tweeted: ""Even Usain Bolt from Jamaica, one of the greatest runners and athletes of all time, showed RESPECT for our National Anthem!""Mr Trump had criticised NFL players who kneel during the national anthem as a protest, to highlight the treatment of black Americans. Mr Trump's reported remark came as lawmakers from both parties visited him to propose a bipartisan immigration deal. Democratic Senator Richard Durbin had just been discussing US temporary residency permits granted to citizens of countries hit by natural disasters, war or epidemics, when Mr Trump asked, ""Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?""Mr Trumptweetedthat he had used ""tough"" language but not that specific term. Senator Durbin responded by saying Mr Trump used ""racist"" language and that the president did call some African nations ""shitholes"".According to theWashington Post, Mr Trump told lawmakers the US should instead be taking in migrants from countries like Norway, whose prime minister visited him a day earlier, or Asian nations.Mr Trump's administrationannouncedin January 2018 that it would cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US.They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001.Salvadoreans now have until 9 September 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay. Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen was one of the first world leaders to meet Donald Trump at the White House.Their talks at the end of March 2017 focused on the future of the Nato alliance and President Trump ""urged"" the Danish leader to commit to the target of spending 2% of his country's GDP on defence.The meeting appeared to go well, with Mr Rasmussen saying afterwards that he was ""more positive"" about Denmark's relationship with the US than when he ""evaluated the situation right after the [US] election."" Sudan is another of the predominantly Muslim countries that Donald Trump has included on his travel ban list.The Supreme Court partly reinstated the ban after it was twice rejected by judges in the US.It means people without ""close"" family or business relationships in the US could be denied visas and barred entry.More recently, Mr Trump postponed a deadline on whether to permanently lift US sanctions against Sudan so he could have more time to ""establish that the government of Sudan has demonstrated sufficient positive action"" on counter-terrorism efforts, providing humanitarian relief and securing a ceasefire in conflict areas.The US has issued sanctions against Sudan since the 1990s, when it was accused of state-sponsored terrorism.Mr Trump has yet to appoint a special envoy for Sudan. President Trump's main focus in Yemen has been his ban on its citizens from travelling to America.In December 2017, the US Supreme Court ruledPresident Donald Trump's travel banon six mainly Muslim countries could go into full effect, pending legal challenges.Mr Trump has alsocalled on Saudi Arabiato ""allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it,"" in response to the humanitarian crisis linked to the ongoing Saudi campaign and blockade against Houthi rebels.Yemen was the site of thefirst military operationauthorised by Mr Trump, in which a special forces team raided the compound of a suspected terrorist leader.The mission didn't go to plan. The US Navy Seals came under fire from fighters belonging to the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula group (AQAP) and one member of the elite team was killed.It later emergedthat a number of civilians were also killed in the operation, which had been drawn up in November 2016 but approved by Mr Trump.In aninterview with Fox News, Mr Trump appeared to lay blame for the death of Navy Seal William ""Ryan"" Owens on military leaders.""This was a mission that was started before I got here,"" Mr Trump said. ""They came to see me and they explained what they wanted to do, the generals, who are very respected... And they lost Ryan.""ANew York Times articleclaimed the Navy Seals found out their mission had been compromised after intercepting AQAP communications but they ""pressed on toward their target"" nonetheless.Mr Trump responded to criticism bytweetingthat it had been ""a winning mission... not a failure"". A White House statement said it was a ""successful raid"" that yielded ""important intelligence"".Carryn Owens, the widow of the Navy Seal, was invited to Mr Trump's joint address to Congress. She gota standing ovationand as the room applauded, the president said her husband's legacy was ""etched into eternity"".

"As the leaders of the EU's remaining 27 member states prepare for the first Brexit summit in Brussels, which issues will shape the agendas of the individual countries taking part? Chancellor Angela Merkel is keen to emphasise that Brexit negotiations are between Britain and the EU but Germany's position will assume a significance above and beyond most - perhaps all - of the other member states. This is partly because of its economic and political weight in the union but also because, unlike many other countries, it has the resources, the people and the expertise to analyse and work through the administrative complexities of deconstructing Britain's membership. For a nation that considers itself to be European first, German second, the priority is now the future security of the EU. Berlin wants to present a united European front in the negotiations, so it's likely to stick to a script agreed with the big EU institutions. Expect a firm line too from Berlin on the rights of EU citizens living in Britain. While there is concern in Berlin about the impact of what one German newspaper called ""Britain's leap into the dark"", and an acknowledgement of, in Mrs Merkel's words, the ""enormity and complexity"" of the negotiations ahead, but politicians in Berlin worry about the bigger picture too. Mrs Merkel has made it clear all along that she wants to get on with tackling other challenges facing the union; migration, terrorism, youth unemployment, the impact of digitisation and so on. And, she said on Thursday that, in a world of global challenges, Europe could not afford to be introspective now. Berlin didn't want Britain to leave - but, now that the decision's made, it wants ""fair and constructive"" exit negotiations to be concluded quickly and cleanly. But it's unlikely to support talks over the shape of the future relationship between the UK and the EU unless Britain first agrees the terms of its exit - ie commits to paying that ""Brexit bill"". Angela Merkel welcomed Theresa May's remarks that Britain wanted to see a strong Europe There is, in reality, little appetite here for a punitive approach. Berlin wishes to preserve its strong economic relationship with the UK. But don't expect Germany to be a soft negotiating partner either. Even business leaders - among them the head of the association of Germany's all-powerful car manufacturers - acknowledge the EU's interests must come first. Mrs Merkel has warned against the ""illusion"" the UK can retain or even negotiate better rights than member states. In Angela Merkel's response to the triggering of Article 50 last month, she chose first to commit to minimising the personal impact of Brexit on EU citizens living in the UK. And she is expected to seek to protect what she sees as those vital founding freedoms of the EU. She has repeatedly insisted that there can be no access to the single market without freedom of movement of people - a red line upon which many will seek to compromise but upon which she is likely to stand firm. France is in the middle of presidential elections, and will have a new head of state in early May. The two candidates havevery different views of the European Union - and of Brexit. If Marine Le Pen of the Front National is elected, all bets are off. She is vehemently anti-EU, and thinks the UK's departure is not to be regretted but applauded. With Ms Le Pen in the Elysee, the chaos created by Brexit would quickly be eclipsed as Brussels struggled to cope with a much greater threat - Frexit. But realistically, Marine Le Pen's chances are small. Far more probable is a President Emmanuel Macron. Mr Macron is fervently pro-European. In recent months, he has spoken out strongly about how the UK must not be allowed special treatment in its negotiations with Brussels. Echoing the outgoing President Francois Hollande, he says favours to London would betray the spirit of the EU and encourage populism. Despite his fervent support for the EU, might a President Macron actually support a softer version of Brexit? The obvious conclusion is that he would take a tough line in the talks on Brexit. But another interpretation suggests he might actually make life easier for the UK's negotiators. This is because on many issues Mr Macron is in agreement with the UK. He is economically liberal, pro-trade and pro-business. He understands the City. Hope for this more favourable view comes from a policy paper co-written by Mr Macron's top adviser, Jean Pisani-Ferry. In it, he argues for a ""continental partnership"" with the UK, in which London would have access to the single market (and pay into the EU budget) but win back control over movement of workers. This is seen as a very soft version of Brexit. Optimists say that a Macron victory would be seen as the start of a rollback against populism in Europe. A more confident Brussels establishment would then be more likely to reach a generous deal with London. Poles make up the largest non-British nationality living in the UK, so the first priority for the Polish government is to secure the rights of those 850,000 Polish citizens. It's thought that many of those Poles have not been living in Britain long enough to claim permanent residency, so there's a great deal of uncertainty among them about their future rights post-Brexit. Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydlo has argued there is no place for a ""multi-speed Europe"" Warsaw wants to be seen to be protecting its citizens' current status, including their access to UK social benefits. Essentially, it wants the current rules to remain in force. Those workers' earnings are important for the Polish economy. Each year, they send home an estimated $1bn (Â£780m). Another pressing concern is securing the UK's contribution to the EU budget. Poland is the biggest recipient of funds - 106bn euro (Â£90bn) under the 2014-20 EU budget, to which the UK is a significant contributor. Those funds have transformed the infrastructure landscape of Poland, and helped drive the country's economic growth. Warsaw hopes Brexit will not mean less money in the pot. Before the referendum, Poland named Britain as its number one partner in the EU. It insists the UK will remain a strong ally, especially in areas such as defence and Nato cooperation. Russia's annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine have increased concerns in Poland and the Baltic states about security. British soldiers have been deployed to the region and are taking part in the defence of Nato's eastern flank, a contribution that Warsaw values. So often the rock of contention, Gibraltar looms large over the impending Brexit negotiations. Spain lobbied hard to ensure that the British overseas territorywas specifically mentioned in the European Council's draft guidance document,external, which states that Madrid can veto the application of an agreement between the EU and the UK to Gibraltar. Since Spain joined the EU, Gibraltar has been able to call on Brussels to intervene when it felt Spain was squeezing traffic unreasonably at the land border, charges Madrid has consistently denied, citing security concerns. Gibraltarians voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU Now, there will have to be an agreement between Britain and Spain to apply the eventual Brexit terms of trade and movement of people to and from the British overseas territory. Spain has proposed joint sovereignty, something Gibraltarians have traditionally rejected out of hand. But aside from grandstanding on the Rock, Spain has many reasons to make Brexit as soft as possible. The Spanish consulate in London says 130,000 Spaniards live in Britain. On the other side, 309,000 British citizens are registered as residents in Spain. Here, the two countries will seek reciprocity on a deal making migrants' lives comfortable. Tourism is Spain's leading economic driver. According to the Spanish government, 23% of the 75 million foreign tourists who visited the country in 2016 came from Britain. There are strong financial links between the two countries too. Spanish company Ferrovial operates Heathrow and several other UK airports. Santander says 20% of its profits in 2016 came from its UK banking operations. Spain consistently runs a healthy trade surplus with the UK. Madrid has said it will work for an amicable deal with Britain, but the shadow of an impending row over applying it to Gibraltar threatens to be a major political stumbling block. Expats, exports, security - these will be Italy's three immediate Brexit negotiation priorities. Italy's embassy in the UK estimates there could be up to 600,000 Italians living in the UK,while it is thought that only 30,000 Britons live in Italy. Many of the Italians living in Britain are young graduates who cannot find work at home. Italy will want to safeguard their rights - and  find a way to ensure future graduates can continue to look for work in the UK. Then, Italy will want to make sure that it is able to carry on selling its goods to the UK. Britain is currently Italy's fourth biggest export market. In 2015, Italy exported 22.5bn euro (Â£19bn) worth of goods to the UK including cars, machinery, clothes, and the sparkling wine prosecco. HMS Bulwark worked with the Italian navy and coastguard to rescue migrants in the Mediterranean Italy will also seek to maintain a security alliance with Britain, particularly in the Mediterranean. As an EU member, Britain has taken part in anti-smuggling operations off the Italian coast. Italy and the UK have also worked together in efforts to stabilise Libya. Brexit also presents a number of opportunities for Italy. The EU must decide the fate of its agencies currently based in the UK. Milan is taking part in the unofficial competition to take over as the host of the European Banking Agency and the European Medicines Agency. It's never fun watching your best friend go through a break-up, and it gets a lot more complicated when you've got a bunch of friends in common. That's the position Sweden finds itself in, as its closest ally prepares to divorce itself from the EU. The two countries have shared the same perspective on 90% of votes in the European Council, and the UK is the Nordic nation's fifth biggest export partner. Ever-efficient Sweden has made no secret of its desire for negotiations on a new trade agreement with the UK to start as soon as possible. But its first priority is clarity on the future rights of EU citizens to live, work and study in a post-Brexit Britain. Sweden's European Affairs Minister, Ann Linde, has criticised the application process for Swedes who want permanent UK residency According to the Swedish government, more than 100,000 Swedes, from a population of just 10 million, are based in the UK, and about 1,000 Swedish businesses operate there. Sweden's Minister for European Affairs and Trade, Ann Linde, has been openly critical of the challenges facing Europeans seeking permanent residency in the UK under current rules, which include filling out an 85-page document and providing evidence of steady work. While Sweden's centre-left government has said it wants to make sure its old friend gets a ""fair deal"" in the negotiations, it has made clear that keeping the rest of the 27-member bloc intact is its core goal, a message shared by the country's centre-right opposition parties. But public support for the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats - who are pushing for a ""Swexit""- has crept up to about 19%, with just over a year to go before the country's next general election. Meanwhile, Sweden has seen a huge spike in citizenship applications from British expats anxious to guarantee their future in Scandinavia, with 1,616 forms submitted in 2016, three times the total of the previous year, 511. A ""self-inflicted wound"" is how one bewildered Dutch columnist described Brexit. The UK has historically been one of the Netherlands' closest allies. Exports between the two run into the tens of billions of euros. A comprehensive free trade agreement will be a priority - the Dutch government's biggest fear is having to fall back on the World Trade Organization tariffs. But bear in mind, the Netherlands was one of the first recruits to the EU club of nations and about 80% of the country's GDP comes from exports, most of which (79%) are within Europe. The strength of Britain's relationship with this small but influential ally could prove critical in determining the nature of the final deal. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said his general election victory showed voters had chosen a path of safety and stability In fact, the pragmatic Dutch could emerge as mediators. They are the masters of compromise, proud of their ability to put differences aside to work together in the common interest, to literally dig the land out of the sea. They have their people to think about too. The Dutch foreign minister told the BBC that securing the rights of the approximately 100,000 Dutch citizens who lived in the UK was a top priority in the negotiations. And the Britons based in the Netherlands are anxious to be afforded the same protections. The domestic political landscape could also influence the Dutch stance. Eurosceptic parties performed well in the recent election. They were emboldened by Brexit, despite the fact support for a ""Nexit"" fell after Britain demonstrated the complications involved in extricating oneself from the EU. The Dutch dilemma will be how to maintain the valuable economic, cultural and political links with the UK without bolstering the eurosceptics at home and across the continent who want to destroy their lucrative club.

"Could advances in technology, genetics and artificial intelligence lead to a world in which economic inequality turns into biological inequality? asks the historian and writer Yuval Noah Harari. Inequality goes back at least 30,000 years. Hunter-gatherers were more equal than subsequent societies. They had very little property, and property is a pre-requisite for long-term inequality. But even they had hierarchies. In the 19th and 20th Centuries, however, something changed. Equality became a dominant value in human culture, almost all over the world. Why? It was partly down to the rise of new ideologies such as humanism, liberalism and socialism. But it was also about technological and economic change - which was connected to those new ideologies, of course. Suddenly the elite needed large numbers of healthy, educated people to serve as soldiers in the army and as workers in the factories. Governments didn't educate and vaccinate to be nice. They needed the masses to be useful. But now that's changing again. The best armies today require a small number of highly professional soldiers using very high-tech kit. Factories, too, are increasingly automated. Genetic engineering is now widespread. How far could it evolve? This is one reason why we might - in the not-too-distant future - see the creation of the most unequal societies that have ever existed in human history. And there are other reasons to fear such a future. With rapid improvements in biotechnology and bioengineering, we may reach a point where, for the first time in history, economic inequality becomes biological inequality. Until now, humans had control of the world outside them. They could control the rivers, forests, animals and plants. But they had very little control of the world inside them. They had limited ability to manipulate and engineer their own bodies, brains and minds. They couldn't cheat death. That might not always be the case. Reality Check: Has inequality been getting worse? Headline Numbers: How do you measure inequality? Eight ways intelligent machines are already in your life Will a robot take your job? There are two main ways to upgrade humans. Either you change something in their biological structure by changing their DNA. Or, the more radical way, you combine organic and inorganic parts - perhaps directly connecting brains and computers. The rich - through purchasing such biological enhancements - could become, literally, better than the rest; more intelligent, healthier and with far greater life-spans. At that point, it will make sense to cede power to this ""enhanced"" class. Think about it like this. In the past, the nobility tried to convince the masses that they were superior to everyone else and so should hold power. In the future I am describing, they really will be superior to the masses. And because they will be better than us, it will make sense to cede power and decision-making to them. Artificial intelligence is being seen as a threat to swathes of human jobs We might also find that the rise of artificial intelligence - and not just automation - will mean that huge numbers of people, in all kinds of jobs, simply lose their economic usefulness. The two processes together - human enhancement and the rise of AI - may result in the separation of humankind into a very small class of super-humans and a massive underclass of ""useless"" people. Here's a concrete example. Think about the transportation market. You have thousands of lorry, taxi and bus drivers in the UK. Each of them commands a small share of the transportation market, and they gain political power because of that. They can unionise and if the government does something they don't like, they can go on strike and shut down the entire transportation system. Now fast-forward 30 years. All vehicles are self-driving. One corporation controls thealgorithmthat controls the entire transport market. All the economic power previously shared by thousands, and all their political power, is now in their hands of a single corporation. Could those who control data and algorithms become the super-class of the future? Once you lose your economic importance, the state loses at least some of the incentive to invest in your health, education and welfare. It's very dangerous to be redundant. Your future depends on the goodwill of some small elite. Maybe there is goodwill. But in a time of crisis - like climate catastrophe - it would be very easy to toss you overboard. Technology is not deterministic. We can still do something about all this. But I think we should be aware that what I'm describing is one possible future. If we don't like this possibility, we need to act before it's too late. There is one more possible step on the road to previously unimaginable inequality. In the short-term, authority might shift to a small elite that owns and controls the master algorithms and the data that feeds them. In the longer term, however, authority could shift completely from humans to the algorithms. Once AI is smarter than us, all humanity could be made redundant. What would happen after that? We have absolutely no idea. We literally can't imagine it. How could we? We are talking about an intelligence far greater than that which humanity currently possesses. Yuval Noah Harari is a professor in the Department of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and author of Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow.The Inquiryis broadcast on the BBC World Service on Thursdays.

"NCR's latest model of ATM can wirelessly connect with your smartphone Watch a queue of shoppers for a minute and they will be preparing to pay in very different ways. Some will pull out a debit or credit card ready to put in a reader. Others might use their smartphone to complete their purchase, the rest will be paying in cash. The group using notes and coins is still significant but their numbers are starting to dwindle, particularly among the young. That spells trouble for the operators of cash machines. Time then for a reinvention of the humble ATM [automated teller machine] but in a digital world what can you do with a hole in the wall whose primary function is dispensing cash? The answer is a ""bank in a box"", a machine that is the alternative to a branch serving all your financial needs with 24/7 opening hours, says one manufacturer. Other experts are more sceptical. They say all that can be done is to manage the decline of ATMs, and cash in general, until they are replaced entirely by a digital wallet found on our phones. This debate is a far cry from the hurried signing of contracts, over a pink gin, between Barclays and John Shepherd-Barron in the UK some 50 years ago. The deal, between bank and inventor, led to the first ever cash machine being installed in London in 1967. All did not go entirely to plan. When one was installed in Zurich, Switzerland, there was a mysterious malfunction. Eventually, it was found that wires from two intersecting nearby tramlines were interfering with the mechanism. Barclays Bank unveiled its first cash machine in the UK in 1967 Yet with other devices also being patented, the ATM soon evolved and its use spread widely. The latest figures show that ATM numbers in the BRIC nations [Brazil, Russia, India, China] have gone up sharply and machines remain a constant if not growing sight in Western Europe. Russia, has seen rapid growth in recent years, according to a report by Payments UK, while growth in India is coming, in part, from the development of solar-powered ATMs in rural areas. Portugal has the highest proportion of cash machines in Western Europe with 1,516 machines per one million residents. Sweden, typical of a Scandinavian shift towards a cashless society, has the lowest with 333 machines per one million inhabitants. Solar-powered ATMs are useful in rural locations and at festivals Tellingly the popularity of ATMs in Portugal may not necessarily have anything to do with cash. ""Cash machines in Portugal are part of a fully integrated cross-bank network,"" says Payments UK's Cash and Cash Machines report. ""This has allowed a number of innovations offering a range of other bank-related functions and services, such as cash and cheque deposits and also other services such as cinema and concert ticket purchases, tax payments, bill payments, and mobile phone top-ups."" So what new technology is coming along to replace the button-operated ATMs? One of the major international ATM manufacturers and software suppliers, NCR, has just started marketing its latest ""self-service"" machine. It claims users will never look at an ATM in the same way again - mainly owing to the fact that they think they are looking at a tablet computer. Functions allow the customer to swipe, pinch and zoom on the colourful 19-inch screen, just like on a tablet. And there is a video banking option to allow people to talk to bank staff. Instead of fighting against the advance of smartphones, it also allows people to complete withdrawals or transactions that they started on their phone. It has already been installed in drive-throughs in the US, and Rachel Nash, area director of NCR, says that it will soon be seen across the UK, Europe, then Australia and New Zealand and onwards. ""It bridges the gap between the mobile-first customer and those who want nothing to do with it [digital banking],"" she says. The first newly-designed ATM by NCR has just been installed in Switzerland As of 2014, Russia had the highest number of cash machines per one million inhabitants than any European country In Western Europe, Portugal had 1,516 ATMs per one million people in 2014. The UK had 1,074, while the average in the EU was 960 The UK recorded 54 cash machine withdrawals per person in 2014 - the highest in the world Germany and Belgium have the largest amount of cash withdrawn per adult in Western Europe. Adults in these countries on average withdraw over Â£3,500 a year from cash machines India has the lowest value of cash machine withdrawals with less than Â£270 per adult a year. However, this value has slowly increased over the past few years Source: Payments UK NCR says its research shows that 80% of the transactions typically completed inside a physical branch can be completed through a video teller at an ATM. ""This is perfect to leave behind when a branch closes,"" says Ms Nash. ""It is a bank in a box."" This is one of many new ATM designs on the market. But some argue that the ATM will never beat the smartphone as the hardware of choice when managing our financial affairs in the future. Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com, says: ""ATMs will continue to evolve in terms of functionality, with increased use of the phone to access cash via the ATM. ""While the long-term viability of ATMs might be threatened by a move to a cashless society, it is too soon to put them on the endangered species list."" He points out that if and when ATM usage declines in the US, fees are likely to rise for customers who use machines not in their bank's network. Will we soon be able to do all our banking without talking to anyone in person? But Robert Wardrop, co-founder of the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance based at the Cambridge Judge Business School, believes that as smartphone digital wallets become more convenient, so cash machine use will decline. Given that such technology has been in place for some time, only privacy concerns and regulation have stopped that happening sooner. Some people still value the anonymity of cash, he says. ""[Digitally] all your transactions are transparent, so those worried about a Big Brother world will push back against that."" So consumer preferences will ultimately determine the future of cash machines and, indeed, cash itself. The power lies with those shoppers standing in line, and how they decide to pay.

"This video can not be played Ahmad Nawaz survived the Peshawar school attack More than 130 children died when the Taliban attacked a school in Pakistan in 2014. Ahmad Nawaz - then aged 14 - only survived by playing dead. Now, he is visiting UK schools to teach an anti-radicalisation message. ""I was surrounded by the dead bodies of friends, with whom I was laughing, talking and joking moments earlier,"" Ahmad Nawaz tells an assembly of more than 100 schoolchildren in Birmingham. The 16-year-old speaks calmly and openly as he relives his ordeal in the hope it can deter young people from being radicalised. ""I always thought that school was a safe place, not a place where children would be brutally massacred. All I could see was blood and killing,"" he tells the pupils, many of whom are visibly moved. A Pakistani soldier walks amid the debris following the Taliban attack Ahmad lost his younger brother in December 2014, when the Taliban attacked Peshawar's Army Public School - a school that teaches boys and girls from both military and civilian backgrounds. Seven Taliban attackers wearing bomb vests cut through a wire fence to gain entry to the school, before launching an attack on an auditorium where children were taking an exam. In one of the worst assaults in the country's recent history, the gunmen then went from room to room, shooting pupils and teachers in a siege that lasted eight hours. The attack left 141 people dead - 132 were children. Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel. Ahmad was shot in the arm, and survived only by playing dead. ""The terrorists were merciless, they would shoot children until they died. My school uniform was red in blood,"" he says. The gunmen set fire to several of the bodies, as they moved through the school building. Ahmad saw his teacher ""burning alive"", but says: ""I couldn't help because my wounds did not let me."" He says he still sees the incident in his nightmares. Ahmad was shot in the arm by a Taliban gunman Ahmad was eventually rescued from the building, and put in an ambulance of dead bodies to be transported to a nearby hospital. He later flew to the UK for surgery, at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Nobel Peace prize winner Malala Yousafzai was treated at this same hospital after being shot by the Taliban in 2012 - and visited Ahmad while he recovered. Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai visited Ahmad to offer support to him and his family Ahmad now lives with his family in Birmingham. He has visited more than 10 schools so far, the latest one being Rockwood Academy. Formerly known as Park View Academy, it was one of several Birmingham schools caught up in the Trojan Horse inquiry, where it was claimed a group of hard-line Muslims were taking over schools in the city. Ahmad tells the pupils he has ""decided not to be afraid and step back"". ""I will continue to share mine and my friends' stories,"" he says. The gunmen roamed the school for about eight hours ""I want to say to the students who are inspired by the terrorist ideologies, and are running towards different countries like Syria and Iraq, that I am a victim of those terrorists. They do not belong to any religion. ""I know Islam doesn't teach us about brutality, it teaches us about love and peace."" His story seems to have captivated many of those listening. ""I really felt upset and shocked,"" says one young boy. ""He's being brave and courageous,"" adds another. Back at his home, Ahmad explains how much of his motivation to spread his message comes from his brother. Ahmad's parents had originally told him, while he laid in hospital, that his younger brother Haris had been moved to another school after the attack. But 15 days later, he learned from a friend that Haris had died. Ahmad with his brother Haris Haris' death is, understandably, still at the forefront of his family's daily life. ""I have no words to explain. Still we are in pain,"" his mother, Samina, says. ""We want to [move on], but we can't."" Ahmad hopes that his work might spare other families the pain of losing a loved one. ""When we educate [pupils], we can finish the ideology of terrorism. I want this message to be spread throughout the world as much as it can,"" he says. ""I think I have stopped students from being radicalised and doing terrorist activities, and I'm proud of myself.""

"Russell Tovey is known for the role of werewolf George Sands in the BBC's Being Human Few stage productions attract the level of expectation which surrounds the National Theatre's new revival in London of Tony Kushner's 1990s play Angels in America.  Its star cast ensured it sold out within days.  But Russell Tovey says the gay drama was part of his life long before he signed up to act in it. In 2006 Tovey, at 24, was in New York to appear in The History Boys on Broadway.  But he already knew and admired Kushner's play, mainly from the HBO version. ""Most days I ran around Central Park and the Bethesda fountain there became a pilgrimage point for me,"" he says. Russell Tovey in the Central Park location that became a ""pilgrimage point"" for him ""In the play the statue of the angel Bethesda is a symbol of strength and hope and each day I would salute it. So in my old photograph albums I've got selfies with past lovers, friends, my family and my dog - all with the Bethesda fountain there behind us. ""So when I was asked to be in the play it was the easiest 'yes' ever.  I feel I've astral projected this show to come my way. Watch: Russell Tovey on changing into a werewolf on Being Human ""My character Joe is complex and interesting because he doesn't even know himself properly.  He's a repressed homosexual and a Mormon and he's moved with his wife from Utah to New York.  Eventually he starts a relationship with Louis [played by James McCardle].  It's more of a love story than people will probably expect."" Louis has been in a relationship with Prior Walter, played in London by Andrew Garfield.  But describing the play's storyline is tricky: when the two halves were first seen at the National Theatre a quarter of a century ago critics and audiences loved the energy and the unclassifiable audacity. Kushner subtitled the play A Gay Fantasia on National Themes; Tovey sees a play ""about needing love and knowing yourself in a time of political upheaval"". Andrew Garfield (front) plays Prior Walter who is ill with Aids, while Nathan Stewart-Jarrett plays the nurse Belize Angels in America is two plays with a total running time of seven hours. The first half was first seen in San Francisco in 1990 when the Aids crisis was scaring a lot of people. ""The story starts mid-80s in the Reaganite period when there was very little recognition of what Aids was and far too little funding for research.  Thirty years ago there was an almost total lack of understanding and empathy outside the gay community for what gay men were going through."" In 1992 presenting an ambitious Aids epic was a bold decision for the National Theatre - though the gamble paid off.  Tovey is passionate that in 2017 Angels in America shouldn't be seen as a period retread. Denise Gough plays Russell Tovey's wife who moves with him from Utah to New York ""In lots of places attitudes to homosexuality have changed and as a gay man I see that as fantastic.  But there's still homophobia big time in this country and around the world.  You read now about camps in Chechnya where they're torturing people for being gay.  Yes there's marriage equality and more gay rights but there's still a huge way to go to normalise homosexuality around the world. 'This show couldn't be more relevant because it's about a political time when apparently you can forget about whole sections of society.  In the US now it's like time has gone backwards and there are states where they're voting to take away gay marriage or Aids research funding.  People's rights are being removed.  So it doesn't feel like a time when we can all sit back in our chairs and say everything's sorted now.  Because it's not."" Marianne Elliott took on the challenge of directing Tony Kushner's (left) epic Angels in America has had 11 weeks of rehearsals.  ""The process hollowed us all.  The greatest thing was getting the first audiences in and suddenly we were reinvigorated because they've loved it.  Tickets are pretty hard to get hold of - but NT Live means people around the world can get to see the show in cinemas which is great."" One of the main characters is taken from real life - the New York lawyer Roy Cohn who died of Aids in 1986 and who's played by Nathan Lane. Tovey says Cohn reminds him of contemporary political figures in the US. ""Roy Cohn is a big, flawed character and any actor loves to play flawed characters.  He's fascinating in the way that Donald Trump is.  Or maybe Kellyanne Conway - in the future that's going to be a dream part for an actress. There are such contradictions and complications and it makes great drama."" Tovey's constructed a TV career based almost equally in Britain and in the US. For HBO he played the gay English boss of a San Francisco tech company in Looking.   Since then he's been in ABC's Quantico, again as a gay Englishman.  So does he worry that his out gay status might typecast him? Russell Tovey always wanted to do a big US show like Quantico but wants to remain living in London ""When I was younger I was sometimes worried about playing gay.  Would I get stereotyped?  In fact every gay character that's been offered to me has had a unique story.  To continue playing gay characters, as an openly gay actor, has been the most exciting thing ever to happen to me.  Coming out gave me such a broad and magical landscape to explore as an actor.  And it gave me so many personal experiences too: it's been a huge benefit to me."" Quantico is a mainstream drama series, though one that depicts gay relationships more openly than would have been possible even a few years ago.  So is it very different from making a BBC series or something for HBO? ""I'd always wanted to do a big network series in America.  What terrified me was that there's no time to spare, no plan B if it's raining or something goes wrong.  You just keep shooting until you finish the schedule for the day.  Sometimes you finish a scene and it can be on screen in an episode only two weeks later.  And you can work to 4am.  I would get days off but the crew would be there all the time.  It's like a different world and it's marvellous but it's mental.  But once you face the challenge it's excellent. 'I adore London and I've no intention of leaving: I'm London through and through.  I love my home too much - and my squad and my family and my life and my stuff.  But working in San Francisco and New York is brilliant.  I love having my visa renewed.""
