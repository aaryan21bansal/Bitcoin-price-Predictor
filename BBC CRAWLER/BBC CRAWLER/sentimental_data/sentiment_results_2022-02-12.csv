"This video can not be played James Heappey says Britons in Ukraine should leave immediately The UK will not be able to fly British nationals out of Ukraine if Russia invades, Armed Forces Minister James Heappey has warned. He told the BBC the RAF would ""not be in a position to go in"" and people there should ""leave now"". Mr Heappey said the advice had changed because Russia was in a position where it could attack ""at no notice"". Russia has denied any plans to invade Ukraine despite massing more than 100,000 troops near the border. On Friday, the UK Foreign Office warnedBritish nationals in Ukraine to leave the country within 48 hourswhile commercial means were still available.A number of other countries have issued similar advice. The US also saidRussia could invade ""any day now""and told its own citizens to leave - although it said the US did not know whether President Vladimir Putin had made a final decision. Both French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Joe Biden spoke with Mr Putin on Saturday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said she spoke to her US counterpart, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and shared her ""acute concerns"" of military aggression against Ukraine within days. She tweeted: ""We agree Russia will face massive consequences for any invasion, including severe sanctions. Russia must deescalate and engage with Nato proposals."" Moscow has accused Western countries of stirring up hysteria. 'We don't have the option to leave Ukraine' Five ways out of Ukraine conflict Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up? Following a call with world leaders on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he feared for the security of Europe and urged allies to have a ""heavy package of economic sanctions ready to go"" should Russia attack, Downing Street confirmed. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Mr Heappey said: ""We are now confident that the artillery systems, the missile systems and the combat air are all in place that would allow Russia to launch - at no notice - an attack on Ukraine."" But he warned there would be ""a big difference between what [people] may have seen on their TV screens in Afghanistan over the summer and what may happen over the next week or so"" - referring to the international airlift to rescue people after the fall of Kabul to the Taliban last year. ""The Royal Air Force will not be in a position to go in and to fly people out so they need to leave now by commercial means or drive out of Ukraine into a neighbouring country,"" he said. British troops helping with training in Ukraine will also be leaving the country over the weekend, Mr Heappey added on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""There will be no troops in Ukraine if there's going to be a conflict there."" Some embassy staff are also being withdrawn but British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons,said on Twitter:,external""I am staying in Kyiv and continue to work there with a core team. The embassy remains operational."" The BBC's Paul Adams in Kyiv said there were signs of urgency and departure at the British embassy, with staff loading bags into a car and driving off. Nobody seemed keen to talk. The capital does not feel like a city in crisis though, our correspondent added. This video can not be played Expat Stuart McKenzie: ""If the British embassy aren't here to help, everybody's on their own"" The advice to leave Ukraine has left some Britons grappling with difficult dilemmas. Stuart McKenzie is considering heading to Poland, after spending nearly three decades in Ukraine. ""We love Ukraine and we've built our lives, families, businesses here. None of us want to leave,"" he told BBC Breakfast. ""These things can get out of control very fast and we've got to be on the right side of the chaos."" But Ken Stewart said he can't leave the country - his wife has just given birth to a son, who cannot get the paperwork to travel out of Ukraine yet. He said the UK government had made clear ""we are on our own"". ""We're both pretty nervous,"" he said. Harry Lee, from Cambridge, said he is not intending to leave Kharkiv yet, where he works as a teacher, despite being just 40 miles from the Russian border. ""Life is continuing largely as normal. There's been no signs of any panic,"" he says. Read more on Britons in Ukraine Former British ambassador to the US Lord Kim Darroch said embassy and Foreign Office staff would be working around the clock to make sure British people in Ukraine - thought to number in the low thousands - were aware of the advice to leave. ""It will overwhelm the embassy's resources, you can't assume all the Brits in the country will hear this so you have to contact them,"" he told the Today programme. ""You may have to arrange an emergency telephone line, you'll need to send people to the airport where, with lots of foreign nationals trying to get out, there will be chaos. There may need to be extra flights laid on so this will occupy everyone's time for 24 hours a day for the next few days and you won't get everyone out - some people will choose to stay."" On Friday, Tobias Ellwood, Conservative MP and chair of the defence select committee, raised concerns about the rhetoric being used by Washington. He told BBC's Newsnight: ""It's almost bordering on panic and that absolutely fits into Putin's objective. He'll be delighted to see the West and the Nato alliance crumbling in this way."" Nato's 30 members - which include the UK, US and several former Soviet republics - agree to come to another's aid in the event of an armed attack. Ukraine is not a member of Nato. However, it is a ""partner country"" and may be allowed to join the military alliance sometime in the future, a move Russia sees as a direct threat to its security. Liz Truss had a frosty meeting with her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov earlier this week The UK has made continued diplomatic efforts this week, with the prime minister visiting allies in Belgium and Poland, and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss meeting her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov. Ms Truss's meeting proved to be ill-tempered, with Mr Lavrov saying relations between the UK and Russia left ""much to be desired"". On Friday,Defence Secretary Ben Wallace met his Russian counterpart Sergei Shogiu,who he said had given him security assurances. Mr Heappey reiterated that diplomatic lines were still being pursued. He told BBC Breakfast: ""Clearly the only route to a peaceful outcome is if talks continue, and I think if talks continue there has to be a willingness to believe what each side says to each other.""

"Ben Garratt says the warnings from UK and US governments mean he wants to leave - but he has to wait for paperwork for his newborn son British and other foreign nationals in Ukraine have been warned to flee the country amid rumours of an imminent Russian invasion. It has left families grappling with difficult dilemmas. Despite the warnings of an imminent invasion, Ken Stuart can't leave Ukraine. His wife Tatiana has just given birth to a son, Douglas. Ken, who is originally from Edinburgh, tells BBC Radio 5 Live: ""He doesn't have a birth certificate yet - it takes one to two weeks to get that - and without a birth certificate, he can't have a passport and without a passport, we can't leave the country."" An email from the British government sent to Ken and other UK nationals told them they ""should not expect increased consular support or help with evacuating following any Russian military activity in Ukraine"". ""So we are on our own as far as they are concerned,"" he says. ""We're both pretty nervous."" A dozen nations tell citizens: leave Ukraine now Russia invasion could begin any day, US warns UK wonât be able to fly people out of Ukraine - minister Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up? The conflict with Russia has focused on the eastern regions of Ukraine since it began in 2014, when Russia seized control of the country's Crimean peninsula. Ken, whose home is in Ukraine's capital in the northern central region, says his only option of fleeing if an invasion happens is to stay with his wife's relatives in the west. ""We don't have any options other than to either stay put and see what happens or to try and pre-empt things a bit and go to the west of the country,"" he says. Fellow Scot Stuart McKenzie is already planning to flee with his wife and two children, after nearly 30 years in Ukraine. ""With young children in the country I've got to take their safety as priority so we're definitely looking at getting them out of the country as soon as possible,"" he tells BBC Breakfast. This video can not be played Expat Stuart McKenzie: ""If the British embassy aren't here to help, everybody's on their own"" He says he will probably drive out to Poland, where he has another business. His wife doesn't have a UK visa, so flying back to the UK is impossible. But he's worried about the obstacles he might find as he tries to get out. ""So many people will be trying to leave at the same time, there won't be flights, the roads will be blocked, are you going to be able to get fuel for your car, is there going to be cash in the banking machines? ""There is going to be so many things happening, so much chaos happening."" Stuart says the Ukrainian government have been dealing with threats from Russia for eight years and is trying to maintain calm, but adds that the tension now feels different. ""Every day there is more and more threats, and we hear that as soon as next week we could have Russian troops in the country,"" he says. Student Haider Ali arrived in Gatwick after his university in Ukraine told him to ""get out as soon as you can"" Foreigners living in Ukraine don't want to leave, Stuart says. ""We love Ukraine and we've built our lives, families, businesses here."" But he says: ""These things can go out of control very fast, we've got to be on the right side of the chaos. To think of a border with a million cars and panic happening would be disastrous."" Some Britons have already made it out of Ukraine, arriving back in the UK on Saturday, just hours after the Foreign Office issued its warning. At Gatwick, Haider Ali, a 21-year-old from Birmingham who was studying in Dnipro in central Ukraine, tells PA News his university advised international students to ""get out as soon as you can"" - so he booked a Â£210 one-way ticket. He says the Ukrainians are a ""laissez-faire"" people but in the last couple of days they have started to get worried. ""When that happens, alarm bells should be ringing."" But he says he hopes to return by June to continue his studies. Teacher Harry Lee sees no need to flee Kharkiv, 40 miles from the Russian border, just yet Meanwhile, in Kharkiv, just 40 miles from the border with Russia, Harry Lee is not planning to go anywhere - at least for now. He says: ""Life is continuing largely as normal. There's been no signs of any panic, there's been no signs of people stockpiling things. Whereas in England, toilet paper and water bottles would be out of stock, here life is continuing."" Harry, who is originally from Cambridge and works as a teacher in Ukraine's second-largest city, says he has a contingency plan if the situation worsens, intending to drive west or south-west into countries such as Moldova, Romania or Turkey. But for others, crossing the border isn't an option, even though they want to get out as soon as they can. Ben Garratt and his wife Alice moved to Kyiv from north London in December because they were having a baby through a surrogate. Now baby Raphael has arrived, but they need to provide proof of his British citizenship to get an emergency travel document, a more urgent alternative to a passport. Ben Garratt says it is ""frustrating"" to have to wait for travel documents amid the crisis ""It's getting frustrating because we're being told by the UK government to leave the country... and we still don't have the document we need,"" Ben tells the PA News agency. He says the passport office in Kyiv wants him to attend a two-hour interview on Wednesday, which seems ""bizarre"" amid the urgent warnings from governments around the world. Ben says: ""If we take the advice at face value, it means the UK and also the US government are worried that Russian action is imminent - that makes us want to get out.""

"Protesters tried to argue with police Police have started to clear a blockade of the main crossing between Canada and the United States. After days of protests by truckers against Covid rules at the Ambassador Bridge in Ontario, officers urged them to heed an injunction against the demonstration. The vital trade route links Windsor, Ontario, with Detroit, Michigan. Truckers' protests against Covid vaccine mandates are also ongoing at other border crossings and in Ottawa. The self-styled ""Freedom Convoy"" movement was started by Canadian truckers opposed to a vaccinate-or-quarantine order for drivers crossing the border. Friday's court order against the blockadewas filed by the city of Windsorand the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, which argued that it was losing as much as $50m ($39m; Â£29m) per day because of the convoy. Following the injunction, Windsor Police put out a statement to ""make demonstrators clearly aware that it is a criminal offence"" to block the border crossing. The police added that a criminal conviction could lead to the seizure of vehicles and the inability to enter the US. But hours later, crowds of people waving Canadian flags flouted the order and continued to occupy the bridge. While police had some initial success in clearing the road on Saturday, more supporters arrived as the day went on until they once again outnumbered the officers trying to move the crowds away. ""We urge all demonstrators to act lawfully [and] peacefully,"" police said in a statement. ""Commuters are still being asked to avoid the areas affected by the demonstrations at this time."" Is Trudeau losing his fight against truckers? Hundreds of other protesters continue to demonstrate in the centre of Ottawa, the nation's capital. Two other border crossings with the US are also being blocked by anti vaccine mandate protesters. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with US President Joe Biden about the border blockades on Friday. The week-long disruption to the bridge, which accounts for roughly 25% of US-Canada goods trade, rocked the car manufacturing industry. General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Honda plants have been forced to halt production and cancel work shifts due to parts shortages caused by the blockade. Analysis by Robin Levinson-King in Windsor, Ontario In the cold light of Saturday morning, police came in to break up the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge. Arriving in city buses, they created a flank along the north side of the protest, which had blocked several lanes of traffic, preventing people - and millions of dollars of trade - from reaching the US, which is just on the other side of the border. Wearing balaclavas to protect them from the bitter wind, with some carrying heavy weapons, the officers made it known that the party-protest, which had been going for almost a week, had come to an end. The protesters were not happy, but neither were they surprised that it was coming to an end. Some thanked the police and expressed their support for law enforcement, while one man cried ""You should be ashamed!"" ""They're gonna have to move us out. We'll be peaceful and we'll lock arms and show unity,"" said Dan, a protester who declined to give his last name to the BBC. ""If that's what they need to do, give me a ticket and I'll see you in court."" Slowly, and with the help of an armoured vehicle, police have been inching forward, encroaching on the blockade. Some have voluntarily driven away. Others began to break down the mess-hall tents. It will likely take a few hours to move the hundred or so vehicles - most of them pickups and SUVs, with a handful of heavy commercial lorries - to disperse. Speaking on Friday, Mr Trudeau urged the truckers ""to go home now"", saying their frustration with Covid measures had been ""heard"". ""If you join the protests because you are tired of Covid, you need to understand that you are breaking laws. The consequences are becoming more and more severe,"" he warned. ""You don't want to end up losing your licence, end up with a criminal record, which will impact your job, your livelihood, even your ability to travel internationally, including to the US."" He is due to meet with his advisors on an emergency committee known as the Incident Response Group on Saturday. But many of those protesting at the bridge said they would continue to demonstrate no matter the consequences. ""Bring it,"" one of those blocking the bridge, Chris Mayville,told Canadian broadcaster CBC News,external. ""Do you think I care? Do you think I care about a fine? I'm going to pay a fine? No. You think I care about their mandates? No. This needs to end."" Elsewhere, in Canada's financial capital Toronto, police braced for protests by expanding a cordon in the city centre. There were also tense scenes in France, where thousands ofpolice officers attempted to stopanti-restriction demonstrators from disrupting traffic in Paris.

"Dame Cressida arrives at New Scotland Yard the day after her resignation The resignation of Britain's most senior police officer comes after a series of crises has engulfed the Metropolitan Police. Why has it proved so difficult to clean up the toxic culture associated with the force? In full dress uniform, Dame Cressida Dick delivered her resignation speech on the balcony of New Scotland Yard, a slight break in her voice as she described the ""honour and privilege"" of leading the country's biggest police force. Her grim-faced aides appeared shocked by the speed of events. Inside the force, she is well-liked. She has defended ""my Met"", as she has called it, endlessly. But over her shoulder, on Thursday evening, the lights of London glittered - a city arguably less fond of ""its Met"", since she took over five years ago. She failed to win the friends outside, that came so easily inside her organisation. Charities representing women, the families of murder victims, and parts of the media turned against her. There were too many moments when the first woman to run the Metropolitan Police had had to apologise for its behaviour. Nine hours earlier, the commissioner hadn't been planning to resign. She told a radio phone-in that her staff backed her and even the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, had said he trusted her. That comment about the mayor seems to have brought him to a tipping point - along with new and horrifying disclosures about Charing Cross police station. His people contacted hers and made things clear. She no longer had his support. Her five years in charge started with the horrors of the 2017 terrorist attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire, and ends with the pandemic. Crime is up by 4% with 45% fewer cases solved. Knife crime fell as Covid struck, though there has been a recent series of teenage murders and there are concerns violent crime, Dame Cressida's priority, is rising again. But she's been brought down by crimes and bad attitudes within her own ranks. Racism, misogyny, bullying and incompetence. Rape, and in the chilling case of Sarah Everard, murder. The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick How can it be fixed? Over a long career, former Metropolitan Police detective Shabnam Chaudhri fought against ""the culture"", which for her included racist abuse. Speaking to the BBC the day after Dame Cressida's resignation, she described policing as a closed community. ""They get so comfortable in their own company,"" she says, ""that when new people come in, they get indoctrinated to that way of thinking."" It is a culture of ""corridor comments"". ""They disguise it as banter. There's a saying ""know your audience"". These guys know their audience."" Too often, she says, officers complaining about misconduct, or perceived to be ""using the race card"" are briefed against, even when they move teams. She should know. It happened to her, again and again. A constant drag on her career ambitions. The Metropolitan Police has a whistleblowing hotline. A channel for raising complaints about poor attitudes. But Ms Chaudhri said it was used to make false allegations against her, because she had spoken out. It is possible that a toxic culture at the Met was always there, but we couldn't see it as easily. A woman holds up placard at vigil to Sarah Everard at Clapham Common Things have changed. When officers arrest people, onlookers often start filming, their pictures shared instantly on social media. Footage from police body-worn cameras is sometimes made public during legal proceedings. And then there are messaging groups. ""WhatsApp leaves a footprint,"" Ms Chaudhri says. ""They think they're safe within a group. These people act like a pack of wolves and the only way they get exposed is because these messages come out in the investigation process."" Group messages provided crucial evidence for Operation Hotton, the investigation into abusive behaviour at Charing Cross police station. This case appears to have convinced the mayor that enough was enough. The investigation uncovered messages which were ""highly sexualised and/or violent and discriminatory, generally described as 'banter' by police officers"". They included: Messages about police officers attending a festival dressed as known sex offenders - sent within a WhatsApp group containing 17 police officers Numerous messages about rape within WhatsApp and Facebook chat groups Homophobic comments Use of words that could be considered misogynist, racist, or constituting disability discrimination The comments were claimed to be a ""joke or game, or just a 'misunderstanding',"" an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct concluded. There are a number of features of ""The Job"" which make this sort of behaviour more likely, according to a senior figure in policing who spoke on condition of anonymity. It starts at entry level. ""They say: 'He's going to be a good officer so we'll knock the rough edges off him.' ""But a leopard doesn't change his spots, and then you've got a problem for 30 years."" Most officers join in their early 20s and retire at 50. ""Probationary constable misbehaviour needs to be dealt with early on,"" he says. Gaps in vetting are one possible reason why the Met police officer Wayne Couzens' interest in extreme pornography and drug abuse were not discovered. In his case, according to the ""banter"", his nickname was ""the rapist"". He was one. And a killer. In one of the Met's many apologies, it said ""vetting is a snapshot in time and, unfortunately can never 100% guarantee an individual's integrity"". Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary is reviewing the vetting of officers, and will report later in the year. In the Met, experience is highly valued. The force has major investigation teams capable of solving complex cases and made up of officers respected for what they've done in the past. Most of them do not contribute to the toxic culture which is now damaging trust in the force. But there's a concern that as careers progress in some teams, bad attitudes become entrenched. Leroy Logan, a retired superintendent, says police ""middle-managers"" are failing to tackle those views. Cressida Dick on the day of her resignation The sergeants and the inspectors should be the ""checks and balances"" in the organisation, he says. ""It's not being Mr or Ms Popular. You have to have the ethical leadership to hold people to account, which they don't like. But it's what you're supposed to do."" Shabnam Chaudhri puts it another way. ""We need the good officers to call out the bad ones."" She believes this goes right to the top and is among those who believe Dame Cressida Dick was too defensive of the Met, and not focused enough on communicating the depth of its cultural issues. The Met's answer to all of this is Baroness Louise Casey. She is a respected public policy trouble-shooter, who has advised governments on everything from homelessness and families in crisis, to violence during the Euros at Wembley Stadium in 2021. Now she's been brought in by the Met to hunt down bad attitudes within its ranks, and stamp them out. But she has barely started. The BBC has been told she has only been able to begin work at New Scotland Yard this week because of recent ill-health. One issue she is expected to deal with early on is that it can be difficult to get rid of bad officers. Police employment rights are well protected, partly because as police officers they are not allowed to go on strike. This means everything is dealt with formally, with a process akin to a criminal investigation. While in some cases the misconduct in question is criminal, the complexity of the process means there can be a tendency not to make complaints. Some cases go to the Independent Office for Police Conduct and take months to resolve. Baroness Louise Casey will be under pressure to speed things up. But it could be one of her toughest assignments. Ms Chaudhri believes ""the culture"" will try to block her at every turn. We have been told that some of Baroness Casey's ideas were included in a plan sent to mayor Sadiq Khan to persuade him not to move against the commissioner. A plan which was rejected. This leaves the Met in a difficult position. Scotland Yard sources say Baroness Casey's work is due to continue up until Christmas. Even that sounds like a small window for changing the culture of a huge organisation. The pressure is going to grow. A police complaints investigation into the case of Bianca Williams, a black athlete and her partner pulled from their car and handcuffed by the police, is due soon. In addition, three Met police officers are currently facing criminal prosecutions: two for rape, one for unauthorised meetings with children. The ""bad 'uns"", as Dame Cressida Dick controversially described them, are not just damaging those they work with. The harm they do to trust between people and the police makes the job of decent officers more difficult. And the taint spreads beyond London. The Met is supposed to be a totemic police force. Scotland Yard, known around the world. It sets standards for smaller forces. Its officers do specialist roles such as protecting the royals, or tracking terrorists. The scandal, and the resignation of Dame Cressida Dick, have been deeply damaging. A former officer, respected in the ex-police community, spent the day after the resignation taking the temperature among his contacts within police forces. By the evening, he had sent a text message: ""All looking to leave policing except the last few who are pension trapped. This has really damaged morale.""

"Samantha Morton, who was homeless as a teenager, says the care system ""clearly isn't working"" The actress Samantha Morton has accused the government of being ""neglectful"" towards 16 and 17-year-olds in care. The lawchanged last Septemberso under-16s must be in regulated settings like children's homes or foster care. That does not apply to older teens, who can be in supported or semi-independent accommodation such as a hostel. Ms Morton - who lived in care and was homeless at 16 - expressed anger that, nearly 30 years later, many still find themselves without sufficient support. In 2020, over 6,000 teenagers were living in supported accommodation - the vast majority aged 16 and 17. Figures obtained by the charity Article 39 show that 22 children aged 16 and 17 died while living in supported accommodation between 2018 and 2020. This week, the charity took the government to the High Court, arguing that the policy was discriminatory and ministers had not properly consulted young people who had been placed in supported accommodation. Judgment is expected in the next few weeks. The Department for Education said councils had a ""duty to ensure children in their care have safe, stable accommodation until they reach adulthood"". It added that ""supported accommodation can be right for some young people"" and it was bringing in checks on the quality of such provision. Ms Morton, who grew up in Nottinghamshire and suffered abuse while in care,warned in 2019that the county's system was ""still not fit for purpose"" - despite a major inquiry into historical abuse in care homes. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, she said: ""If 22 children have diedâ¦ it clearly isn't working."" Ms Morton cited thecase of Caitlin Sharp, a 17-year-old girl with epilepsy who died in 2019 after being placed in supported accommodation against professional advice. After her death it was discovered she had not taken her medication for five months. Ms Morton said the situation was ""just heart breaking"" and she was ""lost for wordsâ¦ that [the government] think this is OK"". She said it ""feels criminal"" that a 15-year-old could be living in a very supportive environment, but when they turn 16 ""they'd be moved to rented, shared accommodation alongside someone who'd been released from prison with a tag"". Article 39's director Carolyne Willow said there was extensive research showing children in this type of housing were vulnerable to criminal or sexual exploitation. She explained that many such young people ""feel lonely and isolated and abandoned"" when placed in properties on their own. Ms Willow said: ""We are the sixth richest country in the world. Our care system for very vulnerable children should be modelled on the best of family life, not designed around institutional neglect."" Children in care homes 'seen as criminals not victims' Children in care in England could hit almost 100,000 by 2025 Care services 'investigating too many families' Ms Morton also said she worried providers were not ""accountable"" any more, as so much of children's social care was now operated by private companies. Places in supported accommodation are usually far cheaper for councils than children's homes, often costing several hundred pounds per week. The current cost of a place in a home regulated by Ofsted is about Â£4,500 per week. If the child is vulnerable, that can rise to Â£10,000 or more. The government has commissioned anindependent review of children's social carewhich is expected to report later this year. There has been an outcry in the last few months over the deaths ofStar HobsonandArthur Labinjo-Hughes. Both were murdered at home - but were known to social services, who failed to protect them. Ms Morton pointed out that the deaths of teenagers actually in the care of the state had received far less attention. She said: ""If we had an image on the front page of a newspaper of 22 very cute, very small children that had died in the care of the local authorityâ¦ there would be absolute uproar about this. ""But because they're a different age bracket - there isn't.""

"Jessica Morgan said she was ""never going to be the full-time mum type"" For Jessica Morgan, returning to work soon after giving birth was never in doubt. ""I was never going to be the full-time mum type,"" she says. ""I haven't got the personality or patience, I think, for that."" But she faced a stigma for choosing work over a longer period of maternity leave, and found she was not alone. Cassandra Bodington, a self-employed single mum, said taking more than two weeks off was simply not an option. Ms Bodington, a business coach from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, was back on her first client calls 14 days after her daughter was born. The two met after Ms Morgan posted about her experience on social media. They became friends and have now launched a podcast in which they talk openly about their experiences. ""It was a mixture of emotions... I needed to get my head back into work,"" 39-year-old Ms Bodington said. ""I needed that anchor."" Taking a full year of maternity leave was not an option: ""I had to make that choice to keep a roof over my child's head. I was 35, I didn't want to move back in with my parents."" Doctor on maternity leave helped with cave rescue No babies allowed in Commons, MP told 'Raw and inspiring': Tales of pandemic motherhood As she is self-employed, Ms Bodington was entitled to Â£151.97 per week in maternity allowance, but with no other income to supplement that, she said the amount was ""not liveable"". The high childcare costs were ""tough"", she added, but the help was important to her. Her daughter started attending nursery one day a week when she was 12 weeks. Average UK two-earner couples spend more than 20% of their income on childcare, one of the highest shares among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, second only to Switzerland. Cassandra and baby Elodie Ms Bodington said it felt like ""a cloud had lifted"" when her daughter Elodie started nursery. ""I didn't feel any guilt about putting her in childcare at all... I still breastfed her until she was 10 months."" It allowed her to see clients and keep her business going, expressing milk between meetings when Elodie was in nursery. While Ms Morgan said taking more time out would have meant leaving her career behind and starting from scratch after maternity leave. The financial pressure was compounded by feelings of guilt both women experienced. ""What I didn't plan for was the hormonal rollercoaster. You just can't help but feel guilty,"" Ms Morgan said. ""I felt guilt when I was working and when I wasn't."" People judged her, Ms Morgan said, telling her it was a time she should treasure. ""All it did was tear me up inside, and there was a lot of guilt around it."" ""It comes from that word 'should'. You should breastfeed. You should sleep when the baby sleeps. Am I a bad mother going to my computer to see if work has come in? It was a continuous battle with my brain."" Her husband took shared parental leave after the birth of their first child, and became the main carer for their children after the birth of their second. That allowed them to build a business together - they now run a media agency. Cassandra on her first client call when Elodie was 14 days old ""People from the outside thought we had it easy, but we took a huge risk."" Both women wish they had been able to be more proud of and comfortable with the decisions they took. Nor do they feel their children have missed out. ""We're always measuring ourselves against other people. But we just have to do what's right for us,"" Ms Bodington said. New mothers are entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave They must take at least two weeks after the baby is born, or four weeks if they are a factory worker The earliest leave can be taken is 11 weeks before the expected week of childbirth, unless the baby is born early Mothers are eligible to be paid for six weeks at 90% of their average weekly earnings and 33 weeks at Â£151.97 per week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (if lower) Self-employed people can apply for maternity allowance, which is currently Â£151.97 per week They can also take Shared Paternity Leave (SPL), where a mother and father can share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay between them Source:Gov.uk,external HAYLEY PEARCE PODCAST :Tackling the issues that make your group chats go off I WAS THERE:Real life experiences from major moments Women not supported to become leaders, says boss Little change in gender pay gap, study finds No parental leave âa barrierâ to local politics Women warned home working may harm their careers Maternity pay and leave - GOV.UK Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Demonstrators who oppose France's Covid pass, which requires people to show proof of vaccination before entering public venues, want to gather and blockade the capital across the weekend - suggesting such scenes may be repeated Sunday.

They have also drawn in others angry at rising prices in France. Some plan to continue on to Brussels, home of many European Union institutions, for further demonstrations on Monday.

Police have set up checkpoints at exits from the Paris ring road, and they're out in force across the capital, stopping cars that look like they're occupied by protesters. By midday they'd issued around 300 fines. Two months ahead of presidential elections the government is anxious to avoid any scene reminiscent of the sometimes violent yellow-vest protests of three years ago. The protest movement is ostensibly about Covid restrictions, in imitation of the so-called Freedom Convoys in Canada, but many of the participants also proclaim their allegiance to the yellow-vests.

"""Our business is growing,"" says Poundland managing director Barry Williams Poundland is selling more fresh food in a bid to attract cash-strapped shoppers to do a weekly shop with the budget chain. It's opening its biggest ever store in Nottingham today which will have shelves of fruit, vegetables and bread. Poundland has been trialling fresh food in a handful of convenience stores but it's the first time the retailer has stocked these items in a main store. It plans to add the new ranges to more than 20 other large stores this year. It's already begun rolling out chilled and frozen food and aims to have that stocked in 350 stores by the autumn. ""It's a natural extension of what our customers are looking for,"" says the managing director of Poundland, Barry Williams. His latest shop, on a retail park on the outskirts of Nottingham, is twice the typical size of a regular Poundland. It feels like a supermarket with trolleys and belted checkouts, as well as beer, wine and spirits. Poundland is launching its first large-format store Although grocery sales soared during the pandemic, the going hasn't been easy for discount chains as shoppers returned to the big weekly shop - and did it online. But the boss of Poundland says the discounters are starting to grow again. ""Our business is growing. The size of the basket that shoppers are spending with us is growing quite dramatically."" ""I'm seeing shoppers shop around a lot more particularly than what they were doing during the pandemic. There are locations that are coming back to life again, I think shoppers are definitely on the hunt for value now"". But, like every other retailer, Poundland is also grappling with rising costs. ""Inflation is hitting us right across the board,"" says Mr Williams. ""The cost of transportation and fuel, the cost of containers - that is double digit percentage inflation that we're seeing right now. And if you think of wage inflation for our colleagues, which we're supportive of, that is high single per cent inflation as well. I've got suppliers approaching us, and they all want cost increases"". The grocery aisles are fiercely competitive. But with shoppers perhaps more price-sensitive than they've ever been, retailers have to balance how much of their costs to pass on without losing customers to rivals. The boss of Poundland says he's determined to keep his prices keen: ""I'm not a magician, I'm not Paul Daniels. I can't magic all of this stuff away. ""What I can do is work as hard as I can on behalf of shoppers, to make sure that we mitigate as much as we can to protect them. Our view is really clear  - that people who work the hardest on behalf of shoppers are the ones who are going to win. The ones who just pass that on to the shoppers. Well, shoppers are king, they can go wherever they want.""

"Dame Cressida arrives at New Scotland Yard the day after her resignation The resignation of Britain's most senior police officer comes after a series of crises has engulfed the Metropolitan Police. Why has it proved so difficult to clean up the toxic culture associated with the force? In full dress uniform, Dame Cressida Dick delivered her resignation speech on the balcony of New Scotland Yard, a slight break in her voice as she described the ""honour and privilege"" of leading the country's biggest police force. Her grim-faced aides appeared shocked by the speed of events. Inside the force, she is well-liked. She has defended ""my Met"", as she has called it, endlessly. But over her shoulder, on Thursday evening, the lights of London glittered - a city arguably less fond of ""its Met"", since she took over five years ago. She failed to win the friends outside, that came so easily inside her organisation. Charities representing women, the families of murder victims, and parts of the media turned against her. There were too many moments when the first woman to run the Metropolitan Police had had to apologise for its behaviour. Nine hours earlier, the commissioner hadn't been planning to resign. She told a radio phone-in that her staff backed her and even the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, had said he trusted her. That comment about the mayor seems to have brought him to a tipping point - along with new and horrifying disclosures about Charing Cross police station. His people contacted hers and made things clear. She no longer had his support. Her five years in charge started with the horrors of the 2017 terrorist attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire, and ends with the pandemic. Crime is up by 4% with 45% fewer cases solved. Knife crime fell as Covid struck, though there has been a recent series of teenage murders and there are concerns violent crime, Dame Cressida's priority, is rising again. But she's been brought down by crimes and bad attitudes within her own ranks. Racism, misogyny, bullying and incompetence. Rape, and in the chilling case of Sarah Everard, murder. The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick How can it be fixed? Over a long career, former Metropolitan Police detective Shabnam Chaudhri fought against ""the culture"", which for her included racist abuse. Speaking to the BBC the day after Dame Cressida's resignation, she described policing as a closed community. ""They get so comfortable in their own company,"" she says, ""that when new people come in, they get indoctrinated to that way of thinking."" It is a culture of ""corridor comments"". ""They disguise it as banter. There's a saying ""know your audience"". These guys know their audience."" Too often, she says, officers complaining about misconduct, or perceived to be ""using the race card"" are briefed against, even when they move teams. She should know. It happened to her, again and again. A constant drag on her career ambitions. The Metropolitan Police has a whistleblowing hotline. A channel for raising complaints about poor attitudes. But Ms Chaudhri said it was used to make false allegations against her, because she had spoken out. It is possible that a toxic culture at the Met was always there, but we couldn't see it as easily. A woman holds up placard at vigil to Sarah Everard at Clapham Common Things have changed. When officers arrest people, onlookers often start filming, their pictures shared instantly on social media. Footage from police body-worn cameras is sometimes made public during legal proceedings. And then there are messaging groups. ""WhatsApp leaves a footprint,"" Ms Chaudhri says. ""They think they're safe within a group. These people act like a pack of wolves and the only way they get exposed is because these messages come out in the investigation process."" Group messages provided crucial evidence for Operation Hotton, the investigation into abusive behaviour at Charing Cross police station. This case appears to have convinced the mayor that enough was enough. The investigation uncovered messages which were ""highly sexualised and/or violent and discriminatory, generally described as 'banter' by police officers"". They included: Messages about police officers attending a festival dressed as known sex offenders - sent within a WhatsApp group containing 17 police officers Numerous messages about rape within WhatsApp and Facebook chat groups Homophobic comments Use of words that could be considered misogynist, racist, or constituting disability discrimination The comments were claimed to be a ""joke or game, or just a 'misunderstanding',"" an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct concluded. There are a number of features of ""The Job"" which make this sort of behaviour more likely, according to a senior figure in policing who spoke on condition of anonymity. It starts at entry level. ""They say: 'He's going to be a good officer so we'll knock the rough edges off him.' ""But a leopard doesn't change his spots, and then you've got a problem for 30 years."" Most officers join in their early 20s and retire at 50. ""Probationary constable misbehaviour needs to be dealt with early on,"" he says. Gaps in vetting are one possible reason why the Met police officer Wayne Couzens' interest in extreme pornography and drug abuse were not discovered. In his case, according to the ""banter"", his nickname was ""the rapist"". He was one. And a killer. In one of the Met's many apologies, it said ""vetting is a snapshot in time and, unfortunately can never 100% guarantee an individual's integrity"". Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary is reviewing the vetting of officers, and will report later in the year. In the Met, experience is highly valued. The force has major investigation teams capable of solving complex cases and made up of officers respected for what they've done in the past. Most of them do not contribute to the toxic culture which is now damaging trust in the force. But there's a concern that as careers progress in some teams, bad attitudes become entrenched. Leroy Logan, a retired superintendent, says police ""middle-managers"" are failing to tackle those views. Cressida Dick on the day of her resignation The sergeants and the inspectors should be the ""checks and balances"" in the organisation, he says. ""It's not being Mr or Ms Popular. You have to have the ethical leadership to hold people to account, which they don't like. But it's what you're supposed to do."" Shabnam Chaudhri puts it another way. ""We need the good officers to call out the bad ones."" She believes this goes right to the top and is among those who believe Dame Cressida Dick was too defensive of the Met, and not focused enough on communicating the depth of its cultural issues. The Met's answer to all of this is Baroness Louise Casey. She is a respected public policy trouble-shooter, who has advised governments on everything from homelessness and families in crisis, to violence during the Euros at Wembley Stadium in 2021. Now she's been brought in by the Met to hunt down bad attitudes within its ranks, and stamp them out. But she has barely started. The BBC has been told she has only been able to begin work at New Scotland Yard this week because of recent ill-health. One issue she is expected to deal with early on is that it can be difficult to get rid of bad officers. Police employment rights are well protected, partly because as police officers they are not allowed to go on strike. This means everything is dealt with formally, with a process akin to a criminal investigation. While in some cases the misconduct in question is criminal, the complexity of the process means there can be a tendency not to make complaints. Some cases go to the Independent Office for Police Conduct and take months to resolve. Baroness Louise Casey will be under pressure to speed things up. But it could be one of her toughest assignments. Ms Chaudhri believes ""the culture"" will try to block her at every turn. We have been told that some of Baroness Casey's ideas were included in a plan sent to mayor Sadiq Khan to persuade him not to move against the commissioner. A plan which was rejected. This leaves the Met in a difficult position. Scotland Yard sources say Baroness Casey's work is due to continue up until Christmas. Even that sounds like a small window for changing the culture of a huge organisation. The pressure is going to grow. A police complaints investigation into the case of Bianca Williams, a black athlete and her partner pulled from their car and handcuffed by the police, is due soon. In addition, three Met police officers are currently facing criminal prosecutions: two for rape, one for unauthorised meetings with children. The ""bad 'uns"", as Dame Cressida Dick controversially described them, are not just damaging those they work with. The harm they do to trust between people and the police makes the job of decent officers more difficult. And the taint spreads beyond London. The Met is supposed to be a totemic police force. Scotland Yard, known around the world. It sets standards for smaller forces. Its officers do specialist roles such as protecting the royals, or tracking terrorists. The scandal, and the resignation of Dame Cressida Dick, have been deeply damaging. A former officer, respected in the ex-police community, spent the day after the resignation taking the temperature among his contacts within police forces. By the evening, he had sent a text message: ""All looking to leave policing except the last few who are pension trapped. This has really damaged morale.""

"Samantha Morton, who was homeless as a teenager, says the care system ""clearly isn't working"" The actress Samantha Morton has accused the government of being ""neglectful"" towards 16 and 17-year-olds in care. The lawchanged last Septemberso under-16s must be in regulated settings like children's homes or foster care. That does not apply to older teens, who can be in supported or semi-independent accommodation such as a hostel. Ms Morton - who lived in care and was homeless at 16 - expressed anger that, nearly 30 years later, many still find themselves without sufficient support. In 2020, over 6,000 teenagers were living in supported accommodation - the vast majority aged 16 and 17. Figures obtained by the charity Article 39 show that 22 children aged 16 and 17 died while living in supported accommodation between 2018 and 2020. This week, the charity took the government to the High Court, arguing that the policy was discriminatory and ministers had not properly consulted young people who had been placed in supported accommodation. Judgment is expected in the next few weeks. The Department for Education said councils had a ""duty to ensure children in their care have safe, stable accommodation until they reach adulthood"". It added that ""supported accommodation can be right for some young people"" and it was bringing in checks on the quality of such provision. Ms Morton, who grew up in Nottinghamshire and suffered abuse while in care,warned in 2019that the county's system was ""still not fit for purpose"" - despite a major inquiry into historical abuse in care homes. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Saturday, she said: ""If 22 children have diedâ¦ it clearly isn't working."" Ms Morton cited thecase of Caitlin Sharp, a 17-year-old girl with epilepsy who died in 2019 after being placed in supported accommodation against professional advice. After her death it was discovered she had not taken her medication for five months. Ms Morton said the situation was ""just heart breaking"" and she was ""lost for wordsâ¦ that [the government] think this is OK"". She said it ""feels criminal"" that a 15-year-old could be living in a very supportive environment, but when they turn 16 ""they'd be moved to rented, shared accommodation alongside someone who'd been released from prison with a tag"". Article 39's director Carolyne Willow said there was extensive research showing children in this type of housing were vulnerable to criminal or sexual exploitation. She explained that many such young people ""feel lonely and isolated and abandoned"" when placed in properties on their own. Ms Willow said: ""We are the sixth richest country in the world. Our care system for very vulnerable children should be modelled on the best of family life, not designed around institutional neglect."" Children in care homes 'seen as criminals not victims' Children in care in England could hit almost 100,000 by 2025 Care services 'investigating too many families' Ms Morton also said she worried providers were not ""accountable"" any more, as so much of children's social care was now operated by private companies. Places in supported accommodation are usually far cheaper for councils than children's homes, often costing several hundred pounds per week. The current cost of a place in a home regulated by Ofsted is about Â£4,500 per week. If the child is vulnerable, that can rise to Â£10,000 or more. The government has commissioned anindependent review of children's social carewhich is expected to report later this year. There has been an outcry in the last few months over the deaths ofStar HobsonandArthur Labinjo-Hughes. Both were murdered at home - but were known to social services, who failed to protect them. Ms Morton pointed out that the deaths of teenagers actually in the care of the state had received far less attention. She said: ""If we had an image on the front page of a newspaper of 22 very cute, very small children that had died in the care of the local authorityâ¦ there would be absolute uproar about this. ""But because they're a different age bracket - there isn't.""

"""Our business is growing,"" says Poundland managing director Barry Williams Poundland is selling more fresh food in a bid to attract cash-strapped shoppers to do a weekly shop with the budget chain. It's opening its biggest ever store in Nottingham today which will have shelves of fruit, vegetables and bread. Poundland has been trialling fresh food in a handful of convenience stores but it's the first time the retailer has stocked these items in a main store. It plans to add the new ranges to more than 20 other large stores this year. It's already begun rolling out chilled and frozen food and aims to have that stocked in 350 stores by the autumn. ""It's a natural extension of what our customers are looking for,"" says the managing director of Poundland, Barry Williams. His latest shop, on a retail park on the outskirts of Nottingham, is twice the typical size of a regular Poundland. It feels like a supermarket with trolleys and belted checkouts, as well as beer, wine and spirits. Poundland is launching its first large-format store Although grocery sales soared during the pandemic, the going hasn't been easy for discount chains as shoppers returned to the big weekly shop - and did it online. But the boss of Poundland says the discounters are starting to grow again. ""Our business is growing. The size of the basket that shoppers are spending with us is growing quite dramatically."" ""I'm seeing shoppers shop around a lot more particularly than what they were doing during the pandemic. There are locations that are coming back to life again, I think shoppers are definitely on the hunt for value now"". But, like every other retailer, Poundland is also grappling with rising costs. ""Inflation is hitting us right across the board,"" says Mr Williams. ""The cost of transportation and fuel, the cost of containers - that is double digit percentage inflation that we're seeing right now. And if you think of wage inflation for our colleagues, which we're supportive of, that is high single per cent inflation as well. I've got suppliers approaching us, and they all want cost increases"". The grocery aisles are fiercely competitive. But with shoppers perhaps more price-sensitive than they've ever been, retailers have to balance how much of their costs to pass on without losing customers to rivals. The boss of Poundland says he's determined to keep his prices keen: ""I'm not a magician, I'm not Paul Daniels. I can't magic all of this stuff away. ""What I can do is work as hard as I can on behalf of shoppers, to make sure that we mitigate as much as we can to protect them. Our view is really clear  - that people who work the hardest on behalf of shoppers are the ones who are going to win. The ones who just pass that on to the shoppers. Well, shoppers are king, they can go wherever they want.""

"Law enforcement takes part in joint drills with the National Guard in the Kherson region of Ukraine on Saturday More than a dozen countries have urged their citizens to leave Ukraine amid warnings from Western powers that an invasion by Russia could be imminent. The US, UK and Germany are among those who told their nationals to leave. Moscow has amassed an estimated 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border but denies any intent to invade. In a phone call, US President Joe Biden again warned Russian leader Vladimir Putin of the costs of any invasion. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said invasion warnings could stoke panic, which he called ""the best friend of our enemies"". The White House has warned that an invasion could happen at any time, and could begin with bombing from the air. Russia characterised such allegations as ""provocative speculation"". Non-essential staff have been ordered to leave the US Embassy in Ukraine's capital Kyiv, and consular services will be suspended from Sunday, although ""a small consular presence"" will remain in the western city of Lviv ""to handle emergencies"". Canada is also moving its embassy staff to Lviv, near the border with Poland, Canadian media reported. UK ambassador to Ukraine Melinda Simmons tweeted that she and a ""core team"" are staying in Kyiv. Russia itself is also making changes, saying it will ""optimise the staffing"" of its diplomats in Ukraine, citing ""possible acts of provocation by the Kyiv regime or third countries"". 'We don't have the option to leave Ukraine' Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? Five ways out of Ukraine conflict The US has also pulled some 150 troops who were training Ukrainian soldiers out of the country, citing an abundance of caution. And Dutch airline KLM announced it would stop flying to Ukraine, effective immediately, Dutch media said. Mr Zelensky said that if Western powers had any firm evidence of an impending invasion, he had yet to see it. ""I think there is too much information in the media about a deep, full-scale war,"" he said. ""We understand all the risks, we understand that they exist. If you or someone else has additional 100% reliable information about the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine... please share it with us."" This video can not be played Iâm staying in Ukraine, for now: Watch US citizen and English teacher Juan Tec explain why Many countries, including Australia, Italy, Israel, the Netherlands and Japan have told their citizens to leave Ukraine. Some have also evacuated diplomatic staff and their families. Mr Biden told Mr Putin that any invasion would result in ""swift and severe costs on Russia"", White House notes about the call said. ""While the United States remains prepared to engage in diplomacy... we are equally prepared for other scenarios,"" it said. The Kremlin described the call as taking place amid ""peak hysteria"" from the US and its allies, and said Mr Putin had again told his counterpart that they had not addressed Russia's security concerns. But both leaders would continue to talk, it said. French President Emmanuel Macron also spoke to Mr Putin by phone on Saturday, telling him that ""a sincere dialogue was not compatible with escalation"", according to notes released by the French embassy. With foreign embassies withdrawing staff and a host of countries now telling their citizens to leave Ukraine, Kyiv still doesn't feel like a city in crisis. The government here is telling people to stay calm and united and, in the words of a statement this morning, refrain from actions that undermine stability and sow panic. President Zelensky said the country had to be ready for any eventuality. Across Ukraine, foreign citizens are now making hurried plans. Stuart McKenzie, who's lived in Kyiv for 28 years and runs a successful business, hopes to get his wife and two sons out on a flight. But he is ready, if necessary, to pack the family into the car and drive 300 miles to Poland. He loves Ukraine and can't quite believe it's come to this. At the British Embassy, we found tight-lipped staff loading bags into a car and driving off. No-one seemed keen to talk. Not far to the north, across the border in Belarus, Russia's war games are now well under way. Russian defence ministry pictures, released this morning, showed multiple rocket launchers being fired. Moscow still says it has no plans to invade. But there's a lot the Russians can do without ever setting foot inside Ukraine. In Kyiv, several thousand people marched through the city on Saturday, chanting slogans pledging loyalty to Ukraine and resistance to any Russian invasion. The march was organised by a right-wing nationalist group called Gonor and anti-Zelensky far-right activist Sergiy Sternenko, but it attracted other people too. BBC reporter Eleanor Montague says the demonstration was not huge, but was the first significant manifestation of public feeling since tensions escalated, finishing at the Maidan, the city's most famous square. Sasha Nizelska, who works as a nanny in Kyiv, told the BBC that she would resist a Russian attack with all means in her power. The sentiment was repeated by people of all age groups attending the demonstration. Tensions have steadily increased as Russia has continued to deploy troops along Ukraine's eastern border. Russian troops are also staging military exercises in Belarus to the north, while naval exercises in the Sea of Azov in the south-east have led to accusations thatRussia is blocking Ukraine's access to the sea. Meanwhile, some 7,500km (4,660 miles) away on Russia's eastern side, the Russian defence ministry says it spotted a US Navy submarine inside its territorial waters. Officials say the US submarine was near the Kuril Islands and failed to surface when instructed. The Marshal Shaposhnikov destroyer took unspecified ""appropriate"" actions and the US submarine left the area, the ministry said. A US defence official has been summoned by Moscow over the incident. However, US officials later contradicted their Russian counterparts' version of events. ""There is no truth to the Russian claims of our operations in their territorial waters,"" US military spokesman Captain Kyle Raines said in a statement carried by Reuters. ""I will not comment on the precise location of our submarines but we do fly, sail, and operate safely in international waters.""

Ken, who is originally from Edinburgh, tells BBC Radio 5 Live: ""He doesn't have a birth certificate yet - it takes one to two weeks to get that - and without a birth certificate, he can't have a passport and without a passport, we can't leave the country."" An email from the British government sent to Ken and other UK nationals told them they ""should not expect increased consular support or help with evacuating following any Russian military activity in Ukraine"". ""So we are on our own as far as they are concerned,"" he says. ""We're both pretty nervous."" A dozen nations tell citizens: leave Ukraine now Russia invasion could begin any day, US warns UK wonât be able to fly people out of Ukraine - minister Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up? The conflict with Russia has focused on the eastern regions of Ukraine since it began in 2014, when Russia seized control of the country's Crimean peninsula. Ken, whose home is in Ukraine's capital in the northern central region, says his only option of fleeing if an invasion happens is to stay with his wife's relatives in the west. ""We don't have any options other than to either stay put and see what happens or to try and pre-empt things a bit and go to the west of the country,"" he says. Fellow Scot Stuart McKenzie is already planning to flee with his wife and two children, after nearly 30 years in Ukraine. ""With young children in the country I've got to take their safety as priority so we're definitely looking at getting them out of the country as soon as possible,"" he tells BBC Breakfast. This video can not be played Expat Stuart McKenzie: ""If the British embassy aren't here to help, everybody's on their own"" He says he will probably drive out to Poland, where he has another business. His wife doesn't have a UK visa, so flying back to the UK is impossible. But he's worried about the obstacles he might find as he tries to get out. ""So many people will be trying to leave at the same time, there won't be flights, the roads will be blocked, are you going to be able to get fuel for your car, is there going to be cash in the banking machines? ""There is going to be so many things happening, so much chaos happening."" Stuart says the Ukrainian government have been dealing with threats from Russia for eight years and is trying to maintain calm, but adds that the tension now feels different. ""Every day there is more and more threats, and we hear that as soon as next week we could have Russian troops in the country,"" he says. Student Haider Ali arrived in Gatwick after his university in Ukraine told him to ""get out as soon as you can"" Foreigners living in Ukraine don't want to leave, Stuart says. ""We love Ukraine and we've built our lives, families, businesses here."" But he says: ""These things can go out of control very fast, we've got to be on the right side of the chaos. To think of a border with a million cars and panic happening would be disastrous."" Some Britons have already made it out of Ukraine, arriving back in the UK on Saturday, just hours after the Foreign Office issued its warning. At Gatwick, Haider Ali, a 21-year-old from Birmingham who was studying in Dnipro in central Ukraine, tells PA News his university advised international students to ""get out as soon as you can"" - so he booked a Â£210 one-way ticket. He says the Ukrainians are a ""laissez-faire"" people but in the last couple of days they have started to get worried. ""When that happens, alarm bells should be ringing."" But he says he hopes to return by June to continue his studies. Teacher Harry Lee sees no need to flee Kharkiv, 40 miles from the Russian border, just yet Meanwhile, in Kharkiv, just 40 miles from the border with Russia, Harry Lee is not planning to go anywhere - at least for now. He says: ""Life is continuing largely as normal. There's been no signs of any panic, there's been no signs of people stockpiling things. Whereas in England, toilet paper and water bottles would be out of stock, here life is continuing."" Harry, who is originally from Cambridge and works as a teacher in Ukraine's second-largest city, says he has a contingency plan if the situation worsens, intending to drive west or south-west into countries such as Moldova, Romania or Turkey. But for others, crossing the border isn't an option, even though they want to get out as soon as they can. Ben Garratt and his wife Alice moved to Kyiv from north London in December because they were having a baby through a surrogate. Now baby Raphael has arrived, but they need to provide proof of his British citizenship to get an emergency travel document, a more urgent alternative to a passport. Ben Garratt says it is ""frustrating"" to have to wait for travel documents amid the crisis ""It's getting frustrating because we're being told by the UK government to leave the country... and we still don't have the document we need,"" Ben tells the PA News agency. He says the passport office in Kyiv wants him to attend a two-hour interview on Wednesday, which seems ""bizarre"" amid the urgent warnings from governments around the world. Ben says: ""If we take the advice at face value, it means the UK and also the US government are worried that Russian action is imminent - that makes us want to get out.""

"Protesters tried to argue with police Police have started to clear a blockade of the main crossing between Canada and the United States. After days of protests by truckers against Covid rules at the Ambassador Bridge in Ontario, officers urged them to heed an injunction against the demonstration. The vital trade route links Windsor, Ontario, with Detroit, Michigan. Truckers' protests against Covid vaccine mandates are also ongoing at other border crossings and in Ottawa. The self-styled ""Freedom Convoy"" movement was started by Canadian truckers opposed to a vaccinate-or-quarantine order for drivers crossing the border. Friday's court order against the blockadewas filed by the city of Windsorand the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, which argued that it was losing as much as $50m ($39m; Â£29m) per day because of the convoy. Following the injunction, Windsor Police put out a statement to ""make demonstrators clearly aware that it is a criminal offence"" to block the border crossing. The police added that a criminal conviction could lead to the seizure of vehicles and the inability to enter the US. But hours later, crowds of people waving Canadian flags flouted the order and continued to occupy the bridge. While police had some initial success in clearing the road on Saturday, more supporters arrived as the day went on until they once again outnumbered the officers trying to move the crowds away. ""We urge all demonstrators to act lawfully [and] peacefully,"" police said in a statement. ""Commuters are still being asked to avoid the areas affected by the demonstrations at this time."" Is Trudeau losing his fight against truckers? Hundreds of other protesters continue to demonstrate in the centre of Ottawa, the nation's capital. Two other border crossings with the US are also being blocked by anti vaccine mandate protesters. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with US President Joe Biden about the border blockades on Friday. The week-long disruption to the bridge, which accounts for roughly 25% of US-Canada goods trade, rocked the car manufacturing industry. General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Honda plants have been forced to halt production and cancel work shifts due to parts shortages caused by the blockade. Analysis by Robin Levinson-King in Windsor, Ontario In the cold light of Saturday morning, police came in to break up the blockade at the Ambassador Bridge. Arriving in city buses, they created a flank along the north side of the protest, which had blocked several lanes of traffic, preventing people - and millions of dollars of trade - from reaching the US, which is just on the other side of the border. Wearing balaclavas to protect them from the bitter wind, with some carrying heavy weapons, the officers made it known that the party-protest, which had been going for almost a week, had come to an end. The protesters were not happy, but neither were they surprised that it was coming to an end. Some thanked the police and expressed their support for law enforcement, while one man cried ""You should be ashamed!"" ""They're gonna have to move us out. We'll be peaceful and we'll lock arms and show unity,"" said Dan, a protester who declined to give his last name to the BBC. ""If that's what they need to do, give me a ticket and I'll see you in court."" Slowly, and with the help of an armoured vehicle, police have been inching forward, encroaching on the blockade. Some have voluntarily driven away. Others began to break down the mess-hall tents. It will likely take a few hours to move the hundred or so vehicles - most of them pickups and SUVs, with a handful of heavy commercial lorries - to disperse. Speaking on Friday, Mr Trudeau urged the truckers ""to go home now"", saying their frustration with Covid measures had been ""heard"". ""If you join the protests because you are tired of Covid, you need to understand that you are breaking laws. The consequences are becoming more and more severe,"" he warned. ""You don't want to end up losing your licence, end up with a criminal record, which will impact your job, your livelihood, even your ability to travel internationally, including to the US."" He is due to meet with his advisors on an emergency committee known as the Incident Response Group on Saturday. But many of those protesting at the bridge said they would continue to demonstrate no matter the consequences. ""Bring it,"" one of those blocking the bridge, Chris Mayville,told Canadian broadcaster CBC News,external. ""Do you think I care? Do you think I care about a fine? I'm going to pay a fine? No. You think I care about their mandates? No. This needs to end."" Elsewhere, in Canada's financial capital Toronto, police braced for protests by expanding a cordon in the city centre. There were also tense scenes in France, where thousands ofpolice officers attempted to stopanti-restriction demonstrators from disrupting traffic in Paris.

"Dame Cressida arrives at New Scotland Yard the day after her resignation The resignation of Britain's most senior police officer comes after a series of crises has engulfed the Metropolitan Police. Why has it proved so difficult to clean up the toxic culture associated with the force? In full dress uniform, Dame Cressida Dick delivered her resignation speech on the balcony of New Scotland Yard, a slight break in her voice as she described the ""honour and privilege"" of leading the country's biggest police force. Her grim-faced aides appeared shocked by the speed of events. Inside the force, she is well-liked. She has defended ""my Met"", as she has called it, endlessly. But over her shoulder, on Thursday evening, the lights of London glittered - a city arguably less fond of ""its Met"", since she took over five years ago. She failed to win the friends outside, that came so easily inside her organisation. Charities representing women, the families of murder victims, and parts of the media turned against her. There were too many moments when the first woman to run the Metropolitan Police had had to apologise for its behaviour. Nine hours earlier, the commissioner hadn't been planning to resign. She told a radio phone-in that her staff backed her and even the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, had said he trusted her. That comment about the mayor seems to have brought him to a tipping point - along with new and horrifying disclosures about Charing Cross police station. His people contacted hers and made things clear. She no longer had his support. Her five years in charge started with the horrors of the 2017 terrorist attacks and the Grenfell Tower fire, and ends with the pandemic. Crime is up by 4% with 45% fewer cases solved. Knife crime fell as Covid struck, though there has been a recent series of teenage murders and there are concerns violent crime, Dame Cressida's priority, is rising again. But she's been brought down by crimes and bad attitudes within her own ranks. Racism, misogyny, bullying and incompetence. Rape, and in the chilling case of Sarah Everard, murder. The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick How can it be fixed? Over a long career, former Metropolitan Police detective Shabnam Chaudhri fought against ""the culture"", which for her included racist abuse. Speaking to the BBC the day after Dame Cressida's resignation, she described policing as a closed community. ""They get so comfortable in their own company,"" she says, ""that when new people come in, they get indoctrinated to that way of thinking."" It is a culture of ""corridor comments"". ""They disguise it as banter. There's a saying ""know your audience"". These guys know their audience."" Too often, she says, officers complaining about misconduct, or perceived to be ""using the race card"" are briefed against, even when they move teams. She should know. It happened to her, again and again. A constant drag on her career ambitions. The Metropolitan Police has a whistleblowing hotline. A channel for raising complaints about poor attitudes. But Ms Chaudhri said it was used to make false allegations against her, because she had spoken out. It is possible that a toxic culture at the Met was always there, but we couldn't see it as easily. A woman holds up placard at vigil to Sarah Everard at Clapham Common Things have changed. When officers arrest people, onlookers often start filming, their pictures shared instantly on social media. Footage from police body-worn cameras is sometimes made public during legal proceedings. And then there are messaging groups. ""WhatsApp leaves a footprint,"" Ms Chaudhri says. ""They think they're safe within a group. These people act like a pack of wolves and the only way they get exposed is because these messages come out in the investigation process."" Group messages provided crucial evidence for Operation Hotton, the investigation into abusive behaviour at Charing Cross police station. This case appears to have convinced the mayor that enough was enough. The investigation uncovered messages which were ""highly sexualised and/or violent and discriminatory, generally described as 'banter' by police officers"". They included: Messages about police officers attending a festival dressed as known sex offenders - sent within a WhatsApp group containing 17 police officers Numerous messages about rape within WhatsApp and Facebook chat groups Homophobic comments Use of words that could be considered misogynist, racist, or constituting disability discrimination The comments were claimed to be a ""joke or game, or just a 'misunderstanding',"" an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct concluded. There are a number of features of ""The Job"" which make this sort of behaviour more likely, according to a senior figure in policing who spoke on condition of anonymity. It starts at entry level. ""They say: 'He's going to be a good officer so we'll knock the rough edges off him.' ""But a leopard doesn't change his spots, and then you've got a problem for 30 years."" Most officers join in their early 20s and retire at 50. ""Probationary constable misbehaviour needs to be dealt with early on,"" he says. Gaps in vetting are one possible reason why the Met police officer Wayne Couzens' interest in extreme pornography and drug abuse were not discovered. In his case, according to the ""banter"", his nickname was ""the rapist"". He was one. And a killer. In one of the Met's many apologies, it said ""vetting is a snapshot in time and, unfortunately can never 100% guarantee an individual's integrity"". Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary is reviewing the vetting of officers, and will report later in the year. In the Met, experience is highly valued. The force has major investigation teams capable of solving complex cases and made up of officers respected for what they've done in the past. Most of them do not contribute to the toxic culture which is now damaging trust in the force. But there's a concern that as careers progress in some teams, bad attitudes become entrenched. Leroy Logan, a retired superintendent, says police ""middle-managers"" are failing to tackle those views. Cressida Dick on the day of her resignation The sergeants and the inspectors should be the ""checks and balances"" in the organisation, he says. ""It's not being Mr or Ms Popular. You have to have the ethical leadership to hold people to account, which they don't like. But it's what you're supposed to do."" Shabnam Chaudhri puts it another way. ""We need the good officers to call out the bad ones."" She believes this goes right to the top and is among those who believe Dame Cressida Dick was too defensive of the Met, and not focused enough on communicating the depth of its cultural issues. The Met's answer to all of this is Baroness Louise Casey. She is a respected public policy trouble-shooter, who has advised governments on everything from homelessness and families in crisis, to violence during the Euros at Wembley Stadium in 2021. Now she's been brought in by the Met to hunt down bad attitudes within its ranks, and stamp them out. But she has barely started. The BBC has been told she has only been able to begin work at New Scotland Yard this week because of recent ill-health. One issue she is expected to deal with early on is that it can be difficult to get rid of bad officers. Police employment rights are well protected, partly because as police officers they are not allowed to go on strike. This means everything is dealt with formally, with a process akin to a criminal investigation. While in some cases the misconduct in question is criminal, the complexity of the process means there can be a tendency not to make complaints. Some cases go to the Independent Office for Police Conduct and take months to resolve. Baroness Louise Casey will be under pressure to speed things up. But it could be one of her toughest assignments. Ms Chaudhri believes ""the culture"" will try to block her at every turn. We have been told that some of Baroness Casey's ideas were included in a plan sent to mayor Sadiq Khan to persuade him not to move against the commissioner. A plan which was rejected. This leaves the Met in a difficult position. Scotland Yard sources say Baroness Casey's work is due to continue up until Christmas. Even that sounds like a small window for changing the culture of a huge organisation. The pressure is going to grow. A police complaints investigation into the case of Bianca Williams, a black athlete and her partner pulled from their car and handcuffed by the police, is due soon. In addition, three Met police officers are currently facing criminal prosecutions: two for rape, one for unauthorised meetings with children. The ""bad 'uns"", as Dame Cressida Dick controversially described them, are not just damaging those they work with. The harm they do to trust between people and the police makes the job of decent officers more difficult. And the taint spreads beyond London. The Met is supposed to be a totemic police force. Scotland Yard, known around the world. It sets standards for smaller forces. Its officers do specialist roles such as protecting the royals, or tracking terrorists. The scandal, and the resignation of Dame Cressida Dick, have been deeply damaging. A former officer, respected in the ex-police community, spent the day after the resignation taking the temperature among his contacts within police forces. By the evening, he had sent a text message: ""All looking to leave policing except the last few who are pension trapped. This has really damaged morale.""

"Stormont became home to the ""new Northern Ireland Assembly"" a generation ago Since devolution as we know it today began in Northern Ireland 22 years ago, Stormont has been without a functioning government for 35% of its lifespan. A series of resignations, suspensions and stand-offs have interrupted power-sharing, sometimes for years at a time. Its record of dysfunction may be about to get even worse as Stormontlost both of its leaders earlier this month. Without its first and deputy first ministers in place, much of Stormont's decision-making power grinds to a halt. BBC News NI looks back at the stop-start nature of Stormont and the rows that have brought the house down. The current Northern Ireland Assembly was established in 1998 as a result of the Good Friday Agreement, but government ministers were not appointed until the following year. Devolution took shape as Northern Ireland emerged from decades of violence known as the Troubles and there were serious teething problems as unionists and nationalists got to grips with sharing power. Thefirst locally-elected ministers took charge on 2 December 1999,external, which was just over 22 years and two months ago, (or 8,108 calendar days to be precise). But from the outset, the new government was beset by battles over when the IRA would give up its weapons, a controversy which almost strangled it at birth. Northern Ireland's first power-sharing executive held its first meeting on 2 December 1999, but without its DUP ministers Stormont is usually governed by a team of 10 locally-elected ministers who are collectively known asthe Northern Ireland Executive. That executive must be led jointly by a first minister from Northern Ireland's biggest political party and a deputy first minister from its second largest party. However,Paul Givan from the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) resigned as first minister on 4 Februaryin protest over post-Brexit trading arrangements. Under Stormont's power-sharing rules, his resignation meant Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill automatically lost her position as deputy first minister. The other eight ministers are still working in their own departments, but they cannot meet as an executive in the absence of a first and deputy first minister. More importantly, executive ministers cannot take any major new decisions without the two leaders. It has causedcomplications for lifting coronavirus restrictionsand means that the budget for the next three years cannot be approved, and that hasfar-reaching implications for the health service. Michelle O'Neill lost her position as deputy first minister when Paul Givan resigned No, not this time.  Its government departments are still running and assembly members are continuing to debate and pass legislation. However, the loss of the first and deputy first ministers means the executive is no longer functioning. This week, we learned that Stormont will be allowed to stagger on in this manner for the next three months, until its next election which is expected on 5 May. That is due tonew legislation passed at Westminster this week aimed at stabilising power-sharing, which allows the assembly to continue without an executive for at least six months Suspension and a return to direct rule from Westminster are seen as a last resort and in more recent years, various procedures have been used to avoid complete collapse. After the last election in 2017, it took nearly three years to form a government. The 90 newly-elected assembly members kept their seats and most of their salaries, but could not pass laws or hold debates during that period. With the civil service running public services in the absence of an executive,legislation was passed in 2018 to allow civil servants more flexibility to take decisionswithout ministers. Power-sharing returned to Stormont on 11 January 2020 after a three-year gap Tactical resignations at the very top of Stormont have been used since the very early days of devolution. Parties have taken advantage of a previous rule which stipulated that when Stormont's leaders quit and were not replaced, there would be a six-week deadline before the assembly would be dissolved for a fresh election. But it is not just leaders who can quit or threaten to quit. At one stage in 2015, DUP ministers were resigning and being reappointed every week, in a tactic which Sinn FÃ©in criticised as aversion of the Hokey Cokey.

More importantly, executive ministers cannot take any major new decisions without the two leaders. It has causedcomplications for lifting coronavirus restrictionsand means that the budget for the next three years cannot be approved, and that hasfar-reaching implications for the health service. Michelle O'Neill lost her position as deputy first minister when Paul Givan resigned No, not this time.  Its government departments are still running and assembly members are continuing to debate and pass legislation. However, the loss of the first and deputy first ministers means the executive is no longer functioning. This week, we learned that Stormont will be allowed to stagger on in this manner for the next three months, until its next election which is expected on 5 May. That is due tonew legislation passed at Westminster this week aimed at stabilising power-sharing, which allows the assembly to continue without an executive for at least six months Suspension and a return to direct rule from Westminster are seen as a last resort and in more recent years, various procedures have been used to avoid complete collapse. After the last election in 2017, it took nearly three years to form a government. The 90 newly-elected assembly members kept their seats and most of their salaries, but could not pass laws or hold debates during that period. With the civil service running public services in the absence of an executive,legislation was passed in 2018 to allow civil servants more flexibility to take decisionswithout ministers. Power-sharing returned to Stormont on 11 January 2020 after a three-year gap Tactical resignations at the very top of Stormont have been used since the very early days of devolution. Parties have taken advantage of a previous rule which stipulated that when Stormont's leaders quit and were not replaced, there would be a six-week deadline before the assembly would be dissolved for a fresh election. But it is not just leaders who can quit or threaten to quit. At one stage in 2015, DUP ministers were resigning and being reappointed every week, in a tactic which Sinn FÃ©in criticised as aversion of the Hokey Cokey.

"Jessica Morgan said she was ""never going to be the full-time mum type"" For Jessica Morgan, returning to work soon after giving birth was never in doubt. ""I was never going to be the full-time mum type,"" she says. ""I haven't got the personality or patience, I think, for that."" But she faced a stigma for choosing work over a longer period of maternity leave, and found she was not alone. Cassandra Bodington, a self-employed single mum, said taking more than two weeks off was simply not an option. Ms Bodington, a business coach from Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, was back on her first client calls 14 days after her daughter was born. The two met after Ms Morgan posted about her experience on social media. They became friends and have now launched a podcast in which they talk openly about their experiences. ""It was a mixture of emotions... I needed to get my head back into work,"" 39-year-old Ms Bodington said. ""I needed that anchor."" Taking a full year of maternity leave was not an option: ""I had to make that choice to keep a roof over my child's head. I was 35, I didn't want to move back in with my parents."" Doctor on maternity leave helped with cave rescue No babies allowed in Commons, MP told 'Raw and inspiring': Tales of pandemic motherhood As she is self-employed, Ms Bodington was entitled to Â£151.97 per week in maternity allowance, but with no other income to supplement that, she said the amount was ""not liveable"". The high childcare costs were ""tough"", she added, but the help was important to her. Her daughter started attending nursery one day a week when she was 12 weeks. Average UK two-earner couples spend more than 20% of their income on childcare, one of the highest shares among Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, second only to Switzerland. Cassandra and baby Elodie Ms Bodington said it felt like ""a cloud had lifted"" when her daughter Elodie started nursery. ""I didn't feel any guilt about putting her in childcare at all... I still breastfed her until she was 10 months."" It allowed her to see clients and keep her business going, expressing milk between meetings when Elodie was in nursery. While Ms Morgan said taking more time out would have meant leaving her career behind and starting from scratch after maternity leave. The financial pressure was compounded by feelings of guilt both women experienced. ""What I didn't plan for was the hormonal rollercoaster. You just can't help but feel guilty,"" Ms Morgan said. ""I felt guilt when I was working and when I wasn't."" People judged her, Ms Morgan said, telling her it was a time she should treasure. ""All it did was tear me up inside, and there was a lot of guilt around it."" ""It comes from that word 'should'. You should breastfeed. You should sleep when the baby sleeps. Am I a bad mother going to my computer to see if work has come in? It was a continuous battle with my brain."" Her husband took shared parental leave after the birth of their first child, and became the main carer for their children after the birth of their second. That allowed them to build a business together - they now run a media agency. Cassandra on her first client call when Elodie was 14 days old ""People from the outside thought we had it easy, but we took a huge risk."" Both women wish they had been able to be more proud of and comfortable with the decisions they took. Nor do they feel their children have missed out. ""We're always measuring ourselves against other people. But we just have to do what's right for us,"" Ms Bodington said. New mothers are entitled to 52 weeks of maternity leave They must take at least two weeks after the baby is born, or four weeks if they are a factory worker The earliest leave can be taken is 11 weeks before the expected week of childbirth, unless the baby is born early Mothers are eligible to be paid for six weeks at 90% of their average weekly earnings and 33 weeks at Â£151.97 per week or 90% of their average weekly earnings (if lower) Self-employed people can apply for maternity allowance, which is currently Â£151.97 per week They can also take Shared Paternity Leave (SPL), where a mother and father can share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay between them Source:Gov.uk,external HAYLEY PEARCE PODCAST :Tackling the issues that make your group chats go off I WAS THERE:Real life experiences from major moments Women not supported to become leaders, says boss Little change in gender pay gap, study finds No parental leave âa barrierâ to local politics Women warned home working may harm their careers Maternity pay and leave - GOV.UK Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"The price of pasta, tinned tomatoes and strawberry jam jumped last year as the cost of supermarket staples rose, new figures for the BBC suggest. Overall, the price of a basket filled with 15 standard food items rose by Â£1.32, or 8%, in just one year. Changes in the average cost of the food items at Asda, Morrisons, Sainsbury's and Tesco were tracked by retail research firm Assosia. Some items fell in price, with carrots and mild cheddar seeing small declines. The same basket of food made up of items from the cheaper ""value"" ranges at the supermarkets recorded an overall fall in price, down 45p, or 4%. But within that, items such as pasta and vanilla ice cream saw rises of more than 6%. Other items the firm tracked in the new research for BBC News included tortilla chips, fish fingers, honey, blueberries, carrots and lemons. Although official figures suggest that the overall cost of living increased by 5.4% in the year to December, this number - known as the inflation rate - can mask some steep rises seen at the tills, especially on everyday items. There are many factors that can make it difficult to track how prices are changing for households, such as promotions at supermarkets or a lack of availability of certain products. Asda, for example, recentlypledged to stock its budget ranges in all of its 581 supermarketsand online after complaints from anti-poverty campaigner Jack Monroe. ""Looking at food prices is a bit of a minefield"", says Kay Staniland, director at Assosia.  Her company selected a snapshot of popular products that were comparable across the value and standard ranges. ""I think the figures show that retailers are trying to avoid the biggest increases to value lines as much as possible. But these value lines do make up a small part of total ranges. The standard mid-tier range is where the largest volume of sales come from,"" she says. Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer magazine, also tracks a weekly basket of goods and how prices differ across the supermarket aisles.  He says ""we're now in a 'once in a generation' moment for food inflation in the UK"". ""We've not seen anything like this since the financial crash in 2008. And this is just the start. It's going to go on for two or two and a half years, probably as various costs and problems filter through into the system."" Inflation is everywhere in the food supply chain, he says, from rising energy and labour costs to raw materials and packaging. Marmite maker set to raise prices as costs soar âHow can we afford anything with bills this high?â Why are prices rising so quickly? The supermarkets are now grappling with how much of these costs to pass on. ""The food market is incredibly competitive and if you put your prices up ahead of the competition, the shopper will notice.  Right now, more than ever, price is the major focus for the shopper. And they will vote with their feet,"" he says. Shoppers such as Fernanda Almeida have already been feeling the pinch, though. Fernanda Almeida says she now cooks meals from scratch to save money She lives with her partner in Worcester and the pair used to purchase ready-meals, or pots of instant porridge, which he could take along to his military barracks where cooking space is limited. But after the shopping bill went up by about Â£20 a week, they introduced some changes. ""Our shopping has changed completely... we're definitely cooking from scratch a lot more now because it just works out cheaper,"" Fernanda says. She says she feels ""worried"". ""I've gone from someone who has a budget per month but goes to the shop without a list, picks up things that I fancy eating, to planning each meal, checking items off against the list."" She's noticed that tinned items in particular have gone up in price and it can often be cheaper to buy individual items for recipes in larger supermarkets, even in comparison with discount stores like Aldi or Lidl. Vimbai Gwata-St John in Bexley has seen her food shop go up by about Â£20 a week, too. Vimbai Gwata-St John: ""The one thing you can't compromise on is food"" As a mum to an 18-week-old baby with food intolerances she has had to chop and change what they are buying from week to week. She says she used to follow a budget strictly until she became ill during her pregnancy. ""Because of that, we didn't have time or ability to track our expenses, we just bought what we needed out of desperation because of the other problems at that point in our lives."" Now she is trying to get the budget back on track and is looking at couponing or starting to buy items such as toilet paper or nappies in bulk. Although prices are going up across the board, she says: ""The one thing you can't compromise on is food."" How supermarkets manage their own inflationary pressures will have consequences for millions of households. And the least well-off, which spend a bigger share of income on essentials such as food and energy, are less able to absorb soaring prices in the aisles. The big four supermarket chains have learned from the mistakes they made in 2008, when they put prices up. Aldi and Lidl swooped, stealing customers and market share. Their businesses have since doubled in size and are still opening new stores. ""It's a real dog-eat-dog situation,"" says Adam Leyland. ""The battleground is value. And they are determined to stop them (the discounters) making further grounds. For instance, Tesco and Sainsbury's are price-matching Aldi. Cost cutting, shrinkflation - reducing the size of a product but not the price - and cutting back on expensive ingredients are just some of the tactics that retailers are using to mitigate the rising cost of groceries. But the trend is clear. Assosia recorded more than 17,000 price increases across the main supermarkets last month, more than double the number in the same month last year, and across every category. ""Inflation is everywhere"" says Mr Leyland. And he agrees withthe recent warning from John Allan, the chairman of Tesco, that the worst is yet to come.

Authorities have deployed more than 7,000 officers over the next three days in a bid to stop the demonstrators. Despite those efforts, some vehicles managed to arrive at the Arc de Triomphe in the city, and tear gas was fired at demonstrators on the nearby Champs-ÃlysÃ©es avenue. The groups were inspired by the self-styled Canadian ""Freedom Convoy""which has disrupted tradeon the US border and occupied streets in Ottawa. Similar demonstrations have started to spread around the world. Austria and Belgium have banned such convoys from entering their capitals, with similar demonstrations also emerging in Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. On Saturday, police in Paris said they had intercepted hundreds of vehicles heading into the city.Two were allegedly carrying knives,external, hammers and petrol canisters, andfive were allegedly carrying slingshots,external. A video posted online by a journalist and shared by the police showed officers halting lines of vehicles on the city's ring road. Police close to the Arc de Triomphe were seen diverting camper vans and other vehicles away from the area. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Demonstrators who oppose France's Covid pass, which requires people to show proof of vaccination before entering public venues, want to gather and blockade the capital across the weekend - suggesting such scenes may be repeated Sunday. Convoys have organised online and appear to come from various political and ideological backgrounds, making it difficult to estimate how many vehicles might arrive in Paris each day. They have also drawn in others angry at rising prices in France. Some plan to continue on to Brussels, home of many European Union institutions, for further demonstrations on Monday. City officials there have also banned the planned demonstration. A protester by the Arc de Triomphe Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Friday that authorities would be ""very firm"" if the group tried to block the French capital. ""The right to demonstrate and to have an opinion are a constitutionally guaranteed right in our republic and in our democracy. The right to block others or prevent coming and going is not,""he told France 2,external. Mr Castex also objected to the demonstrators calling themselves a ""Freedom Convoy"". The word freedom should not be associated with ""virulent attacks against vaccination"", he said, because freedom is not ""contaminating others"". The convoys consisting overall of some several hundred cars and camper-vans spent the night at points outside Paris, and from early this morning began driving into the city centre - their aim, apparently, to block the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es. Police have set up checkpoints at exits from the Paris ring road, and they're out in force across the capital, stopping cars that look like they're occupied by protesters. By midday they'd issued around 300 fines. Two months ahead of presidential elections the government is anxious to avoid any scene reminiscent of the sometimes violent yellow-vest protests of three years ago. The protest movement is ostensibly about Covid restrictions, in imitation of the so-called Freedom Convoys in Canada, but many of the participants also proclaim their allegiance to the yellow-vests. Some intend to proceed to Brussels on Sunday. France's protesters were inspired by the blockade in Canada, which has closed a crossing that sees $1.7bn (Â£1.2bn) of daily trade between Canada and the US. Truckers there, objecting to a federal Covid vaccine mandate for those crossing the border into Canada, have occupied the Ambassador Bridge and camped on the streets of the capital Ottawa for days. A court order ordering them to leave the bridge came into effect at 19:00 local time (midnight GMT) on Friday. Copycat protests have also emerged elsewhere. Some 10,000 protesters opposed to vaccine mandates arrived at Parliament House in the Australian capital Canberra on Saturday,local media reported,external, while police in New Zealand's capital Wellington arrested more than 100 people on Thursday who blocked roads in the city.

"Protesters are still occupying a main crossing at Canada's border with the United States, despite a court ruling ordering them to leave. The injunction came into effect at 19:00 local time (midnight GMT) on Friday to end days of protests. Truckers are blockading Ambassador Bridge, a vital trade link between Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan. Truckers' protests against Covid restrictions are also ongoing at other border crossings and in Ottawa. The injunction was filed by the city of Windsor and the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, which argued that they were losing as much as $50m ($39m; Â£29m) per day because of the convoy. Following the court order, Windsor Police put out a statement to ""make demonstrators clearly aware that it is a criminal offence"" to block the border crossing. The police added that a criminal conviction could lead to the seizure of vehicles and the inability to enter the US. But hours later, crowds of people waving Canadian flags flouted the order and continued to occupy the bridge. Is Trudeau losing his fight against truckers? Hundreds of other protesters continue to demonstrate in the centre of Ottawa, the nation's capital. Two other border crossings with the US are also being blocked by anti-vaccine mandate protesters. On Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke with US President Joe Biden about the border blockades. The pair discussed their ""shared challenges at the border"", Mr Trudeau said, with the prime minister promising quick action to resume trade. Mr Trudeau added that he and Mr Biden also discussed US phone calls that have flooded police emergency call centres in Canada, and the donations and assistance that protesters are getting from American citizens. By Robin Levinson-King, BBC News, Windsor Less than an hour before the injunction took effect on Friday, the protesters at the Ambassador Bridge had a vote. Do they obey the court order to vacate the roads? Or do they keep their trucks and automobiles in park, and stand their ground? The vote - by a resounding cry of ""Freedom!"" - was clear: they're not going anywhere. That leaves the ball in law enforcement's court. As of 21:00 local time, no arrests had been made and no fines issued. The blockade has cost millions of dollars in lost trade each day; during the court proceedings, representatives from the automotive industry, who have several plants in the area and rely on shipping parts back and forth across the border, estimated the Windsor blockade had cost them about C$600m since it began. The crowd had grown since the afternoon and the atmosphere grew merrier - pop music blared on the speakers, while a spluttering traffic light provided an almost disco-like atmosphere. The question is, when will the party end? Addressing Canadians on Friday, Mr Trudeau said: ""If you join the protests because you are tired of Covid you need to understand that you are breaking laws. The consequences are becoming more and more severe. ""You don't want to end up losing your licence, end up with a criminal record, which will impact your job, your livelihood, even your ability to travel internationally, including to the US. ""We've heard your frustration with Covid, with the measures that are there to keep people safe. We've heard you. It's time to go home now."" The Liberal leader added that ""we are a long way from ever having to call in the military, although of course we have to be ready for any eventuality"". Mr Trudeau's rhetoric comes a day after US officials spoke to their Canadian counterparts to urge them to use their federal powers to end the ""Freedom Convoy"" protests. Also on Friday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the protests were illegal as he declared a state of emergency for the province. The order increases the penalty for blocking crucial infrastructure, making an offence punishable by up to a year in jail and C$100,000 in fines. Ahead of the injunction on Friday, Windsor Mayor Drew Dilkens told CNN the next step was now to ask the protesters to leave. If they refuse, ""one by one we'll start towing the cars if required"", he said. ""All of us respect that the hallmark of our respective democracies is that we have the right to express ourselves, to protest and to demonstrate, that's OK,"" Mr Dilkens said. ""What's not OK is deciding to choke off the busiest commercial border crossing between our two nations."" The week-long disruption to the bridge, which accounts for roughly 25% of US-Canada annual trade, has rocked the car manufacturing industry. General Motors, Ford, Toyota and Honda plants have been forced to halt production and cancel work shifts due to parts shortages caused by the blockade. Ford, the second largest car maker in the US, said on Friday it was temporarily closing production at a plant in Ohio and warned of widespread problems for both nations should the protests continue. The protest has sparked similar convoys in Australia, New Zealand and France. On Friday, protesters drove around Paris in an effort to close the capital, despite a police ban. The US Department of Homeland Security has warned that a convoy may depart from California this weekend, bound for Washington DC.
