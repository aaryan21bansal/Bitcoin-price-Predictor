"This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Alternative Brexit backstop ""can be done"" Home Secretary Sajid Javid has said the UK would remain ""one of the safest countries in the world"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that there would be a ""change in capability"" in terms of access to certain security databases. He also said a general election was the ""last thing this country needs"". His comments on security come after the Met's counter-terrorism chief said no deal would be ""very bad"" for policing. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday, 29 March, when the two-year time limit on withdrawal negotiations enforced by the Article 50 process expires. Prime Minister Theresa May has saidshe is ""determined"" to deliver Brexit on time, ahead of talks on the Irish backstop. The backstop forms part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated by the UK and EU and is aimed at keeping the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic open after Brexit. But Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told RTE Radio that it was ""very frustrating"" the UK government seemed to be considering alternative arrangements that had ""already been rejected"". Meanwhile, Nissan has confirmed that the new X-Trail originally planned for its Sunderland plantwill instead be made in Japan, saying continued Brexit uncertainty is not helping firms like it to ""plan for the future"". Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: All you need to know How ready is UK for a no-deal Brexit? Far-right groups 'could exploit Brexit' Mr Javid said he wants to leave with a deal on 29 March, but ""it makes sense to plan for all contingencies, that of course includes no deal planning"". ""It is true if we have a no deal situation there will be certain capabilities that we rely on for security with the EU, such as databases, arrest warrants... that will change,"" he said. ""There are capabilities we would want to keep, but they require co-operation with the EU and I have to plan on the basis that in a no deal scenario the EU will no longer allow us to access those capabilities."" He said that most of those capabilities began in 2015, saying: ""We were a safe country then and we'd be a very safe country in a no deal scenario."" ""I want a deal... but even in a no deal scenario we would continue to be one of the safest countries in the world."" Last month, the Met's Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu told the BBC the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was ""incredibly concerning"" for police operations. Echoing comments from Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick in December, he said the UK and Europe would be in a ""very bad place"" if police could not exchange data or biometrics on suspected criminals and terrorists. Mr Basu said the Met was working on contingency arrangements with police forces and agencies in Europe. Mr Javid also dismissed speculation about a summer general election, saying that the Conservatives were only preparing for local elections in May. ""I think the last thing this country needs is a general election,"" he said. ""I think the people will never forgive us for it, what they want is this Parliament to deliver Brexit in an orderly way, that is what they are looking for."" The next general election is due in 2022. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalthe prime minister said she would return to Brussels with a ""fresh mandate, new ideas and a renewed determination"", ahead of talks on the Irish backstop. MPs have voted to seek an ""alternative arrangement"" to guarantee the Northern Ireland border stays open after Brexit. She insisted the departure date will not change, saying she would ""deliver Brexit on time"". And she said she rejected the suggestion ""that seeking alternative arrangements for the backstop constituted 'ripping up the Good Friday Agreement'"". The prime minister added that MPs wanted the government to go back to Brussels to renegotiate the deal after the Commons voted in favour of Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady's amendment on Tuesday that called for ""alternative arrangements"" to be found. Please upgrade your browser Mr Javid said an alternative arrangement to the Irish backstop ""can be done"" using ""existing technology"". He said: ""I asked Border Force months ago to advise me to look at what alternative arrangements are possible and they've shown me quite clearly you can have no hard border on the island of Ireland and you can use existing technology - that is perfectly possible. ""The only thing that's missing is a bit of good will on the EU side."" And International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it was ""irresponsible"" for the EU and the Irish Republic to say they will not discuss changing the backstop in the withdrawal agreement. He told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""For the Irish it's even more important than for most to talk to us for alternative ways of achieving a no hard border."" He said a no-deal Brexit would have an impact on the EU's economy, saying: ""Are they really saying they'd rather be in a no deal position? It's not a responsible position to take."" But Mr Varadkar told RTE Radio it was ""very frustrating"" the UK government was ""going back to idea of technology"". He said the EU had already ""examined all of that"" in terms of how other borders operate. He himself had been to look at the US-Canada border, he said, adding: ""Yes, there is lots of technology but it's a hard border."" By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The backstop is an ""insurance policy"" - designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Under the current Brexit deal, the 310-mile Irish border would become the only land border between the EU and the UK. This would probably mean checks on goods crossing it, unless both sides could reach a comprehensive trade deal. If such an agreement could not be reached, then to avoid those checks and border posts or other infrastructure, the backstop would come into force. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU and leave Northern Ireland effectively in the EU's single market for goods. A number of MPs fear the UK could be ""trapped"" in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals on goods with the rest of the world. Read more: Could technology solve the Irish border problem? The EU has repeatedly said that there would be no renegotiation. Speaking at the European Parliament last week, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the backstop was a ""realistic solution"" to preventing a hard border. DUP leader Arlene Foster told the BBC she was hopeful of finding alternatives to the backstop Arlene Foster - leader of the DUP, the party that props up Mrs May's government - told the BBC she was hopeful of finding alternatives to the backstop but it depended on the ""willingness"" of the Irish government. Foster hopeful of backstop changes Meanwhile, some Conservative backbench MPs, including senior Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker, have said they still have other issues with the Brexit deal. Mr Baker, deputy chairman of the Eurosceptic group the European Research Group (ERG), warned there was ""trouble ahead"" for the prime minister. In response to Mrs May's article,he tweeted,external: ""Leave-backing MPs voted to support alternative arrangements in NI but with grave misgivings about the whole agreement.

"Tory MPs Iain Duncan Smith, Nicky Morgan and Steve Baker are all in the meeting at the Cabinet Office Tory MPs have met the government to discuss alternative arrangements to the proposed Irish border ""backstop"", as three days of talks begin. The Alternative Arrangements Working Group, with Leave and Remain MPs, met for the first time after the Commons voted to find another way of avoiding the return of Irish border checks. A government spokesman said the talks had been ""detailed and constructive"". But EU leaders have continued to rule out making changes to the backstop. The Irish PM Leo Varadkar told RTE radio the UK was reviewing ideas that had ""already been rejected"", and it was ""very frustrating"" that the UK government was ""going back to the idea of technology"". Brexit: A really simple guide Katya Adler: EU digs heels in over Brexit deal How ready is UK for a no-deal Brexit? Brexit: All you need to know Is Labour softening on freedom of movement? But German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the EU would listen to proposals to solve the Irish border ""riddle"", although they needed to hear how the UK wanted to do it. The backstop is an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after Brexit. Number 10 said the working group of Conservative MPs was set up following ""significant support"" for the so-called ""Malthouse Compromise"" - named after housing minister Kit Malthouse who encouraged talks between different groups of MPs. Engineered by both Leavers and Remainers, the proposal includes extending the transition period for a year until the end of 2021 and protecting EU citizens' rights, instead of using the backstop. Please upgrade your browser Members of the working group include Conservative MPs Steve Baker, Marcus Fysh, Owen Paterson, Damian Green and Nicky Morgan. The group will hold regular meetings with Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, as well as senior government officials from HMRC, Cabinet Office Europe Unit and Number 10. Mr Fysh said the group had spoken to the EU and it was ""very open"" to the proposals, adding that they were not based on new technology. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said the group had explored the proposal ""in detail"" on the first day of talks. The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said the government's willingness to provide civil service support to this group of Conservative MPs was an indication of how seriously Downing Street was treating their idea. The backstop insurance policy would kick in if, after almost two years after Brexit, the two sides had not reached a trade agreement with one another that avoided the need for physical border checks. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU and leave Northern Ireland effectively in the EU's single market for goods. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Critics fear the UK could be ""trapped"" in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals on goods with the rest of the world. Unionists also fear it would drive a wedge between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But by changing the backstop, the PM could win support. Ex-Northern Ireland first minister Lord Trimble has said he is planning to take the government to court over the Brexit deal, claiming the Northern Ireland protocol - which includes the backstop - breaches the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Mrs May will visit Northern Ireland on Tuesday to deliver a speech on Brexit and meet business leaders. What are the new ideas for the Irish backstop? Read more: Could technology solve the Irish border problem? Alternatives to the backstop that the prime minister has said she wants to discuss with EU leaders include: a ""trusted trader"" scheme to avoid physical checks on goods flowing through the border ""mutual recognition"" of rules with the EU ""technological"" solutions This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Alternative Brexit backstop ""can be done"" Mr Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that an alternative arrangement to the Irish backstop ""can be done"" using ""existing technology"".

UK 'still safe in no-deal Brexit' - Javid Sheep farmers' post-Brexit tariff fears Customs checks simplified for no-deal Brexit The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, when the two-year time limit on withdrawal negotiations enforced by the Article 50 process expires. Theresa May has said she is ""determined"" to deliver Brexit on time, but a number of cabinet ministers have indicated they would be willing to agree to a short extension to finalise legislation for Brexit. However, a plan to delay Brexit for up to nine months to prevent a no deal - put forward by Labour MP Yvette Cooper - was voted down by Parliament. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Kier Starmer said he could not see Mrs May negotiating an alternative to the backstop at this late stage, saying the prime minister had effectively ""run down the clock"". Meanwhile, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said contingency plans for Britain's departure from the EU with no deal were ""genuinely astonishing"",in a speech in the US. She warned of food shortages and stockpiling of medicine amid a ""real and growing risk"" of a no deal scenario. Numerous politicians have shut down the idea of looking at the backstop again, saying there was no desire to re-open negotiations on the withdrawal agreement in Brussels. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said the EU was not looking for a substitute solution, because they say they've already investigated every other option that exists and none has the same effect as the backstop. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said there was ""full agreement"" that the withdrawal agreement ""cannot be reopened"". Allow Twitter content?

Irish Deputy Prime Minister Simon Coveney said the withdrawal agreement rejected by MPs already allowed the EU and UK to work on alternative arrangements for the backstop. He added: ""What Ireland is being asked to do by some in Westminster is to essentially do away with an agreed solution between the UK government and EU negotiators and to replace it with wishful thinking and I think that's a very unreasonable request to ask the Irish government to be flexible on."" Speaking during a trip to Japan, German Chancellor Mrs Merkel said: ""To solve this riddle, you have to be creative and you have to listen to one another. ""We can have those conversations... But we must hear from Great Britain how they want to do it."" Labour's Hilary Benn met the Secretary General of the European Commission, Martin Selmayr, in Brussels.

But Mr Selmayr later tweeted,externalthat when asked if such an assurance would help, the response from MPs was ""inconclusive"". He added: ""The meeting confirmed that the EU did well to start its no deal preparations in December 2017.""

By Katya Adler, BBC Europe editor So. how open does the EU seem almost a week on from parliament narrowly voting in favour of an amendment to find alternatives to the backstop guarantee to keep the Irish border open after Brexit? After all, with every passing day as we've heard, again and again and again, the clock is ticking towards an increased chance of a no-deal Brexit with all the costs and chaos that could involve. Well, if I were to speak in weather forecast terms, I might describe current EU attitudes as frosty with a chance of ice. If Theresa May comes to Brussels later this week, she will be received politely and listened to attentively. But if her EU ask remains centred around getting a time limit to, or allowing the UK a unilateral get-out mechanism from, the Irish border backstop or if she pushes again for pure technology as a means of avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland, then the likelihood of her being sent home empty-handed - or as good as - is very high indeed.

She said he was a ""role model"" due to his work on financial literacy programs with underprivileged youth. By Kameron Virk, BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat reporter in Atlanta Having just released a hugely popular album that's been praised for its introspection, storytelling, and maturity, 21 Savage is at the peak of his career. Atlanta is arguably the centre of hip-hop in the US and, by extension, the world. He's considered one of the city's greatest - and Atlanta through and through. The rapper is known in the city as a person who frequently donates to charitable causes. He launched his own campaign promoting financial literacy in children on the Ellen show. His raps have mostly painted pictures of a violent upbringing in Atlanta surrounded by drugs and guns, something which up until now nobody had questioned. But his arrest by ICE and links to the UK have definitely left people in the city confused. A fan in Atlanta told the BBC he was treating the details of Savage 21's case with scepticism: ""I find that very hard to believe that he moved from England on his own to Atlanta."" ""He's an icon for here,"" said another fan in the state of Georgia's capital. ""He's making great music. We're losing someone big."" 21 Savage performed onstage during Bud Light Super Bowl Music Fest There are 10.6 million undocumented immigrants in the US, according to the Center for Migration Studies. That represents 3.25% of the US population. Although President Donald Trump has blamed the southern border for illegal immigration, most actually arises because people overstay their visas (tourist or other temporary permits). More than 700,000 people who entered the US legally overstayed their expected departure date in 2018, according to the Department of Homeland Security. In the same year, some 396,000 people were held in immigration detention, and some 256,000 people were deported by authorities. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played The Pope was met with flowers and drums Pope Francis has arrived in the United Arab Emirates  for the first ever visit by a pontiff to the Arabian peninsula. He landed in Abu Dhabi where he was greeted by Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The Pope will take part in an interfaith conference on Monday and on Tuesday hold Mass in which 120,000 people are expected to attend. Before leaving he expressed concern about the war in Yemen, in which the UAE is engaged. ""The population [in Yemen] is exhausted by the lengthy conflict and a great many children are suffering from hunger, but cannot access food depots,"" the Pope said. Profile: Pope Francis United Arab Emirates profile ""The cry of these children and their parents rises up to God,"" he said. It is not clear whether the Pope plans to raise the issue in public or in private while visiting the UAE. The UAE is involved in Yemen as part of a Saudi-led coalition. The Pope was welcomed by Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince The UAE is home to nearly a million Roman Catholics, most of them from the Philippines or India. Some have been queuing for passes for Tuesday's Mass. One told AFP news agency the Pope's visit ""opens doors for conversations about tolerance that the whole world needs to hear"". In a video message on Thursday, the Pope said: ""Faith in God unites and does not divide, it draws us closer despite differences, it distances us from hostilities and aversion."" He paid tribute to the UAE as ""a land that is trying to be a model of coexistence, of human brotherhood, and a meeting place among diverse civilisations and cultures"". While in Abu Dhabi, the Pope will also hold a meeting with Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the grand imam of Cairo's al-Azhar mosque, which is the highest seat of learning for Sunni Muslims. BBC Arabic's Murad Batal Shishani, who is in Abu Dhabi, says the Vatican hopes that the Pope's visit might loosen restrictions on the building of churches in the region, particularly in neighbouring Saudi Arabia where non-Muslim places of worship are forbidden. Vatican officials say they need a stronger Church presence in the UAE to minister to the Catholic community there. ""We are really stretched. We need more churches. We need more priests,"" one official was quoted by Reuters as saying.

"This video can not be played Worried by ""flaws"" in his appearance, Chris Evans MP began a dangerous exercise routine After being hit by a car and going through his parents' divorce, Chris Evans' physical and mental pain had been pushed to the max. As weight sky-rocketed and his self-esteem hit rock bottom, he started working out. But what started out as a keep-fit regime, turned into a mental health condition - body dysmorphia. The Islwyn MP is encouraging anyone experiencing something similar to talk to someone. ""You feel you have a control over something, especially when you feel there are parts of your life that are out of control,"" he said. Body dysmorphic disorder is a psychological condition which sees sufferers develop obsessive worries about their perceived flaws - and go to extreme lengths to try and deal with them. Mr Evans' condition was triggered by months of recovery after being hit by a car when he was 13 and needing a plaster cast on his leg to aid his recovery. ""Naturally I was inactive and I put a lot of weight on,"" he told BBC Wales'Sunday Politics Wales. ""And that, when you're 13 and 14, makes you very self-conscious about yourself... And then suddenly, when the cast came off, I was looking around and I just didn't feel good enough."" It was already a difficult time in his life, with his parents divorcing and stress building up over his upcoming exams. Taking cues from his film star idols Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, who had ""had everything worked out"", his intense daily exercise regime involved waking up at 05:00 to take his dog for a run up the mountain for an hour and a half. This was followed by another hour-long work out and further long walks and training. Labour politician Mr Evans said he sought inspiration from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone as a teenager ""Then I'd check myself out in the mirror - if I wasn't happy with what I was doing, I would constantly just pick one exercise, for example bicep curls, and constantly do them until I was fatigued,"" he said. Mr Evans's routine became so extreme that he ended up ripping his bicep muscles. He said he had to stop, and it came as a relief. ""You can sleep again, and suddenly it's not that important,"" he said. He thinks society in general should talk about such matters more. ""Everybody's got challenges, everybody's got different problems they've got to face,"" he said. ""But I think if you're honest and you're open, and you talk to someone you trust, people always try to help you.""

"This video can not be played Meteorologists have warned of a ""risk to life and property"" Officials in the Australian city of Townsville are deliberately flooding several neighbourhoods after record rainfall that has swollen a dam beyond capacity. Residents in and around the north-eastern city have been warned of ""risk to life"" and ""unprecedented flooding"" that could inundate up to 20,000 homes. People have been told to seek shelter on higher ground. Townsville has received more than a metre (3.3ft) of rain in just a week. That is more than 20 times the average for the time of year - beating the previous record set in 1998, in what became known as the Night of Noah. Gates at the Ross River dam were fully opened on Sunday evening because water levels were too high and the monsoon rains were continuing.

"William Davis helped launch The Money Programme, one of BBC Two's best known programmes Former BBC broadcaster and journalist William Davis has died, after heart failure, aged 85. Following a successful career in Fleet Street, he joined the BBC and became a presenter on The World At One and also edited satirical magazine Punch. Born in Germany, he moved at the age of 16 to the UK where he changed his name and became a British citizen. His daughter, Jacki, described him as a ""self-made man"" who had a passion to have champagne with everything. Duringan appearance on the BBC's Desert Island Discs, he described his childhood growing up in Germany during World War Two as ""very grim"". He said the ""horrifying experience"" of being bombed made him ""grateful for the good things that have happened to me"". Davis said that when he first arrived in the UK, it was difficult, with a ""great deal of hostility towards anything German"" so he pretended to be Austrian. He worked at various national newspaper titles including the Financial Times, the London Evening Standard as City editor, and at the Guardian as financial editor. Before becoming one of The World At One's first presenters alongside William Hardcastle, he had helped develop, launch and present BBC Two's The Money Programme. This video can not be played One of the first presenters recalls his time on The World At One Speaking in 2016, Davis said the current affairs show sometimes ""made the news, not just reported it."" ""We knew we had it made when (former prime minister) Harold Wilson phoned up, personally, to complain about something Bill or I had said on the programme,"" he said. ""That week we all said 'that's it - we've arrived'."" In 1968, the Hanover-born journalist became editor of one of the nation's best-known satirical magazines. ""He was very proud of editing Punch because he thought it was very funny that a little German boy had become the editor of the most quintessentially British institution you could think of,"" Jacki said. She added: ""Of his generation of journalists, he was genuinely pioneering and innovative, he was never content to do it the way it had always been done."" She said her father had been a ""great admirer"" of Baroness Thatcher and gave the former Conservative prime minister advice from ""time to time"". ""He would go and see her in Number 10 and give her advice, talking really about how you frame the message, it was really communications advice"". During a lengthy career, Davis also launched in-flight British Airways magazine High Life and became chairman of the British Tourist Authority and English Tourist Board. He wrote a wide variety of books. Davis died at his home in Cannes, southern France, on Saturday. Davis, whose son Simon died at a young age, is survived by his wife Sylvette, daughters Sue and Jacki, and his two grandchildren Lucinda and William.

"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson An underwater search for the missing plane carrying footballer Emiliano Sala and his pilot is under way. Cardiff City's new signing disappeared with pilot David Ibbotson over the English Channel on 21 January. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said its Geo Ocean III vessel arrived on Sunday morning to the search area. Together with a privately-funded vessel, it is conducting sonar surveys off Guernsey. The AAIB said its search was expected to last three days, while the private search will continue ""until the plane is located"". Cushions believed to be from the planewere found on a beach near Surtainville, on France's Cotentin Peninsula, on Monday. Argentine Sala, 28, and Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, were travelling from Nantes, where Sala previously played, when the flight was lost. This video can not be played The vessels are using sonar to search the seabed Nantes pay tribute to missing Sala Sala's family 'struggling with few answers' Speaking from Guernsey harbour, David Mearns said his team on board the FPV Morven would work jointly with the AAIB's vessel. They plan to search an area covering four square miles about 24 nautical miles north of Guernsey. The location has been based on the flight path before it lost radar contact, said Mr Mearns, a shipwreck hunter. An official search following the plane's disappearance was called off after three days with Guernsey officials saying there was little chance those on board survived. Geo Ocean III will search the water for the next three days It prompted a privately-funded search to be set-up, with Â£324,000 was raised in an online appeal. Sala'sfamily arrived on Guernseyfollowing his disappearance and were taken to see the area, circling the island of Alderney. Mr Mearns said both vessels would divide their search area in half, looking for ""wreckage"" and a ""debris field"" in a depth of 60-120m (196-390ft).

"Bristol is one of the major UK ports for import and export for the automotive trade A storm is brewing as clouds gather over Bristol Port, with the rain set to fall on tens of thousands of vehicles parked in the port's car compounds, ready for export by ship, or destined for UK dealerships. It is an apt backdrop for the UK automotive sector's current predicament. ""Brexit has derailed the industry,"" says Sarwant Singh, senior partner and global head of automotive and transportation at consultants Frost & Sullivan. ""The uncertainty causes people not to buy cars."" The number of cars sold in the UK dropped 5.7% in 2017,according to industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders,,externaland ratings agency Moody's predicts a further 5.5% fall this year. There has been little respite from foreign markets, with exports slipping 1% last year. Each year, about 80% of the vehicles built in the UK are exported, so smooth international trade relations are vital for the automotive sector's continued prosperity. But these days, the relations are as choppy as the sea in the Bristol Channel. Vauxhall, owned by France's PSA Group, makes the Astra at Ellesmere Port Industry executives' main fear is that Brexit will result in heightened barriers to trade, not only with the European Union, but with the rest of the world too,once the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. The prospect of an escalating trade dispute between the US and its main trading partners, the EU and China, also looms large, afterUS President Donald Trump's recent threat to tax carsimported into the world's largest market. ""All of Europe is exposed,"" says Justin Cox, director of global production at consultants LMC Automotive, ""but some plants are more exposed than others, and it so happens that several of those are in the UK."" Then there's China, the world's second-largest car market. Trading relations with China are already complicated, and may well be subject to even greater complexity in future. ""A UK-China free trade agreement will be neither easy nor clearly advantageous for the UK,external,"" says Bruegel, a European think tank that specialises in economics. Part of the issue, it says, is that the UK would like to land better trade deals with China when it leaves the bloc than the ones the EU already has in place. But being smaller, the UK will be in a weaker position during trade talks, so there are no guarantees China will be prepared to offer better terms. On top of this, UK automotive trade with China - and other fast-growing markets such as India, Brazil and Russia - could suffer, depending on the terms of a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, Mr Singh says. That's because the UK might not be able to piggyback on the EU's existing bilateral trade agreements with third countries, including those entered into since the Brexit vote withCanadaandJapan. Instead, it would face years of protracted trade talks with dozens of countries. Despite uncertainty about Brexit, BMW has said it will assemble its new Mini in the UK Getting a good Brexit deal is also important because of the interdependence of European automotive companies. ""The motor industry has taken advantage of the EU's single market as much as, perhaps more than, any other industry,"" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of SMMT. As a result,EU customers buy about â¬15bn ($18.5bn; Â£13bn) worth of British-made cars per year,external, accounting for some 53% of the UK's vehicle exports, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). Conversely, EU manufacturers deliver 81% of the cars imported by the UK, to the tune of about â¬45bn, a trade imbalance that Brexit supporters hope will give the UK leverage during trade talks. At the same time, about 80% of the parts and components used to build cars in the UK are also imported from the EU, while70% of the parts and components made in the UK are exported to EU countries,external. ""Any changes to the deep economic and regulatory integration between the EU and the UK will have an adverse impact,externalon automobile manufacturers with operations in the EU and/or the UK, as well as on the European economy in general,"" the ACEA says. EU manufacturers deliver 81% of the cars imported by the UK Hence, both the UK and the European car industries are keen to see a final UK-EU deal that retains frictionless trade in the long-term. ""Anything short of single market membership could be a problem for the UK,"" says Simon Dorris, managing partner at Lansdowne Consulting. Free trade is indeed key to future prosperity, not just within Europe but beyond, according to Prof Patrick Minford of Cardiff University, who chairs Economists for Free Trade, a group of pro-Brexit economists. Its much debated paper,From Project Fear to Project Prosperity,external, suggests fears of rising trade barriers for carmakers after Brexit are misplaced. Prime Minister Theresa May has said thatBrexit presents an ""opportunity to strike free trade deals around the world"". ""Auto manufacturers will improve profitability post-Brexit,"" Prof Minford predicts. UK production: 1.75 million motor vehicles. Exports to the EU: 800,000 EU 27 production: 19.69 million motor vehicles. Exports to the UK: 2.3 million Source: ACEA Despite the uncertainty about a future trade deal,a number of big carmakers have committed to building more cars in the UK since the Brexit vote, including Nissan, BMW, Toyota, and last week Vauxhall, which is owned by French group PSA. ButParliament's cross-party Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee is pessimistic,external, recently warning that ""there are no advantages to be gained from Brexit for the automotive industry for the foreseeable future"". The UK's best-selling car is the compact Ford Fiesta The UK prime minister's desire for free trade is shared by the global motor industry more generally. Executives are nevertheless pragmatic, and accept that although international trade is governed by rules policed by the World Trade Organization, free trade is rarely a reality. Trade-distorting subsidies and a variety of measures, such as regulatory barriers, internal tax measures, and intellectual property rights, still impede the free flow of goods,external, even when trade agreements are in place, according to the European Commission. The EU, for instance, will not import cars unless they meet EU safety and emissions requirements. Moreover, trade agreements are generally conditional. For instance, cars exported from the EU must be predominantly made within the EU to be allowed free entry into other markets. Such""Rules of Origin"" could complicate exports for UK carmakers after Brexit, as an estimated 55%-75% of the parts and components that make up a car built in Britain are imported, according to Mr Hawes of SMMT. More from the BBC's series taking an international perspective on trade: 'Little price impact' from axing EU tariffs UK to seek exemption from US steel tariffs We don't want wall with UK - EU's Tusk Airbus warns of Brexit parts supply risk Corbyn backs customs union membership Whatever level of access UK-made cars get to markets around the world after Brexit, the manufacturers ultimately have to try ensure that their vehicles will be popular with overseas buyers. Mr Hawes says that this is not always easy, citing the fact that the UK's best-selling car is the compact Ford Fiesta, whereas the most popular vehicle in the US is the large Ford F150 pick-up truck. Consequently, there are reasons to question whether the US market is the most natural one to focus on for UK manufacturers, which tend to produce cars that suit British and European consumers, he observes. ""So it's also about producing the right car for the market,"" he says, pointing to how Honda is producing the Civic in Swindon for global markets. ""They have shown it can be done"".

"The Sunderland plant opened in 1986 Nissan has confirmed that the new X-Trail originally planned for its Sunderland plant will instead be made in Japan. In a letter to workers, it said continued Brexit uncertainty is not helping firms to ""plan for the future"". In 2016, the carmaker said it would build the new model in the UK after ""assurances"" from the government. Unions described the news as ""disappointing"" and said they were ""seriously concerned"". The government said Nissan's decision was ""a blow to the sector"" but that no jobs would go as a result. Nissan has made cars at Sunderland since 1986 and employs almost 7,000 people. Commenting on its decision, Nissan also said that since 2016 ""the environment for the car industry in Europe has changed dramatically"", including ""changing emissions regulations"". In the UK, diesel cars that fail to meet the latest emissions standards now face a levy and a number of European countries, including the UK, have announced bans on both new diesel and petrol vehicles in the future. As a result, sales of new diesel cars in the UK tumbled by 30% in 2018, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Nissan was always going to produce the X-Trail model at its Kyushu production hub but decided two years ago, ""there was a good business case for bringing production to Europe as well,"" according to the firm's Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy. He said the company is now planning ""to optimise our investments and concentrate production in Kyushu, instead of adding another production site"". Jaguar Land Rover in Brexit car shutdown Toyota urges support for PM's Brexit deal Carmakers fear rising trade barriers after Brexit Mr de Ficchy, said: ""Nissan is investing heavily in new technologies and powertrains for the next generation of vehicles in our Sunderland plant. ""To support this, we are taking advantage of our global assets, and with X-Trail already manufactured in Japan, we can reduce our upfront investment costs."" Mr de Ficchy said the news would be ""disappointing"" to its UK team and partners, but that the workforce in Sunderland had the company's ""full confidence"". ""While we have taken this decision for business reasons, the continued uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future,"" he added. A number of carmakers, including Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota and Vauxhall have expressed fears of disruption to their supply chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""Nissan's announcement is a blow to the sector and the region, as this was to be a further significant expansion of the site and the workforce. ""The company has confirmed that no jobs will be lost. They have reiterated today their commitment to the UK by continuing to manufacture in Sunderland the current Qashqai, Leaf and Juke models and the new Qashqai model from 2020."" Unite's acting national officer for the car sector, Steve Bush, said: ""This is very disappointing news for Sunderland and the North East and reflects the serious challenges facing the entire UK auto sector."" This video can not be played Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott: The news is devastating He added that the union remained ""seriously concerned"" that ""the apprenticeships and additional jobs that come with future investment and which this community so desperately needs will be lost"". Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott said the move was ""devastating news for our city and the region"". She added: ""The uncertainty around Brexit is always a factor now in any decisions made in manufacturing."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The Conservatives' botched negotiations and threat of a no-deal Brexit is causing uncertainty and damaging Britain's economy."" By Rob Young, BBC business reporter There's been a run of bad news from the car industry in recent months. Job losses have been announced at Jaguar Land Rover and Ford and the cancellation of Nissan's X-Trail investment at its Sunderland plant is just the latest disappointment from a sector that was booming a few years ago. There are many who want to say this is all down to Brexit. But it's not. Declining car sales in China, the world's biggest car market, have unnerved the industry worldwide. As have falling car sales and an economic rough patch in Europe. There are questions over whether diesel technology has a future after governments, who pushed it hard until a few years ago, and drivers, who previously liked its fuel efficiency, have become less keen on it. In the UK, this is all set against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty. The car industry has long been worried about potential changes to trading rules after the UK leaves the EU. It's nervous about border taxes and customs delays disrupting its just-in-time model of manufacturing. Nissan has been clear the decision to cancel its Sunderland X-Trail investment is a commercial decision. But it chose to say ""continued uncertainty"" around the UK's future relationship with the EU ""is not helping"" it plan for the future. Big businesses tend to stay out of politics. So Nissan's decision to highlight Brexit means it is clearly a concern in the minds of company executives. Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said Nissan had ""all sorts of problems that are nothing to do with Brexit"", including ""very considerable corporate governance problems"" arising from ex-chairman Carlos Ghosn's arrest. Production of the Qashqai - the best-selling crossover vehicle in Europe - makes up the majority of the current work at Sunderland. There had been concerns that Nissan - part-owned by France's Renault - could move production to France in future to avoid any post-Brexit EU tariffs. But when the X-Trail investment was initially announced, Nissan said hundreds of jobs would be created at the Sunderland plant. It sparked questions over whether a deal between the carmaker and the government had been struck, although ministers insisted that no ""financial compensation"" had been offered.

"This video can not be played Who is really in charge in Venezuela? The US says it is sending aid to crisis-hit Venezuela following a request from Juan GuaidÃ³, the opposition leader who has declared himself interim president. Mr GuaidÃ³'s move last month won swift backing from the US and others but triggered a power struggle. Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has accused him of mounting a coup and retains major international allies. He has dismissed US offers of aid as a pretext for military intervention. Maduro: Dictator or defender of socialism? Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Saturday saw thousands take to the streets of the capital Caracas for protests in support of both President Maduro and Mr GuaidÃ³. Crucially, Mr Maduro retains the support of the military, but ahead of the demonstrations Mr GuaidÃ³ was given a boost after an air force general - Francisco Yanez - became the highest-ranking military official yet to pledge support for the opposition leader. Mr GuaidÃ³ says he has held secret meetings with the military to win support for ousting Mr Maduro and also reached out to China, one of Mr Maduro's most important backers. Mr GuaidÃ³ does not control any territory in Venezuela, so instead he is planning to set up collection centres in neighbouring countries where Venezuelans have fled to. He said he wanted to set up an international coalition,externalto gather aid at three points, and press Venezuela's army to let it into the country. In a tweet, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said plans were being advanced this weekend. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sunday sees the expiration of a deadline set by several European countries - including France, Britain, Germany and Spain - for Mr Maduro to call presidential elections.

"The sting operation came complete with a fake university website India has made a diplomatic protest to the US after 129 Indian students were arrested for enrolling in a fake university. The University of Farmington, advertised as based in Michigan state, was run by undercover agents from the Department of Homeland Security to expose ""pay-to-stay"" immigration fraud. Prosecutors say those who enrolled knew that the facility would be illegal. However, Indian officials say the students may have been duped. On Saturday, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued the protest to the US embassy in Delhi, expressing concern over the arrests and demanding consular access to those detained. ""Our concern over the dignity and wellbeing of the detained students and the need for immediate consular access for Indian officials to the detainees was reiterated,"" the ministry said. The fake university was set up in 2015 to try to catch foreign nationals who had initially travelled to the US on student visas and wanted to stay in the country, US media reported. A website for the University of Farmington showed pictures of students in classes and libraries, or relaxing around a grassy campus. The website used stock images of students working It advertised tuition for undergraduates at $8,500 (Â£6,500) a year and $11,000 a year for graduate students. It also had a fake Facebook page with a calendar of events. But court papers released last week showed that the employees of the University of Farmington were undercover agents for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). The ""campus"" was an office at a business park in a Detroit suburb. The indictment, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, said the students knew the scheme was illegal. Prosecutors say the spurious university was being used as a ""pay to stay"" scheme - allowing people who entered the country legally as students to extend their stay and work by transferring to it. US hits Ghana with visa limits A total of 130 students - including 129 from India - were arrested on Wednesday and charged with civil immigration charges, the Detroit Free Press reported. The students face possible deportation if convicted. Separately, eight people who allegedly acted as recruiters were charged with conspiracy to commit visa fraud and ""harbouring aliens for profit"". The Indian government said the students could have been tricked into enrolling. ""We have urged the US side to share full details and regular updates of the students with the government, to release them from detention at the earliest and not to resort to deportation against their will,"" MEA added. Some immigration advocates in the US also believe innocent foreigners were trapped by the government. Ravi Mannam, an immigration attorney in Atlanta, told the Detroit Free Press that the sting ""kind of hooked these students by promising them credits for their previous master's programmes"". Meanwhile a telephone hotline for worried relatives of those being held has been set up at the Indian embassy in Washington, the Times of India reported. The US embassy in Delhi confirmed it had received the note of protest but made no further statement. US immigration authorities have resorted to increasingly tough enforcement tactics in recent years. In a precedent to the latest sting,immigration agents set up the fake University of Northern New Jerseyin 2016 under the Obama administration. A total of 21 people, mostly from China and India, were arrested. The effects of a US migrant raid on one tiny town Over the past two years, the Trump administration has further clamped down on undocumented migrants and visa overstayers. Workplace raids have led to hundreds of arrests. In two massive operations last year, ICE agents detained 146 people at a meat supplier in Ohio and another 150 at a trailer manufacturer in Texas.

"Susan McGorm and Sinead McGranaghan have offered free haircuts to homeless people A hairdresser has opened up her salon to offer free haircuts to homeless people. Susan McGorm, 34, is offering the cuts on Sunday in the hope that the small gesture will ""perk up"" the people who take up her offer. Ms McGorm said she wanted to do something to put out some ""good karma"" and help in whatever way she could. She said seeing people on the streets had ""spurred her on"" to do something in her local community. Susan McGorm has opened up her salon to offer homeless people, like this client, free haircuts ""You just feel terrible for them, a haircut might perk them up and make them feel more presentable"", she said.

The man who captured his life on camera Dementia whiteboard 'touches hearts' The teacher who doesn't want presents The salon, in the Broomhill area of Glasgow, is not currently open on a Sunday. By mid-afternoon nine homeless clients had visited. She now plans to run the event monthly. Speaking between haircuts, she said: ""It's been a great success. We will definitely do this again. ""The smiles on their faces made it really worth it. ""Things started off slow so we were panicked for the first hour that no one would come. ""But today we've had quite a few people in, including two young girls with their support workers. One was just a teenager who had no family, but she's trying to get her life back on track. ""She said after her haircut she felt so much better about herself."" She had toured the city centre and the west end on Saturday night - along with friends, family and colleagues who are supporting her endeavour - to speak to people on the streets and tell them about the free haircuts. The group had prepared 50 care packages - each one containing a leaflet about the service, hats and scarves and sandwiches supplied for free by local cafes. They also lined up a buffet - supplied by a local Morrison's - and hot drinks for the customers who come along.

"Police said the victim's next-of-kin had been informed A pilot died when his light aircraft crashed in Essex. The man, in his 50s, was the only person on board and was pronounced dead at the scene in Belchamp Walter, police said. Essex Police said they were called to reports of a ""light aircraft in distress"" at 11:50 GMT. Eight fire crews from Essex and Suffolk were also sent to the scene in Bells Road. Police said that the victim's next-of-kin had been informed. Essex Fire Service said its firefighters reported that the aircraft - which had landed in an arable field - was alight when they arrived. The fire was extinguished by 12:49. The crash site is about five miles from Ridgewell Airfield, the home of Essex Gliding Club, but it is not yet known where the flight originated from, or its intended destination. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said it was ""aware of the incident and had deployed a team to investigate"".

"The race to buy collapsed music chain HMV has a new front-runner after a surprise intervention from a Canadian entrepreneur, media reports say. The latest rescue bid is said to come from businessman Doug Putman, owner of Canada's Sunrise Records stores. The move pits him against Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, who has also placed a bid. HMV collapsed in December, its second administration in six years, risking 2,200 jobs at 125 stores. Those stores are continuing to trade while negotiations are held with major suppliers and bids are considered. The reports of Mr Putman's interest first surfaced intrade paper Music Week,externalon Saturday. Administrators KPMG declined to comment. HMV's Croydon branch closed down last month because of redevelopment Mr Putman previously bought HMV's Canadian business in 2017, expanding his small chain into a national operation with 80 outlets. His bid would secure the future of up to 90 of HMV's 130 UK stores, reports said. However, Music Week suggested that the HMV brand could disappear and be replaced by Sunrise's if Mr Putman's bid was successful. The paper said that although HMV Retail was in administration, HMV Brands, which controls the rights to the name, was not. KPMG confirmed that HMV Brands was not in administration, but declined to comment further. The rise and fall of a music icon Did streaming finish off HMV? Mike Ashley: The saviour of the High Street? Until now, Mr Ashley had been the likely favourite to take over the music retailer. As the owner of more than 60% of Sports Direct, he has bought retailers including the House of Fraser department store chain and Evans Cycles. His company also owns stakes in French Connection and Debenhams. HMV owner Hilco, which took the company out of its first administration in 2013, has blamed a ""tsunami"" of retail challenges for the latest collapse. These include business rate levels and the increasing use of streaming services to deliver music and movies. HMV sold 31% of all physical music in the UK in 2018 and 23% of all DVDs, with its market share growing month by month throughout the year. However, the music industry expects physical entertainment sales to shrink by another 17% this year.

"Theresa May said she would return to Brussels with a ""renewed determination"" Theresa May has said she is ""determined"" to deliver Brexit on time, ahead of talks on the Irish backstop. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the prime minister,externalsaid she would return to Brussels with a ""fresh mandate, new ideas and a renewed determination"". MPs have voted to seek an ""alternative arrangement"" to guarantee the Northern Ireland border stays open after Brexit. But the Irish deputy prime minister has said ""there are no credible alternative arrangements"" to the proposal. The backstop forms part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated by the UK and EU and is aimed at keeping the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic open after Brexit. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said that while Mrs May pledged to ""go back to Brussels to secure a plan that Parliament can stand behind"", the EU remains publicly opposed to changing the backstop. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, when the two-year time limit on withdrawal negotiations enforced by the Article 50 process expires. Some MPs have suggested Britain will need more time to negotiate its exit to avoid crashing out of the EU without a deal. Mrs May has insisted the departure date will not change, writing in the Telegraph that she would ""deliver Brexit on time"". And she said she rejected the suggestion ""that seeking alternative arrangements for the backstop constituted 'ripping up the Good Friday Agreement'"". Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: All you need to know How ready is UK for a no-deal Brexit? The prime minister added that MPs wanted the government to go back to Brussels to renegotiate the deal after the Commons voted in favour of Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady's amendment on Tuesday that called for ""alternative arrangements"" to be found. Mrs May wrote: ""While replacing the backstop with alternative arrangements was one option, [Sir Graham] would also be happy with the current backstop if there was a time limit or unilateral exit mechanism."" This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Alternative Brexit backstop ""can be done"" Home Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that an alternative arrangement to the Irish backstop ""can be done"" using ""existing technology"". Mr Javid said: ""I asked Border Force months ago to advise me to look at what alternative arrangements are possible and they've shown me quite clearly you can have no hard border on the island of Ireland and you can use existing technology - that is perfectly possible. ""The only thing that's missing is a bit of good will on the EU side."" UK 'still safe in no-deal Brexit' - Javid And International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it was ""irresponsible"" for the EU and the Irish Republic to say they will not discuss changing the backstop in the withdrawal agreement. He told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""For the Irish it's even more important than for most to talk to us for alternative ways of achieving a no hard border."" He said a no-deal Brexit would have an impact on the EU's economy, saying: ""Are they really saying they'd rather be in a no deal position? It's not a responsible position to take."" Mr Fox said Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK is leaving the EU - should only be extended in the event there was a Brexit deal that needed ""a little time to get the legislation through"". To ""simply extend"" it, without a deal in place, would not ""provide the impetus for a deal"", he said. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss told John Pienaar on Pienaar's Politics that she was confident a time-limited backstop could be negotiated. ""On the time limit to the backstop there are various people across the EU who have hinted that that could be acceptable,"" she said. ""The fact is the EU have always claimed that the backstop is a temporary measure."" She added: ""I think we are seeing signs of the EU's position softening."" By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The backstop is an ""insurance policy"" - designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Under the current Brexit deal, the 310-mile Irish border would become the only land border between the EU and the UK. This would probably mean checks on goods crossing it, unless both sides could reach a comprehensive trade deal. If such an agreement could not be reached, then to avoid those checks and border posts or other infrastructure, the backstop would come into force. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU and leave Northern Ireland effectively in the EU's single market for goods. A number of MPs fear the UK could be ""trapped"" in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals on goods with the rest of the world. Read more: Could technology solve the Irish border problem? Writing in the Sunday Times, deputy Irish prime minister Simon Coveney,externalsaid: ""The EU will not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement and there will be no withdrawal agreement without the backstop."" Mr Coveney said the backstop was required to ""ensure the protection of the Good Friday Agreement"" which ended 30 years of armed struggle in Northern Ireland. Simon Coveney said the backstop in the event of a no-deal Brexit was a ""necessary guarantee"" to ensure there was no hard border He said no alternatives have been put forward ""that achieve the shared goal of the UK and EU to avoid a hard border"", and the backstop was a ""necessary guarantee"". Arlene Foster - leader of the DUP, the party that props up Mrs May's government - said dealing with the ""toxicity"" of the backstop would allow the EU and UK to move forward towards a Brexit deal. She said she was hopeful of finding alternatives but it depended on the ""willingness"" of the Irish government. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Sunday News programme, Mrs Foster said that if the EU wants a deal, it has to be acceptable to both sides. ""I think we really need to focus on trying to get a deal. That's what the DUP want, that's what the government wants and I believe it's what the European Union wants."" Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill said the backstop was ""the bottom line"". She told the BBC's Sunday Politics ""nothing good"" would come from Brexit. Earlier on Sunday, the Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said the backstop was ""the absolute bare minimum"" required. Foster hopeful of backstop changes Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Meanwhile, some Conservative backbench MPs, including senior Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker, have said they still have other issues with the Brexit deal. Please upgrade your browser Mr Baker, deputy chairman of the Eurosceptic group the European Research Group (ERG), warned there was ""trouble ahead"" for the prime minister. In response to Mrs May's article,he tweeted,external: ""Leave-backing MPs voted to support alternative arrangements in NI but with grave misgivings about the whole agreement. ""Now the PM co-opts us into accepting everything but the backstop and, on the backstop, accepting a codicil."" He said a ""further substantial defeat"" for the agreement should be expected ""if all we see is a codicil - a 'joint interpretive instrument'"". Tory MP Andrea Jenkynstweeted,externalthat the UK ""deserves a better deal"". ""No PM, we said we would support the amendment to send a message to EU re the backstop, we all said there are other issues with WA (withdrawal agreement),"" she said. In January, MPs rejectedMrs May's withdrawal agreement by 432 votes to 202,with nearly 120 Conservative MPs voting against their leader. After the Commons voted on the Brady amendment, theEU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the backstopis ""part and parcel"" of the UK's Brexit deal and will not be renegotiated. A staring match of one against 27 Will EU blink first in Brexit standoff? Speaking at the European Parliament last week, Mr Barnier said the backstop was a ""realistic solution"" to preventing a hard border.

"This video can not be played Who is really in charge in Venezuela? The US says it is sending aid to crisis-hit Venezuela following a request from Juan GuaidÃ³, the opposition leader who has declared himself interim president. Mr GuaidÃ³'s move last month won swift backing from the US and others but triggered a power struggle. Venezuela's President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has accused him of mounting a coup and retains major international allies. He has dismissed US offers of aid as a pretext for military intervention. Maduro: Dictator or defender of socialism? Who is Juan GuaidÃ³? Saturday saw thousands take to the streets of the capital Caracas for protests in support of both President Maduro and Mr GuaidÃ³. Crucially, Mr Maduro retains the support of the military, but ahead of the demonstrations Mr GuaidÃ³ was given a boost after an air force general - Francisco Yanez - became the highest-ranking military official yet to pledge support for the opposition leader. Mr GuaidÃ³ says he has held secret meetings with the military to win support for ousting Mr Maduro and also reached out to China, one of Mr Maduro's most important backers. Mr GuaidÃ³ does not control any territory in Venezuela, so instead he is planning to set up collection centres in neighbouring countries where Venezuelans have fled to. He said he wanted to set up an international coalition,externalto gather aid at three points, and press Venezuela's army to let it into the country. In a tweet, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said plans were being advanced this weekend. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Worried by ""flaws"" in his appearance, Chris Evans MP began a dangerous exercise routine After being hit by a car and going through his parents' divorce, Chris Evans' physical and mental pain had been pushed to the max. As weight sky-rocketed and his self-esteem hit rock bottom, he started working out. But what started out as a keep-fit regime, turned into a mental health condition - body dysmorphia. The Islwyn MP is encouraging anyone experiencing something similar to talk to someone. ""You feel you have a control over something, especially when you feel there are parts of your life that are out of control,"" he said. Body dysmorphic disorder is a psychological condition which sees sufferers develop obsessive worries about their perceived flaws - and go to extreme lengths to try and deal with them. Mr Evans' condition was triggered by months of recovery after being hit by a car when he was 13 and needing a plaster cast on his leg to aid his recovery. ""Naturally I was inactive and I put a lot of weight on,"" he told BBC Wales'Sunday Politics Wales. ""And that, when you're 13 and 14, makes you very self-conscious about yourself... And then suddenly, when the cast came off, I was looking around and I just didn't feel good enough."" It was already a difficult time in his life, with his parents divorcing and stress building up over his upcoming exams. Taking cues from his film star idols Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone, who had ""had everything worked out"", his intense daily exercise regime involved waking up at 05:00 to take his dog for a run up the mountain for an hour and a half. This was followed by another hour-long work out and further long walks and training. Labour politician Mr Evans said he sought inspiration from Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone as a teenager ""Then I'd check myself out in the mirror - if I wasn't happy with what I was doing, I would constantly just pick one exercise, for example bicep curls, and constantly do them until I was fatigued,"" he said. Mr Evans's routine became so extreme that he ended up ripping his bicep muscles. He said he had to stop, and it came as a relief. ""You can sleep again, and suddenly it's not that important,"" he said. He thinks society in general should talk about such matters more. ""Everybody's got challenges, everybody's got different problems they've got to face,"" he said. ""But I think if you're honest and you're open, and you talk to someone you trust, people always try to help you.""

"Jussie Smollett performs onstage at Troubadour in West Hollywood, California Empire actor Jussie Smollett's performed for the first time since his attack telling fans he'll always stand for love. On stage, before singing, he fought back tears as he told fans: ""I had to be here tonight, y'all. I can't let [them] win."" Police are searching for two men who punched him, poured a ""chemical substance"" over him and put a rope around his neck in a suspected racist and homophobic attack. ""I have so many words on my heart,"" the 36-year-old said after hugging his family. ""The most important thing I have to say is thank you so much and that I'm okay. I'm not fully healed yet, but I'm going to."" The concert had been planned for a long time before the incident. His family and others had urged him to cancel the show while he recovers and police investigate. But Jussie said he couldn't do that. ""I'm gonna stand strong with y'all. l will always stand for love. I will never stand for anything other than that,"" said the openly gay actor. ""Regardless of what anyone else says, I will only stand for love. And I hope that you all will stand with me. So now, let's do it."" Police are investigating whether he was the victim of a hate crime. Jussie told police the two men - who attacked him in Chicago earlier this week - made reference to ""MAGA"" (Make America Great Again). The slogan was used by Donald Trump during the 2016 US presidential campaign. Chicago police have released this image of two ""people of interest"" in the case While Jussie's had a huge amount of support, others have questioned his version of what happened. He told the crowd he wanted to clarify a few things. ""Just because there has been a lot of stuff said about me that's absolutely not true,"" he said. He glanced at the balcony: ""I'm sure my lawyer's sitting up there like. 'No, Jussie, no.'"" ""I was bruised but my ribs were not cracked; they were not broken,"" he said referring to some notes he'd brought on stage. ""I went to the doctor immediately. I was not hospitalised. ""Both my doctors in LA and Chicago cleared me to perform, but said to take care, obviously. ""And above all, I fought them back,"" he said to cheers. Then he paused and said: ""I'm the gay Tupac."" No arrests have been made, and police have not found surveillance video of the attack, though they found footage of Jussie walking home with the rope around his neck.

"The race to buy collapsed music chain HMV has a new front-runner after a surprise intervention from a Canadian entrepreneur, media reports say. The latest rescue bid is said to come from businessman Doug Putman, owner of Canada's Sunrise Records stores. The move pits him against Sports Direct founder Mike Ashley, who has also placed a bid. HMV collapsed in December, its second administration in six years, risking 2,200 jobs at 125 stores. Those stores are continuing to trade while negotiations are held with major suppliers and bids are considered. The reports of Mr Putman's interest first surfaced intrade paper Music Week,externalon Saturday. Administrators KPMG declined to comment. HMV's Croydon branch closed down last month because of redevelopment Mr Putman previously bought HMV's Canadian business in 2017, expanding his small chain into a national operation with 80 outlets. His bid would secure the future of up to 90 of HMV's 130 UK stores, reports said. However, Music Week suggested that the HMV brand could disappear and be replaced by Sunrise's if Mr Putman's bid was successful. The paper said that although HMV Retail was in administration, HMV Brands, which controls the rights to the name, was not. KPMG confirmed that HMV Brands was not in administration, but declined to comment further. The rise and fall of a music icon Did streaming finish off HMV? Mike Ashley: The saviour of the High Street? Until now, Mr Ashley had been the likely favourite to take over the music retailer. As the owner of more than 60% of Sports Direct, he has bought retailers including the House of Fraser department store chain and Evans Cycles. His company also owns stakes in French Connection and Debenhams. HMV owner Hilco, which took the company out of its first administration in 2013, has blamed a ""tsunami"" of retail challenges for the latest collapse. These include business rate levels and the increasing use of streaming services to deliver music and movies. HMV sold 31% of all physical music in the UK in 2018 and 23% of all DVDs, with its market share growing month by month throughout the year. However, the music industry expects physical entertainment sales to shrink by another 17% this year.

"Dr Johan van Zyl says the deal will protect the car industry's competitiveness Toyota's Europe boss has reiterated his support for the Prime Minister's Brexit deal ahead of Tuesday's key Commons vote. Dr Johan van Zyl said the deal was vital to protecting the UK car industry and would stop a damaging no deal exit. His intervention comes days after Jaguar Land Rover and Ford announced thousands of UK job cuts, blaming a slowdown in the global car market. The Japanese firm has said it could cut jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The carmaker, which is investing Â£250m in producing the new Corolla at Burnaston, is concerned about the potential disruption to its just-in-time supply chain. JLR workers 'tense' after cuts announced Ford to cut thousands of jobs in shake-up It is also worried about new tariffs, as a large proportion of the cars it makes in Britain are exported to the EU. The firm, which also has a plant at Deeside, employs 3,000 people in the UK. Speaking at a launch event for the new Corolla on Monday, Dr van Zyl told the BBC: ""We've said since the start of the Brexit discussions that we would like to see trade without any duties or tariffs, and of course we would like to see a regime where the regulatory framework is the same between the EU and the UK. ""That for us is what is really required to make sure that our operations can continue as they are at the moment."" He added: ""The big thing about [the Brexit] deal that is on the table is that it really allows us to keep our competitiveness. But if we put any friction or tariffs into the system, that will impact our costs and that will affect our competitiveness."" Theresa May has urged MPs to back her Brexit deal ""for the country's sake"" as Tuesday's Commons vote looms closer. But despite EU assurances on the ""backstop"" - the fallback plan to avoid any return to physical Northern Ireland border checks - it seems unlikely she will triumph, political observers say. Business minister Greg Clark, who attended the Toyota event on Monday, said that not backing the deal could damage British business. He told the BBC: ""What we need to do to continue a success like [Burnaston] is we need to be able to continue to be able to sell into Europe, protect the just-in-time production that has been the foundation of its success, and we're absolutely determined to ensure that should continue. ""I think it is really important that Parliament listens to people who are creating jobs in this region and across the country and act on it.""

"Jaguar Land Rover is to extend its annual April shutdown in car production because of uncertainties around Brexit. The UK's biggest carmaker will be idle for an extra week because of fears of disruption at its car and engine plants at Liverpool, Birmingham and Wolverhampton. The shutdown during 8 to 12 April will be in addition to a scheduled closure the following week. Britain is due to leave the European Union on 29 March. ""There will be an additional week of production stand-down... due to potential Brexit disruption,"" JLR said in a statement. The company, which is cutting jobs because of a steep fall in sales, has previously warned about the impact of Brexit on its ability to source just-in-time components from mainland Europe. BMW is already planning to close its plant near Oxford for a month after Brexit, while Honda is planning a six-day closure. After Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit plan was defeated in Parliament last week, fears have grown among some businesses of a no-deal exit. Also on Thursday, Airbus, which makes aircraft wings in the UK,warned it could shift manufacturing from the UK in the event of no deal. Brexit uncertainty a disgrace, says Airbus Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts JLR said its move had been under consideration for some time, but it was waiting for clarity over the terms of Britain's EU withdrawal. The company said it needed to inform its workers ahead of any holiday and annual leave plans. JLR has been saying for more than a year that Brexit uncertainty would eventually take its toll on the perception of the UK as a stable and competitive base for global manufacturing. Last July, the company said it needed more certainty around Brexit,and warned that a ""no-deal"" Brexit would cost the company more than Â£1.2bn in profit each year. Chief executive Ralf Speth said last year: ""We have spent around Â£50bn in the UK in the past five years - with plans for a further Â£80bn more in the next five. This would be in jeopardy should we be faced with the wrong outcome."" JLR employs just under 39,000 workers at sites including Castle Bromwich, Solihull and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, and Halewood on Merseyside. Thursday's news follows an announcement earlier this month that JLR is to cut 4,500 jobs under plans to make Â£2.5bn of cost savings.

"The Sunderland plant opened in 1986 Nissan has confirmed that the new X-Trail originally planned for its Sunderland plant will instead be made in Japan. In a letter to workers, it said continued Brexit uncertainty is not helping firms to ""plan for the future"". In 2016, the carmaker said it would build the new model in the UK after ""assurances"" from the government. Unions described the news as ""disappointing"" and said they were ""seriously concerned"". The government said Nissan's decision was ""a blow to the sector"" but that no jobs would go as a result. Nissan has made cars at Sunderland since 1986 and employs almost 7,000 people. Commenting on its decision, Nissan also said that since 2016 ""the environment for the car industry in Europe has changed dramatically"", including ""changing emissions regulations"". In the UK, diesel cars that fail to meet the latest emissions standards now face a levy and a number of European countries, including the UK, have announced bans on both new diesel and petrol vehicles in the future. As a result, sales of new diesel cars in the UK tumbled by 30% in 2018, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders. Nissan was always going to produce the X-Trail model at its Kyushu production hub but decided two years ago, ""there was a good business case for bringing production to Europe as well,"" according to the firm's Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy. He said the company is now planning ""to optimise our investments and concentrate production in Kyushu, instead of adding another production site"". Jaguar Land Rover in Brexit car shutdown Toyota urges support for PM's Brexit deal Carmakers fear rising trade barriers after Brexit Mr de Ficchy, said: ""Nissan is investing heavily in new technologies and powertrains for the next generation of vehicles in our Sunderland plant. ""To support this, we are taking advantage of our global assets, and with X-Trail already manufactured in Japan, we can reduce our upfront investment costs."" Mr de Ficchy said the news would be ""disappointing"" to its UK team and partners, but that the workforce in Sunderland had the company's ""full confidence"". ""While we have taken this decision for business reasons, the continued uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future,"" he added. A number of carmakers, including Jaguar Land Rover, Toyota and Vauxhall have expressed fears of disruption to their supply chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Business Secretary Greg Clark said: ""Nissan's announcement is a blow to the sector and the region, as this was to be a further significant expansion of the site and the workforce. ""The company has confirmed that no jobs will be lost. They have reiterated today their commitment to the UK by continuing to manufacture in Sunderland the current Qashqai, Leaf and Juke models and the new Qashqai model from 2020."" Unite's acting national officer for the car sector, Steve Bush, said: ""This is very disappointing news for Sunderland and the North East and reflects the serious challenges facing the entire UK auto sector."" This video can not be played Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott: The news is devastating He added that the union remained ""seriously concerned"" that ""the apprenticeships and additional jobs that come with future investment and which this community so desperately needs will be lost"". Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott said the move was ""devastating news for our city and the region"". She added: ""The uncertainty around Brexit is always a factor now in any decisions made in manufacturing."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The Conservatives' botched negotiations and threat of a no-deal Brexit is causing uncertainty and damaging Britain's economy."" By Rob Young, BBC business reporter There's been a run of bad news from the car industry in recent months. Job losses have been announced at Jaguar Land Rover and Ford and the cancellation of Nissan's X-Trail investment at its Sunderland plant is just the latest disappointment from a sector that was booming a few years ago. There are many who want to say this is all down to Brexit. But it's not. Declining car sales in China, the world's biggest car market, have unnerved the industry worldwide. As have falling car sales and an economic rough patch in Europe. There are questions over whether diesel technology has a future after governments, who pushed it hard until a few years ago, and drivers, who previously liked its fuel efficiency, have become less keen on it. In the UK, this is all set against the backdrop of Brexit uncertainty. The car industry has long been worried about potential changes to trading rules after the UK leaves the EU. It's nervous about border taxes and customs delays disrupting its just-in-time model of manufacturing. Nissan has been clear the decision to cancel its Sunderland X-Trail investment is a commercial decision. But it chose to say ""continued uncertainty"" around the UK's future relationship with the EU ""is not helping"" it plan for the future. Big businesses tend to stay out of politics. So Nissan's decision to highlight Brexit means it is clearly a concern in the minds of company executives. Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said Nissan had ""all sorts of problems that are nothing to do with Brexit"", including ""very considerable corporate governance problems"" arising from ex-chairman Carlos Ghosn's arrest. Production of the Qashqai - the best-selling crossover vehicle in Europe - makes up the majority of the current work at Sunderland. There had been concerns that Nissan - part-owned by France's Renault - could move production to France in future to avoid any post-Brexit EU tariffs. But when the X-Trail investment was initially announced, Nissan said hundreds of jobs would be created at the Sunderland plant. It sparked questions over whether a deal between the carmaker and the government had been struck, although ministers insisted that no ""financial compensation"" had been offered.

"Major suppliers to care homes and hospitals are stockpiling food to offset the potential disruption of a no-deal Brexit. Apetito and Bidfood, who between them supply thousands of care providers, said they were holding extra inventory in case of supply chain problems. Both said they were prepared but Apetito said it feared others were not. ""We are in a strong position,"" said Apetito UK boss Paul Freeston. ""But some firms would not be able to build up big stocks,"" like his firm, he said. ""Or if they are doing fresh produce they would have to stop. A Hard Brexit could cause them significant economic difficulties."" Magnum ice creams stockpiled ahead of Brexit Record stockpiling at factories over Brexit Apetito provides pre-made meals to more than 400 hospitals and 450 care homes, as well as 100,000 vulnerable people in their homes. Mr Freeston said it was spending Â£5m in building its inventory ahead of Brexit - doubling the raw materials it holds from four to eight weeks' of stock and pre-made meals from five to six weeks'. But if the disruption lasted much longer than 12 to 16 weeks, the firm would have ""very real difficulties"", because it supplies specialist food for elderly people and those with critical conditions. But if there are backlogs at UK ports in the event of a no-deal, ""the quality of food could suffer and our product range would really narrow"", Mr Freeston said. The other worry is that if the UK suddenly started trading on World Trade Organisation terms with the EU, the cost of raw materials could jump - and Britain imports about a third of its food from the bloc. The concerns are shared by Bidfood, which supplies the kitchens of 4,000 care homes and 950 hospitals across the UK, as well as schools and prisons. Jim Gouldie, its supply chain and technical services director, said the firm had ""looked carefully"" at products needed by sectors with a ""duty of care"" and invested in additional warehousing. Meanwhile Anglia Crown, which manufactures meals for 100 hospital sites, told the BBC it was worried about prices rising after Brexit. A spokeswoman said the company was agreeing prices for ""as many commodities as possible, especially any bought in from Europe"". Despite the warnings, the National Care Association said most of the care homes it represents are prepared for any no-deal disruption and have enough food stocks in place - even if that means relying on dried or canned food to carry them through. But boss Nadra Ahmed is worried that any price shocks to suppliers could end up being passed on to providers. ""Care providers are struggling with funding and recruitment issues already so any increases will increase the challenges they face."" The Hospital Caterers Association (HCA), which represents hospital catering companies, says most of his members have been preparing for Brexit for some time. And while he is not overly worried about a no deal, he does expect some short term volatility after Brexit. ""A number are making arrangements to increase their stock holding - either on site or by securing commitments from their long-established suppliers,"" he says. ""But this clearly is not possible for perishable goods. It is imperative that we ensure continuity of supply to minimise any potential disruption to patients' menus."" A government spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to make sure that patients continue to receive the same high standard of care. ""We are working closely with the NHS, Defra and healthcare providers to ensure the uninterrupted supply of food and specialised nutritional products to patients, as part of our preparations for a no-deal EU Exit.""

"Bristol is one of the major UK ports for import and export for the automotive trade A storm is brewing as clouds gather over Bristol Port, with the rain set to fall on tens of thousands of vehicles parked in the port's car compounds, ready for export by ship, or destined for UK dealerships. It is an apt backdrop for the UK automotive sector's current predicament. ""Brexit has derailed the industry,"" says Sarwant Singh, senior partner and global head of automotive and transportation at consultants Frost & Sullivan. ""The uncertainty causes people not to buy cars."" The number of cars sold in the UK dropped 5.7% in 2017,according to industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders,,externaland ratings agency Moody's predicts a further 5.5% fall this year. There has been little respite from foreign markets, with exports slipping 1% last year. Each year, about 80% of the vehicles built in the UK are exported, so smooth international trade relations are vital for the automotive sector's continued prosperity. But these days, the relations are as choppy as the sea in the Bristol Channel. Vauxhall, owned by France's PSA Group, makes the Astra at Ellesmere Port Industry executives' main fear is that Brexit will result in heightened barriers to trade, not only with the European Union, but with the rest of the world too,once the transition period ends on 31 December 2020. The prospect of an escalating trade dispute between the US and its main trading partners, the EU and China, also looms large, afterUS President Donald Trump's recent threat to tax carsimported into the world's largest market. ""All of Europe is exposed,"" says Justin Cox, director of global production at consultants LMC Automotive, ""but some plants are more exposed than others, and it so happens that several of those are in the UK."" Then there's China, the world's second-largest car market. Trading relations with China are already complicated, and may well be subject to even greater complexity in future. ""A UK-China free trade agreement will be neither easy nor clearly advantageous for the UK,external,"" says Bruegel, a European think tank that specialises in economics. Part of the issue, it says, is that the UK would like to land better trade deals with China when it leaves the bloc than the ones the EU already has in place. But being smaller, the UK will be in a weaker position during trade talks, so there are no guarantees China will be prepared to offer better terms. On top of this, UK automotive trade with China - and other fast-growing markets such as India, Brazil and Russia - could suffer, depending on the terms of a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU, Mr Singh says. That's because the UK might not be able to piggyback on the EU's existing bilateral trade agreements with third countries, including those entered into since the Brexit vote withCanadaandJapan. Instead, it would face years of protracted trade talks with dozens of countries. Despite uncertainty about Brexit, BMW has said it will assemble its new Mini in the UK Getting a good Brexit deal is also important because of the interdependence of European automotive companies. ""The motor industry has taken advantage of the EU's single market as much as, perhaps more than, any other industry,"" says Mike Hawes, chief executive of SMMT. As a result,EU customers buy about â¬15bn ($18.5bn; Â£13bn) worth of British-made cars per year,external, accounting for some 53% of the UK's vehicle exports, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA). Conversely, EU manufacturers deliver 81% of the cars imported by the UK, to the tune of about â¬45bn, a trade imbalance that Brexit supporters hope will give the UK leverage during trade talks. At the same time, about 80% of the parts and components used to build cars in the UK are also imported from the EU, while70% of the parts and components made in the UK are exported to EU countries,external. ""Any changes to the deep economic and regulatory integration between the EU and the UK will have an adverse impact,externalon automobile manufacturers with operations in the EU and/or the UK, as well as on the European economy in general,"" the ACEA says. EU manufacturers deliver 81% of the cars imported by the UK Hence, both the UK and the European car industries are keen to see a final UK-EU deal that retains frictionless trade in the long-term. ""Anything short of single market membership could be a problem for the UK,"" says Simon Dorris, managing partner at Lansdowne Consulting. Free trade is indeed key to future prosperity, not just within Europe but beyond, according to Prof Patrick Minford of Cardiff University, who chairs Economists for Free Trade, a group of pro-Brexit economists. Its much debated paper,From Project Fear to Project Prosperity,external, suggests fears of rising trade barriers for carmakers after Brexit are misplaced. Prime Minister Theresa May has said thatBrexit presents an ""opportunity to strike free trade deals around the world"". ""Auto manufacturers will improve profitability post-Brexit,"" Prof Minford predicts. UK production: 1.75 million motor vehicles. Exports to the EU: 800,000 EU 27 production: 19.69 million motor vehicles. Exports to the UK: 2.3 million Source: ACEA Despite the uncertainty about a future trade deal,a number of big carmakers have committed to building more cars in the UK since the Brexit vote, including Nissan, BMW, Toyota, and last week Vauxhall, which is owned by French group PSA. ButParliament's cross-party Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee is pessimistic,external, recently warning that ""there are no advantages to be gained from Brexit for the automotive industry for the foreseeable future"". The UK's best-selling car is the compact Ford Fiesta The UK prime minister's desire for free trade is shared by the global motor industry more generally. Executives are nevertheless pragmatic, and accept that although international trade is governed by rules policed by the World Trade Organization, free trade is rarely a reality. Trade-distorting subsidies and a variety of measures, such as regulatory barriers, internal tax measures, and intellectual property rights, still impede the free flow of goods,external, even when trade agreements are in place, according to the European Commission. The EU, for instance, will not import cars unless they meet EU safety and emissions requirements. Moreover, trade agreements are generally conditional. For instance, cars exported from the EU must be predominantly made within the EU to be allowed free entry into other markets. Such""Rules of Origin"" could complicate exports for UK carmakers after Brexit, as an estimated 55%-75% of the parts and components that make up a car built in Britain are imported, according to Mr Hawes of SMMT.

Mr Hawes says that this is not always easy, citing the fact that the UK's best-selling car is the compact Ford Fiesta, whereas the most popular vehicle in the US is the large Ford F150 pick-up truck. Consequently, there are reasons to question whether the US market is the most natural one to focus on for UK manufacturers, which tend to produce cars that suit British and European consumers, he observes. ""So it's also about producing the right car for the market,"" he says, pointing to how Honda is producing the Civic in Swindon for global markets. ""They have shown it can be done"".

"Thousands of police officers and civilian staff have never undergone stricter criminal record and background checks, despite the fact that they were introduced in 2006, the BBC has found. Data from 16 forces in England and Wales showed 5,966 officers and staff had not had the retrospective checks, which include credit and DNA records. The police watchdog said the level of vetting was ""concerning"". The National Police Chiefs' Council said it will work ""hard"" to cut levels. Under the new guidelines, all new police officers and staff undergo rigorous vetting checks, while serving members should also be retrospectively checked every 10 years. Checks include credit, DNA and fingerprint analysis using the police database, as well as investigations into an applicant's partner, family and friends. Previously, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said it was seeing too many cases of corruption and of officers abusing their positions of authority - sometimes for sexual gain. However, BBC 5 Live Investigates found that there were thousands of officers and staff who had not undergone the stricter checks. Freedom of Information replies from 36 of 43 police forces in England and Wales revealed that 16 of them had not performed retrospective background checks on those people. West Midlands Police had the largest number of officers and staff who had not been checked or vetted within the last 10 years, with 3,283. Hertfordshire Constabulary had 831 and Cambridgeshire Constabulary had 637. West Midlands Police said it had ""backlogs in our routine reviews of vetting"" but it was confident only ""a minority"" were not covered by other government or security checks. Concerns about police vetting procedures were raised recently afterthe conviction of Cheshire Police Officer Ian Naudein December for the rape of a 13-year-old girl. Ian Naude, a ""committed paedophile"", was jailed for 25 years for raping a teenage girl BBC 5 Live Investigates spoke to Yvonne, not her real name, who was a long-term victim of domestic violence. After her husband attacked both her and her daughter during an incident in 2013, she called 999. When Dorset Police came to her home, one of the attending officers began to groom Yvonne. ""He said a beautiful woman like you shouldn't be treated like this. He started texting me, complimenting me, he was very persuasive,"" she told the BBC Yvonne and the Dorset PC had a sexual relationship over the next six months, but she says she felt taken advantage of and used. She ended the affair, but says the officer would continue to come to her home unannounced, wearing his police uniform. ""I felt threatened. He said if anyone found out, the court case (for her husband's domestic violence) would have to start all over again."" After an investigation, the officer - who has not been named to protect the victim - admitted gross misconduct at a disciplinary hearing. Supt Pete Windle, of Dorset Police's Professional Standards Department, said: ""Over the past five years, eight officers and staff have either been dismissed or resigned while under investigation for such allegations. ""Every member of Dorset Police has been vetted to the relevant national standards. We currently have a small number of officers and staff who are due for their 10-year vetting renewal and the force is in the process of ensuring these are completed."" Data from a Freedom of Information request to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC), also showed that the number of police officers reported for abusing their power ""for sexual gain"" has more than doubled over a four-year period - from 84 in 2014-15 to 170 in 2017-18. The National Police Chiefs' Council said more cases like this were being reported because of the work they had done in highlighting the issue. In a statement, it said: ""There is a gap and we will work really hard to sort that out. ""We are confident the number of officers and staff who have not been retrospectively vetted before 2006 will fall in the coming months."" HMICFRS said the low levels of vetting uncovered by the BBC could affect public confidence in the police. ""We're currently inspecting forces to check that they've cleared their vetting backlogs,"" it said.

"This video can not be played Sajid Javid: Alternative Brexit backstop ""can be done"" Home Secretary Sajid Javid has said the UK would remain ""one of the safest countries in the world"" in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that there would be a ""change in capability"" in terms of access to certain security databases. He also said a general election was the ""last thing this country needs"". His comments on security come after the Met's counter-terrorism chief said no deal would be ""very bad"" for policing. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday, 29 March, when the two-year time limit on withdrawal negotiations enforced by the Article 50 process expires. Prime Minister Theresa May has saidshe is ""determined"" to deliver Brexit on time, ahead of talks on the Irish backstop. The backstop forms part of the withdrawal agreement negotiated by the UK and EU and is aimed at keeping the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic open after Brexit. But Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar told RTE Radio that it was ""very frustrating"" the UK government seemed to be considering alternative arrangements that had ""already been rejected"". Meanwhile, Nissan has confirmed that the new X-Trail originally planned for its Sunderland plantwill instead be made in Japan, saying continued Brexit uncertainty is not helping firms like it to ""plan for the future"". Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: All you need to know How ready is UK for a no-deal Brexit? Far-right groups 'could exploit Brexit' Mr Javid said he wants to leave with a deal on 29 March, but ""it makes sense to plan for all contingencies, that of course includes no deal planning"". ""It is true if we have a no deal situation there will be certain capabilities that we rely on for security with the EU, such as databases, arrest warrants... that will change,"" he said. ""There are capabilities we would want to keep, but they require co-operation with the EU and I have to plan on the basis that in a no deal scenario the EU will no longer allow us to access those capabilities."" He said that most of those capabilities began in 2015, saying: ""We were a safe country then and we'd be a very safe country in a no deal scenario."" ""I want a deal... but even in a no deal scenario we would continue to be one of the safest countries in the world."" Last month, the Met's Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu told the BBC the possibility of a no-deal Brexit was ""incredibly concerning"" for police operations. Echoing comments from Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick in December, he said the UK and Europe would be in a ""very bad place"" if police could not exchange data or biometrics on suspected criminals and terrorists. Mr Basu said the Met was working on contingency arrangements with police forces and agencies in Europe. Mr Javid also dismissed speculation about a summer general election, saying that the Conservatives were only preparing for local elections in May. ""I think the last thing this country needs is a general election,"" he said. ""I think the people will never forgive us for it, what they want is this Parliament to deliver Brexit in an orderly way, that is what they are looking for."" The next general election is due in 2022. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalthe prime minister said she would return to Brussels with a ""fresh mandate, new ideas and a renewed determination"", ahead of talks on the Irish backstop. MPs have voted to seek an ""alternative arrangement"" to guarantee the Northern Ireland border stays open after Brexit. She insisted the departure date will not change, saying she would ""deliver Brexit on time"". And she said she rejected the suggestion ""that seeking alternative arrangements for the backstop constituted 'ripping up the Good Friday Agreement'"". The prime minister added that MPs wanted the government to go back to Brussels to renegotiate the deal after the Commons voted in favour of Tory backbencher Sir Graham Brady's amendment on Tuesday that called for ""alternative arrangements"" to be found. Please upgrade your browser Mr Javid said an alternative arrangement to the Irish backstop ""can be done"" using ""existing technology"". He said: ""I asked Border Force months ago to advise me to look at what alternative arrangements are possible and they've shown me quite clearly you can have no hard border on the island of Ireland and you can use existing technology - that is perfectly possible. ""The only thing that's missing is a bit of good will on the EU side."" And International Trade Secretary Liam Fox said it was ""irresponsible"" for the EU and the Irish Republic to say they will not discuss changing the backstop in the withdrawal agreement. He told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""For the Irish it's even more important than for most to talk to us for alternative ways of achieving a no hard border."" He said a no-deal Brexit would have an impact on the EU's economy, saying: ""Are they really saying they'd rather be in a no deal position? It's not a responsible position to take."" But Mr Varadkar told RTE Radio it was ""very frustrating"" the UK government was ""going back to idea of technology"". He said the EU had already ""examined all of that"" in terms of how other borders operate. He himself had been to look at the US-Canada border, he said, adding: ""Yes, there is lots of technology but it's a hard border."" By Tom Edgington, BBC Reality Check This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The backstop is an ""insurance policy"" - designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Under the current Brexit deal, the 310-mile Irish border would become the only land border between the EU and the UK. This would probably mean checks on goods crossing it, unless both sides could reach a comprehensive trade deal. If such an agreement could not be reached, then to avoid those checks and border posts or other infrastructure, the backstop would come into force. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU and leave Northern Ireland effectively in the EU's single market for goods. A number of MPs fear the UK could be ""trapped"" in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals on goods with the rest of the world. Read more: Could technology solve the Irish border problem? The EU has repeatedly said that there would be no renegotiation. Speaking at the European Parliament last week, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the backstop was a ""realistic solution"" to preventing a hard border. DUP leader Arlene Foster told the BBC she was hopeful of finding alternatives to the backstop Arlene Foster - leader of the DUP, the party that props up Mrs May's government - told the BBC she was hopeful of finding alternatives to the backstop but it depended on the ""willingness"" of the Irish government. Foster hopeful of backstop changes Meanwhile, some Conservative backbench MPs, including senior Tory Brexiteer Steve Baker, have said they still have other issues with the Brexit deal. Mr Baker, deputy chairman of the Eurosceptic group the European Research Group (ERG), warned there was ""trouble ahead"" for the prime minister. In response to Mrs May's article,he tweeted,external: ""Leave-backing MPs voted to support alternative arrangements in NI but with grave misgivings about the whole agreement.

"Pay for workers in their 30s is still 7% below the level at which it peaked before the 2008 banking crisis, research has suggested. The Resolution Foundation think tank said people who were in their 20s at the height of the recession a decade ago were worst hit by the pay squeeze. It suggested the crisis had a lasting ""scarring"" effect on their earnings. The foundation said people in their 30s who wanted to earn more should move to a different employer. The research found those who stayed in the same job in 2018 had real wage growth of 0.5%, whereas those who found a different employer saw an average increase of 4.5%. How did the crisis affect your finances? Workers are Â£800 a year poorer post-crisis Who was to blame for the financial crisis?

This video can not be played 'I earned more as a student than I have since' Ms Cominetti said the pay squeeze was especially trying for people ""unlucky enough to enter the labour market during the financial crisis"".

Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: ""The average earnings of those in their 20s and 30s fell especially sharply in the immediate aftermath of the recession, perhaps as employers were able to cut starting wages more than wages of those already in work.""

"The decision to simplify challenges to a violent offenders' release comes after controversy over the potential release of black cab rapist John Worboys in 2018 Victims of crime in England and Wales will be given new rights to challenge the release of violent offenders, Justice Secretary David Gauke has said. Instead of having to go to court to contest Parole Board decisions, victims will be able to apply to the Ministry of Justice to appeal against release. The change follows an outcry last year after the so-called black-cab rapist John Worboys was granted parole. That decision wasoverturned by the High Court in March 2018. It is hoped the new powers given to victims will simplify costly and time-consuming court challenges to Parole Board decisions. In November the board ruled that Worboys, who isnow known as John Radford, must stay in prison. Some of the reasons given for refusing the rapist's parole were his ""sense of sexual entitlement"" and need to control women. This video can not be played Victim: 'The police assumed I was some drunk' Black-cab rapist Worboys, 61, was convicted of 19 offences against 12 women in 2009 at Croydon Crown Court and ordered to serve at least eight years in jail. The following year police said a number of women had come forward and that his alleged victims now numbered more than 100. Worboys would win passengers' trust before uncorking miniature bottles of champagne. Little did they know the cheap Tesco bubbly was laced with date-rape drug Temazepam, or over-the-counter sleeping medication, from the ""tool-kit"" he kept in the passenger footwell. Read the full story here. Challenges to a person's release will only apply to the most serious offenders, and will have to be launched within 21 days of victims being notified of the decision. Mr Gauke said: ""This landmark reform will for the first time empower victims to hold the Parole Board to account for its decision and help restore public confidence in the important work that it does."" Mary Mason, chief executive of Solace Women's Aid, welcomed the new powers but said: ""It's yet another piecemeal reform of a system which is deeply flawed."" ""What we want to see is much more root and branch look at the whole of the system about rape and sexual assault."" Ms Mason said currently victims of rape and sexual assault were often not told their abuser was being released. ""All sorts of things happen which means they are not aware that they have actually been released, and so they aren't able to take safety measures,"" she said. The new system will apply to indeterminate sentence prisoners (ISPs), like those serving a life sentence, or people jailed under imprisonment for public protection (IPP). Worboys was sentenced under IPP, where a criminal is jailed for an indeterminate period until a Parole Board judges they no longer pose a risk to the public. The system would also apply to those serving extended sentences. The Ministry of Justice said the challenge threshold would be similar to that of a High Court judicial review, which will focus on ""illegality, irrationality and procedural unfairness"". A request would first be considered by the Prison and Probation Service, which could be passed to a Parole Board judge who could order a panel to review its decision, or order a fresh hearing.

"Emily Fazah says premenstrual syndrome (PMS) ""shouldn't be shrugged off"" ""I'm out for a week sometimes because I feel so low"". Emily Fazah has suffered from intense symptoms ever since she started her periods - from anxiety and fatigue, to mood swings and cramps. The 29-year-old says she ""suffered in silence"" for years, but is determined to no longer be embarrassed. She has set up an online community called Moody Girl, inspired by her childhood nickname, to ""get the world"" talking about premenstrual syndrome (PMS). ""Women have been feeling isolated for so long,"" says Miss Fazah, who lives in Ipswich, Suffolk. ""It shouldn't be embarrassing talking in front of men about suffering. It shouldn't be shrugged off."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""From a young age, I learned to suppress it, not talk about it and suffer in silence,"" she says. Although she could turn to her mum, no-one at her school had the same problems. It was not until she began working full-time in London that she reached ""breaking point"". ""I was trying to keep down my emotions and the way it was making me feel,"" she says. It made going to client meetings difficult, and with a male boss, she felt she ""couldn't really open up about it"". Moody Girl provides an online platform for women to share their experiences That's when the seed for Moody Girl was sown. Miss Fazah thought to herself: ""What if there are other women out there that maybe I haven't met yet who have been going through the same thing as me? How do I connect with them?"" She made the decision to move back to Suffolk to set up the website, which shares her own story as well as experiences from other women, and a playlist which reflects her current mood. ""I wanted to open up that dialogue which was so desperately needed."" She says her aim is ""getting the word out, making a community of other women who are suffering, raising money and raising awareness, and not being embarrassed"". Miss Fazah launched Moody Girl in Ipswich The Facebook page has more than 1,100 followers, some from as far afield as the USA, and a further 600 people follow the Instagram site. Izzy Finbow, 29, from London, says she has found the Moody Girl community ""enlightening"" and ""inspiring"". The digital content editor says her PMS was ""ridiculous"", leaving her feeling bleakly depressed and ""irrational to new levels"". Being a part of the online social sites and seeing Miss Fazah's Instagram photos has helped her realise she is not alone, and given her tips such as using an app to track her periods. Eileen Murphy, 37, from Cambridge, says through the forum she has found ""solidarity"" with other women, while her partner now has a greater understanding of her symptoms and mood.

Hailley, a nurse from Canada,commented on Reddit,external: ""I had one resident where I worked who would be in tears because he was worried about his children and having to pay for his meals. ""It was sometimes tough to reassure him. We had to call his children to talk to him a few times. It was hard to see him so upset."" She told the BBC: ""I have seen people talk down to those with dementia, which is just not right. They are still adults who know when they are being treated differently.

Tim Beanland, a spokesperson for the Alzheimer's Society says: ""Anxiety is really common amongst people with dementia and they can need a lot of support, but help is out there. ""Whiteboards are useful for providing a structure for the day or explaining that someone has left the house and will return at a particular time. ""As long as what is written on the board does not offer false reassurances, then techniques like this are a good thing."" The Alzheimer's Society also advises thatsomeone with dementia,externalwho is experiencing anxiety may benefit from company and the opportunity to talk about their feelings. And because those living with dementia can alsoworry about losing things,external, Mr Beanland recommends decluttering and adding labels on drawers and glass-fronted cupboards so people know what's inside.

Brachycephalic dog breeds are increasingly popular but suffer from having short, obstructed airways. Battersea called the breeds an ""example of irresponsible, selective breeding"". The Kennel Club found French bulldogs to be the UK's most popular dog breed in 2018 Brachycephalic dog breeds tend to have big eyes, snub noses, and are compact in size. The British Veterinary Association haswarned people against buying flat-faced breedsbut Battersea has nonetheless taken in increasing numbers in recent years. The shelter took in 40 French bulldogs and 47 pugs in 2018, compared to eight and 36 respectively in 2014. According to Battersea vets, the way many are bred means they often have airways so narrow that it is ""the equivalent of us breathing through a drinking straw"".

"Thousands of police officers and civilian staff have never undergone stricter criminal record and background checks, despite the fact that they were introduced in 2006, the BBC has found. Data from 16 forces in England and Wales showed 5,966 officers and staff had not had the retrospective checks, which include credit and DNA records. The police watchdog said the level of vetting was ""concerning"". The National Police Chiefs' Council said it will work ""hard"" to cut levels. Under the new guidelines, all new police officers and staff undergo rigorous vetting checks, while serving members should also be retrospectively checked every 10 years. Checks include credit, DNA and fingerprint analysis using the police database, as well as investigations into an applicant's partner, family and friends. Previously, Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said it was seeing too many cases of corruption and of officers abusing their positions of authority - sometimes for sexual gain. However, BBC 5 Live Investigates found that there were thousands of officers and staff who had not undergone the stricter checks. Freedom of Information replies from 36 of 43 police forces in England and Wales revealed that 16 of them had not performed retrospective background checks on those people. West Midlands Police had the largest number of officers and staff who had not been checked or vetted within the last 10 years, with 3,283. Hertfordshire Constabulary had 831 and Cambridgeshire Constabulary had 637. West Midlands Police said it had ""backlogs in our routine reviews of vetting"" but it was confident only ""a minority"" were not covered by other government or security checks. Concerns about police vetting procedures were raised recently afterthe conviction of Cheshire Police Officer Ian Naudein December for the rape of a 13-year-old girl. Ian Naude, a ""committed paedophile"", was jailed for 25 years for raping a teenage girl BBC 5 Live Investigates spoke to Yvonne, not her real name, who was a long-term victim of domestic violence. After her husband attacked both her and her daughter during an incident in 2013, she called 999. When Dorset Police came to her home, one of the attending officers began to groom Yvonne. ""He said a beautiful woman like you shouldn't be treated like this. He started texting me, complimenting me, he was very persuasive,"" she told the BBC Yvonne and the Dorset PC had a sexual relationship over the next six months, but she says she felt taken advantage of and used. She ended the affair, but says the officer would continue to come to her home unannounced, wearing his police uniform. ""I felt threatened. He said if anyone found out, the court case (for her husband's domestic violence) would have to start all over again."" After an investigation, the officer - who has not been named to protect the victim - admitted gross misconduct at a disciplinary hearing. Supt Pete Windle, of Dorset Police's Professional Standards Department, said: ""Over the past five years, eight officers and staff have either been dismissed or resigned while under investigation for such allegations. ""Every member of Dorset Police has been vetted to the relevant national standards. We currently have a small number of officers and staff who are due for their 10-year vetting renewal and the force is in the process of ensuring these are completed."" Data from a Freedom of Information request to the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC), also showed that the number of police officers reported for abusing their power ""for sexual gain"" has more than doubled over a four-year period - from 84 in 2014-15 to 170 in 2017-18. The National Police Chiefs' Council said more cases like this were being reported because of the work they had done in highlighting the issue. In a statement, it said: ""There is a gap and we will work really hard to sort that out. ""We are confident the number of officers and staff who have not been retrospectively vetted before 2006 will fall in the coming months."" HMICFRS said the low levels of vetting uncovered by the BBC could affect public confidence in the police. ""We're currently inspecting forces to check that they've cleared their vetting backlogs,"" it said.

"Major suppliers to care homes and hospitals are stockpiling food to offset the potential disruption of a no-deal Brexit. Apetito and Bidfood, who between them supply thousands of care providers, said they were holding extra inventory in case of supply chain problems. Both said they were prepared but Apetito said it feared others were not. ""We are in a strong position,"" said Apetito UK boss Paul Freeston. ""But some firms would not be able to build up big stocks,"" like his firm, he said. ""Or if they are doing fresh produce they would have to stop. A Hard Brexit could cause them significant economic difficulties."" Magnum ice creams stockpiled ahead of Brexit Record stockpiling at factories over Brexit Apetito provides pre-made meals to more than 400 hospitals and 450 care homes, as well as 100,000 vulnerable people in their homes. Mr Freeston said it was spending Â£5m in building its inventory ahead of Brexit - doubling the raw materials it holds from four to eight weeks' of stock and pre-made meals from five to six weeks'. But if the disruption lasted much longer than 12 to 16 weeks, the firm would have ""very real difficulties"", because it supplies specialist food for elderly people and those with critical conditions. But if there are backlogs at UK ports in the event of a no-deal, ""the quality of food could suffer and our product range would really narrow"", Mr Freeston said. The other worry is that if the UK suddenly started trading on World Trade Organisation terms with the EU, the cost of raw materials could jump - and Britain imports about a third of its food from the bloc. The concerns are shared by Bidfood, which supplies the kitchens of 4,000 care homes and 950 hospitals across the UK, as well as schools and prisons. Jim Gouldie, its supply chain and technical services director, said the firm had ""looked carefully"" at products needed by sectors with a ""duty of care"" and invested in additional warehousing. Meanwhile Anglia Crown, which manufactures meals for 100 hospital sites, told the BBC it was worried about prices rising after Brexit. A spokeswoman said the company was agreeing prices for ""as many commodities as possible, especially any bought in from Europe"". Despite the warnings, the National Care Association said most of the care homes it represents are prepared for any no-deal disruption and have enough food stocks in place - even if that means relying on dried or canned food to carry them through. But boss Nadra Ahmed is worried that any price shocks to suppliers could end up being passed on to providers. ""Care providers are struggling with funding and recruitment issues already so any increases will increase the challenges they face."" The Hospital Caterers Association (HCA), which represents hospital catering companies, says most of his members have been preparing for Brexit for some time. And while he is not overly worried about a no deal, he does expect some short term volatility after Brexit. ""A number are making arrangements to increase their stock holding - either on site or by securing commitments from their long-established suppliers,"" he says. ""But this clearly is not possible for perishable goods. It is imperative that we ensure continuity of supply to minimise any potential disruption to patients' menus."" A government spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to make sure that patients continue to receive the same high standard of care. ""We are working closely with the NHS, Defra and healthcare providers to ensure the uninterrupted supply of food and specialised nutritional products to patients, as part of our preparations for a no-deal EU Exit.""

"This video can not be played The Pope was met with flowers and drums Pope Francis has arrived in the United Arab Emirates  for the first ever visit by a pontiff to the Arabian peninsula. He landed in Abu Dhabi where he was greeted by Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan. The Pope will take part in an interfaith conference on Monday and on Tuesday hold Mass in which 120,000 people are expected to attend. Before leaving he expressed concern about the war in Yemen, in which the UAE is engaged. ""The population [in Yemen] is exhausted by the lengthy conflict and a great many children are suffering from hunger, but cannot access food depots,"" the Pope said. Profile: Pope Francis United Arab Emirates profile ""The cry of these children and their parents rises up to God,"" he said. It is not clear whether the Pope plans to raise the issue in public or in private while visiting the UAE. The UAE is involved in Yemen as part of a Saudi-led coalition. The Pope was welcomed by Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince The UAE is home to nearly a million Roman Catholics, most of them from the Philippines or India. Some have been queuing for passes for Tuesday's Mass. One told AFP news agency the Pope's visit ""opens doors for conversations about tolerance that the whole world needs to hear"". In a video message on Thursday, the Pope said: ""Faith in God unites and does not divide, it draws us closer despite differences, it distances us from hostilities and aversion."" He paid tribute to the UAE as ""a land that is trying to be a model of coexistence, of human brotherhood, and a meeting place among diverse civilisations and cultures"". While in Abu Dhabi, the Pope will also hold a meeting with Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, the grand imam of Cairo's al-Azhar mosque, which is the highest seat of learning for Sunni Muslims. BBC Arabic's Murad Batal Shishani, who is in Abu Dhabi, says the Vatican hopes that the Pope's visit might loosen restrictions on the building of churches in the region, particularly in neighbouring Saudi Arabia where non-Muslim places of worship are forbidden. Vatican officials say they need a stronger Church presence in the UAE to minister to the Catholic community there. ""We are really stretched. We need more churches. We need more priests,"" one official was quoted by Reuters as saying.

"The decision to simplify challenges to a violent offenders' release comes after controversy over the potential release of black cab rapist John Worboys in 2018 Victims of crime in England and Wales will be given new rights to challenge the release of violent offenders, Justice Secretary David Gauke has said. Instead of having to go to court to contest Parole Board decisions, victims will be able to apply to the Ministry of Justice to appeal against release. The change follows an outcry last year after the so-called black-cab rapist John Worboys was granted parole. That decision wasoverturned by the High Court in March 2018. It is hoped the new powers given to victims will simplify costly and time-consuming court challenges to Parole Board decisions. In November the board ruled that Worboys, who isnow known as John Radford, must stay in prison. Some of the reasons given for refusing the rapist's parole were his ""sense of sexual entitlement"" and need to control women. This video can not be played Victim: 'The police assumed I was some drunk' Black-cab rapist Worboys, 61, was convicted of 19 offences against 12 women in 2009 at Croydon Crown Court and ordered to serve at least eight years in jail. The following year police said a number of women had come forward and that his alleged victims now numbered more than 100. Worboys would win passengers' trust before uncorking miniature bottles of champagne. Little did they know the cheap Tesco bubbly was laced with date-rape drug Temazepam, or over-the-counter sleeping medication, from the ""tool-kit"" he kept in the passenger footwell. Read the full story here. Challenges to a person's release will only apply to the most serious offenders, and will have to be launched within 21 days of victims being notified of the decision. Mr Gauke said: ""This landmark reform will for the first time empower victims to hold the Parole Board to account for its decision and help restore public confidence in the important work that it does."" Mary Mason, chief executive of Solace Women's Aid, welcomed the new powers but said: ""It's yet another piecemeal reform of a system which is deeply flawed."" ""What we want to see is much more root and branch look at the whole of the system about rape and sexual assault."" Ms Mason said currently victims of rape and sexual assault were often not told their abuser was being released. ""All sorts of things happen which means they are not aware that they have actually been released, and so they aren't able to take safety measures,"" she said. The new system will apply to indeterminate sentence prisoners (ISPs), like those serving a life sentence, or people jailed under imprisonment for public protection (IPP). Worboys was sentenced under IPP, where a criminal is jailed for an indeterminate period until a Parole Board judges they no longer pose a risk to the public. The system would also apply to those serving extended sentences. The Ministry of Justice said the challenge threshold would be similar to that of a High Court judicial review, which will focus on ""illegality, irrationality and procedural unfairness"". A request would first be considered by the Prison and Probation Service, which could be passed to a Parole Board judge who could order a panel to review its decision, or order a fresh hearing.

"The sting operation came complete with a fake university website India has made a diplomatic protest to the US after 129 Indian students were arrested for enrolling in a fake university. The University of Farmington, advertised as based in Michigan state, was run by undercover agents from the Department of Homeland Security to expose ""pay-to-stay"" immigration fraud. Prosecutors say those who enrolled knew that the facility would be illegal. However, Indian officials say the students may have been duped. On Saturday, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) issued the protest to the US embassy in Delhi, expressing concern over the arrests and demanding consular access to those detained. ""Our concern over the dignity and wellbeing of the detained students and the need for immediate consular access for Indian officials to the detainees was reiterated,"" the ministry said. The fake university was set up in 2015 to try to catch foreign nationals who had initially travelled to the US on student visas and wanted to stay in the country, US media reported. A website for the University of Farmington showed pictures of students in classes and libraries, or relaxing around a grassy campus. The website used stock images of students working It advertised tuition for undergraduates at $8,500 (Â£6,500) a year and $11,000 a year for graduate students. It also had a fake Facebook page with a calendar of events. But court papers released last week showed that the employees of the University of Farmington were undercover agents for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE). The ""campus"" was an office at a business park in a Detroit suburb. The indictment, filed in the District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, said the students knew the scheme was illegal. Prosecutors say the spurious university was being used as a ""pay to stay"" scheme - allowing people who entered the country legally as students to extend their stay and work by transferring to it. US hits Ghana with visa limits A total of 130 students - including 129 from India - were arrested on Wednesday and charged with civil immigration charges, the Detroit Free Press reported. The students face possible deportation if convicted. Separately, eight people who allegedly acted as recruiters were charged with conspiracy to commit visa fraud and ""harbouring aliens for profit"". The Indian government said the students could have been tricked into enrolling. ""We have urged the US side to share full details and regular updates of the students with the government, to release them from detention at the earliest and not to resort to deportation against their will,"" MEA added. Some immigration advocates in the US also believe innocent foreigners were trapped by the government. Ravi Mannam, an immigration attorney in Atlanta, told the Detroit Free Press that the sting ""kind of hooked these students by promising them credits for their previous master's programmes"". Meanwhile a telephone hotline for worried relatives of those being held has been set up at the Indian embassy in Washington, the Times of India reported. The US embassy in Delhi confirmed it had received the note of protest but made no further statement. US immigration authorities have resorted to increasingly tough enforcement tactics in recent years. In a precedent to the latest sting,immigration agents set up the fake University of Northern New Jerseyin 2016 under the Obama administration. A total of 21 people, mostly from China and India, were arrested. The effects of a US migrant raid on one tiny town Over the past two years, the Trump administration has further clamped down on undocumented migrants and visa overstayers. Workplace raids have led to hundreds of arrests. In two massive operations last year, ICE agents detained 146 people at a meat supplier in Ohio and another 150 at a trailer manufacturer in Texas.

""It has taken time to make sure that it's not me but I'm convinced I'm not on that photo,"" he said. He said that he had however blackened his face at a dance contest in San Antonio. ""It is because my memory of that is so vivid that I do not believe I am in the photo in the yearbook,"" he said. Mr Northam said he was not asking for forgiveness for his past actions but for ""the opportunity to demonstrate without a shadow of a doubt that the person I was then is not the person I am today"". The statement on Saturday came after he said on Friday that he was ""deeply sorry for the decision I made to appear as I did in this photo and for the hurt that decision caused then and now"". Mr Northam's yearbook page, which came from the paediatric neurologist's time at Eastern Virginia Medical School, was first published by conservative website Big League Politics.

"The Sunderland plant opened in 1986 Nissan is expected to announce that it is cancelling a planned investment at its plant in Sunderland. In 2016 the car maker said it would build the new model of its X-Trail SUV in the UK after receiving ""assurances"" from the government over Brexit. The Japanese company is expected to say investment will be now be pulled, rather than existing work being halted. Labour MP for Houghton and Sunderland South, Bridget Phillipson, spoke of her concern at the prospect. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""If confirmed, this would represent deeply troubling news for the north east economy,"" she tweeted. ""So many jobs and livelihoods depend on Nissan's success."" Labour Sunderland Central MP Julie Elliott suggested there was an ""inevitable role that Brexit plays here.... None of it is conducive to encouraging business investment in this country"". ""I will be doing everything I can to protect the jobs at the Sunderland plant. I will be asking for the government to intervene, and will stay in close contact with the company itself,"" she said in aTwitter post,external. Nissan has produced cars at Sunderland since 1986 and employs almost 7,000 people. Nissanannounced in October 2016it would build the next-generation X-Trail and Qashqai at Sunderland. Production of the Qashqai - the best-selling crossover vehicle in Europe - makes up the majority of the current work at Sunderland and is not expected to be affected by the announcement on the X-Trail. BBC business reporter Rob Young said: ""The reasons for the investment cancellation are not known, but the industry as a whole has been warning Brexit uncertainty might hit investment."" Our correspondent said as the announcement was expected to be about planned future investment, the impact on Nissan's current workforce may be very minimal. Nissan refused to shed light on the situation. A spokesman said it ""does not comment on rumour or speculation"". There had been concerns that Nissan - part-owned by France's Renault - could move production to France in future to avoid any post-Brexit EU tariffs. But when the X-Trail investment was initially announced, Nissan said hundreds of jobs would be created at the Sunderland plant. It sparked questions over whether a deal between the car-maker and the government had been struck although ministers insisted that no ""financial compensation"" had been offered. Peter Campbell, the motor industry correspondent at the Financial Times, said the fall in demand for diesels would appear to be one of the main factors in the announcement as Nissan was planning to make mainly diesel versions of the X-Trail in Sunderland. He told the BBC: ""If Nissan decided to make those cars in petrol it would have to ship engines over from Japan and the cost of doing that work against the decision to build it in the UK."" He added: ""There are obviously other factors - car sales are down in the UK, they have fallen across Europe...  and there is obviously the overhang of Brexit and the worries of the impact that might have on a plant that exports about 80% of its vehicles.""

"Pay for workers in their 30s is still 7% below the level at which it peaked before the 2008 banking crisis, research has suggested. The Resolution Foundation think tank said people who were in their 20s at the height of the recession a decade ago were worst hit by the pay squeeze. It suggested the crisis had a lasting ""scarring"" effect on their earnings. The foundation said people in their 30s who wanted to earn more should move to a different employer. The research found those who stayed in the same job in 2018 had real wage growth of 0.5%, whereas those who found a different employer saw an average increase of 4.5%. How did the crisis affect your finances? Workers are Â£800 a year poorer post-crisis Who was to blame for the financial crisis? Economic analyst Nye Cominetti said the UK was ""finally starting to deliver a pay recovery"", but added: ""Whether this recovery continues to build momentum in 2019 will depend in large part on what happens with Brexit."" This video can not be played 'I earned more as a student than I have since' Ms Cominetti said the pay squeeze was especially trying for people ""unlucky enough to enter the labour market during the financial crisis"". Resolution Foundation policy analyst Dan Tomlinson said: ""It's important that we see pay growth returning, productivity growth driving higher pay and helping these people [to] be able to afford to do things like settle down, have a family, and move into their own home."" In 2018,analysis carried out for the BBCby the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) showed that people in their 30s were earning Â£2,100 a year less than people in the same age group in 2008. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, said: ""The average earnings of those in their 20s and 30s fell especially sharply in the immediate aftermath of the recession, perhaps as employers were able to cut starting wages more than wages of those already in work."" While this age group has seen earnings grow in recent years, it has not been enough to make up for initial losses, he said.

"The controversial backstop, designed to eliminate the need for a hard border in Ireland, continues to be the major sticking point in the Brexit negotiations. Some of the MPs who have rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal say they have not been convinced by the arguments that the arrangement would only ever be temporary. They believe that alternative arrangements, such as technological solutions, would eliminate the need for a backstop in the first place. So how viable is this? The backstop is an ""insurance policy"" - designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Under the current Brexit deal, the 310-mile Irish border would become the only land border between the EU and the UK. This would probably mean checks on goods crossing it, unless both sides could reach a comprehensive trade deal. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. If such an agreement couldn't be reached, then to avoid those checks and border posts or other infrastructure, the backstop would come into force. It would keep the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU and leave Northern Ireland effectively in the EU's single market for goods. A number of MPs fear the UK could be ""trapped"" in this arrangement for years, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals on goods with the rest of the world. Norway and Sweden have one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Norway is not in the EU (although it is in the single market) and its 1,000-mile border with Sweden is the EU's longest land border. Cars go through unmanned border posts equipped with cameras that use an automatic number plate recognition system. And a sophisticated computer system allows goods to be declared to customs before they leave warehouses. But lorries transporting goods must still stop at a staffed crossing for physical customs checks. Norwegian customs says checks at the main border crossing, in Svinesund, take 20 minutes on average At the main border crossing, at Svinesund, Norwegian customs says, it processes about 1,300 lorries every day - and each one takes about 20 minutes. Lars Karlsson, who used to be a senior Swedish customs officer,wrote a report for the European Parliament,externalon how technology could be used at the Irish border. He told BBC News technology alone wouldn't eliminate the need for checks at the Irish border and the success of the Sweden-Norway customs border relied on high levels of trust and similar product standards. In any case, the border is not frictionless and there are border posts - and both of these elements would be intensely controversial on the Irish border. The EU's deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand, has already ruled out using existing technology. ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls,"" she said following the vote in the UK Parliament. The European Research Group (ERG), which is made up of pro-Brexit Conservatives,has outlined a ""unique solution"" involving a mix of technology and a simplifying of custom procedures,externalin its report A Better Deal. ""No checks at the border"" would be needed, Hans Maessen, one of report authors, told BBC News. He said checks could be carried out at warehouses instead: ""You make a declaration and customs can say, 'Hold up, I'll come by with my car and inspect your goods,'"" Mr Maessen said. How many trade deals has the UK done? Reality Check: A plan to unlock the Irish border problem Does the Good Friday Agreement rule out a hard border? This system could be developed using existing IT systems and no physical infrastructure would be required, he added. But the EU requires physical inspections on certain goods at the point where they enter the single market. This applies to some animal products and food products. And the ERG's report appears to acknowledge this. ""Inspections on veterinary and SPS (sanitary and phytosanitary) regulations shall be done at the premises of the exporter, importer, or at official border inspection facilities, located in the vicinity of the point of entry into the territory of the other party,"" it says. Single market rules require consignments of food or animals to enter the EU through specified border inspection posts. And some worry that any new checks - even ones away from the border - could create tensions. Last year Northern Ireland's Chief Constable, George Hamilton, warned of the risks that customs officers could face. ""Whether that be HMRC [HM Revenue & Customs], whether that be people engaging in checking of standards and products, then I think it's highly foreseeable that they will become the subject of threat,"" he said. Reality Check: What can the UK learn from other external borders? Frictionless borders: Learning from Norway? One potential, but expensive, way of avoiding physical checks altogether at the Irish border could be to develop a satellite system, according to Mr Karlsson. ""The driver could have a phone in their pocket, linked to a satellite. And when the truck passes the border, a computer would automatically register it,"" he said. Could GPS technology help to avoid a hard border? So could a future technological solution to the backstop work? ""Theoretically, I believe it could be done,"" said David Henig, director of the UK Trade Policy Project think tank. ""However, it would require huge amounts of trust and money. What happens if a lorry driver doesn't register? And in any event, it certainly couldn't be delivered in the next few years."" This solution also doesn't get round the fact that EU law requires physical inspections of some products. A former customs building serves as a reminder of a bygone era of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic So what about another ""alternative"" - simply time limiting the backstop so that it automatically ends? This would defeat the whole purpose of the backstop, according to Katy Hayward, an expert in border studies, at Queen's University Belfast. ""What happens when that time limit expires? Time limiting the backstop pretty much kicks the can down the road and doesn't face up to the reality of what to do about the Irish border after the transition period,"" she said. Another suggestion is for the UK to have the right to withdraw from the backstop without EU agreement - a so-called ""unilateral exit mechanism"". The fear from some Brexit-supporting MPs is that the EU might drag its feet when it comes to negotiating a free trade agreement, or worse, talks could break down completely. And this could leave the UK trapped in the backstop with no obvious way out. If the UK just walked away and left the backstop, however, it could harm relations to the point where a future trade deal with the EU became almost impossible to achieve. And the EU says the current backstop plan is the only ""realistic solution"" to preventing a hard border in Ireland. So, at the moment it looks as if there are no easy solutions - especially one that would be acceptable to the EU, the UK government and the majority of MPs.

"John Worboys carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008 Taxi driver John Worboys, who is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008, is to be freed from jail. He was an unassuming presence in the front seat, seemingly no different from the thousands of other black cab drivers who ferry workers, tourists and revellers across London. John Worboys claimed to be something of a white knight, rescuing vulnerable women from illegal taxi touts - even if they could not afford the fare. But behind his friendly exterior lay a sinister motive - between October 2006 and February 2008, Worboys sedated 12 women, raping one of them, carrying out other sexual assaults on five more and an attempted sexual assault on another. He was convicted of 19 offences in 2009 at Croydon Crown Court and ordered to serve at least eight years in jail. The following year police said a number of women had come forward and that his alleged victims now numbered more than 100. Worboys, now 60, has spent 10 years in custody including a period on remand. When one woman went to police in July 2007, the cabbie was arrested but police decided they lacked evidence to press charges so they let him go. Between then and February 2008, 29 women were attacked by Worboys. He also drove his black cab in Dorset - where he had a studio which produced adult films - and there have been reports of incidents at the time Worboys was there. The victims - all travelling alone at night - were aged 18 to 33. One 26-year-old, from west London, recalled waking in the cab, dazed from the effects of the drugs. ""The next thing I remember is him being in the back trying to put his hand up my skirt,"" she said. ""I screamed at him to get off me."" 'Black cab rapist' to be freed from jail Worboys, a former stripper and porn actor, craved the attention of women to the extent he would concoct stories to impress them. Boasting of Â£50,000 casino wins and flaunting a carrier bag of cash, he would win passengers' trust before uncorking miniature bottles of champagne. Little did they know the cheap Tesco bubbly was laced with date-rape drug Temazepam, or over-the-counter sleeping medication, from the ""tool-kit"" he kept in the passenger footwell. Alongside the drugs, he stashed Jack Daniels, gin, vodka or whisky, prescription drugs, plastic gloves, condoms and a vibrator. Worboys would win passengers' trust before uncorking miniature bottles of champagne As prosecutors put it, there was ""everything he would need to stupefy and sexually assault a passenger in his cab"". A fully-licensed driver, Worboys had undergone criminal records checks. As one victim said: ""Your guard drops when you are in a black cab, you learn to trust the drivers."" Some remembered nothing after the few sips of laced drink, waking the next morning with the feeling something was seriously amiss. ""I felt just awful, so horrible. Something had been violated,"" one said. Others were wary when Worboys offered them a drink but thought it rude to refuse. They poured away the drink or stalled events by phoning friends, only for Worboys' faÃ§ade to slip as he became frustrated and menacing. Once, when he failed to get his way, he forced a pill down a victim's throat. Another time he complained: ""You've really wasted my time."" Worboys targeted women who had been drinking. Afterwards, many doubted themselves, felt embarrassed or feared wasting police time. He was eventually caught when a woman went for police examination, having ended up slumped by the toilet after accepting a drink from him. The cheap Tesco bubbly was laced with date-rape drug Temazepam, or over-the-counter sleeping medication A media appeal brought forward a flood of earlier victims. Police said that if it was not for these women's courage, Worboys might still have been at large. His DNA was recovered from a semen stain in one woman's underwear. A wristband belonging to another was found in his house, and a third victim's address was found in Worboys' notebook. Forensic evidence linked a vibrator found in his car to another victim. In court, Worboys played the victim. Clutching the side of the witness box, as if for support, he sounded almost timid as he blamed his thirst for attention on missing out on cuddles after his mum died of cancer, when he was 13. He had worked as a milkman, junior dairy manager and security guard, before his craving for attention led him to become a stripper. For 13 years, until he was 42, Worboys revelled in performing as ""Terry the Minder"" for hen parties. Publicity photographs from the 1980s and 1990s show him sporting a blond tinted ""mullet"" haircut, posing in American-style police uniforms, satin underwear or rubber-look outfits. Despite the type of films produced by Worboys in his Dorset studio he claimed he ""never really had casual sex"", although he revealed ""the only time I feel comfortable sleeping... is if I've got someone I'm sleeping with"". These sleeping problems had given him access to prescription Temazepam. Worboys married once - in 1991, to mother-of-three Jean Clayton - but they were unable to have children together and divorced in 1999. Hunched on the stand, with furrowed brow and sunken eyes, he wept as he explained it had been 13 years since he had passed ""the Knowledge"" to become a cabbie. During that time, he claimed, he carried drinks and cigarettes in his cab to hand to ""down-and-outs"". He said he impressed passengers with his ""banter"", allowing them to smoke inside provided they sit on the floor away from view, or let them believe he was doling out ecstasy tablets when in fact they were vitamin pills - his ""vitamin Es"". To officers who investigated his case, this image was as false as the tales of university days he would tell to impress young students. Det Insp Dave Reid said: ""John Worboys took advantage of his position of trust as a black cab driver in London. ""He enticed women into his cab where he took the opportunity to carry out his frightening, humiliating and degrading attacks."" This is an update on an articlewritten in 2009,external.

Search teams are scouring the area where the 21-year-old was last seen Police have been carrying out house-to-house inquiries in Hull The family said Miss Squire's disappearance was ""very out of character"" and they were ""broken without her"". More than 70 police officers have been out making inquiries, including knocking door-to-door around the area where the student vanished. About 200 students have also been involved in the search of the university premises, organised by student Ryan Tweddell. Speaking earlier, Det Supt Simon Gawthorpe said: ""There are a number of leads we are following up and I want to offer my thanks to everyone who has come forward with information, your help has been invaluable."" Miss Squire was reported missing after getting into a taxi outside the Welly Club at about 23:00 on Thursday, and is believed to have got out of the vehicle a short while later near where she lived in Wellesley Avenue. Humberside Police said she was then helped by a motorist who pulled over after spotting her sat on a bench in the street, with the force adding the man in question had since contacted them and ""really helped out"" with the search. The student was last spotted on CCTV in Beverley Road Miss Squire was last spotted on CCTV in Beverley Road, near to the junction with Haworth Street, at about 23:45 on Thursday. The officer appealed for anyone who was on Haworth Street between 23:30 and 00:30 GMT on the night she disappeared to get in touch. He said house to house inquiries were continuing in the area she was last seen and specialist teams and the coastguard were searching around the River Hull. Mr Tweddell said: ""It was great to see so many students turn out to support the search for Libby. ""We can't believe the community came out in the numbers they did, it just shows how much people care. ""Libby is a loving, down-to-earth, typical, normal student. She is hardworking, helps everyone who needs it and is a lovely, brilliant girl."" Police have asked people to check their sheds and gardens In a statement, the University of Hull said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the missing student. A spokesman said: ""We are working closely with Humberside Police to support their search for Libby and offering support to Libby's family at this distressing time."" Fire crews have been searching a frozen pond near where she was last seen Libby Squire got in a taxi outside The Welly club Police urged people living in the area to check their gardens and outbuildings in case Miss Squire had taken shelter. Anyone who was driving around the area at the time and has dashcam footage has also been asked to come forward. Miss Squire, who is 5ft 7in tall and has long dark brown hair, had been wearing a black leather jacket, black long-sleeved top and a black denim skirt with lace.

"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women A decision by the Parole Board to release the rapist John Worboys has been quashed, prompting the board's chairman Nick Hardwick to resign. A legal challenge by two victims was upheld by the High Court, and the Parole Board praised the ""bravery"" of the women who brought the action. Worboys, 60, has served 10 years, including remand time, of an indeterminate prison sentence. ""A lot of women will be sleeping a lot easier tonight,"" one victim said. The victim - known as DSD - said she was thrilled with the result and was confident the Parole Board would ""make the right decision next time because the information will be put in front of them"". Mr Worboys' case will now be referred back to the Parole Board, where a new panel will make a ""fresh determination"". In Professor Hardwick'sletter of resignation, he said he was ""sorry for the mistakes that were made in this case"", adding that Justice Secretary David Gauke had told him his position was now ""untenable"". That the Parole Board did not take into account the dozens of alleged offences that Worboys was not prosecuted for was acknowledged by the High Court. But barrister Phillippa Kaufmann QC, who represented the two victims, said the problem did not lie ""solely at the feet of the Parole Board"". She said Prof Hardwick had been ""scapegoated"" for wider failings in the system. After the High Court hearing Ms Kaufmann said: ""That material [on Worboys' alleged offences] was not put in by the Ministry of Justice itself. ""So Gauke has a responsibility here; the Ministry of Justice has a responsibility here,"" she said. Worboys, who is now known as John Radford, was convicted of one rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted assault and 12 drugging charges - but police believe he committed crimes against more than 100 women between 2002 and 2008. Analysis: Legal implications of the judgement Parole Board chairman's resignation letter The cabbie who preyed on young women In November, the Parole Board decided to approve his release with ""stringent"" licence conditions, arguing its decision was based on appropriate evidence. But the High Court judges said the Parole Board ""should have undertaken further inquiry into the circumstances of his offending"". The case will now be referred back to the Parole Board and considered by a new panel, while Worboys remains in prison. This video can not be played Victim: 'The police assumed I was some drunk' Justice Secretary Mr Gauke congratulated the victims on the ""unprecedented legal action"" and announced plans to make the Parole Board system more transparent. Responding to a question at PMQs, Prime Minister Theresa May said the ruling raised ""serious concerns"" and agreed the victims should never have had to face their attacker in court during their legal challenge. Mrs May also said she had full confidence in Mr Gauke, who had decided it ""would not be appropriate"" for the government to seek a judicial review earlier in the year. Nick Hardwick said he had been told his position as chairman of the Parole Board had become ""untenable"" But shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon has called for an independent review of the Parole Board's handling of the case. He added: ""It can't be right that women victims have to go to judicial review before the reasons for the release of John Worboys became available."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who brought the challenge with the two victims, said the decision would bring ""some reassurance to the victims and to all Londoners,external"". At a court hearing this month, lawyers for Worboys' victims and Mr Khan had argued the former cab driver had been dishonest with the Parole Board and had crafted an account to convince the panel he was a changed man. Victims told Worboys would serve life-sentence Worboys review: What we have learned They said the ""wider allegations"" against Worboysshould have been taken into account. During his original trial, jurors heard Worboys - who became known as the black-cab rapist - had picked up his victims in London's West End and given them champagne laced with sedatives, claiming he had won the lottery or had won money at casinos. Analysis by BBC home affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw This is a landmark ruling that will shape the way future parole hearings are conducted. It makes clear that when assessing a prisoner's suitability for release, details of alleged offences, as well as convictions, can be considered - as long as they're dealt with fairly. In the John Worboys case, the judges were clearly concerned that allegations for which he was not prosecuted weren't addressed by the panel that directed his release. As a result, his apparent ""honesty"" wasn't subjected to sufficient scrutiny. It remains something of a puzzle why the psychologists and parole panel members didn't examine those issues. Were they confused about the legality of doing so? Or were they taken in by the arch manipulator, Worboys? Some may regard it as unfortunate that Nick Hardwick, who'd steered through changes to reduce parole delays, won't be in place to see through the further reforms necessary. But the high-profile nature of the case, and the clear failings highlighted in the judgment, made it difficult for him to continue in such a febrile atmosphere. In a further move on Wednesday, the High Court judges found the rules which stop Parole Board decisions from being made public were unlawful. It came after the Sun newspaper, along with Mr Khan and the victims, also challenged the Parole Board's lack of openness and its failure to give reasons for its decisions. Following the judgement, Mr Gauke said such rules would be abolished. A spokesman from the Sun praised it as ""a victory for transparency and for the free press"". The Victims' Commissioner, Baroness Newlove, also said the parole process should be more victim-focussed. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith praised the victims who brought the case forward, but said the decision ""must now provoke a rethink of a criminal justice system"" in which many lacked ""confidence"". Fellow Conservative Dominic Grieve said some aspects of the case were ""quite astonishing"". He said it was difficult to understand why the Parole Board did not probe into Worboys' background. But he added that because of the number of indeterminate sentences - where no date is set for a prisoner's release - the Parole Board deals with more cases than it was designed to handle. This video can not be played Justice Secretary David Gauke says there were serious failings in the case Making a statement in the Commons, the justice secretary announced a host of proposals regarding the parole process: Parole Board decisions can be challenged and re-assessed by a judge-led panel of different Parole Board members under a new mechanism Rule 25 - which prohibits the details of Parole decisions from being made public - will be abolished All relevant evidence of past offending should be included in the dossiers submitted to the Parole Board Procedures to check that every dossier sent by HM Prison and Probation Service to the Parole Board contains every necessary piece of evidence Boost the role of the secretary of state's representative at Parole Board hearings Work with the Parole Board to review the composition of panels so that the Parole Board includes greater judicial expertise for complex, high profile cases Develop more specialist training for Parole Board panel members Parole Board chairman's resignation letter Cabbie who preyed on young women 'The police assumed I was some drunk' Video, 00:01:32'The police assumed I was some drunk' New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"Michelin's Jean-Dominique Senard and Renault's Thierry BollorÃ© Renault and Nissan have pledged to continue their alliance as its architect, Carlos Ghosn, resigned from the French carmaker. Mr Ghosn's resignation came as he remained incarcerated in Japan where he is accused of financial misconduct at Nissan. Renault said Michelin's Jean-Dominique Senard had been appointed chairman, and Thierry BollorÃ© chief executive. Mr Ghosn was sacked by Nissan shortly after his arrest on 19 November. Renault's management shake-up was welcomed by Nissan's chief executive Hiroto Saikawa. ""In the big picture, this is a big milestone that we are reaching. We are starting a new chapter. So I welcome this new leadership of Renault,"" Mr Saikawa said. The architect of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Mr Ghosn had not been sacked by Renault. Instead, the French car giant had handed day-to-day operations to Mr BollorÃ©, who now takes the role permanently. Mr Ghosn faces three charges in Japan of financial misconduct, including understating his income and aggravated breach of trust. He denies any wrongdoing and could remain in custody for months afterhis application for bail earlier this week was denied. Questions had been asked about future of the alliance - which Mitsubishi joined three years ago - which Mr Ghosn oversaw. It sold 10.6 million vehicles in 2017 and together employs 470,000 around the globe. On Thursday, as Renault announced its boardroom change it did not use Mr Ghosn's name but said: ""The board praised the alliance's track record, which has enabled it to become the world's leading automobile manufacturer"". Carlos Ghosn: Renault-Nissan's relentless 'cost killer' Carlos Ghosn: Five charts on the Nissan boss scandal Until his arrest, Mr Ghosn had achieved star status in Japan. Born in Porto Velho, Brazil, to Lebanese parents, according to one poll he was the man most Japanese women wanted to marry and in another he came seventh in a poll of who should run the country. He oversaw Nissan's recovery after Renault took a stake in the then-troubled car maker in 1999, the start of the alliance. Renault's new chairman, Mr Senard, will be responsible for managing Renault's alliance with Japanese carmaker Nissan, while Mr BollorÃ© will co-ordinate the carmaker's activities. Mr Senard also backed the alliance.   ""It's important that this alliance remain extremely strong,"" Mr Senard said.  ""It is our compulsory duty to go forward together."" The French union CGT has estimated that Mr Ghosn could be in line for a severance deal of up to â¬28m (Â£24.5m)  in addition to an annual pension of â¬800,000. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire  told AFP the government, which owns a 15% stake in Renault, would be  ""extremely vigilant as key shareholders on the exit conditions that will be set by the (Renault) board of directors"". He said Mr Senard's main responsibility ""will be to ensure the future of the alliance between Renault and Nissan and to strengthen it"". Carlos Ghosn faces three charges of financial misconduct in Japan for understating his income and aggravated breach of trust Prof David Bailey at Aston Business School said the alliance would no longer be able to rely on Mr Ghosn to hold it together, but it was important that the alliance remained, because of the cost pressures facing the industry. ""They are going to have to come up with new ways to glue it together,"" Prof Bailey said. Renault has said previously that it has not found any evidence of wrongdoing yet, and an investigation into executive pay has shown no signs of fraud so far. Mr  Saikawa said ""communication between the boards of the two companies has been a bit difficult"" since Mr Ghosn's arrest, and that he was looking forward to ""better communication"". Nissan said it had now begun preparations to hold an extraordinary general meeting in April to discuss new board members. The agenda will be to cover the departure of Carlos Ghosn and Greg Kelly, an aide to Mr Ghosn who was arrested in November and bailed on Christmas Day. The shareholder meeting will also cover the appointment of a new director to be nominated by Renault.

"The leopard cub was hidden in a plastic grocery basket An air passenger who arrived in India from Thailand has been detained at the airport after customs officers found a month-old leopard cub in his luggage. Suspicions were raised when officials heard noises coming from his bag, which was found to contain the 2.2lb (1kg) cub hidden in a plastic grocery basket. The man had arrived at Chennai airport on Saturday on a flight from Bangkok. Authorities are investigating whether the suspect is part of an international smuggling ring, officials told AFP. The 45-year-old, who has not yet been officially named, was said to have been ""evasive in his replies"" when questioned about his luggage by customs officers. Airport officials said the cub looked ""weak"" ""The animal was in a state of shock and was making trill sounds, and appeared to be weak,"" airport officials said.

"A coalition of investors is calling on McDonald's, KFC, and other fast food suppliers to take swift action on climate change. The group, with around $6.5 trillion under management, want the chains to cut carbon and water risks in their dairy and meat suppliers. Animal agriculture, they argue, is one of the highest emitting sectors without a low CO2 plan. McDonald's says it has put in place strong climate targets for suppliers. Meat, veg, nuts - a diet designed to feed 10bn Is meat too hot for politicians? Meat substitutes 'exceeding salt limits' The investors group have targeted some of the largest companies in the global fast food sector that's said to be worth $570bn. As well as McDonald's, these include Domino's Pizza, Burger King, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Wendy's, Pizza Hut and KFC. More than 80 investors have signed a letter to the fast food giants asking them to ""enact meaningful policies and targets"" to reduce the carbon footprint of their meat and dairy supply chains. They are concerned by ananalysis of the meat and dairy producers that supply the fast food giants,external. Agricultural emissions including those from meat and dairy are on track to contribute around 70% of the total allowable greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 that would the keep rise in the world's temperature under 2C this century. The livestock sector is also estimated to use approximately 10% of annual global water flows. In their letter, they are calling on the chains to put in place clear requirements for suppliers of animal proteins to report and reduce their greenhouse gases and their freshwater impacts. They want the companies to publish quantitative, time bound targets for reductions and commit to publicly disclose the progress on these targets. The investors say they are calling for these steps to help these fast food companies minimise their future risks. ""When it comes to evaluating market risk, rising global temperatures and intensifying competition for water access are increasingly material factors for investors,"" said Eugenie Mathieu, from Aviva Investors, one of the signatories. ""This is especially the case in the meat and dairy sector. From field to fork, investors want to understand which food companies are monitoring and minimising the long-term environmental risks in their supply chain. This engagement sends a clear message to the fast food sector that investors expect them to deliver sustainable supply chains."" However a spokesperson for McDonald's poured scorn on the idea that they are not doing enough to ensure their supply chains are combating climate change. They say that in 2018, McDonald's became the first restaurant company in the world to address global climate change by setting a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which has been approved by theScience Based Targets initiative,external. ""This includes reducing emissions intensity in our supply chain through engagement and collaboration with suppliers and farmers - which we expect will prevent 150 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions from being released into the atmosphere by 2030,"" the spokesperson said. ""This is the equivalent of taking 32 million passenger cars off the road for an entire year or planting 3.8 billion trees and growing them for 10 years. The target will enable McDonald's to grow as a business without growing its emissions."" Consumption of meat and dairy produce has been under renewed focus in recent weeks, after theEAT-Lancet commission report,external. Their experts suggested that a sustainable, ""planetary health diet"" to feed an expected population of ten billion people by mid century would imply a 90% reduction in red meat and milk consumption. If these recommendations are to have any real impact, the fast food sector will have to take stronger measures. ""Investors are eager to see more leadership from these companies to reduce the mounting climate and water risks linked to their meat and dairy suppliers,"" said Mindy Lubber, from Ceres, the nonprofit organisation working with investors on climate, water scarcity and pollution. ""From eliminating deforestation to reducing water waste, cleaning up their supply chains will have enormous impacts on the animal agriculture sector as a whole, and dramatically increase our ability to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming."" The companies behind the letter are calling for meaningful action by March.

"These chickens have a human gene that enables them to lay eggs containing useful drugs Researchers have genetically modified chickens that can lay eggs that contain drugs for arthritis and some cancers. The drugs are 100 times cheaper to produce when laid than when manufactured in factories. The researchers believe that in time production can be scaled up to produce medicines in commercial quantities. The chickens do not suffer and are ""pampered"" compared to farm animals, according to Dr Lissa Herron, of Roslin Technologies in Edinburgh. ""They live in very large pens. They are fed and watered and looked after on a daily basis by highly trained technicians, and live quite a comfortable life. ""As far as the chicken knows, it's just laying a normal egg. It doesn't affect its health in any way, it's just chugging away, laying eggs as normal."" Scientists have previously shown that genetically modified goats, rabbits and chickens can be used to produce protein therapies in their milk or eggs. The researchers say their new approach is more efficient, produces better yields and is more cost-effective than these previous attempts. ""Production from chickens can cost anywhere from 10 to 100 times less than the factories. So hopefully we'll be looking at at least 10 times lower overall manufacturing cost"" said Dr Herron. Battery ""pharming"": these eggs contain drugs produced at a tenth of the cost of normal production in laboratories The biggest saving comes from the fact that chicken sheds are far cheaper to build and run than highly sterile clean rooms for factory production. Many diseases are caused because the body does not naturally produce enough of a certain chemical or protein. Such diseases can be controlled with drugs that contain the deficient protein. These drugs are synthetically produced by pharmaceutical companies and can be very expensive to manufacture. Dr Herron and her colleagues managed to reduce the costs by inserting a human gene - which normally produces the protein in humans - into the part of the chickens' DNA involved with producing the white in the chickens' eggs. After cracking the eggs and separating the white from the yolk, Dr Herron discovered that the chicken had relatively large quantities of the protein. The team has focused on two proteins that are essential to the immune system: one is IFNalpha2a, which has powerful antiviral and anti-cancer effects, and the other is macrophage-CSF, which is being developed as a therapy that stimulates damaged tissues to repair themselves. Three eggs are enough to produce a dose of the drug, and chickens can lay up to 300 eggs per year. With enough chickens, the researchers believe they can produce drugs in commercial quantities. The development of drugs for human health, and the regulatory hoops required, will take between 10 and 20 years. The researchers are hopeful of using chickens to develop drugs for animal health. These include drugs which boost the immune systems of farm animals as an alternative to antibiotics, which would reduce the risk of the development of new strains of antibiotic-resistant superbugs.  And there is the potential to use the healing properties of macrophage-CSF to treat pets, according to Dr Herron. ""For example, we could use it in regenerating the liver or the kidneys of a pet that has suffered damage to these organs. The drugs currently available are a bit too pricey so we hope that we might be able to get into that a little more,"" she explained. Professor Helen Sang, of the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, said: ""We are not yet producing medicines for people, but this study shows that chickens are commercially viable for producing proteins suitable for drug discovery studies and other applications in biotechnology."" The eggs are produced for research purposes and not on sale in supermarkets.

"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson An underwater search for the missing plane carrying footballer Emiliano Sala and his pilot is under way. Cardiff City's new signing disappeared with pilot David Ibbotson over the English Channel on 21 January. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said its Geo Ocean III vessel arrived on Sunday morning to the search area. Together with a privately-funded vessel, it is conducting sonar surveys off Guernsey. The AAIB said its search was expected to last three days, while the private search will continue ""until the plane is located"". Cushions believed to be from the planewere found on a beach near Surtainville, on France's Cotentin Peninsula, on Monday. Argentine Sala, 28, and Mr Ibbotson, 59, from Crowle, North Lincolnshire, were travelling from Nantes, where Sala previously played, when the flight was lost. This video can not be played The vessels are using sonar to search the seabed Nantes pay tribute to missing Sala Sala's family 'struggling with few answers' Speaking from Guernsey harbour, David Mearns said his team on board the FPV Morven would work jointly with the AAIB's vessel. They plan to search an area covering four square miles about 24 nautical miles north of Guernsey. The location has been based on the flight path before it lost radar contact, said Mr Mearns, a shipwreck hunter. An official search following the plane's disappearance was called off after three days with Guernsey officials saying there was little chance those on board survived. Geo Ocean III will search the water for the next three days It prompted a privately-funded search to be set-up, with Â£324,000 was raised in an online appeal. Sala'sfamily arrived on Guernseyfollowing his disappearance and were taken to see the area, circling the island of Alderney.

"The war-damaged block was in a formerly rebel-held area that had been bombed before Syrian forces retook it At least 11 people including four children were killed when a war-damaged apartment block collapsed in the city of Aleppo, state media said. A child was the only survivor from the collapse in the formerly rebel-held area of Salaheddin, which was bombed by Syria and Russia before being retaken. Residents have been eking out a living in ruins across Syria, with little rebuilding taking place. Syria's authorities have so far focused their efforts on basic infrastructure. Several other buildings in Salaheddin near the five-storey block that caved in are on the brink of collapse, AFP reported. Who will help rebuild the former 'capital' of IS? Why is there a war in Syria? UN satellite data from 2017 suggested that more than 35,000 structures in the city had suffered damage. The small amount of residential reconstruction that has taken place there has been carried out privately, AFP reported. The collapse of the building has highlighted the problem of buildings rendered unsafe by war damage that have yet to be rebuilt. Entire cities and suburbs have been shattered by fighting between the Syrian government, rebel groups and the Islamic State (IS) group, with the Syrian government, its ally Russia and the US-led coalition against IS all carrying out thousands of air strikes. A boy was the only survivor to be pulled from the rubble He was then carried to safety by volunteer rescuers The US says it will now cost between $300bn (Â£230bn) and $400bn to rebuild Syria's ruined housing and infrastructure. However the West has refused to provide funds unless there is wide-ranging political reform in Damascus. In the city of Raqqa, where IS formerly had its headquarters, the US-led coalition carried out more than 6,000 air strikes during the 2017 campaign to drive out the extremists, reducing much of the city to rubble in the process. Some families have since returned but rebuilding work there has yet to start in earnest. This video can not be played A Syrian family's return to Raqqa after five years of struggle Other areas to see widespread destruction include the city of Homs and the Damascus suburbs of Daraya and eastern Ghouta, where government forces besieged rebels and eventually forced them to agree ceasefire deals. Last year the governor of Homs provinceTalal al-Barazi told AP that Syria needed a million new housing units,external. The Syrian authorities have imposed a reconstruction tax of 0.55% on some goods and are also appealing to the Syrian business community and expatriates to provide funds. Russia, Iran and China, who have backed Mr Assad, have made some investments in the country.Western sanctions against Syria have also made it difficult for foreign companies to work there,external, Reuters reported.
