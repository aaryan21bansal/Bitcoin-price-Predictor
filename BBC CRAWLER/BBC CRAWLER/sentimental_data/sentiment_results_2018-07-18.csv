"The regulator of heath care services in England is calling for a limit on how long it takes to report the results of patients' x-rays and scans. The Care Quality Commission's review of radiology practices found that the process could vary from one hour to two working days in hospital A&Es. This could mean delays in results being shared with doctors and patients receiving timely care. The review also said there were not enough radiologists to meet demand. The Care Quality Commission asked all 151 health trusts in England to reveal their own internal benchmarks for radiology reporting - and it found huge variations in the time taken to examine and report on scans and x-rays. For urgent or fast track cases, this varied from two to five working days In A&E, the range was one hour to two working days And for GP referrals, while some trusts aimed to report back within 24 hours, others settled for 21 days The review also said a shortage of radiologists was contributing to delays and backlogs. The CQC has called for national standards for hospitals to ensure timely reporting. Cancer Research UK said radiology scans were crucial in diagnosing many cancers, and it was extremely worrying that some patients were waiting a long time. Serious concerns had already been aired after inspections of three NHS trusts, where backlogs and delays to radiology reporting were felt to be putting patients at risk. The trusts were Worcester Royal Hospital, Kettering General Hospital and Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth. Professor Ted Baker, CQC's chief inspector of hospitals, said: ""While our review found some examples of good practice, it also revealed a major disparity in timescales for interpreting and reporting on examinations, meaning that some patients are waiting far longer than others for their results. ""We are calling for agreed national standards to ensure consistent, timely reporting of radiological examinations,"" he said. ""This will allow trusts to monitor and benchmark their own performances - and ensure that, for example, patients are not put at risk by delays in their x-ray results being reported to the clinician responsible for their care."" He added that many trusts relied on outsourcing to external providers or delegating reporting to non-radiology clinical staff to cope with an increasing workload. But he said that those with the job of interpreting x-rays had to be ""appropriately trained to do so"".

"Karen White is accused of four counts of sexual touching at New Hall Prison, Wakefield A transgender prisoner has been charged with committing four sexual offences against inmates at a women's jail in West Yorkshire. Karen White, 51, is accused of four counts of sexual touching at New Hall Prison, Wakefield. The offences are alleged to have taken place between September and November last year. She appeared before magistrates earlier this month and is due to appear at Leeds Crown Court in August. More from Yorkshire Ms White, who was born male but now identifies as a woman, has since been moved to a male prison. Ministry of Justice (MoJ) guidance says in the ""great majority"" of cases transgender prisoners are allowed to ""experience the system"" in the gender in which they identify. The department said there were ""strict safeguards"" to prevent abuse of the way transgender prisoners are managed, and attempts to undermine the system were rare.

"Students arriving in Melbourne - ranked this year as one of the world's best student cities Australia is overtaking the UK as the world's second biggest destination for international students, says research from University College London. Researchers at UCL's Centre for Global Higher Education say the UK is being pushed into third place behind the United States and Australia. Australia has been rapidly expanding its international student numbers. The British Council says it shows the UK needs to ""look again"" at its policies towards overseas students. An analysis this year found that overseas students added Â£20bn to the UK's economy - and universities in the UK have warned that immigration rules after Brexit will need to be more welcoming for students. The UCL study has tracked the latest movements in international students and report author Professor Simon Marginson says Australia is moving ahead of the UK. He warns that Canada is also catching up in taking a growing slice of the lucrative overseas student market. Overseas students starting in Melbourne this year were invited to a welcome party and dance Three years ago the UK was recruiting around 130,000 more overseas students than Australia, says Prof Marginson, who is also co-chair of the Higher Education Commission's current inquiry into international students. But he says successive years of Australia having increases of 12% to 14% in overseas students have seen it catch up and overtake the UK, which has been growing much more slowly. Official student figures for 2018 from the UN's education agency, Unesco, will not be published until after the end of this year. But the UCL researchers are ""certain"" that Australia is on the verge of moving ahead of the UK in overseas students and this ""may have already happened"". ""UK higher education is still highly valued internationally, but the government has held down the growth of international student numbers for five years, by limiting new student numbers and post-study work visas,"" says Prof Marginson. ""Meanwhile, competitor nations are strongly promoting their international education."" Overseas students add Â£20bn to the economy Door kept open to EU students after Brexit London ranked best city for students Trump's biggest fans? Canadian universities Australia has been marketing itself as an English-speaking country with high-performing universities, with an attractive climate and a welcoming culture for overseas students. This year's Best Student Cities rankings put Melbourne and Sydney in the top 10 - although London was the highest ranked of all. Australia has succeeded in attracting students from outside Europe, particularly from China. The research from UCL warns that the UK's future intake of international students will depend on keeping its appeal for European students. Last week, the government set out post-Brexit plans that would keep open the door to visa-free travel for European Union students coming to UK universities. But there was no detail on whether EU students would have to pay full international fees. Universities in the UK have been campaigning for overseas students to be taken out of net migration figures. A spokeswoman for the British Council said that international students are ""an immense source of long-term influence and soft power for the UK"". She said the UK was competing with countries with ""welcoming visa policies"" and ""comprehensive international education strategies"". With the approach of Brexit, she said ""it has never been more important to reinforce and open up international channels for the UK"".

"Tanyalee Davis is an award-winning comedian who bases much of her comedy on her experiences A comedian who criticised a train firm after she was ""humiliated"" for using a disabled space for her mobility scooter has thanked the public for their support. Tanyalee Davis, who lives in Norwich, said a Great Western Railway (GWR) service guard threatened to call the police if she did not leave the space. Ms Davis said she was ""amazed"" by the support she had received. The government said the treatment was ""entirely unacceptable"". GWR said on Tuesday that staff who saw the video were ""collectively horrified"". Ms Davis said: ""I can't tell you how amazed I am by the amount of support we have received through YouTube and the BBC and ITV. I feel very honoured.""

"Dame Margaret Hodge has been a fierce critic of Labour's new anti-Semitism guidelines Labour MP Margaret Hodge faces ""action"" by the party after reportedly swearing at Jeremy Corbyn and calling him an ""anti-Semite"". A spokesman for the Labour leader said what had happened was ""clearly unacceptable between colleagues"". The alleged confrontation came after Labour adopted new guidelines on anti-Semitism, which were criticised by some Jewish leaders and some MPs. Ms Hodge said she chose to ""confront"" Mr Corbyn to express her ""outrage"". The code of conduct was rubber-stamped by the executive committee on Tuesday. It says: ""Anti-Semitism is racism. It is unacceptable in our party and in wider society."" But it does not include all of the ""working examples"" given in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA)definition of anti-Semitism,external. Following criticism, Labour said it would ""reopen development of the code"" in consultation with Jewish groups. New Labour anti-Semitism code criticised Chief rabbi warns Labour over anti-Semitism Dame Margaret, the MP for Barking, clashed with Mr Corbyn in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday. Mr Corbyn's spokesman declined to reveal the precise nature of the action being taken against her but said it would be taken under Parliamentary Labour Party procedures requiring MPs to behave in a ""respectful"" way towards colleagues and not to ""bring the party into disrepute"". Without confirming the language she had used, Dame Margaretwrote in The Guardian,externalthat she ""confronted Jeremy Corbyn in Parliament and told him to his face what I and many others are feeling"". Labour was ""so distrusted by the Jewish community, we are the last people on earth, at this time, who should think about amending a widely accepted definition of anti-Semitism"", she said. The Israel-Palestine conflict, she said, had been ""allowed to infect the party's approach to growing anti-Semitism"" saying she and other Jewish MPs had received growing amounts of anti-Semitic abuse. In adopting its new code, the party ""chose to make the party a hostile environment for Jews"", she said, adding: ""I stand by my action as well as my words."" The decision to take action against Dame Margaret has been criticised, with Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educations Trust, describing it as ""extraordinary and just appalling"". Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband tweeted: ""It is the Labour leadership which has brought the party into disrepute - not Margaret Hodge. How dare they preach about 'respect between colleagues' when this very code legitimises the most appalling disrespect."" Labour's code of conduct was drawn up after the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry that followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks. The code does reproduce the IHRA's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples from that definition: Accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country Claiming that Israel's existence as a state is a racist endeavour Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis Labour's code says it is ""wrong"" to accuse Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their own country. And it says that using Nazi comparisons in Israel-Palestine debates ""carries a strong risk of being regarded as prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"", triggering a disciplinary investigation. A party spokeswoman said: ""The code of conduct adopts the IHRA definition and expands on and contextualises the IHRA examples to produce robust, legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases."" Mr Corbyn has said he is ""committed to eliminating anti-Semitism wherever it exists"". ""Prejudice and hatred of Jewish people has no place whatsoever in the Labour Party,"" he said earlier this year.

"Under-pressure NHS services in England are spending over Â£1bn a year buying care from outside the NHS because they are unable to keep up with demand. The bill is being racked up by hospitals, ambulances and mental health trusts, data obtained by the BBC shows. NHS managers said money was being wasted as often it was done at the last minute, and led to the NHS over-paying. Sending patients to private clinics for care like hip and knee surgery is thought to be the most common purchase. 10 charts that show why the NHS is in trouble Phillippa Hentsch, of NHS Providers, which represents trusts, said these decisions were often made as a ""last resort"" where the only alternative would be to cancel. ""Hospitals have to hand over the patients because they have simply not got the beds, staff or theatres free to see them due to the pressures on the emergency side. ""The best interests of the patients are what are paramount. But it is valuable income that is lost to those hospitals. It seems such a waste"" she said. ""In some cases hospitals are over-paying for these treatments and tests. It is another sign that things are not working properly."" The figures have been provided to the BBC by NHS Improvement, the financial regulator for the health service. They show that in each of the last two years just over Â£1bn has been spent by NHS trusts on buying health care from non-NHS bodies. Figures are not available for earlier years. As well as non-emergency operations, the spending is also going on hospitals buying places in care homes to get elderly patients off wards. Ambulances sometimes have to use private crews to transport the less serious patients, and mental health bosses have paid for beds in private hospitals because they have run out of space. Charities are also used to provide support in areas such as cancer and palliative care. David Hare, chief executive of the NHS Partners Network, which represents private health care firms, said there were ""considerable benefits"". He said the flexibility of being able to buy in support could help reduce pressure and improve care. ""It is right that NHS trusts are able to make local decisions about how best to spend precious NHS resources. At a time of immense pressure it makes no sense to leave available capacity from the private and voluntary sectors 'on the shelf'."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said that despite the sums involved the amount spent was still ""low"" given the overall size of the budget - for NHS trusts it exceeds Â£70bn. ""We remain clear that the NHS will remain free at the point of use both now and in the future,"" he added.

"The Shinil Group say this is the nameplate of the sunken Donskoi A Russian warship that sank 113 years ago has been found off the coast of a South Korean island, salvagers say. The Shinil Group, a South Korean firm, says it found the vessel Dimitrii Donskoi near Ulleungdo island. Companies have claimed in the past to have found the wreck, amid historic rumours of treasure on board. The cruiser was scuttled by her crew in 1905 after Japan's victory in the Battle of Tsushima - a key moment of the Russo-Japanese War. Setting sail in 1885, the armoured cruiser served in the Mediterranean and the Baltic before heading to the Pacific. The ship served in the Mediterranean and the Baltic before sailing to the Pacific While not badly damaged in the battle itself, the ship fell behind the fleet and was attacked by the Japanese. Her crew scuttled the Donskoi off Ulleungdo. Rumours persist that the Donskoi was carrying the gold for Russia's Pacific Fleet, used to pay crew salaries and docking fees - gold which would be worth billions of dollars if found today. But no proof exists that the ship carried gold, with academics raising doubts that a warship would carry such valuable cargo. Kirill Kolesnichenko, a professor of social sciences at Russia's Far Eastern Federal University, told Russian news site RIA Novosti thatkeeping all your money on one ship would be too dangerous,external. He asked why Russia would send gold by ship when it could move it by train to Vladivostok without any risk. The Wreck Detectives Pictures show Black Sea ""ship graveyard"" Hunting the shipwrecks of the slave trade Nevertheless, several Japanese and South Korean companies have made efforts to find the ship in the last century. Don-A Construction was declared bankrupt by a Seoul District Court in 2001 after claiming to have found the wreck, but failing to lift it from the depths. Now, Shinil Group say they have finally found the Donskoi, and have posted photos online and footage on YouTube of their team's alleged discovery. Allow YouTube content?

However, doubts have been raised about the company. South Korean news websiteChosun Biz reported that Shinil Group was only founded in June,external, even though it says it is the successor company to Shinil Corporation, formed in 1957. Moreover, the company was reportedly only formed with about 100 million Korean won (Â£67,689). The company still has not applied for salvage rights to South Korea's Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, BBC Korean says, and were it to do so it would need to pay 10% of the estimated value of the wreck - which, if rumours are true, would be far more than the company is worth. Shinil Group told BBC Korean that they would hold a press conference soonto explain all doubts, and that salvage will take ""about three months"". Should shipwrecks be left alone?

"Mr Erdogan won re-election last month The Turkish government has ended the nationwide state of emergency that was imposed two years ago after a failed coup attempt, state media say. Under the state of emergency, tens of thousands of people were arrested or dismissed from their jobs. However the government has decided against extending it again after seven three-month renewals. The decision comes weeks after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan won re-election. During the campaign, opposition candidates said that the first thing they would do if they won would be to end the state of emergency. Reality Check: The numbers behind the crackdown in Turkey A brief guide to Turkey's coup Erdogan: The full story More than 107,000 people have been removed from public sector jobs by emergency decree since the state of emergency began and more than 50,000 people have been imprisoned pending trial, according to official statistics and NGOs. Many of those dismissed are alleged to be supporters of the exiled Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States and is a former ally of Mr Erdogan. Turkey accuses Mr Gulen and his followers of organising the coup, but he denies it. The 2016 coup attempt saw parliament bombed by military aircraft and more than 250 people killed.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said it was ""not too late to save Brexit"" Boris Johnson has said it is ""not too late to save Brexit"" as he accused Theresa May of ""dithering"" over the UK's strategy for leaving the EU. In a resignation speech in the Commons, the former foreign secretary said a ""needless fog of self-doubt"" had descended over the past 18 months. While praising the PM's ""courage and resilience"", he said her Chequers plan would see the UK in ""miserable limbo"". He quit 10 days ago, saying he could not support the PM's EU blueprint. BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said Mr Johnson's friends were insisting he was not trying to emulate Sir Geoffrey Howe, whose caustic resignation speech in 1990 is widely seen as having paved the way for Margaret Thatcher's downfall weeks later. But by suggesting there was time for Mrs May to change her approach, she said he appeared to be telling MPs that it would be ""in their hands"" if she didn't. PM answers MPs Brexit questions Brexit deal must be 'workable' - May Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Addressing MPs, Mr Johnson said the ""bright certainties"" that followed the 2016 Brexit vote had dissipated and the UK risked ending up in ""economic vassalage"" if it agreed to follow EU regulations on trade, the environment and social affairs. He said the vision set out by Mrs May in her Lancaster House speech in January 2017 for a ""strong independent, self-governing Britain"" had never been turned into a firm negotiating position. By Laura Kuenssberg, the BBC's political editor It's the first Boris Johnson speech that I can remember watching that didn't have any jokes. For his allies, that was the point. It wasn't designed, they say, to make a personal attack on Theresa May. But my goodness, it made a pretty savage attack on her policies - a ""fog of self-doubt"", ""pretending to the electorate"", ""a fantastical Heath Robinson"" proposal on customs, ""miserable permanent limbo"". For someone who less than a fortnight ago celebrated collective cabinet responsibility at Chequers, that's quite some feat. Laura's full blog The government, he claimed, had simply not tried to make the case for a loose arrangement with the EU based on a wide-ranging free trade deal. Instead, he said the UK had conceded ground over the divorce bill, the role of the European Court of Justice and the Northern Ireland border, which he said had needlessly become ""politically charged"" and resulted in a ""fantastical, Heath Robinson"" customs arrangement being put forward. Ministers, he warned, were ""saying one thing to the EU about what we are really doing, and pretending another to the electorate"" - a situation which voters would see through. Allow Twitter content?

""Given that in important ways this is Brexit in name only, I am of course unable to support it, as I said in cabinet at Chequers, and am happy to be able now to speak out against it. ""It is not too late to save Brexit. We have time in these negotiations. We have changed tack once and we can change again. ""We need to take one decision now before all others - and that is to believe in this country and what it can do because the UK's admirers across the world are fully expecting us to take back control."" Mr Johnson's speech was retweeted by a host of prominent Brexiteer Tories, among them Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the influential European Research Group of MPs. Allow Twitter content?

At the same time as Mr Johnson was attacking her Brexit strategy, Mrs May was defending it before the Liaison Committee of MPs. She conceded that her proposed post-Brexit trade and tariff arrangements were a ""novel idea"" that did not exist anywhere else in the world, adding that that did not matter, if they were the ""best"" arrangements for the UK. Profile: Boris Johnson Boris Johnson under fire over newspaper role Earlier she had said at PMQs that the final Brexit deal must honour the 2016 referendum result but also be ""workable"" in terms of protecting jobs and livelihoods. On Wednesday evening Mrs May addressed the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, where one - Simon Clarke - announced he had withdrawn a letter calling for a vote of no confidence in the PM. Mr Clarke said he remained ""deeply opposed"" to the Chequers agreement but that Mrs May deserved a chance to negotiate and ""see what comes back"". Tempers have been running high in the Commons over planning for the UK's March 2019 exit. In the past 48 hours, the government has narrowly won a series of votes on trade and customs arrangements despite substantial rebellions by pro-European Tories. Would-be rebels were reportedly warned on Tuesday that opposing the government in a vote on a customs union would lead to a vote of confidence and potentially a general election. The government ultimately won the vote by a margin of six.

"A college drop-out who sought revenge for his uncle's death in Syria has been convicted of preparing to attack Downing Street and kill the PM. Naa'imur Rahman, 20, was convicted at the Old Bailey after he was trapped in a major undercover operation involving the FBI, MI5 and police. Rahman approached officers posing online as fellow extremists, asking them for help with an attack. He met two and repeatedly asked for bombs - leading to his conviction. He has now been jailed for aminimum of 30 years. Last summer Rahman was homeless in London after falling out with both his mother in the city and close relatives in Walsall, where he grew up. Walsall to Syria: Fighters, travellers and victims? Three years ago he was referred to the national deradicalisation scheme, Channel, amid concerns that the-then teenager could be brainwashed by his uncle. When he was investigated last year over an allegation of sexting with an underage girl, intelligence emerged from his phone that he had maintained contact with his uncle. Rahman's uncle Musadikur Rohaman died in a drone strike in Syria Musadikur Rohaman left the UK for Syria in 2014. The Old Bailey trial heard that he'd been encouraging his nephew to attack the UK and had sent him bomb-making plans and other extremist material. However, in late June 2017, Rohaman was killed in a coalition drone strike on IS fighters near the city of Raqqa. When Rahman learnt of his uncle's death, prosecutors told the trial that he planned his revenge. Rahman made contact with IS recruiters via social media - but unbeknown to him the contact was actually an FBI agent. That agent referred Rahman to an MI5 team of online role players who convinced him that they were genuine IS figures. ""I want to do a suicide bomb on Parliament,"" Rahman told the MI5 role players. ""I want to attempt to kill Theresa May. All I need now is a sleeper cell to lay low for now."" Despite his total lack of skills or training, MI5 was concerned that Rahman would press ahead, so counter-terrorism chiefs launched an elaborate undercover operation to gather evidence of his intent. As Rahman kept asking for help, the MI5 team introduced him to an undercover police officer in London posing as an Islamic State weapons fixer. The jury watched secretly recorded video of Rahman meeting ""Shaq"" in a car and setting out his aspirations. He told the story of his uncle's killing - and asked for a truck bomb and firearms  - before conceding he could neither drive nor fire a gun. Rahman then settled for storming Downing Street in an attempt to kill Theresa May. On 6 November last year, Rahman laid out his final plan to ""Shaq"" - a recording of it was played in court. ""I have drawn up a plan, gone through it in detail in my head. You know at the gate of Downing Street? There are about four men innit? And two men on the door? ""I want to get past that gate and if I can get to the door I want to make a dash for Theresa May. She sleeps there every night."" Undercover officers gave Rahman a fake bomb Shaq asked Rahman to elaborate on how he thought this was possible. ""If I have a backpack with stuff inside and I do that at the gate and I get past the gate... a 10-second sprint to the door."" ""I'll be honest with you,"" replied Shaq. ""I've never looked at it."" ""I wanna drop a bag at the gate, so the gate blows up a bit and I can go through and then like, make a run, like I was thinking taking a human hostage until I get to the actual door. ""Grab a human shield and then once I get close enough to the door, I'll do what I can with them to get inside."" ""You're trying to get to Number 10,"" asked Shaq. ""That's your main objective?"" ""Take her head off, yeah,"" replied Rahman. Rahman said he couldn't fund the attack because he was ""broke and homeless"" - but he handed over a jacket and a rucksack, asking for both to be filled with explosives. The jacket was filled with fake explosives Shaq returned the items with a fake bomb in the bag and the jacket filled with supposed explosives. Rahman took both off him and said: ""Do you know? Now I've seen everything it feels good."" As he walked away from the scene he was surrounded by police, arrested, and later said: ""I'm glad it's over."" Rahman told his trial that none of his plans was serious. When he made contact with men whom he thought were his uncle's comrades in Syria, he had begun showing off, making up schemes to impress them. Prosecutors showed Rahman (circled) had carried out extensive reconnaissance He told jurors that one fantastical proposal had been to build balloons to drop missiles from the edge of space. Rahman claimed he had been set up and tricked by MI5 and the police. But prosecutors showed that Rahman had carried out extensive reconnaissance of Downing Street, Parliament and nearby government buildings. The jury had to be convinced that Rahman had seriously intended to attack Downing Street and had taken the first steps along that course. In sentencing, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: ""I am sure that at all material times Rahman believed the devices to be real and capable of causing serious harm.""

"The majority of military personnel in Scotland are facing higher income tax bills The UK government is to compensate thousands of soldiers who faced having to pay more income tax because they are based in Scotland. Anyone earning more than about Â£26,000 in Scotland now pays more income tax than they would if they lived elsewhere in the UK. The MoD says about 8,000 military personnel have been affected. They will now be reimbursed with an annual payment to ensure all military staff pay the same tax. Income tax rates and bands have been devolved to Holyrood, with the Scottish government using its new powers to introduce what it says is a more ""progressive"" taxation system than the three-band system in place elsewhere in the UK. How much income tax do I pay? The new Scottish system adds a 19% ""starter"" rate for those on low incomes, as well as a 21% rate for those who earn above Â£24,000. It also adds a penny to the higher and top rates, bringing them to 41% and 46%. The changes mean lower earners pay slightly less tax than those elsewhere in the UK, while middle and higher earners pay more. The new scheme was announced by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson The UK government has said the changes mean about 70% of its military personnel in Scotland are now facing higher bills than their colleagues elsewhere. It argues this could make Scotland a ""less attractive place for military personnel to be posted to"", and could impact on recruitment and retention. It has previously been estimated that a staff sergeant would pay about Â£117 a year more in Scotland, with a major paying about Â£660 more, a lieutenant colonel about Â£863 more and a full colonel an extra Â£1,013. However, a private based in Scotland would pay about Â£20 a year less in income tax. The MoD says personnel who have been affected by tax rises in Scotland will now be compensated with an annual payment to ensure no troops have to pay more because of where they are deployed or where their families are based. It said its plan will see ""mitigation payments"" of between Â£12 and Â£1,500 paid to regular personnel who pay Scottish Income Tax, regardless of where in the world they are serving.. The MoD said the total cost for the current tax year is expected to be Â£4m, with the case for the payments being reviewed annually. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""It is completely wrong for the brave men and women of our armed forces to be punished for serving in Scotland by unfair raids on their pay packets by the Scottish government. ""That's why we have taken this urgent action to ensure that our troops are treated equally and fairly."" The Scottish government said it hadoffered to discuss the issue with the UK governmentearlier this year but did not receive a reply. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said: ""As a result of the Scottish government's progressive tax system 70% of people in Scotland are paying less tax this year than they did last year for a given income and we hope those who have seen their tax bills reduce will not be disadvantaged by the UK government's proposals. ""We are fully committed to supporting the armed forces community and armed forces families in Scotland benefit from services not available elsewhere in the UK, such as free school meals, prescriptions and eye tests, and tuition fee and living cost support in higher education when they are ordinarily resident. ""It is disappointing that, despite making an offer to discuss the differential taxation of military personnel, the Scottish government has not been consulted on the proposal announced by the MoD.""

"Ronald James poked members of the flight crew and demanded to see the captain A plane passenger who flew into a rage after being denied a bacon roll by cabin crew has been fined Â£230. Ronald James, 68, shouted at staff and ""poked them with his finger"", leaving one in tears when his demand to see the captain was refused, a court heard. Exeter Magistrates' Court heard the row broke out because James had promised his grand-daughter the breakfast treat. He admitted behaving in a threatening, abusive, insulting or disorderly manner. Magistrates also ordered him to pay Â£50 compensation to two air stewardesses. More on this story and other Devon news The court heard Mr James was returning from Palma to Exeter in April with his daughter and grand-daughter on airline TUI. Prosecutor Lyndsey Baker accused Mr James of intimidating crew members after being denied access to the cockpit. Ronald James ""intimidated crew members"" after he was denied a bacon roll At one point, his face was just 5cm (2in) from the face of a female crew member, which left her in tears, the court heard. Ms Baker said: ""He was told he could not go up to the cockpit and was shouting face to face at her. ""He shouted and pointed at the cabin crew, poking staff with his finger, and refused to sit down when landing."" Disabled comedian 'humiliated' on train 'Queue jump bagged me Â£1m Lotto win' Abusive school voicemail shocks mum The argument lasted for ""a couple of minutes"" when the flight was 25 minutes from landing in Exeter, Devon. Ms Baker said the row started because Mr James had ""promised"" his grand-daughter a bacon roll which wasn't available on the flight. Mr James - representing himself - told the magistrates: ""We had no breakfast, my granddaughter had been pushing for something to eat, and I said wait until we are on the plane."" After buying beef burgers that were ""dried out"", Mr James was given a refund, but said it ""wasn't enough"". He said he wanted to speak to the captain to suggest that customers should be warned at check-in that there would be ""no hot food"". ""I was not a happy customer - I wish I had not been on the plane and I wish it had not run out of food,"" he added.

"The UK publishing industry has warned that Brexit could damage its record-breaking export business. The boss of the Publishers Association said any tariffs or other barriers to trade post-Brexit ""could be a problem"". His warning came as the industry body reported record sales of Â£5.7bn in 2017, up 5% on the previous year. Exports rose by 8% to Â£3.4bn, to account for 60% of total income, consolidating the UK's position as the biggest exporter of books in the world. The Publishers Association represents book, journal, audio and electronic publishers in the UK, including everything from fiction and non-fiction to academic and educational publishing. Last year 36% of its exports were shipped to the European Union, making it the largest market for UK books. Publishers Association chief executive Stephen Lotinga, said: ""It's not just tariffs that could be a problem [post-Brexit]. It's the non-tariff barriers, customs checks and delays."" ""That means having books sat in a customs warehouse in Calais rather than in a bookshop in Duesseldorf."" The figures contained in the Publishers Association's latest yearbook also show that sales of physical and digital books rose by 4% last year to Â£3.7bn. Of that exports accounted for Â£1.6bn, a rise of 7% on the previous year. In some sectors exports are even more crucial. Total income from academic journals totalled Â£1.6bn last year, with Â£1.4bn of that coming from exports. James Daunt, managing director of the book chain Waterstones, exports books to his stores in the Irish Republic, Amsterdam and Brussels. He said: ""With the pound down and the Irish market strong, we have been going from strength to strength, but if the trucks all start to get backed up at the ports and can't reach the booksellers it could create real problems."" He added there were other benefits that could be lost after Brexit: ""The EU has also been very supportive of us as booksellers. It's been very active in preventing anti-competitive behaviour, for instance by Amazon, and that kind of protection may not be available after Brexit."" Mr Daunt said that over the past 30 years UK publishers have created a dominant position in securing English-language rights to books sold across Europe. He added: ""You have to remember the UK publishing industry is deeply entwined with Europe. ""Macmillan may seem to be British, but it's owned by a German conglomerate. Penguin is the same. It is part of the Bertelsmann group, also in Germany. ""The whole question of the management of rights after Brexit, depending on what agreement we have, could become much more difficult. ""It may become easier for those rights to be funnelled not through London but say India or the US."" The Publishers Association has issued a 10-point Brexit blueprint for publishing which includes a ""gold standard"" for intellectual property laws and copyright, ""to make the most of global free trade opportunities after Brexit"". It said it feared copyright might be viewed by trade negotiators as bargaining chips in future trade discussions. Trade minister Baroness Fairhead said earlier this year that the UK publishing industry was ""one of our huge success stories"". She pledged that the Department for International Trade would continue to work with the industry to ensure publishers have the support they need to export and grow. But Mr Lotinga said that ""whatever kind of deal we end up having with the EU, it has to be balanced to allow us to continue to succeed"". ""The worst-case scenario concerns copyright. At the moment we are part of a system that protects works for 50, 60 or 70 years. The UK law is integrated with the EU and we have confidence in how we are treated."" ""If we leave that system and do a trade deal with other countries, for instance the US, they have a completely different approach to copyright - one side will have to compromise on regulations.""

"This video can not be played Trump on Putin: ""As the leader of a country, you would have to hold him responsible, yes"" Russian President Vladimir Putin has rounded on US critics of his summit with President Donald Trump. Certain forces in the US wanted to sacrifice US-Russian ties for their ""narrow party interests"", he told a meeting of Russian diplomats in Moscow. ""They are feeding millions of their people stories,"" he said. Mr Trump contradicted US intelligence agencies on Monday when he backed away from blaming Russia for meddling in the 2016 election, provoking condemnation. He later said he had misspoken at the summit. Calls for Trump interpreter to testify Your toolkit to help understand the story Trump's 'most serious mistake' In his comments, Mr Putin said the meeting had been ""successful and has led to useful agreements"". ""Of course, it remains to be seen how the situation will develop, especially given that certain forces in America are trying to belittle and undermine the results of the meeting,"" he added. This video can not be played ""He is not a politician"": US voters on the aftermath of the Trump-Putin summit During an interview with CBS News on Wednesday, Mr Trump said he held Mr Putin personally responsible for interfering in the election, and that he was ""very strong on the fact that we can't have meddling"". On Thursday, Mr Trump accused opponents of preferring to go to war rather than seeing good relations with Russia. In a series of tweets he said he was keen to meet Mr Putin again. US special counsel Robert Mueller is currently investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was collusion among the Trump campaign team, something denied by both.

""The deep state has literally leapt into action after the Helsinki summit,"" says official TV channel Rossiya 1. According to state-run Channel One, Trump has become ""the target of persecution with a vengeance"" in the US, and therefore had to reverse his remarks on alleged Russian meddling.

And St Petersburg-based Channel Five wonders: ""Is Trump under hypnosis?"" The White House is facing further criticism for not ruling out a Russian proposal to question US citizens accused by the Kremlin of ""illegal activities"". One of those being sought by Russia is former US ambassador to Moscow Michael McFaul, but allowing him to be questioned would breach the legal immunity normally granted to a country's foreign service.

"Dame Margaret Hodge has been a fierce critic of Labour's new anti-Semitism guidelines Labour MP Margaret Hodge faces ""action"" by the party after reportedly swearing at Jeremy Corbyn and calling him an ""anti-Semite"". A spokesman for the Labour leader said what had happened was ""clearly unacceptable between colleagues"". The alleged confrontation came after Labour adopted new guidelines on anti-Semitism, which were criticised by some Jewish leaders and some MPs. Ms Hodge said she chose to ""confront"" Mr Corbyn to express her ""outrage"". The code of conduct was rubber-stamped by the executive committee on Tuesday. It says: ""Anti-Semitism is racism. It is unacceptable in our party and in wider society."" But it does not include all of the ""working examples"" given in the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's (IHRA)definition of anti-Semitism,external. Following criticism, Labour said it would ""reopen development of the code"" in consultation with Jewish groups. New Labour anti-Semitism code criticised Chief rabbi warns Labour over anti-Semitism Dame Margaret, the MP for Barking, clashed with Mr Corbyn in the Houses of Parliament on Tuesday. Mr Corbyn's spokesman declined to reveal the precise nature of the action being taken against her but said it would be taken under Parliamentary Labour Party procedures requiring MPs to behave in a ""respectful"" way towards colleagues and not to ""bring the party into disrepute"". Without confirming the language she had used, Dame Margaretwrote in The Guardian,externalthat she ""confronted Jeremy Corbyn in Parliament and told him to his face what I and many others are feeling"". Labour was ""so distrusted by the Jewish community, we are the last people on earth, at this time, who should think about amending a widely accepted definition of anti-Semitism"", she said. The Israel-Palestine conflict, she said, had been ""allowed to infect the party's approach to growing anti-Semitism"" saying she and other Jewish MPs had received growing amounts of anti-Semitic abuse. In adopting its new code, the party ""chose to make the party a hostile environment for Jews"", she said, adding: ""I stand by my action as well as my words."" The decision to take action against Dame Margaret has been criticised, with Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educations Trust, describing it as ""extraordinary and just appalling"". Former Foreign Secretary David Miliband tweeted: ""It is the Labour leadership which has brought the party into disrepute - not Margaret Hodge. How dare they preach about 'respect between colleagues' when this very code legitimises the most appalling disrespect."" Labour's code of conduct was drawn up after the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry that followed allegations of anti-Semitism within party ranks. The code does reproduce the IHRA's ""working definition"" of anti-Semitism and lists behaviours likely to be regarded as anti-Semitic - but critics point out that it leaves out four examples from that definition: Accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country Claiming that Israel's existence as a state is a racist endeavour Requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Comparing contemporary Israeli policies to those of the Nazis Labour's code says it is ""wrong"" to accuse Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than their own country. And it says that using Nazi comparisons in Israel-Palestine debates ""carries a strong risk of being regarded as prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the party"", triggering a disciplinary investigation. A party spokeswoman said: ""The code of conduct adopts the IHRA definition and expands on and contextualises the IHRA examples to produce robust, legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases."" Mr Corbyn has said he is ""committed to eliminating anti-Semitism wherever it exists"". ""Prejudice and hatred of Jewish people has no place whatsoever in the Labour Party,"" he said earlier this year.

"The Shinil Group say this is the nameplate of the sunken Donskoi A Russian warship that sank 113 years ago has been found off the coast of a South Korean island, salvagers say. The Shinil Group, a South Korean firm, says it found the vessel Dimitrii Donskoi near Ulleungdo island. Companies have claimed in the past to have found the wreck, amid historic rumours of treasure on board. The cruiser was scuttled by her crew in 1905 after Japan's victory in the Battle of Tsushima - a key moment of the Russo-Japanese War. Setting sail in 1885, the armoured cruiser served in the Mediterranean and the Baltic before heading to the Pacific. The ship served in the Mediterranean and the Baltic before sailing to the Pacific While not badly damaged in the battle itself, the ship fell behind the fleet and was attacked by the Japanese. Her crew scuttled the Donskoi off Ulleungdo. Rumours persist that the Donskoi was carrying the gold for Russia's Pacific Fleet, used to pay crew salaries and docking fees - gold which would be worth billions of dollars if found today. But no proof exists that the ship carried gold, with academics raising doubts that a warship would carry such valuable cargo. Kirill Kolesnichenko, a professor of social sciences at Russia's Far Eastern Federal University, told Russian news site RIA Novosti thatkeeping all your money on one ship would be too dangerous,external. He asked why Russia would send gold by ship when it could move it by train to Vladivostok without any risk. The Wreck Detectives Pictures show Black Sea ""ship graveyard"" Hunting the shipwrecks of the slave trade Nevertheless, several Japanese and South Korean companies have made efforts to find the ship in the last century. Don-A Construction was declared bankrupt by a Seoul District Court in 2001 after claiming to have found the wreck, but failing to lift it from the depths. Now, Shinil Group say they have finally found the Donskoi, and have posted photos online and footage on YouTube of their team's alleged discovery. Allow YouTube content?

However, doubts have been raised about the company. South Korean news websiteChosun Biz reported that Shinil Group was only founded in June,external, even though it says it is the successor company to Shinil Corporation, formed in 1957. Moreover, the company was reportedly only formed with about 100 million Korean won (Â£67,689). The company still has not applied for salvage rights to South Korea's Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries, BBC Korean says, and were it to do so it would need to pay 10% of the estimated value of the wreck - which, if rumours are true, would be far more than the company is worth. Shinil Group told BBC Korean that they would hold a press conference soonto explain all doubts, and that salvage will take ""about three months"". Should shipwrecks be left alone?

"An alleged Kremlin agent offered sex for a job with an American special interest organisation she targeted, say US officials. Maria Butina's ties with Russian intelligence make her a flight risk, a federal judge ruled, and she will be held until her trial. A lawyer for the 29-year-old said she has been co-operating with the US government for several months. The case is not part of the US inquiry into alleged Russian election meddling. Ms Butina, who was arrested on Sunday, appeared for two hours on Wednesday afternoon at a US court in Washington DC. US Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson ruled that the government had proved there are no conditions of her release that would guarantee her return to court for trial. She is facing charges of failing to register as a foreign agent and conspiring against the US government. She is not charged with espionage. On Wednesday, Moscow's foreign ministry said Ms Butina's arrest was designed to undermine the ""positive results"" of a summit between US President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on Monday. Court filings on Wednesday say Ms Butina was living with an unnamed 56-year-old American - identified in documents as US Person 1 - with whom she had a ""personal relationship"". Prosecutors say she described the man - who was nearly twice her age - as her boyfriend. ""But this relationship does not represent a strong tie to the United States because Butina appears to treat it as simply a necessary aspect of her activities,"" said the court papers. In some of her photos on social media, Ms Butina is seen with Paul Erickson, a South Dakota-based conservative political activist who is listed in public records as being 56 years old. She had ""expressed disdain for continuing to cohabitate with"" the American man, according to documents seized by the FBI, and got him to do her university homework. Prosecutors said she did not appear to take the attachment seriously because ""on at least one occasion, Butina offered an individual other than US Person 1 sex in exchange for a position within a special interest organisation"". The documents do not name the organisation in question. But her social media accounts show she frequented National Rifle Association (NRA) events. Trump attacks Putin summit 'haters' Ms Butina's lawyer, Robert Driscoll, has denied all the allegations. The Department of Justice alleges that Ms Butina worked ""under the direction and control"" of a senior Russian official who is not named in charging documents. Court papers say the Russian official acted as her handler, and coached her through online messages. ""Right now everything has to be quiet and careful,"" Ms Butina allegedly wrote to her contact through a private Twitter message, a month before the 2016 presidential election. On the night of the vote, court filings say she messaged the Russian official: ""I'm going to sleep. It's 3 a.m. here. I am ready for further orders."" During the inauguration of President Donald Trump, she shared a photo of herself attending the event at the US Capitol. ""You're a daredevil girl!"" her contact messaged her. ""What can I say!"" she replied. ""Good teachers."" She tried to establish ""back channel"" lines of communication to ""penetrate the US national decision-making apparatus"", the Justice Department said. During her time in the US, she fostered relationships with conservative pro-gun groups. At one point during the presidential election, she and the Russian official allegedly tried unsuccessfully to broker a meeting between Mr Trump and Mr Putin. At a town hall meeting in July 2015, she asked then-candidate Donald Trump about his views on Russia. The following year she met his son, Donald Trump Jr, at an NRA convention. Ms Butina's Facebook page includes pictures of her attending events where she met other well-known American politicians, including Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. She entered the US in August 2016 on an F-1 student visa. According to her LinkedIn page, she recently completed a masters degree in international relations from American University in Washington DC. Those who encountered Ms Butina said she was a gregarious networker whose life story appealed to conservatives she met at events around the US. Ms Butina and Mr Torshin met Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker at an NRA convention In 2015 she told a US radio show that she grew up in the woods of Siberia, and was taught to hunt by her father. After a brief career as the owner of a chain of furniture stores, she said she moved to Moscow where she founded a group called the Right to Bear Arms, which advocated for private gun ownership in Russia. According to US media, the Russian official appears to be Alexander Torshin, a deputy governor of Russia's Central Bank and a well-connected ex-Russian senator from President Putin's political party. He was targeted by US Department of Treasury sanctions in April. Ms Butina posted several photos to her social media accounts over the past few years showing her with Mr Torshin. On her visa application, Ms Butina said she had previously been employed as special assistant to Mr Torshin. In one online conversation with her contact, presumed to be Mr Torshin, the official likened her to Anna Chapman, the red-haired Russian agent who was convicted in the US in 2010 and was later sent back to Russia as part of a prisoner swap. She and Mr Torshin attended several high profile events together ""Are your admirers asking for your autographs yet? You have upstaged Anna Chapman,"" her handler wrote. ""She poses with toy pistols, while you are being published with real ones."" WATCH: Anna Chapman coy about spy accusations Russian spy fronts mystery show Sources tell US media that,externalthe fact that Mr Torshin was not charged is a sign investigators are working to secure her co-operation against him and possibly other Russian officials. When asked about the arrest at a news briefing on Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: ""We're looking at that but this is a lengthy process.""

US special counsel Robert Mueller is currently investigating allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was collusion among the Trump campaign team, something denied by both.

"This video can not be played Highlight from the boys' news conference The 12 boys rescued from a flooded cave in northern Thailand last week have spoken publicly of their ordeal for the first time, describing the ""moment of miracle"" when divers found them. Adul Sam-on, 14, the only member of the group who speaks English, told reporters he could only say ""hello"" when the British divers surfaced. The boys were trapped in the Tham Luang caves for more than two weeks. They left hospital earlier on Wednesday and are on their way home. Five things we learned from news conference Musk apology to diver for Twitter attack The full story of the cave rescue The 12, who are members of a junior football team, the Wild Boars, appeared in their club's kit at a news conference in Chiang Rai. They were greeted by a banner that read ""Bringing the Wild Boars Home"" on a stage designed to look like a football pitch. The boys sat alongside members of the Thai Navy Seals who helped rescue them. The boys came to the news conference in their football gear One boy described how they had lived on water from the stones of the cave. ""Water is clean,"" he said. ""Only water, no food."" Chanin ""Titan"" Wibrunrungrueang, 11, said: ""I tried not to think about food because it would make me hungry."" By Howard Johnson, BBC News, Chiang Rai This was a joyous news conference. The first joke was cracked by a Thai Navy Seal diver as he introduced himself: ""My name is Baitoey and I'm the most beautiful in the cave."" The room erupted with laughter. First to speak was Adul, the boy who communicated with the British divers. He said the coach asked him to translate. His reply: ""Chill, I can't understand that quickly!"" Cue more fits of giggles. The boys' friends, family and nurses from Chiang Rai Hospital were smiling and willing them on from the sidelines. A compere kept up a lively patter, making sure no-one was left out. As attention turned to how they became trapped, the mood in the room became more sober. The boys listened attentively as their coach described finding the shelf that kept them safe. When Titan, the youngest of the 12, said he tried not to think of food because it only made him hungry, the others laughed out loud - proof again that even in the worst conditions, these boys have an unbeatable team spirit. The boys went missing on 23 June and were found by divers on 2 July. Navy Seals then brought them food and other supplies. The group described how they bonded with their rescuers over more than a week, until their final rescue. ""We played draughts (checkers),"" Titan said. ""(Navy Seal) Baitoey always won and he was the king of cave."" This video can not be played Thai cave rescue: Saying sorry to cave spirit Nang Norn The team's coach, Ekapol Chantawong, who was rescued with them, paid tribute toSaman Kunan, a former Navy Seal who died during the operation. ""We are impressed that Saman sacrificed his life to save us so that we could go and live our lives. Once we heard the news, we were shocked,"" he said. ""We were very sad. We felt like... we caused sadness to his family."" Some boys said they would learn from their ordeal. One promised to be ""more careful and live my life the fullest"". Another said: ""This experience taught me to be more patient and strong."" The boys are due to be ordained as Buddhist monks for a short period of time, a tradition for males in Thailand who have experienced a misfortune. The boys and the coach got trapped when sudden rain blocked their exit from Tham Luang cave, where they had planned to spend only an hour. The heroes who saved the Wild Boars In pictures: How the rescue unfolded The boys survived on water dripping from the cave Nine days passed before the boys were found by two British rescue divers. It was unclear at first how they would be brought out of the flooded cave. But with more rain expected, a risky rescue was attempted. Expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the exit. Each boy was accompanied by a diver who also carried his air supply. The boys were heavily sedated ahead of the rescue to prevent them panicking. The boys and their coach were rescued in three stages over three days.

"This video can not be played The singer wins BBC privacy case at High Court but how did it get to this Sir Cliff Richard has won his privacy case against the BBC over its coverage of a police raid on his home. High Court judge Mr Justice Mann awarded an initial Â£210,000 in damages. The singer claimed the BBC's reporting of the 2014 raid, which was part of an investigation into historical child sex allegations, was a ""serious invasion"" of privacy. He was never arrested or charged. The BBC said journalists acted in good faith and it is considering an appeal. Speaking outside the High Court in London, the BBC's director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth apologised to Sir Cliff and said: ""In retrospect, there are things we would have done differently."" But, she said, the case marked a ""significant shift"" against press freedom and an ""important principle"" around the public's right to know was at stake. This video can not be played The BBC's director of news says the ruling is a ""significant shift against press freedom"" In his judgement, Mr Justice Mann said the BBC had infringed Sir Cliff's privacy rights in a ""serious"" and ""sensationalist"" way. He rejected the BBC's case that its reporting, which included footage filmed from a helicopter, was justified under rights of freedom of expression and of the press. Mr Justice Mann said a suspect in a police investigation ""has a reasonable expectation of privacy"" and while Sir Cliff being investigated ""might be of interest to the gossip-monger"", there was not a ""genuine public interest"" case. He also said while the case could have a ""significant impact on press reporting"", it did not mean the law was changing or he was setting a precedent - as the Human Rights Act already covers the issues at stake, namely the right to privacy versus right to freedom of expression. He awarded Sir Cliff Â£190,000 damages and an extra Â£20,000 in aggravated damages after the BBCsubmitted its coverage of the raid for an award. The BBC must pay 65% of the Â£190,000 and South Yorkshire Police, which carried out the raid, 35%. South Yorkshire Police had earlier agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£400,000 after settling a claim he brought against the force. Read the full judgement,external What has the reaction been? At court, Sir Cliff told the BBC he was ""choked up"" at the judgement, adding: ""It's wonderful news."" Fans supporting him sang the singer's hit Congratulations as the judgement was announced. This video can not be played Fans of Sir Cliff Richard cheered and sang his 1968 song Congratulations outside court The 77-year-old singer took legal action against the BBC over broadcasts of a South Yorkshire Police raid on his home in Sunningdale, Berkshire, in August 2014. Officers were investigating an allegation made by a man who claimed he was sexually assaulted by Sir Cliff at an event at Sheffield United's Bramall Lane in 1985 when he was a child. By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman Today's judgement is very significant. The judge found it was not merely the BBC's use of helicopter pictures which breached Sir Cliff's right to privacy. The simple naming of Sir Cliff as a suspect in the police investigation amounted to a breach of his privacy. It means, going forward, people who are suspects in police investigations, save in exceptional circumstances, are entitled to reasonably expect the matter is kept private and not covered by the media. That is why the BBC is broadening this out and saying, in effect, this is a dark day for news reporting. Looking at some of the police investigations covered in the past, the BBC points out that naming the suspects has sometimes resulted in additional complainants coming forward. Standing alongside Sir Cliff outside court, his solicitor Gideon Benaim said the singer's motivation was ""not for personal gain"" but to ""right a wrong"". Mr Benaim said Sir Cliff, who has sold 250 million records since he began performing in 1958, had ""never expected his privacy and reputation would be tarnished in this way"". He said his client had offered to settle earlier with the BBC for ""reasonable"" damages and an apology, but the BBC had been ""defiant"". This video can not be played Sir Cliff Richard's lawyer said the singer ""aimed to right a wrong"" The case raised ""serious questions"", he said, about the way BBC management scrutinises the work of its journalists and how the BBC focused on preserving an exclusive story rather than respecting Sir Cliff's rights. Sir Cliff told reporters he would not comment further at that time, adding: ""It's going to take a while to get over the whole emotional factor."" Later, he told ITV News the judgement was ""just the most wonderful relief"". He said he ""couldn't speak"" and his ""eyes were watering"" in the court room. Responding to the judgement, South Yorkshire Police chief constable Stephen Watson said he accepted the findings and the force accepted and apologised for its mistakes at a ""very early stage"". ""I would like to take this opportunity to again offer our sincere apologies for the distress Sir Cliff Richard has suffered,"" he added. The judge said he would hold another hearing to determine further damages after the singer said his plans for ""professional work"" were ""seriously disrupted"" in the wake of the coverage. He said that in the years leading up to August 2014, he had worked regularly, released a new album every 18 months or so and usually played a number of concerts. But he said he had been left ""in effect in creative limbo"" for two years until prosecutors said he would not face any charges. Sir Cliff claimed his right to privacy under the Human Rights Act had been violated while the BBC argued that the same act protects freedom of expression. Presenter Gloria Hunniford returned to the High Court to support her friend Sir Cliff TV and radio presenter Gloria Hunniford, who told the trial her friend Sir Cliff felt""violated and betrayed""by the BBC's report, returned to the High Court for the judgement. She later told the BBC that Sir Cliff spent Â£4m on his case. Ms Hunniford said it was a ""landmark case"" and thought it would ""eventually change the law"", meaning suspects could have anonymity until they are charged with an offence. She said Sir Cliff had been distraught and was so upset he had only returned to the flat for five minutes after the raid before he went on to sell it. What was a ""total invasion of privacy"" for Sir Cliff, she said, was footage from a camera zooming in on police searching inside his home. Conservative MP Anna Soubry also called for a law change at Prime Minister's Questions. Citing what she dubbed ""Cliff's' law"", Ms Soubry said: ""Suspects should not be named by the media until such time as they are charged."" In response, Theresa May said it was a very ""difficult issue"" and needed ""careful judgement"". ""There may well be cases where the publication of a name enables other victims to come forward and therefore strengthen a case,"" the prime minister said. She also said both the police and media ""have to recognise their responsibilities"". Fans of Sir Cliff were outside the court BBC director of editorial policy and standards David Jordan told BBC Radio 4's World At One the judgement could have a ""chilling effect"" on the ability of the media to report when somebody is the subject of a police investigation. He said the BBC will look in depth at the 200-page judgement before deciding on whether or not to appeal. The judge was also critical of various BBC witnesses who gave evidence. Gary Smith, the BBC's UK news editor at the time and now head of news at BBC Scotland, was ""obsessed"" with scooping rivals which ""probably affected some of his judgement"" at the time of the coverage, he said. Ms Unsworth, who gave final approval for the story, was also, but to a lesser extent, ""affected by the desire to protect the scoop"" at the time while Dan Johnson, the reporter who broke the story, was ""not dishonest"" but let his ""enthusiasm get the better of him"".

A High Court judge said the BBC had infringed the singer's privacy rights in a ""serious and sensationalist way"". Sir Cliff was not arrested or charged over the historical child sex claim and told ITV News: ""If heads roll then maybe it's because it was deserved."" The BBC said journalists acted in good faith and it is considering an appeal. The judge, Mr Justice Mann, awarded Sir Cliff an initial Â£210,000. He rejected the BBC's case that its reporting of South Yorkshire Police's raid of Sir Cliff's flat in Sunningdale, Berkshire, in August 2014, which included footage filmed from a helicopter, was justified under rights of freedom of expression and of the press. Speaking to ITV's Julie Etchingham, Sir Cliff, 77, said: ""They [senior managers] have to carry the can. I don't know how they are going to do it, but they'll have to. ""It's too big a decision to be made badly. It was nonsense."" Describing the court's decision as an ""enormous relief"" and ""incredibly emotional"", Sir Cliff said his intention behind bringing the case was not to curtail press freedom. ""I want a correction made to what happened to me and it was made, nobody said anything about freedom of speech but I will fight to the death against the abuse of the freedom of speech, what the BBC did was an abuse. They took it upon themselves to be judge, jury and executioner."" He went on to call for people to have the right to anonymity until they are charged.

BBC director of editorial policy and standards David Jordan said resignations were ""not necessarily the right response to every mistake that every journalist makes in a news organisation"". He said the BBC did not regret contesting the case because a ""substantial and significant"" issue - concerning people being investigated by police - had been at stake. But he said elements of the way the original report was presented - such as the length of time the BBC gave Sir Cliff to respond to the claims and ""perhaps the use of the helicopter"" - might have been done differently. Mr Jordan said the BBC would look in depth at the 122-page judgement before deciding on whether or not to appeal. Speaking outside the High Court, the BBC's director of news and current affairs Fran Unsworth apologised to Sir Cliff but said the case marked a ""significant shift"" against press freedom and an ""important principle"" around the public's right to know was at stake.

"This is the first time the title has been won by a black woman since the pageant started in 1952 The first black woman to be crowned Miss Universe Great Britain in the pageant's 66-year history has called it ""a great achievement"". Dee-Ann Kentish Rogers, who's also a competitive athlete and recently passed her exams to be a barrister, says the massive response to the fact she's a black woman has ""kind of startled"" her. ""Although I've been preparing for this pageant for a long time, I've just been preparing as Dee-Ann,"" she tells Newsbeat. ""Now that I've won the pageant, I've come to the realisation that I've not only won the pageant as Dee-Ann, but as a black woman."" Miss Universe GB selects Britain's representative for the Miss Universe contest. The 25-year-old from Anguilla, a British overseas territory, currently lives in Birmingham and will represent Great Britain in the 67th Miss Universe pageant later this year. The Miss Universe Great Britain franchise started in 1952, but has undergone several name changes, which often causes confusion. And in some years the UK hasn't had a representative at Miss Universe. There was no Miss Universe Great Britain after its first year for almost four decades afterwards. England, Scotland and Wales would hold their own separate competitions instead. A combined pageant returned in 1991 and Anita St Rose (of Trinidadian descent) won Miss Universe Great Britain in 1996. The pageant's name was changed to Miss Universe United Kingdom in 2000. The name was changed back to Miss Universe GB in 2008, a name it still has today. In terms of the competition as it's currently known, Dee-Ann Kentish-Rogers is the first black woman to win the title. As a dark-skinned black woman with dreadlocks, Dee-Ann recognises just how significant it is for her to be given the title. People outside of the pageant have asked if she'd consider taking her hair down or straightening it for the competition because of the negative connotations associated with dreadlocks, but she adamantly refused. ""I felt that it was very important for me to represent my cultural identity and to represent myself truly on this platform. ""This is a part of who I am. If you're going to take one part of me, you're going to take all of me."" Dee-Ann says she's received several humbling messages since winning the pageant, including some from mothers on behalf of their daughters. ""Some individuals have reached out to me in a personal capacity just to say that my win feels like a win for them. ""As it got closer to the competition, I started to feel the magnitude of what this could mean if I were to get the crown, not just for black women, but for Great Britain as a whole."" Dee-Ann was a competitive athlete before starting in pageantry Becoming Miss Universe Great Britain wasn't always Dee-Ann's dream. She originally wanted to be an Olympic heptathlete for Great Britain, having competed twice in the Commonwealth Games, but a knee injury meant she could no longer pursue that goal. ""My dream kind of reinvented itself and it shifted into pageantry because in pageantry you have the same reach. ""Miss Universe Great Britain was the pageant equivalent of becoming an Olympic athlete for Great Britain."" But Dee-Ann says being in a pageant was harder than preparing for her sporting competitions. ""They're very similar, but being in a pageant you have to undergo a kind of surgical examination of yourself, your ambitions, things that people don't do until they're very, very old. ""Most of the preparation for the Commonwealth Games is done on the track... but in pageantry, the mind is the focal point, and the mind is I think the hardest muscle to master."" Dee-Ann says pageantry has the ""same power to inspire"" as sport While some may argue that pageantry is an out-of-date institution, Dee-Ann says that its potential to give women a voice is exactly why it's just as valuable today. ""Pageantry has been getting a lot of backlash because of people thinking it's very archaic, but pageantry for me has given me a platform, given me a voice, given me the opportunity to empower myself. ""One of the biggest problems that women have in the 21st century is having people listen to them. ""We have had to be very creative in making a space for ourselves."" But can a competition that focuses so much on a woman's appearance really be a good influence for young girls? Dee-Ann says yes, although she admits that questions about pageantry and beauty standards are ""understandable"". ""As someone who's gone through the system, I would advocate for it for young women. While some may say it's old-fashioned, Dee-Ann says pageantry empowers her ""Most of the women who I've known or have come into contact with through pageantry have grown exponentially since the pageant. They've pursued their goals relentlessly and have achieved what they've set out to do."" In terms of her own goals, Dee-Ann passed her exams to be a barrister earlier this month and will officially qualify in London at the end of July. For the future of beauty pageantry and its diversity, Dee-Ann hopes to show other young women that their dreams of competing in the pageant system are absolutely possible. ""The buzz that's surrounding my victory in Miss Universe Great Britain is the first indication as to why it's so important today,"" she told Newsbeat. ""If I can say that to a young black girl, an Asian girl, any girl of any ethnicity in the United Kingdom, especially in this post-Brexit, post-Windrush era, then I would be ecstatic because I would have done my job.""

"Pte Sean Benton was the first of four young soldiers to die at the base The death of a young soldier at Deepcut barracks 23 years ago was suicide, a coroner has ruled after a new inquest. Pte Sean Benton, 20, from Hastings, was found with five gunshot wounds to his chest at the Surrey army base in 1995. Delivering his conclusions at Woking Coroner's Court, Judge Peter Rook QC said three suicide notes were found after his death. Speaking afterwards, his sister Tracy Lewis said the family would ask police to open a criminal investigation. ""Our brother Sean was funny, generous and kind hearted. He loved his family and the British Army. ""He wanted to travel the world and support peacekeeping overseas. ""What he got was bullying, violence and terrible lack of care when his mental health fell apart,"" she said. Brigadier Christopher Coles said the Army has made ""significant changes"" in how it trains and cares for trainees. He said: ""The Army a long time ago accepted that there were significant shortcomings at Deepcut at the time of Sean's death. We took too long to recognise and rectify that situation. ""The resources available to those responsible for training, the levels of supervision for the trainees, the availability of adequate welfare facilities and the policies for using trainees for guard duties were not good enough."" Pte Benton was the first of four young recruits to die between 1995 and 2002, with his death originally recorded as suicide. ""I'm satisfied that the fatal wounds were self inflicted,"" Mr Rook said, with the soldier firing ""six shots to himself"", one of which missed. He said the first round injured the soldier, but that a second round - fired by Pte Benton when two officers arrived at the scene - proved fatal. Notes to his friends and family were found afterwards, which Mr Rook said revealed his ""settled intent to die"". They were found nearby, expressing his upset at learning he was to be discharged after a string of confrontations. This video can not be played Sean Benton's family want a criminal investigation. In a note to his parents, Pte Benton said: ""I'm sorry, I'll always love you all"", while in a note to a friend he said: ""Learn by my mistakes."" The coroner said he had not found the soldier to have been ""intentionally targeted"" but that he had ""frequently come to the attention of staff"". He described a litany of failures with the original investigation into Pte Benton's death, and said he was hampered by a failure to preserve evidence, poor photographs of the scene, and a lack of scrutiny of eyewitness accounts. ""Even by the standards of 1995, the investigation into Sean's death was woefully inadequate."" Summing up, Mr Rook said: ""There was ample evidence available to those at Deepcut that Sean was vulnerable,"" but ""suicidal feelings were not apparent to anyone who saw him that evening"". ""It is likely Sean had an emerging emotional personality disorder,"" he said. In addition, there was a failure by the Army to provide appropriate welfare supervision and support to Pte Benton. ""Had he been offered, and accepted such support, it is possible that Sean would not have taken the fatal action he did. ""However, the evidence does not establish that this would probably have been the case."" The coroner also highlighted a particular failure from senior Deepcut officers which allowed Pte Benton access to the weaponry that ended his life. The new inquest has heard evidence from more than 170 witnesses since it began in January. It was ordered following a campaign by Pte Benton's family, amid allegations of prolonged bullying at the base. This video can not be played Over the years, families of the soldiers continued their campaigns Shortly after the inquest began,the Army apologised to Pte Benton's family,externaland said there were ""a number of things that could and should have been better"". The inquest had heard Pte Benton died shortly after being told he was going to be discharged. Former recruits told the hearing of bullying and harassment at the base - at one stage, Pte Bentonconfided in his sister he had been ""shackled""and made to parade around the canteen. Deepcut was described as an ""oppressive place"" with claims that ""beasting"" was taking place, along with humiliating punishments and physical and mental abuse. Who were the Deepcut four? Soldier death probe in 1995 'inadequate' Army recruit 'shackled' at barracks Mr Rook said the ratio between instructor and trainee at Deepcut was ""a constant concern"", and there were ""not enough staff to keep the trainees properly occupied"". A first hearing led to a finding that Pte Sean Benton - seen here as a young teenager - killed himself in June 1995 He went on to tell the hearing of how during his time at the barracks witnesses observed a shift in Pte Benton's demeanour, with the common theme being that ""he was not as bubbly as he used to be"". During a three-month warning period, he took an Anadin overdose, and it was ""notable"" a psychiatric assessment did not trigger a full review, he said. He told the court there was ""no doubt"" Pte Benton was ""on the receiving end"" of punishments by senior officers and was attacked at least once by his fellow trainees. It was ""possible"" but not probable these events contributed to Pte Benton's decision to kill himself, Mr Rook said. The inquest heard of Sgt Gavaghan's ""twin brother persona"" The conduct of Sgt Andrew Gavaghan - one of Pte Benton's instructors - was key to the investigation into his death, Mr Rook said. He had an alter ego, was prone to changes in temper, and at times ""lost control of himself"" and on occasions ""went too far"". He told the hearing that a ""closer check"" should have been made on Sgt Gavaghan's treatment of trainees, and that a lack of this contributed ""to his abuse of authority"". In conclusion, he said with the exception of Sgt Gavaghan he had ""not found any other NCO went beyond boundaries"". Sgt Gavaghandenied allegations of abusive behaviour. Who were the Deepcut four?

Mr Unsworth had said the mini-sub would have had ""absolutely no chance of working"" - and suggested Mr Musk could ""stick his submarine where it hurts"".,external The entrepreneur fired back with a tweet where, without using Mr Unsworth's name, he referred to a ""British expat guy who lives in Thailand"". He said he would make a video showing the mini-sub making it deep inside the cave ""no problemo"", adding, ""Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it."" The tweet, sent to his more than 22 million followers, was later deleted. No charges or complaints had ever been filed against Mr Unsworth, Reuters news agency quoted an unnamed police officer in Thailand's Chiang Rai area as saying. Separately, Mr Musk attacked the Thai official in charge of the command centre, Narongsak Osotthanakorn, for saying the mini-sub had been ""not practical"", though ""technologically sophisticated"". Mr Musk said Mr Osotthanakorn had been ""described inaccurately as 'rescue chief'"" and was ""not the subject matter expert"".

How the Thai boys were rescued Mr Musk visited the scene when it was still unclear whether divers on their own would be able to bring out the boys.

"A college drop-out who sought revenge for his uncle's death in Syria has been convicted of preparing to attack Downing Street and kill the PM. Naa'imur Rahman, 20, was convicted at the Old Bailey after he was trapped in a major undercover operation involving the FBI, MI5 and police. Rahman approached officers posing online as fellow extremists, asking them for help with an attack. He met two and repeatedly asked for bombs - leading to his conviction. He has now been jailed for aminimum of 30 years. Last summer Rahman was homeless in London after falling out with both his mother in the city and close relatives in Walsall, where he grew up. Walsall to Syria: Fighters, travellers and victims? Three years ago he was referred to the national deradicalisation scheme, Channel, amid concerns that the-then teenager could be brainwashed by his uncle. When he was investigated last year over an allegation of sexting with an underage girl, intelligence emerged from his phone that he had maintained contact with his uncle. Rahman's uncle Musadikur Rohaman died in a drone strike in Syria Musadikur Rohaman left the UK for Syria in 2014. The Old Bailey trial heard that he'd been encouraging his nephew to attack the UK and had sent him bomb-making plans and other extremist material. However, in late June 2017, Rohaman was killed in a coalition drone strike on IS fighters near the city of Raqqa. When Rahman learnt of his uncle's death, prosecutors told the trial that he planned his revenge. Rahman made contact with IS recruiters via social media - but unbeknown to him the contact was actually an FBI agent. That agent referred Rahman to an MI5 team of online role players who convinced him that they were genuine IS figures. ""I want to do a suicide bomb on Parliament,"" Rahman told the MI5 role players. ""I want to attempt to kill Theresa May. All I need now is a sleeper cell to lay low for now."" Despite his total lack of skills or training, MI5 was concerned that Rahman would press ahead, so counter-terrorism chiefs launched an elaborate undercover operation to gather evidence of his intent. As Rahman kept asking for help, the MI5 team introduced him to an undercover police officer in London posing as an Islamic State weapons fixer. The jury watched secretly recorded video of Rahman meeting ""Shaq"" in a car and setting out his aspirations. He told the story of his uncle's killing - and asked for a truck bomb and firearms  - before conceding he could neither drive nor fire a gun. Rahman then settled for storming Downing Street in an attempt to kill Theresa May. On 6 November last year, Rahman laid out his final plan to ""Shaq"" - a recording of it was played in court. ""I have drawn up a plan, gone through it in detail in my head. You know at the gate of Downing Street? There are about four men innit? And two men on the door? ""I want to get past that gate and if I can get to the door I want to make a dash for Theresa May. She sleeps there every night."" Undercover officers gave Rahman a fake bomb Shaq asked Rahman to elaborate on how he thought this was possible. ""If I have a backpack with stuff inside and I do that at the gate and I get past the gate... a 10-second sprint to the door."" ""I'll be honest with you,"" replied Shaq. ""I've never looked at it."" ""I wanna drop a bag at the gate, so the gate blows up a bit and I can go through and then like, make a run, like I was thinking taking a human hostage until I get to the actual door. ""Grab a human shield and then once I get close enough to the door, I'll do what I can with them to get inside."" ""You're trying to get to Number 10,"" asked Shaq. ""That's your main objective?"" ""Take her head off, yeah,"" replied Rahman. Rahman said he couldn't fund the attack because he was ""broke and homeless"" - but he handed over a jacket and a rucksack, asking for both to be filled with explosives. The jacket was filled with fake explosives Shaq returned the items with a fake bomb in the bag and the jacket filled with supposed explosives. Rahman took both off him and said: ""Do you know? Now I've seen everything it feels good."" As he walked away from the scene he was surrounded by police, arrested, and later said: ""I'm glad it's over."" Rahman told his trial that none of his plans was serious. When he made contact with men whom he thought were his uncle's comrades in Syria, he had begun showing off, making up schemes to impress them. Prosecutors showed Rahman (circled) had carried out extensive reconnaissance He told jurors that one fantastical proposal had been to build balloons to drop missiles from the edge of space. Rahman claimed he had been set up and tricked by MI5 and the police. But prosecutors showed that Rahman had carried out extensive reconnaissance of Downing Street, Parliament and nearby government buildings. The jury had to be convinced that Rahman had seriously intended to attack Downing Street and had taken the first steps along that course. In sentencing, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said: ""I am sure that at all material times Rahman believed the devices to be real and capable of causing serious harm.""

"The new comic series will debut in October Marvel has announced a new comic book series about Black Panther's sister, Shuri, a scientific genius and princess of the mythical nation of Wakanda. It debuts in October and will be written by author Nnedi Okorafor and artwork by Leonardo Romero. The series follows her as she takes the reins after her brother and titular hero, T'Challa, disappears into space. The Black Panther movie was a huge success this year and was hailed for having a largely black cast. Africa live: More updates on this and other stories Black Panther takes $1bn at box office Black Panther women 'can carry own film' Shuri's sarcasm and high-tech inventions made her one of the main new characters in the film. ""While she [Shuri] is the most at home in her lab, working to keep her country at the forefront of science and technology, Wakanda is missing its leader,"" Marvel wrote in a press statement about the new series. ""Without T'Challa around, Shuri will have to decide if she will forego her own passions in order to stand up for her nation."" British actress Letitia Wright (right) played the Black Panther's younger sister Ms Okorafor, who writes African-based science fiction and fantasy novels, is no stranger to the Marvel Universe: she has previously contributed to the bi-weekly series, Black Panther: Long Live the King. The American author, who has Nigerian parents, has won a number of international awards, including a Hugo Award for her novella, Binti, and the Wole Soyinka Prize for Literature. She told the online women's magazine,Bustle,external, that Shuri was a character in the ""Marvel Universe who really sings to me."" Her novel Who Fears Death is reportedly being made into a drama series produced by Game Of Thrones' George RR Martin. Ms Okorafor explained in an email to Bustle that she loved the character for her ambition and being a young African woman of ""genius level intelligence who is obsessed with technology and has travelled spiritually so far into the past that she's seen Wakanda before it was Wakanda."" The Black Panther comic title was reinvigorated in 2016 under author Ta-Nehisi Coates. Two years later, the Black Panther movie became a success and took more than $1bn (Â£795m) from cinemas worldwide. The film has been widely praised as game-changing - including by Michelle Obama - for having a largely black cast and a black director, Ryan Coogler.

"Google has been fined a record â¬4.34bn ($5bn; Â£3.9bn) over Android. The European Commission said the firmhad used the mobile operating system,externalto illegally ""cement its dominant position"" in search. The firm's parent Alphabet has been given 90 days to change its business practices or face further penalties of up to 5% of its average global daily turnover. It has said it plans to appeal. However, it could easily afford the fine if required - its cash reservestotalled nearly $103bn at the end of March,external. This video can not be played WATCH: Margrethe Vestager says the record-sized fine is a result of Google's illegal behaviour At a press conference in Brussels, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said consumers needed choice. And she suggested the ruling could lead manufacturers to sell smart devices using different versions of the Android operating system to Google's, such as Amazon's Fire OS, which she said they had been prevented from doing. ""This will change the market place,"" she said. Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai has blogged in response. ""Rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition and Android has enabled all of them,""he wrote,external. ""Today's decision rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less."" Sundar Pichai also released a video clip saying the ruling could ""upset the careful balance of the Android ecosystem"" Ms Vestager previously fined Google â¬2.4bn ($2.8bn; Â£2.1bn) over a separate probe into its shopping comparison service -a ruling the tech firm is in the process of appealing,externalagainst. In addition, her team has a third investigation underway into Google's advert-placing business AdSense. The Dane targeting multinationals Google adds jobs to UK search results Google fined over Shopping service Ms Vestager alleges that there are three ways that Google has acted illegally: it required Android handset and tablet manufacturers to pre-install the Google Search app and its own web browser Chrome as a condition for allowing them to offer access to its Play app store it made payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators that agreed to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app on their devices it prevented manufacturers from selling any smart devices powered by alternative ""forked"" versions of Android by threatening to refuse them permission to pre-install its apps Ms Vestager acknowledged that Google's version of Android does not prevent device owners downloading alternative web browsers or using other search engines. Google is accused of forcing manufactures to pre-install Chrome by refusing to license its Play Store alone But she said that only 1% of users downloaded a competing search app, and 10% a different browser. ""Once you have it, it is working, very few are curious enough to look for another search app or browser,"" she said. The Competition Commissioner said that Google carried out its abuse at a time when the mobile internet was growing quickly, helping it ensure that its advertising-supported search service repeated the success it had already found on desktop computers. She cannot turn the clock back, but said the size of the fine had been based on the firm's search-related earnings from Android devices in Europe since 2011. She has, however, said the firm must now stop all of the practices outlined above and refrain from any measures with a similar goal. Russia may give one example of how this could be achieved. After similar complaints by the country's regulator, Google now offers Android users a choice between Google, Yandex and Mail.ru as the default search engine the first time they use the Chrome browser. Yandex has seen gained market share on Android phones since Google changed its behaviour in Russia Yandex in particular has benefited from this. Since the change in June 2017, the Moscow-based firm has seen its share of mobile search rise from about 34% to 46%,according to Statcounter,external. The European Commission first began scrutinisingAndroid in April 2015,external, after a complaint by Fairsearch -  a trade group that originally included Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle among its members. It claims the case has dragged on for so long because Google had used ""every trick in its book to delay action"". But the group welcomed the commissioner's intervention. ""This is an important step in disciplining Google's abusive behaviour in relation to Android"", said spokesman Thomas Vinje. ""It means that Google should cease its anti-competitive practices regarding smartphones, but also in other areas - smart TVs in particular - where it is foreclosing competition by using the same practices."" A trade body representing mobile operators has also greeted the development. ""This will enable consumers to benefit from a greater choice of mobile services, and allow more players to innovate and offer new services in the market,"" said the GSMA's chief regulatory officer John Giusti. The European Commission had the power to fine Google up to 10% of its annual revenue.Based on its last annual report,external, that would have amounted to a maximum of $11.1bn (Â£8.5bn). The â¬4.3bn figure is, however, a record-sized sum for the commission. Earlier punishments include: fines totalling  â¬3.8bn against several truck-makers accused of price collusion, which were imposed in July 2016 and September 2017 the â¬2.24bn fine against Google for promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of its search results, which was announced in June 2017 two fines totalling  â¬1.46bn against Microsoft related to the bundling of its Explorer browser with Windows, and failing to keep a pledge to provide users with a choice of other browsers. The two penalties were announced in February 2008 and March 2013 a â¬1.35bn collective fine against several car glass producers, which had been accused of illegally sharing commercially sensitive information. This was made in November 2008 a â¬1.06bn fine against Intel, which was accused of offering discounts to computer-makers that avoided rivals' computer chips. It was announced in May 2009 a â¬997m fine against Qualcomm, which was penalised over claims it had paid Apple to use its chips. This was announced in January 2018 Depending on your point of view, Margarethe Vestager is either the only global regulator really standing up to arrogant American tech giants - or a busybody trying to hobble innovative businesses because Europe can't build its own. But today's ruling shows the gulf that has opened up between US and European competition policies. In the States the focus is on real and obvious harm to consumers in the form of higher prices or less choice. They also seem more sympathetic to the tech giants' argument that they can be easily toppled from their perches by feisty start-ups. European regulators tend to take a wider view of markets, worrying about a ""winner takes it all"" world, where a few mighty platforms appear to offer consumers a shiny world of free or very cheap goodies, but in reality are devoted to crushing any competition. This culture clash isn't going to fade away any time soon. Cheered on by many who are concerned about Silicon Valley's dominance, Ms Vestager will not abandon her mission to tame the tech giants - and the likes of Google, Apple and Amazon will fiercely resist any regulation that they see as a threat to their lucrative business models.

"The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has been fined Â£200,000 after sending a mass email that identified possible abuse victims, the Information Commissioner's Office says. An inquiry staff member emailed 90 people using the ""to"" field instead of the ""bcc"" field - allowing recipients to see each other's addresses, it said. The ICO said the incident last year was a breach of the Data Protection Act. The inquiry said it had apologised and reviewed its data-handling. Twenty-two complaints were received about the breach and one person told the ICO he was ""very distressed"" by it. The inquiry, which covers England and Wales, was set up in 2014 with the aim to investigate claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - and people in the public eye. How the child sexual abuse inquiry works An inquiry staff member first sent a blind carbon copy (bcc) email on 27 February 2017 to 90 inquiry participants telling them about a public hearing, the ICO said. After noticing an error in the email, a correction was sent but email addresses were entered into the ""to"" field instead, revealing the addresses of the recipients. Fifty-two of the email addresses contained full names or had a full name label attached. The inquiry was alerted to the breach by a recipient who entered two further email addresses into the ""to"" field, before clicking on ""reply all"". It then sent three emails asking those who had received the email to delete it and not to circulate it further. The ICO investigation found the inquiry: failed to use an email account that could send a separate email to each participant failed to provide staff with any, or any adequate, guidance or training on the importance of checking email addresses were in the ""bcc"" field hired an IT company to manage the mailing list and relied on its advice that it would prevent individuals from replying to the entire list breached its own privacy notice by sharing participants' email addresses with the IT company without their consent Steve Eckersley, the ICO's director of investigations, said the breach ""placed vulnerable people at risk"" and called this ""concerning"". ""IICSA should and could have done more to ensure this did not happen,"" he said. ""People's email addresses can be searched via social networks and search engines, so the risk that they could be identified was significant."" In a statement, the inquiry said it took its data protection obligations ""very seriously"" and has apologised to those affected. ""After a wide-ranging review by external experts, we have amended our handling processes for personal data to ensure they are robust and the risk of a further breach is minimised,"" it said.

"Christopher Lythgoe (l) and Matthew Hankinson (r) were jailed for a total of 14 years Two men have been found guilty of being members of banned neo-Nazi group National Action. Christopher Lythgoe, 32, of Warrington, and Matthew Hankinson, 24, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, were convicted after a trial lasting over five weeks. Lythgoe was jailed for eight years and Hankinson for six. Earlier in the trial, another man, Jack Renshaw, 23, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, admitted preparing an act of terrorism after buying a machete. He admitted buying it for the purpose of murdering West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper. A former National Action member, Robbie Mullen, warned the anti-racism charity Hope Not Hate of Renshaw's plan, and they went to the police. Ms Cooper thanked Mr Mullen and the police forces who helped her, adding: ""I think it's awful that any public servant - teacher, nurse, doctor, police, MP - should be targeted and threatened with violence simply because of the job they do."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""The extreme far right has absolutely no place in Britain and I am glad these vile extremists are behind bars where they belong."" A total of six men were on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of being members of National Action. Lythgoe, the National Action leader, was found not guilty of encouragement to murder for allegedly giving Renshaw permission to kill Ms Cooper on behalf of the group. Renshaw also admitted threatening to kill Det Con Victoria Henderson, who was investigating him for other matters. Mr Justice Jay said group meetings after the ban were attempting to keep alive an aspiration that was ""truly insidious and evil: the idea that this country should be purged of its ethnic minorities and its Jews; that the rule of law should be subverted; and that once the ideological revolution had taken place this national socialist world view would triumph"". Sentencing Lythgoe, he said: ""You are a fully-fledged neo-Nazi replete with concomitant deep-seated, entrenched racism and anti-Semitism."" The judge told Hankinson: ""You too are a neo-Nazi who glorifies and revels in a perverted ideology, has a deep hatred of ethnic minorities and Jews and has advocated violence to achieve your objectives."" Jurors were unable to decide either whether Renshaw had remained a member of National Action after it was banned, or whether two other men - Michal Trubini, 35, from Warrington and Andrew Clarke, 33, from Prescot, Merseyside - were guilty of the same charge. Another defendant - Garron Helm, 24, from Seaforth in Merseyside - was found not guilty of being a member of the group. It can also now be reported that Renshaw was convicted earlier this year of two counts of stirring up racial hatred in speeches he made in 2016. Jack Renshaw admitted preparing an act of terrorism - buying a machete for the purpose of murdering MP Rosie Cooper National Action, which was founded in 2013, was the first extreme right-wing group to be banned in the UK. It was proscribed in December 2016 after it was assessed as being ""concerned in terrorism"". Earlier that year, the group had celebrated the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a white supremacist, which the government said amounted to the unlawful glorification of terrorism. Det Supt Will Chatterton, head of investigations for counter-terrorism policing for the North West, said: ""Today's result has enabled the spotlight to be shone on the sickening activities of the banned extreme right-wing organisation National Action [and] is a body blow to extreme right-wing organisations. ""It sends out a clear message that counter-terrorism officers and partner agencies will rigorously identify and investigate any violently extreme individual or group who seek to bring a reign of terror to our shores."" Deputy director of Hope Not Hate, Jemma Levene, welcomed the sentences, adding: ""This case should remind everyone of the ongoing threat posed by the British far right. ""While numerically small and splintered, the British far right is growing in violence. This case has brought National Action to its knees, but we must remain vigilant.""

"The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has been fined Â£200,000 after sending a mass email that identified possible abuse victims, the Information Commissioner's Office says. An inquiry staff member emailed 90 people using the ""to"" field instead of the ""bcc"" field - allowing recipients to see each other's addresses, it said. The ICO said the incident last year was a breach of the Data Protection Act. The inquiry said it had apologised and reviewed its data-handling. Twenty-two complaints were received about the breach and one person told the ICO he was ""very distressed"" by it. The inquiry, which covers England and Wales, was set up in 2014 with the aim to investigate claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - and people in the public eye. How the child sexual abuse inquiry works An inquiry staff member first sent a blind carbon copy (bcc) email on 27 February 2017 to 90 inquiry participants telling them about a public hearing, the ICO said. After noticing an error in the email, a correction was sent but email addresses were entered into the ""to"" field instead, revealing the addresses of the recipients. Fifty-two of the email addresses contained full names or had a full name label attached. The inquiry was alerted to the breach by a recipient who entered two further email addresses into the ""to"" field, before clicking on ""reply all"". It then sent three emails asking those who had received the email to delete it and not to circulate it further. The ICO investigation found the inquiry: failed to use an email account that could send a separate email to each participant failed to provide staff with any, or any adequate, guidance or training on the importance of checking email addresses were in the ""bcc"" field hired an IT company to manage the mailing list and relied on its advice that it would prevent individuals from replying to the entire list breached its own privacy notice by sharing participants' email addresses with the IT company without their consent Steve Eckersley, the ICO's director of investigations, said the breach ""placed vulnerable people at risk"" and called this ""concerning"". ""IICSA should and could have done more to ensure this did not happen,"" he said. ""People's email addresses can be searched via social networks and search engines, so the risk that they could be identified was significant."" In a statement, the inquiry said it took its data protection obligations ""very seriously"" and has apologised to those affected. ""After a wide-ranging review by external experts, we have amended our handling processes for personal data to ensure they are robust and the risk of a further breach is minimised,"" it said.

"A jab that protects against a virus that causes cervical cancer should also be given to boys, an advisory committee has recommended. The HPV vaccine is routinely offered to girls aged 12 to 13 at secondary school and is free up until they turn 18. Now the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation has advised extending immunisation to adolescent boys at the same age as girls. The Scottish andWelsh governments have now said they will vaccinate boys. The Department of Health and Social Care in England said it would carefully consider the JCVI's advice and provide an update on its decision shortly. Other health bodies welcomed the committee's recommendation, adding that boys had been insufficiently protected against HPV for ""too long"". Doctors paying for sons to have cancer jab Cancer patient wants HPV vaccine for boys What is HPV? HPV is the name given to a large group of viruses, which can be caught through any kind of sexual contact with another person who already has it. Doctors say most HPV infections go away by themselves, but sometimes infections can lead to a variety of serious problems. For boys, this includes cancer of the anus, penis, mouth and throat. The vaccine has been offered to girls since 2008 as part of the NHS childhood vaccination programme, with boys being said to benefit through herd protection. But there is still a risk of infection in those who go on to have sex with other men or women who have not been vaccinated. Campaigners have long since argued that offering the vaccine to boys would further reduce the risk of HPV infection, pointing to successful programmes in other countries. In July last year,the JCVI was criticisedafter it said in an interim statement that it could not recommend extension of the national HPV programme. However, the committee's new report says a combined vaccination programme is ""highly likely to be cost-effective"". Responding to the report, the Scottish and Welsh governments announced they would introduce an HPV vaccination programme for boys ""as soon as practicable"". The Scottish government added that the age ranges of those to be vaccinated were still under consideration. Public health bodies welcomed the JCVI's report. The Royal Society for Public Health said it was ""a victory for the public's health"". Its chief executive, Shirley Cramer, said: ""Boys have been left insufficiently protected against HPV for too long and it is good news that the UK is following in the footsteps of the other 20 countries already vaccinating boys against HPV."" Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of The Royal College of GPs, also welcomed it, adding: ""We hope parents will take up this important opportunity to get their sons and daughters vaccinated as soon as it is available to them."" The campaign group HPV Action called for the Department of Health and Social Care to accept the JCVI's findings and include boys in a vaccination programme ""without further delay"".

"Mr Woodcock takes a different view to Mr Corbyn on Trident renewal and other defence issues John Woodcock has quit as a Labour MP and will now sit as an independent in the House of Commons. The Barrow and Furness MP, a long-time critic of Jeremy Corbyn, was suspended in April over claims he sent inappropriate messages to a former female member of staff. He has denied the claim, which is being investigated by the party. In his resignation letter, he said the party had been ""taken over by the hard left"" and ""tolerated"" anti-Semitism. He has represented the Cumbrian seat since 2010, winning it with a 209 majority last year. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A Labour spokesman said: ""Jeremy thanks John for his service to the Labour Party."" Mr Woodcock, who is on the right of the party, had the Labour whip withdrawn earlier this year amid claims he sent inappropriate messages to a former female member of staff. He has said he does not accept the charges and was fully co-operating with an internal inquiry. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict MP suspended over sexual harassment claim New Labour anti-Semitism code criticised Announcing his resignation from the party, he accused Labour of failing to appoint an independent investigator to rule on the disciplinary case. He suggested the process was being ""manipulated for factional purposes"" and he had seen e-mails showing senior party figures wanted to stop him standing as a candidate again because of his views on the leadership. In a wide-ranging attack on Mr Corbyn, he said Labour was not a ""credible"" alternative government and its leader would pose a ""clear risk"" to the UK's security if he became prime minister. ""I have promised to fight for local jobs, protect the shipyard and ensure the safety of the my constituents through strong defence and national security. ""I now believe more strongly than ever you have made Labour unfit to deliver those objectives."" Mr Woodcock, who asked a question about Northern Rail during Wednesday's session of Prime Minister's Questions, said he was committed to continuing to represent his constituents in Parliament and was prepared to ""work with the government when it is trying to do the right thing"". He added: ""The party for which I have campaigned since I was a boy is no longer the broad church it has always historically been. ""Anti-Semitism is being tolerated and Labour has been taken over at nearly every level by the hard left, far beyond the dominance they achieved at the 1980s militancy."" Labour has rejected claims its disputes resolution process has become politicised, pointing out that the MP's resignation means the investigation into alleged harassment cannot be concluded and the complainant will be denied their right to have their claim heard. Asked whether there should now be a by-election, a party spokesman said ""basic rules of democratic accountability"" dictated that when MPs ""abandoned"" the platform they were elected on, the public should have their say.

And Unite general secretary Len McCluskey, who has called on critics of Mr Corbyn to shut up or get out, said the MP's resignation from the party was ""no big deal"". ""He resigned from Labour's values a long time ago."" His resignation comes a day after Labour's ruling National Executive approved a new code of conduct on anti-Semitism, which has been criticised by Jewish leaders and some of its own MPs. The document, drawn up after protests by Jewish groups against Labour's handling of the issue, states anti-Semitism is racism but does not fully repeat the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition. Labour said the code, drawn up following the 2016 Chakrabarti inquiry into anti-Semitism, addressed concerns about alleged anti-Semitic remarks by activists and better reflected the views of Jewish community groups.

"Google has been fined a record â¬4.34bn ($5bn; Â£3.9bn) over Android. The European Commission said the firmhad used the mobile operating system,externalto illegally ""cement its dominant position"" in search. The firm's parent Alphabet has been given 90 days to change its business practices or face further penalties of up to 5% of its average global daily turnover. It has said it plans to appeal. However, it could easily afford the fine if required - its cash reservestotalled nearly $103bn at the end of March,external. This video can not be played WATCH: Margrethe Vestager says the record-sized fine is a result of Google's illegal behaviour At a press conference in Brussels, Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said consumers needed choice. And she suggested the ruling could lead manufacturers to sell smart devices using different versions of the Android operating system to Google's, such as Amazon's Fire OS, which she said they had been prevented from doing. ""This will change the market place,"" she said. Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai has blogged in response. ""Rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition and Android has enabled all of them,""he wrote,external. ""Today's decision rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less."" Sundar Pichai also released a video clip saying the ruling could ""upset the careful balance of the Android ecosystem"" Ms Vestager previously fined Google â¬2.4bn ($2.8bn; Â£2.1bn) over a separate probe into its shopping comparison service -a ruling the tech firm is in the process of appealing,externalagainst. In addition, her team has a third investigation underway into Google's advert-placing business AdSense. The Dane targeting multinationals Google adds jobs to UK search results Google fined over Shopping service Ms Vestager alleges that there are three ways that Google has acted illegally: it required Android handset and tablet manufacturers to pre-install the Google Search app and its own web browser Chrome as a condition for allowing them to offer access to its Play app store it made payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators that agreed to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app on their devices it prevented manufacturers from selling any smart devices powered by alternative ""forked"" versions of Android by threatening to refuse them permission to pre-install its apps Ms Vestager acknowledged that Google's version of Android does not prevent device owners downloading alternative web browsers or using other search engines. Google is accused of forcing manufactures to pre-install Chrome by refusing to license its Play Store alone But she said that only 1% of users downloaded a competing search app, and 10% a different browser. ""Once you have it, it is working, very few are curious enough to look for another search app or browser,"" she said. The Competition Commissioner said that Google carried out its abuse at a time when the mobile internet was growing quickly, helping it ensure that its advertising-supported search service repeated the success it had already found on desktop computers. She cannot turn the clock back, but said the size of the fine had been based on the firm's search-related earnings from Android devices in Europe since 2011. She has, however, said the firm must now stop all of the practices outlined above and refrain from any measures with a similar goal. Russia may give one example of how this could be achieved. After similar complaints by the country's regulator, Google now offers Android users a choice between Google, Yandex and Mail.ru as the default search engine the first time they use the Chrome browser. Yandex has seen gained market share on Android phones since Google changed its behaviour in Russia Yandex in particular has benefited from this. Since the change in June 2017, the Moscow-based firm has seen its share of mobile search rise from about 34% to 46%,according to Statcounter,external. The European Commission first began scrutinisingAndroid in April 2015,external, after a complaint by Fairsearch -  a trade group that originally included Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle among its members. It claims the case has dragged on for so long because Google had used ""every trick in its book to delay action"". But the group welcomed the commissioner's intervention. ""This is an important step in disciplining Google's abusive behaviour in relation to Android"", said spokesman Thomas Vinje. ""It means that Google should cease its anti-competitive practices regarding smartphones, but also in other areas - smart TVs in particular - where it is foreclosing competition by using the same practices."" A trade body representing mobile operators has also greeted the development. ""This will enable consumers to benefit from a greater choice of mobile services, and allow more players to innovate and offer new services in the market,"" said the GSMA's chief regulatory officer John Giusti. The European Commission had the power to fine Google up to 10% of its annual revenue.Based on its last annual report,external, that would have amounted to a maximum of $11.1bn (Â£8.5bn). The â¬4.3bn figure is, however, a record-sized sum for the commission. Earlier punishments include: fines totalling  â¬3.8bn against several truck-makers accused of price collusion, which were imposed in July 2016 and September 2017 the â¬2.24bn fine against Google for promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of its search results, which was announced in June 2017 two fines totalling  â¬1.46bn against Microsoft related to the bundling of its Explorer browser with Windows, and failing to keep a pledge to provide users with a choice of other browsers. The two penalties were announced in February 2008 and March 2013 a â¬1.35bn collective fine against several car glass producers, which had been accused of illegally sharing commercially sensitive information. This was made in November 2008 a â¬1.06bn fine against Intel, which was accused of offering discounts to computer-makers that avoided rivals' computer chips. It was announced in May 2009 a â¬997m fine against Qualcomm, which was penalised over claims it had paid Apple to use its chips. This was announced in January 2018 Depending on your point of view, Margarethe Vestager is either the only global regulator really standing up to arrogant American tech giants - or a busybody trying to hobble innovative businesses because Europe can't build its own. But today's ruling shows the gulf that has opened up between US and European competition policies. In the States the focus is on real and obvious harm to consumers in the form of higher prices or less choice. They also seem more sympathetic to the tech giants' argument that they can be easily toppled from their perches by feisty start-ups. European regulators tend to take a wider view of markets, worrying about a ""winner takes it all"" world, where a few mighty platforms appear to offer consumers a shiny world of free or very cheap goodies, but in reality are devoted to crushing any competition. This culture clash isn't going to fade away any time soon. Cheered on by many who are concerned about Silicon Valley's dominance, Ms Vestager will not abandon her mission to tame the tech giants - and the likes of Google, Apple and Amazon will fiercely resist any regulation that they see as a threat to their lucrative business models.

""Rapid innovation, wide choice, and falling prices are classic hallmarks of robust competition and Android has enabled all of them,""he wrote,external. ""Today's decision rejects the business model that supports Android, which has created more choice for everyone, not less."" Sundar Pichai also released a video clip saying the ruling could ""upset the careful balance of the Android ecosystem"" Ms Vestager previously fined Google â¬2.4bn ($2.8bn; Â£2.1bn) over a separate probe into its shopping comparison service -a ruling the tech firm is in the process of appealing,externalagainst. In addition, her team has a third investigation underway into Google's advert-placing business AdSense. The Dane targeting multinationals Google adds jobs to UK search results Google fined over Shopping service Ms Vestager alleges that there are three ways that Google has acted illegally: it required Android handset and tablet manufacturers to pre-install the Google Search app and its own web browser Chrome as a condition for allowing them to offer access to its Play app store it made payments to large manufacturers and mobile network operators that agreed to exclusively pre-install the Google Search app on their devices it prevented manufacturers from selling any smart devices powered by alternative ""forked"" versions of Android by threatening to refuse them permission to pre-install its apps Ms Vestager acknowledged that Google's version of Android does not prevent device owners downloading alternative web browsers or using other search engines. Google is accused of forcing manufactures to pre-install Chrome by refusing to license its Play Store alone But she said that only 1% of users downloaded a competing search app, and 10% a different browser. ""Once you have it, it is working, very few are curious enough to look for another search app or browser,"" she said. The Competition Commissioner said that Google carried out its abuse at a time when the mobile internet was growing quickly, helping it ensure that its advertising-supported search service repeated the success it had already found on desktop computers. She cannot turn the clock back, but said the size of the fine had been based on the firm's search-related earnings from Android devices in Europe since 2011. She has, however, said the firm must now stop all of the practices outlined above and refrain from any measures with a similar goal. Russia may give one example of how this could be achieved. After similar complaints by the country's regulator, Google now offers Android users a choice between Google, Yandex and Mail.ru as the default search engine the first time they use the Chrome browser. Yandex has seen gained market share on Android phones since Google changed its behaviour in Russia Yandex in particular has benefited from this. Since the change in June 2017, the Moscow-based firm has seen its share of mobile search rise from about 34% to 46%,according to Statcounter,external. The European Commission first began scrutinisingAndroid in April 2015,external, after a complaint by Fairsearch -  a trade group that originally included Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle among its members. It claims the case has dragged on for so long because Google had used ""every trick in its book to delay action"". But the group welcomed the commissioner's intervention. ""This is an important step in disciplining Google's abusive behaviour in relation to Android"", said spokesman Thomas Vinje. ""It means that Google should cease its anti-competitive practices regarding smartphones, but also in other areas - smart TVs in particular - where it is foreclosing competition by using the same practices."" A trade body representing mobile operators has also greeted the development. ""This will enable consumers to benefit from a greater choice of mobile services, and allow more players to innovate and offer new services in the market,"" said the GSMA's chief regulatory officer John Giusti. The European Commission had the power to fine Google up to 10% of its annual revenue.Based on its last annual report,external, that would have amounted to a maximum of $11.1bn (Â£8.5bn). The â¬4.3bn figure is, however, a record-sized sum for the commission. Earlier punishments include: fines totalling  â¬3.8bn against several truck-makers accused of price collusion, which were imposed in July 2016 and September 2017 the â¬2.24bn fine against Google for promoting its own shopping comparison service at the top of its search results, which was announced in June 2017 two fines totalling  â¬1.46bn against Microsoft related to the bundling of its Explorer browser with Windows, and failing to keep a pledge to provide users with a choice of other browsers. The two penalties were announced in February 2008 and March 2013 a â¬1.35bn collective fine against several car glass producers, which had been accused of illegally sharing commercially sensitive information. This was made in November 2008 a â¬1.06bn fine against Intel, which was accused of offering discounts to computer-makers that avoided rivals' computer chips. It was announced in May 2009 a â¬997m fine against Qualcomm, which was penalised over claims it had paid Apple to use its chips. This was announced in January 2018 Depending on your point of view, Margarethe Vestager is either the only global regulator really standing up to arrogant American tech giants - or a busybody trying to hobble innovative businesses because Europe can't build its own. But today's ruling shows the gulf that has opened up between US and European competition policies. In the States the focus is on real and obvious harm to consumers in the form of higher prices or less choice. They also seem more sympathetic to the tech giants' argument that they can be easily toppled from their perches by feisty start-ups. European regulators tend to take a wider view of markets, worrying about a ""winner takes it all"" world, where a few mighty platforms appear to offer consumers a shiny world of free or very cheap goodies, but in reality are devoted to crushing any competition. This culture clash isn't going to fade away any time soon. Cheered on by many who are concerned about Silicon Valley's dominance, Ms Vestager will not abandon her mission to tame the tech giants - and the likes of Google, Apple and Amazon will fiercely resist any regulation that they see as a threat to their lucrative business models.

"Taking omega-3 fish oil supplements is often touted as a simple way to protect your heart - but experts say the evidence that it does any good is flimsy at best. Cochrane researchers,externallooked at trials in over 100,000 people and found little proof that it prevented heart disease. They say the chance of getting any meaningful benefit from taking omega-3 is one in 1,000. Eating oily fish, however, can still be recommended as part of a healthy diet. The review mainly looked at supplements rather than omega-3 from eating fish. Experts still believe the latter is good for the heart as well as general health. The NHS says people should try to eat two portions of fish per week, one of which should be oily fish, such as salmon, fresh tuna or mackerel, to get enough ""good"" fats. Omega-3 is a family of fats that includes: ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) - which the body can't make for itself but is found in vegetable oils,  nuts and seeds EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) - which the body can make from ALA but are also present in oily fish and fish oils, including cod liver oil Some brands of milk, yoghurt, bread and spreads have extra omega-3 (usually ALA) added to them. But when it comes to fish oil supplements, Cochrane lead author, Dr Lee Hooper, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""We can be confident in the findings of this review which go against the popular belief that long-chain omega-3 supplements protect the heart. ""This large systematic review included information from many thousands of people over long periods. ""Despite all this information, we don't see protective effects. ""The review provides good evidence that taking long-chain omega-3 [fish oil, EPA or DHA] supplements does not benefit heart health or reduce our risk of stroke or death from any cause. ""The most trustworthy studies consistently showed little or no effect of long-chain omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health."" Some fish contain small amounts of chemicals that may be harmful if eaten in large amounts. Shark, marlin and swordfish may contain small amounts of mercury and should be avoided by women who are pregnant or planning a baby and by all children under 16. Other groups should eat no more than one portion of these fish each week. Prof Tom Sanders, a nutrition expert at King's College London and honorary director of Heart UK, said: ""Current dietary guidelines to prevent cardiovascular disease encourage fish consumption, rather than taking supplements. ""This study provides no evidence to suggest that this dietary advice should change."" Prof Tim Chico, a cardiologist from Sheffield University, said: ""There was a period where people who had suffered a heart attack were prescribed these on the NHS. This stopped some years ago. ""Such supplements come with a significant cost, so my advice to anyone buying them in the hope that they reduce the risk of heart disease, I'd advise them to spend their money on vegetables instead."" Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the Health and Food Supplements Information Service, said early studies of omega-3 fats had found a protective benefit for the heart, but it wasn't always easy to pick up the modest effects of dietary change, particularly in older people on medication. ""For those who won't eat mackerel, salmon or herring, a daily fish oil supplement is a useful way of meeting recommendations,"" she said. ""Omega-3s are also used by the body to maintain the health of the eyes, immune function and brain so it's not all about the heart.""

"This video can not be played Highlight from the boys' news conference The 12 boys rescued from a flooded cave in northern Thailand last week have spoken publicly of their ordeal for the first time, describing the ""moment of miracle"" when divers found them. Adul Sam-on, 14, the only member of the group who speaks English, told reporters he could only say ""hello"" when the British divers surfaced. The boys were trapped in the Tham Luang caves for more than two weeks. They left hospital earlier on Wednesday and are on their way home. Five things we learned from news conference Musk apology to diver for Twitter attack The full story of the cave rescue The 12, who are members of a junior football team, the Wild Boars, appeared in their club's kit at a news conference in Chiang Rai. They were greeted by a banner that read ""Bringing the Wild Boars Home"" on a stage designed to look like a football pitch. The boys sat alongside members of the Thai Navy Seals who helped rescue them. The boys came to the news conference in their football gear One boy described how they had lived on water from the stones of the cave. ""Water is clean,"" he said. ""Only water, no food."" Chanin ""Titan"" Wibrunrungrueang, 11, said: ""I tried not to think about food because it would make me hungry."" By Howard Johnson, BBC News, Chiang Rai This was a joyous news conference. The first joke was cracked by a Thai Navy Seal diver as he introduced himself: ""My name is Baitoey and I'm the most beautiful in the cave."" The room erupted with laughter. First to speak was Adul, the boy who communicated with the British divers. He said the coach asked him to translate. His reply: ""Chill, I can't understand that quickly!"" Cue more fits of giggles. The boys' friends, family and nurses from Chiang Rai Hospital were smiling and willing them on from the sidelines. A compere kept up a lively patter, making sure no-one was left out. As attention turned to how they became trapped, the mood in the room became more sober. The boys listened attentively as their coach described finding the shelf that kept them safe. When Titan, the youngest of the 12, said he tried not to think of food because it only made him hungry, the others laughed out loud - proof again that even in the worst conditions, these boys have an unbeatable team spirit. The boys went missing on 23 June and were found by divers on 2 July. Navy Seals then brought them food and other supplies. The group described how they bonded with their rescuers over more than a week, until their final rescue. ""We played draughts (checkers),"" Titan said. ""(Navy Seal) Baitoey always won and he was the king of cave."" This video can not be played Thai cave rescue: Saying sorry to cave spirit Nang Norn The team's coach, Ekapol Chantawong, who was rescued with them, paid tribute toSaman Kunan, a former Navy Seal who died during the operation. ""We are impressed that Saman sacrificed his life to save us so that we could go and live our lives. Once we heard the news, we were shocked,"" he said. ""We were very sad. We felt like... we caused sadness to his family."" Some boys said they would learn from their ordeal. One promised to be ""more careful and live my life the fullest"". Another said: ""This experience taught me to be more patient and strong."" The boys are due to be ordained as Buddhist monks for a short period of time, a tradition for males in Thailand who have experienced a misfortune. The boys and the coach got trapped when sudden rain blocked their exit from Tham Luang cave, where they had planned to spend only an hour. The heroes who saved the Wild Boars In pictures: How the rescue unfolded The boys survived on water dripping from the cave Nine days passed before the boys were found by two British rescue divers. It was unclear at first how they would be brought out of the flooded cave. But with more rain expected, a risky rescue was attempted. Expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the exit. Each boy was accompanied by a diver who also carried his air supply. The boys were heavily sedated ahead of the rescue to prevent them panicking. The boys and their coach were rescued in three stages over three days. All 13 were transferred to the hospital in Chiang Rai where they received medical and psychological assistance. Who are the boys and their coach?

"Teenagers are becoming less likely to have sex, preferring to spend time with their families and having romantic relationships online, a study suggests. A survey of 1,000 16- to 18-year-olds also found they were drinking much less. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service said this may explain the sharp fall in teen pregnancies in the UK since 2007. Two-thirds of the teenagers surveyed said they had never had sex. And 24% said they had never drunk alcohol. The BPAS report said this current generation of teenagers appeared to be more sensible, more focused on their education and future careers and wanted to avoid pregnancy. More than 80% of those surveyed said performing well in exams or succeeding in their chosen career was a top priority, compared with 68% who said spending time with friends was a top priority. Young people were also more likely to view time with their family as of high importance than time with their friends. And many said work and study commitments meant organising time to see friends was difficult. But daily diaries filled in by teenagers as part of the survey also reveal they are spending an average of almost five hours online every day for non-work or study reasons. Less than a quarter of those surveyed spoke to their friends face to face as frequently as they spoke to them online - and 70% spoke to them online four times a week or more. The researchers suggest young people who regularly socialise face to face with their friends or partners are more likely to be sexually active. 'Being a teenage mum is so lonely' Sex education 'must cover consent and respect' Teenage pregnancy rates have been dropping for 20 years across all nations of the UK after a government strategy was introduced to tackle some of the highest rates in Western Europe. The strategy, which led to better access to contraceptive services and more sex education in schools and clinics, lasted 10 years - but rates have continued to fall, by 50% since 2007. In 1969, the conception rate was 47 per 1,000 young women aged 15-17 - in 2016, it was just 18.9. The BPAS survey found attitudes had also changed - four out of five young people felt there was now a stigma attached to becoming a teenage parent and young women no longer expected to be supported by the state or their family if they became pregnant. Most said they always or usually used contraception when having sex, although 14% said they ""rarely"" or ""never"" did. BPAS head of policy research Katherine O'Brien said the government's plan for mandatory relationships and sex education in schools from September 2019 could bring down teenage conception rates even further if it was comprehensive enough. She said: ""Our research reveals that this is a generation who are focused on their education, aware of economic challenges but determined to succeed regardless and many of whom enjoy time with their families as much as with partners and friends. ""They seem to place significant value on responsibility and maturity, particularly when it comes to alcohol consumption and sex. ""We believe that young people themselves are making different choices about the way they live their lives."" However, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists president Prof Lesley Regan said strong regional variations in teenage pregnancy still existed. It was disappointing that ""a significant proportion of young people are not receiving a high-quality of sex and relationships education"", she said. And cuts to local public health budgets were making it difficult for some young people to access contraceptive services. She called on the government to ensure the needs of young people were met ""as a matter of urgency"".

"This video can not be played Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns challenges the PM to name the time when Brexit became Remain. Theresa May has insisted any Brexit deal must be ""workable"" as she came under fire from both Labour and Conservative MPs in the Commons. During Prime Minister's Questions, she said she disagreed with Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, who asked her ""at what point it was decided Brexit means Remain"". The PM said any deal had to be credible and protect the economy, as well as honouring the 2016 referendum result. Jeremy Corbyn said the Conservatives had ""sunk into a mire"" of infighting. And former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has increased the pressure on the prime minister, accusing her government of ""dithering"" over what it wants and telling MPs it is ""not too late to save Brexit"". At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Johnson: It is not too late to save Brexit Maternity leave MP accuses Tories over vote Appearing before the Liaison Committee of select committee chairs, Mrs May said she stood by her claim that ""no deal was better a bad deal"" when it came to Brexit.  She said the government was working for a ""good deal"" but would be stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" scenario, with plans to issue ""technical notices"" to businesses that would be affected. But she would not set out the ""consequences"" of leaving the EU without a deal to the public until it happened, she told liaison committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston. Mrs May also conceded that her proposed post-Brexit trade and tariff arrangements were a ""novel idea"" that did not exist anywhere else in the world, adding that that did not matter, if they were the ""best"" arrangements for the UK. And she admitted that the ""facilitated customs arrangement"" plan set out in her Brexit White Paper may not be fully ready by the time the transition period expires at the end of 2020. And under questioning from veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash, she denied showing copies of the White Paper to Angela Merkel or other European leaders before it was published and given to MPs. During the final session of PMQs before the summer recess, Mrs May defended her handling of Brexit negotiations and her recent talks with Donald Trump, telling Mr Corbyn that while the Labour leader ""protests, I deliver"". Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Acknowledging ""strong feelings"" on all sides, she insisted her blueprint for future relations with the EU was realistic and already being considered by the EU. In response to Ms Jenkyns's question, she insisted ""Brexit continues to mean Brexit"" and the government should be ""talking about the positives"" of leaving. But the PM added: ""I know she has criticised me for looking for a solution that is workable. I disagree with her on that because I think we need a solution which is going to work for the UK."" On Tuesday, ministers saw off a bid by Tory rebels to create a customs union with the EU if a trade deal failed. The rebel amendment to the trade bill was defeated by only six votes. Twelve Conservatives rebelled against their party by supporting the amendment but the government's total was boosted by the support of four Labour MPs. Conservative MPs were warned that voting for the amendment, and therefore against the government, could lead to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister or a general election, leading Tory remainer Anna Soubry said. This video can not be played Tory MP Anna Soubry tells Today 'both political parties are in the grips of their own extremists' She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was an ""appalling spectacle"" - and that she would be the first in the queue to give her backing to Mrs May. ""The problem is, I don't think that she's in charge any more,"" said the MP for Broxtowe. ""I've no doubt that Jacob Rees Mogg is running our country."" The former minister called for a government of national unity to deal with Brexit. ""I personally would abandon the Labour frontbench and I would reach beyond it and I would encompass Plaid Cymru, the SNP and other sensible, pragmatic people who believe in putting this country's interests first and foremost,"" she said. She also said that many MPs were ""frightened of the extremes"" within their local associations. Hardline Brexiteers led by Mr Rees Mogg are ruthless and organised, while the ""pragmatic majority"" are loyal to the prime minister, she added. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, who is effectively Mrs May's second-in-command, rejected claims her government was in desperate straits over Brexit. ""When the government doesn't have an overall majority in either house of Parliament, things are sometimes close on votes,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But he said the prime minister was ""absolutely focused on getting the right deal for the country in negotiations with her European counterparts"". He apologised to Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, who has accused the Conservatives of double crossing her in Tuesday night's vote. Ms Swinson, who is on a maternity leave, had a ""pairing"" arrangement with Tory chairman Brandon Lewis, which meant he should not have taken part in the vote. Mr Lidington said the fact that Mr Lewis had voted was a ""genuine mess-up"" that should not have happened and he had apologised to Ms Swinson.

"The High Court ruling on Sir Cliff Richard's privacy case against the BBC has prompted reaction from media, police and friends of the singer. Here's what's being discussed. While the BBC has apologised to Sir Cliff Richard for the distress caused by coverage of the raid on his home, the ruling could have an impact on press freedom, its director of news said. Fran Unsworth admitted the case had had a ""very serious impact"" on Sir Cliff, adding there were things that could have been done differently. But, she noted, the judge stressed that even if no footage of the search had been broadcast, then ""the very naming of Sir Cliff would have been unlawful"". This video can not be played The BBC's director of news said she would be going through the whole judgement in detail ""This creates a significant shift against press freedom,"" said Ms Unsworth. ""This means police investigations and searches of people's homes could go unreported and unscrutinised. It will put decision-making about naming individuals in the hands of the police over the public's right to know. ""We don't believe this is compatible with liberty and press freedoms."" Ms Unsworth said there was ""an important principle at stake"", which is why the BBC is considering an appeal. Asked by a reporter outside court if she or Jonathan Munro, the BBC's head of newsgathering, intended to resign, she said it was a ""very long"" judgement and that the BBC had to ""take time to consider what lessons are to be learned"". There has been concern in the media over the ruling and the implications it could have for press freedom. The Society of Editors said,externalthat the judgement ""threatens the ability of the media as a whole to police the police"". Ian Murray, its executive director, said: ""The ruling to make it unlawful that anyone under investigation can be named is a major step and one that has worrying consequences for press freedom and the public's right to know."" He said making it unlawful to name someone under investigation is ""extreme"". ""Certainly, such a major change in the law should be debated in Parliament and not come into force following one case involving a high-profile celebrity,"" said Mr Murray. ""In many situations, the publishing of the name of someone under investigation has led to other witnesses and victims coming forward. We should also consider that the reverse is true. It is vital that the actions of the police should be kept under scrutiny in a free society and this change in the law will make that much harder."" Sunday Times political editor Tim Shipman said the ruling was ""an atrocity for a free media"" and would ""dramatically restrict the freedom to report"". Allow Twitter content?

Sir Cliff said he was ""choked up"" and that the judgement was ""wonderful news"". His lawyer Gideon Benaim said the impact on Sir Cliff had been ""profound"". ""He never expected after 60 years in the public eye that his privacy and reputation would be tarnished in this way, and that he would need to fight such a battle,"" he said. ""Although he felt it necessary to pursue this case - and the sum awarded in damages is one of the highest ever in this area of law - Sir Cliff's motivation was not for personal gain, as he knew all along that he would be substantially out of pocket no matter what. ""His aim has been to try to right a wrong, and, to ensure as best he could, that no other innocent person would have to endure what he went through."" This video can not be played ""It's going to take a little while to get over the whole emotional factor"" On the matter of press freedom, Jon Oakley of Simkins law firm - which represented Sir Cliff - said: ""Where there is a genuine public interest in people being named - for example, where there is imminent risk or danger to the public - the press rightly continues to be free to identify the person being investigated. ""However, after very careful consideration, the judge found that any such public interest does not exist on the facts of this particular case. ""Therefore, rather than heralding any change in the law, we believe what this case represents is confirmation of what has already been the legal position for some time."" Paul Gambaccini spoke to reporters outside court after the ruling Paul Gambaccini, broadcaster and friend of Sir Cliff, said that when the singer found out about the raid he collapsed to the floor weeping, but that another friend had told him to fight the case. ""And he has fought it,"" said Mr Gambaccini. ""And he's fought it for three years, 11 months and four days. And now he's been vindicated."" Gloria Hunniford, speaking on ITV's Loose Women, revealed Sir Cliff had spent Â£4m of his own money on legal fees. ""I hope his life begins as of now,"" she said. ""Let's get on with what he does best."" Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Conservative MP Anna Soubry called for a change in the law over naming suspects. Prime Minister Theresa May said in response that it was a ""difficult issue"" that needed ""careful judgement"". Chief Constable Stephen Watson of South Yorkshire Police accepted the judge's findings. He said: ""I particularly welcome Mr Justice Mann's findings that all South Yorkshire Police officers and staff were found to have acted entirely honestly and were credible and reliable witnesses. ""At a very early stage of these proceedings, we accepted and apologised to Sir Cliff Richard for the mistakes we made in our attempts to protect the integrity of the police investigation and the rights of the complainant, balanced against Sir Cliff Richard's privacy rights. ""I would like to take this opportunity to again offer our sincere apologies for the distress Sir Cliff Richard has suffered."" Dr Alan Billings, South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner, said: ""I welcome the judgement in this case and am sorry for the distress caused to Sir Cliff Richard over this difficult period of time. ""South Yorkshire Police admitted and acknowledged their mistakes, settling damages with Sir Cliff Richard out of court in 2017. ""I have also been assured by South Yorkshire Police, that they have implemented the five recommendations in the 2014 Trotter Review, an independent review into the disclosure of information to the BBC.""

"Taking omega-3 fish oil supplements is often touted as a simple way to protect your heart - but experts say the evidence that it does any good is flimsy at best. Cochrane researchers,externallooked at trials in over 100,000 people and found little proof that it prevented heart disease. They say the chance of getting any meaningful benefit from taking omega-3 is one in 1,000. Eating oily fish, however, can still be recommended as part of a healthy diet. The review mainly looked at supplements rather than omega-3 from eating fish. Experts still believe the latter is good for the heart as well as general health. The NHS says people should try to eat two portions of fish per week, one of which should be oily fish, such as salmon, fresh tuna or mackerel, to get enough ""good"" fats. Omega-3 is a family of fats that includes: ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) - which the body can't make for itself but is found in vegetable oils,  nuts and seeds EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) - which the body can make from ALA but are also present in oily fish and fish oils, including cod liver oil Some brands of milk, yoghurt, bread and spreads have extra omega-3 (usually ALA) added to them. But when it comes to fish oil supplements, Cochrane lead author, Dr Lee Hooper, from the University of East Anglia, said: ""We can be confident in the findings of this review which go against the popular belief that long-chain omega-3 supplements protect the heart. ""This large systematic review included information from many thousands of people over long periods. ""Despite all this information, we don't see protective effects. ""The review provides good evidence that taking long-chain omega-3 [fish oil, EPA or DHA] supplements does not benefit heart health or reduce our risk of stroke or death from any cause. ""The most trustworthy studies consistently showed little or no effect of long-chain omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health."" Some fish contain small amounts of chemicals that may be harmful if eaten in large amounts. Shark, marlin and swordfish may contain small amounts of mercury and should be avoided by women who are pregnant or planning a baby and by all children under 16. Other groups should eat no more than one portion of these fish each week. Prof Tom Sanders, a nutrition expert at King's College London and honorary director of Heart UK, said: ""Current dietary guidelines to prevent cardiovascular disease encourage fish consumption, rather than taking supplements. ""This study provides no evidence to suggest that this dietary advice should change."" Prof Tim Chico, a cardiologist from Sheffield University, said: ""There was a period where people who had suffered a heart attack were prescribed these on the NHS. This stopped some years ago. ""Such supplements come with a significant cost, so my advice to anyone buying them in the hope that they reduce the risk of heart disease, I'd advise them to spend their money on vegetables instead."" Dr Carrie Ruxton, from the Health and Food Supplements Information Service, said early studies of omega-3 fats had found a protective benefit for the heart, but it wasn't always easy to pick up the modest effects of dietary change, particularly in older people on medication. ""For those who won't eat mackerel, salmon or herring, a daily fish oil supplement is a useful way of meeting recommendations,"" she said. ""Omega-3s are also used by the body to maintain the health of the eyes, immune function and brain so it's not all about the heart.""

"Christopher Lythgoe (l) and Matthew Hankinson (r) were jailed for a total of 14 years Two men have been found guilty of being members of banned neo-Nazi group National Action. Christopher Lythgoe, 32, of Warrington, and Matthew Hankinson, 24, of Newton-le-Willows, Merseyside, were convicted after a trial lasting over five weeks. Lythgoe was jailed for eight years and Hankinson for six. Earlier in the trial, another man, Jack Renshaw, 23, of Skelmersdale, Lancashire, admitted preparing an act of terrorism after buying a machete. He admitted buying it for the purpose of murdering West Lancashire MP Rosie Cooper. A former National Action member, Robbie Mullen, warned the anti-racism charity Hope Not Hate of Renshaw's plan, and they went to the police. Ms Cooper thanked Mr Mullen and the police forces who helped her, adding: ""I think it's awful that any public servant - teacher, nurse, doctor, police, MP - should be targeted and threatened with violence simply because of the job they do."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""The extreme far right has absolutely no place in Britain and I am glad these vile extremists are behind bars where they belong."" A total of six men were on trial at the Old Bailey, accused of being members of National Action. Lythgoe, the National Action leader, was found not guilty of encouragement to murder for allegedly giving Renshaw permission to kill Ms Cooper on behalf of the group. Renshaw also admitted threatening to kill Det Con Victoria Henderson, who was investigating him for other matters. Mr Justice Jay said group meetings after the ban were attempting to keep alive an aspiration that was ""truly insidious and evil: the idea that this country should be purged of its ethnic minorities and its Jews; that the rule of law should be subverted; and that once the ideological revolution had taken place this national socialist world view would triumph"". Sentencing Lythgoe, he said: ""You are a fully-fledged neo-Nazi replete with concomitant deep-seated, entrenched racism and anti-Semitism."" The judge told Hankinson: ""You too are a neo-Nazi who glorifies and revels in a perverted ideology, has a deep hatred of ethnic minorities and Jews and has advocated violence to achieve your objectives."" Jurors were unable to decide either whether Renshaw had remained a member of National Action after it was banned, or whether two other men - Michal Trubini, 35, from Warrington and Andrew Clarke, 33, from Prescot, Merseyside - were guilty of the same charge. Another defendant - Garron Helm, 24, from Seaforth in Merseyside - was found not guilty of being a member of the group. It can also now be reported that Renshaw was convicted earlier this year of two counts of stirring up racial hatred in speeches he made in 2016. Jack Renshaw admitted preparing an act of terrorism - buying a machete for the purpose of murdering MP Rosie Cooper National Action, which was founded in 2013, was the first extreme right-wing group to be banned in the UK. It was proscribed in December 2016 after it was assessed as being ""concerned in terrorism"". Earlier that year, the group had celebrated the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a white supremacist, which the government said amounted to the unlawful glorification of terrorism. Det Supt Will Chatterton, head of investigations for counter-terrorism policing for the North West, said: ""Today's result has enabled the spotlight to be shone on the sickening activities of the banned extreme right-wing organisation National Action [and] is a body blow to extreme right-wing organisations. ""It sends out a clear message that counter-terrorism officers and partner agencies will rigorously identify and investigate any violently extreme individual or group who seek to bring a reign of terror to our shores."" Deputy director of Hope Not Hate, Jemma Levene, welcomed the sentences, adding: ""This case should remind everyone of the ongoing threat posed by the British far right. ""While numerically small and splintered, the British far right is growing in violence. This case has brought National Action to its knees, but we must remain vigilant.""

"This video can not be played Abstentionist Irish rebel MP finally enters Westminster One hundred years after winning a seat in the House of Commons, the first woman MP finally graces the corridors of Westminster. It was a seat that Constance Markievicz never took - in line with Sinn FÃ©in's abstentionist policy. Remarkably, she fought the 1918 election for the constituency of Dublin St Patrick's from a cell in Holloway prison - and out of 18 women candidates, she was the only one to win a seat. Her portrait, donated by the Irish parliament, was received on Wednesday by Speaker John Bercow on behalf of the House of Commons. Born in 1868, Constance Gore-Booth was an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, but developed an allegiance to an Irish Republic. WB Yeats immortalised Constance Gore-Booth, left, and her sister Eva, as ""two girls in silk kimonos, both beautiful, one a gazelle"" She spent her childhood at Lissadell House in County Sligo, but was eager to travel and studied art in London and Paris. It was at the AcadÃ©mie Julian in Paris that she met Casimir Markievicz; the pair married in London in 1900. Commonly known as Count and Countess Markievicz, her family and some historians have raised questions about the provenance of the title. Constance Markievicz - or Madame de Markievicz, as she was known - was the first woman elected to the House of Commons, and she was the first woman elected to the First DÃ¡il. Speaker of the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) SeÃ¡n Ã FearghaÃ­l believes both the British and Irish people ""need reminding just how magnificent this woman was"". ""She was an extraordinarily influential"" woman, he added. Constance Gore-Booth, pictured here as a debutante in 1884, soon became involved in the suffragist movement Lauren Arrington, a senior lecturer at the Institute of Irish Studies at Liverpool University, said Markievicz was exposed to alternative political opinions while she was in the French capital. ""She was at the centre of an avant-garde culture in Paris and she encountered ideals that were sensible to her - that women should be equal to men,"" said Dr Arrington. Constance joined her sister, Eva, in Manchester in 1908: As key players in the Barmaids' Political Defence League, they successfully campaigned against the re-election of Winston Churchill in the Manchester North West by-election. But while Markievicz was an anti-imperialist, the1913 Dublin lockoutwas a pivotal moment for her. ""It's the lockout and the formation of the Irish Citizen Army which brings her to republicanism,"" said Dr Arrington. Constance Markievicz was hailed as a hero when she returned to Dublin from prison in 1917 Constance Markievicz took part in theEaster Rising of 1916and fought against British crown forces under socialist rebel Michael Mallin at St Stephen's Green in Dublin. On Easter Monday Dublin Metropolitan police officer Michael Lahiff was shot three times when he was at St Stephen's Green and he later died in hospital. It is believed Mr Lahiff was shot by Markievicz. The rising was unsuccessful and the ringleaders, including Markievicz, were sentenced to death. At her court martial, Markievicz declared she was ""ready to die for Ireland one way or another"". However, Markievicz's death sentence was commuted to life in prison because she was a woman. This greatly frustrated her, according to Dr Arrington. ""It annoyed her as she felt that she shouldn't get off purely because she was a woman, and she also felt some responsibility for the jailed rebels she knew from Na Fianna Ãireann - a nationalist youth organisation Markievicz co-founded with Bulmer Hobson,"" explained Dr Arrington. ""In the first few days after the Rising she was in prison in Kilmainham Gaol, and she could hear the other executions happening from her cell. ""That was torturous for her."" The gifting of the portrait is just one of the ways in which the Houses of the Oireachtas and the UK Parliament are marking the centenary of women's suffrage Although Constance Markievicz was released from prison in 1917 under a general amnesty, she was detained again by 1918. The British government feared a repeat of the 1916 Easter Rising and arrested most of the Sinn FÃ©in leadership charging them with entering into treasonable communication with the German enemy. ""The charges were trumped-up"", explains Dr Arrington adding that ""the government underestimated the extent to which the imprisonment would be a rallying-cry and actually increase Sinn Fein's political power"". Constance Markievicz died in 1927 aged 59, nine years after refusing to take her seat in Westminster Later that year, Prime Minister David Lloyd George called a general election immediately after Armistice Day. Campaigning from a cell in London's Holloway prison, Markievicz combined her suffragist ideals with her anti-imperialism. ""Her platform was for a republic in which men and woman would be equal, and Ireland would be free to pursue its own destiny,"" said Lauren Arrington. Constance Markievicz was sentenced to death for her part in the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland Rather than take her seat in the House of Commons, Madame de Markievicz - along with 72 other Sinn FÃ©in MPs - refused to acknowledge the authority of the British government, and instead helped establish the First DÃ¡il at Dublin's Mansion House in January 1919. Markievicz died in 1927 aged 59, in a public ward in Dublin's Sir Patrick Dun's hospital. Her funeral was attended by the great and the good of Irish society, includingfuture President Ãamon de Valera. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Highlight from the boys' news conference The 12 boys rescued from a flooded cave in northern Thailand last week have spoken publicly of their ordeal for the first time, describing the ""moment of miracle"" when divers found them. Adul Sam-on, 14, the only member of the group who speaks English, told reporters he could only say ""hello"" when the British divers surfaced. The boys were trapped in the Tham Luang caves for more than two weeks. They left hospital earlier on Wednesday and are on their way home. Five things we learned from news conference Musk apology to diver for Twitter attack The full story of the cave rescue The 12, who are members of a junior football team, the Wild Boars, appeared in their club's kit at a news conference in Chiang Rai. They were greeted by a banner that read ""Bringing the Wild Boars Home"" on a stage designed to look like a football pitch. The boys sat alongside members of the Thai Navy Seals who helped rescue them. The boys came to the news conference in their football gear One boy described how they had lived on water from the stones of the cave. ""Water is clean,"" he said. ""Only water, no food."" Chanin ""Titan"" Wibrunrungrueang, 11, said: ""I tried not to think about food because it would make me hungry."" By Howard Johnson, BBC News, Chiang Rai This was a joyous news conference. The first joke was cracked by a Thai Navy Seal diver as he introduced himself: ""My name is Baitoey and I'm the most beautiful in the cave."" The room erupted with laughter. First to speak was Adul, the boy who communicated with the British divers. He said the coach asked him to translate. His reply: ""Chill, I can't understand that quickly!"" Cue more fits of giggles. The boys' friends, family and nurses from Chiang Rai Hospital were smiling and willing them on from the sidelines. A compere kept up a lively patter, making sure no-one was left out. As attention turned to how they became trapped, the mood in the room became more sober. The boys listened attentively as their coach described finding the shelf that kept them safe. When Titan, the youngest of the 12, said he tried not to think of food because it only made him hungry, the others laughed out loud - proof again that even in the worst conditions, these boys have an unbeatable team spirit. The boys went missing on 23 June and were found by divers on 2 July. Navy Seals then brought them food and other supplies. The group described how they bonded with their rescuers over more than a week, until their final rescue. ""We played draughts (checkers),"" Titan said. ""(Navy Seal) Baitoey always won and he was the king of cave."" This video can not be played Thai cave rescue: Saying sorry to cave spirit Nang Norn The team's coach, Ekapol Chantawong, who was rescued with them, paid tribute toSaman Kunan, a former Navy Seal who died during the operation. ""We are impressed that Saman sacrificed his life to save us so that we could go and live our lives. Once we heard the news, we were shocked,"" he said. ""We were very sad. We felt like... we caused sadness to his family."" Some boys said they would learn from their ordeal. One promised to be ""more careful and live my life the fullest"". Another said: ""This experience taught me to be more patient and strong."" The boys are due to be ordained as Buddhist monks for a short period of time, a tradition for males in Thailand who have experienced a misfortune. The boys and the coach got trapped when sudden rain blocked their exit from Tham Luang cave, where they had planned to spend only an hour. The heroes who saved the Wild Boars In pictures: How the rescue unfolded The boys survived on water dripping from the cave Nine days passed before the boys were found by two British rescue divers. It was unclear at first how they would be brought out of the flooded cave. But with more rain expected, a risky rescue was attempted. Expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the exit. Each boy was accompanied by a diver who also carried his air supply. The boys were heavily sedated ahead of the rescue to prevent them panicking. The boys and their coach were rescued in three stages over three days. All 13 were transferred to the hospital in Chiang Rai where they received medical and psychological assistance. Who are the boys and their coach?

"This video can not be played Conservative MP Andrea Jenkyns challenges the PM to name the time when Brexit became Remain. Theresa May has insisted any Brexit deal must be ""workable"" as she came under fire from both Labour and Conservative MPs in the Commons. During Prime Minister's Questions, she said she disagreed with Tory MP Andrea Jenkyns, who asked her ""at what point it was decided Brexit means Remain"". The PM said any deal had to be credible and protect the economy, as well as honouring the 2016 referendum result. Jeremy Corbyn said the Conservatives had ""sunk into a mire"" of infighting. And former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has increased the pressure on the prime minister, accusing her government of ""dithering"" over what it wants and telling MPs it is ""not too late to save Brexit"". At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Johnson: It is not too late to save Brexit Maternity leave MP accuses Tories over vote Appearing before the Liaison Committee of select committee chairs, Mrs May said she stood by her claim that ""no deal was better a bad deal"" when it came to Brexit.  She said the government was working for a ""good deal"" but would be stepping up preparations for a ""no deal"" scenario, with plans to issue ""technical notices"" to businesses that would be affected. But she would not set out the ""consequences"" of leaving the EU without a deal to the public until it happened, she told liaison committee chairwoman Sarah Wollaston. Mrs May also conceded that her proposed post-Brexit trade and tariff arrangements were a ""novel idea"" that did not exist anywhere else in the world, adding that that did not matter, if they were the ""best"" arrangements for the UK. And she admitted that the ""facilitated customs arrangement"" plan set out in her Brexit White Paper may not be fully ready by the time the transition period expires at the end of 2020. And under questioning from veteran Eurosceptic Sir Bill Cash, she denied showing copies of the White Paper to Angela Merkel or other European leaders before it was published and given to MPs. During the final session of PMQs before the summer recess, Mrs May defended her handling of Brexit negotiations and her recent talks with Donald Trump, telling Mr Corbyn that while the Labour leader ""protests, I deliver"". Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Acknowledging ""strong feelings"" on all sides, she insisted her blueprint for future relations with the EU was realistic and already being considered by the EU. In response to Ms Jenkyns's question, she insisted ""Brexit continues to mean Brexit"" and the government should be ""talking about the positives"" of leaving. But the PM added: ""I know she has criticised me for looking for a solution that is workable. I disagree with her on that because I think we need a solution which is going to work for the UK."" On Tuesday, ministers saw off a bid by Tory rebels to create a customs union with the EU if a trade deal failed. The rebel amendment to the trade bill was defeated by only six votes. Twelve Conservatives rebelled against their party by supporting the amendment but the government's total was boosted by the support of four Labour MPs. Conservative MPs were warned that voting for the amendment, and therefore against the government, could lead to a vote of no confidence in the prime minister or a general election, leading Tory remainer Anna Soubry said. This video can not be played Tory MP Anna Soubry tells Today 'both political parties are in the grips of their own extremists' She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was an ""appalling spectacle"" - and that she would be the first in the queue to give her backing to Mrs May. ""The problem is, I don't think that she's in charge any more,"" said the MP for Broxtowe. ""I've no doubt that Jacob Rees Mogg is running our country."" The former minister called for a government of national unity to deal with Brexit. ""I personally would abandon the Labour frontbench and I would reach beyond it and I would encompass Plaid Cymru, the SNP and other sensible, pragmatic people who believe in putting this country's interests first and foremost,"" she said. She also said that many MPs were ""frightened of the extremes"" within their local associations. Hardline Brexiteers led by Mr Rees Mogg are ruthless and organised, while the ""pragmatic majority"" are loyal to the prime minister, she added. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, who is effectively Mrs May's second-in-command, rejected claims her government was in desperate straits over Brexit. ""When the government doesn't have an overall majority in either house of Parliament, things are sometimes close on votes,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But he said the prime minister was ""absolutely focused on getting the right deal for the country in negotiations with her European counterparts"". He apologised to Lib Dem deputy leader Jo Swinson, who has accused the Conservatives of double crossing her in Tuesday night's vote. Ms Swinson, who is on a maternity leave, had a ""pairing"" arrangement with Tory chairman Brandon Lewis, which meant he should not have taken part in the vote. Mr Lidington said the fact that Mr Lewis had voted was a ""genuine mess-up"" that should not have happened and he had apologised to Ms Swinson.

"Inflation remained at 2.4% for the third month in a row in June, according to the Office for National Statistics, after clothing prices fell. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation had been expected to rise to 2.6% last month. However, the summer sales weighed on inflation after clothing prices were cut, in particular on men's fashion. The unchanged figure means that wages remain above inflation despite pay growth slowing to 2.7%. The pound fell against the dollar following the surprise reading, slipping 0.60% to $1.3037. There had been expectations that the Bank of England would raise interest rates in August. But Ben Brettell, Senior Economist, Hargreaves Lansdown, said that June's figure meant it is not ""a done deal"". He said: ""Markets had been pricing in around an 80% chance the Bank would lift borrowing costs in August, but today's inflation data combined with yesterday's lacklustre wage growth figures could force policymakers into a rethink."" Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com, said: ""The Bank of England's policymakers seem to be guiding a hike and the market has quietly acquiesced but data this week does not support the case for an imminent raising of rates. ""My bet is the Bank will - as in May - be forced by softer data to be forced away from raising rates too quickly."" The ONS said that the price of clothing and footwear fell by 2.3% between May and June compared to a 1.1% decline in the same period last year. While it said it was normal for prices to drop at this time of year due to the start of the summer sales season, the ONS said the fall was the largest since 2012 and ""the effect came mainly from men's clothing"". The price of computer games also fell. The ONS said: ""Prices for these games are heavily dependent on the composition of bestseller charts, often resulting in large overall price changes from month to month."" However, the cost of motor fuel and household energy prices rose to keep inflation steady. Petrol prices rose by 2.7p per litre to 128p between May and June 2018 - the highest average price since September 2014. Diesel prices also rose, up 2.9p to 132.1p. Both petrol and diesel prices fell between May and June last year. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: ""Consumers have been feeling the benefit of the summer clothing sales, and computer game prices have also fallen. ""However, gas and electricity and petrol prices all rose, with consumers seeing the highest price at the pump for nearly four years, with inflation remaining steady overall.""

"An MP who is on maternity leave has accused the government of a breach of trust over a key House of Commons vote on Brexit. Lib Dem Jo Swinson was ""paired"" with Tory chairman Brandon Lewis so she could be at home with her baby son during the Trade Bill vote. This should mean neither MP votes so their absences cancel each other out. But Mr Lewis did vote with the government - he has since apologised for an ""honest mistake"" by whips. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, a key ally of Theresa May, also apologised, telling BBC Radio 4's Today that it was a ""genuine mess-up"" on his party's behalf which ""clearly should not have happened"". Government survives key Brexit trade vote Proxy voting by MPs 'good for democracy' Lib Dem whip 'messed up' over Brexit vote The row blew up after voting had taken place on the Trade Bill, where the main battleground was an amendment to do with staying in the customs union if the UK fails to agree a trade deal with the EU. The Lib Dems voted against the government alongside Labour, the SNP and some pro-EU Tories, but the government won by 307 to 301. Pairing is an informal arrangement between two MPs of opposing parties that allows them, with the agreement of the Whips (Whips are the MPs responsible for discipline in each party), to miss occasional votes in the House. If two members from opposite sides of the House both agree to miss a vote, then by agreeing to differ they would cancel out each other's vote, so neither member need turn up. Ms Swinson, the deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats and MP for East Dunbartonshire, gave birth to her second son Gabriel on 29 June. She said she had been told Mr Lewis would be her ""pair"" for the votes on the Trade Bill. Mr Lewis did not take part in most of the day's Trade Bill votes, but did take part in the two closest divisions - the one on customs and another on medicine regulation, which the government lost.

On Twitter, Ms Swinson accused the government of ""desperate stuff"" and a ""calculated, deliberate breaking of trust"" by Tory whips. Labour's shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler accused Mr Lewis of ""making politics even more inaccessible for new mums"". In a tweet to Ms Swinson, Mr Lewis said: ""I'm sorry Jo. I think it was an honest mistake made by the whips in fast-moving circumstances. I know how important the pair is to everyone, especially new parents, and I apologise."" In his apology, Conservative chief whip Julian Smith said Mr Lewis had been ""asked to vote in error"". Labour's Harriet Harman said the episode highlighted the need to allow MPs on parenting leave to nominate a proxy on their behalf. The Commons backed this principle earlier this year and a committee of MPs has put forward recommendations for how it might work. Ms Swinson said Parliament should now make a binding decision on introducing proxy voting before it breaks up for its summer recess on Tuesday. In an urgent question in the House of Commons, Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael said there had been a ""very serious breach of the convention"" and that while he accepted the apology, it was ""less than clear"" to him how it had happened. He described pairing as a ""19th century practice"" trying to cover for ""21st century employment law"" on baby leave. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said the incident involving Ms Swinson's vote had happened ""entirely in error"" and ""will not be repeated"". MPs will consider the issue of proxy voting ""at the earliest opportunity"", she added. Speaker John Bercow warned of ""endless procrastination"" over the issue, and said a decision must be made soon. Labour's shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz said Parliament should agree immediately to ""nod through"" MPs on baby leave. ""It's vital we are a modern workplace and that those on baby leave can have their vote recorded.""

"This video can not be played Highlight from the boys' news conference The 12 boys rescued from a flooded cave in northern Thailand last week have spoken publicly of their ordeal for the first time, describing the ""moment of miracle"" when divers found them. Adul Sam-on, 14, the only member of the group who speaks English, told reporters he could only say ""hello"" when the British divers surfaced. The boys were trapped in the Tham Luang caves for more than two weeks. They left hospital earlier on Wednesday and are on their way home. Five things we learned from news conference Musk apology to diver for Twitter attack The full story of the cave rescue The 12, who are members of a junior football team, the Wild Boars, appeared in their club's kit at a news conference in Chiang Rai. They were greeted by a banner that read ""Bringing the Wild Boars Home"" on a stage designed to look like a football pitch. The boys sat alongside members of the Thai Navy Seals who helped rescue them. The boys came to the news conference in their football gear One boy described how they had lived on water from the stones of the cave. ""Water is clean,"" he said. ""Only water, no food."" Chanin ""Titan"" Wibrunrungrueang, 11, said: ""I tried not to think about food because it would make me hungry."" By Howard Johnson, BBC News, Chiang Rai This was a joyous news conference. The first joke was cracked by a Thai Navy Seal diver as he introduced himself: ""My name is Baitoey and I'm the most beautiful in the cave."" The room erupted with laughter. First to speak was Adul, the boy who communicated with the British divers. He said the coach asked him to translate. His reply: ""Chill, I can't understand that quickly!"" Cue more fits of giggles. The boys' friends, family and nurses from Chiang Rai Hospital were smiling and willing them on from the sidelines. A compere kept up a lively patter, making sure no-one was left out. As attention turned to how they became trapped, the mood in the room became more sober. The boys listened attentively as their coach described finding the shelf that kept them safe. When Titan, the youngest of the 12, said he tried not to think of food because it only made him hungry, the others laughed out loud - proof again that even in the worst conditions, these boys have an unbeatable team spirit. The boys went missing on 23 June and were found by divers on 2 July. Navy Seals then brought them food and other supplies. The group described how they bonded with their rescuers over more than a week, until their final rescue. ""We played draughts (checkers),"" Titan said. ""(Navy Seal) Baitoey always won and he was the king of cave."" This video can not be played Thai cave rescue: Saying sorry to cave spirit Nang Norn The team's coach, Ekapol Chantawong, who was rescued with them, paid tribute toSaman Kunan, a former Navy Seal who died during the operation. ""We are impressed that Saman sacrificed his life to save us so that we could go and live our lives. Once we heard the news, we were shocked,"" he said. ""We were very sad. We felt like... we caused sadness to his family."" Some boys said they would learn from their ordeal. One promised to be ""more careful and live my life the fullest"". Another said: ""This experience taught me to be more patient and strong."" The boys are due to be ordained as Buddhist monks for a short period of time, a tradition for males in Thailand who have experienced a misfortune. The boys and the coach got trapped when sudden rain blocked their exit from Tham Luang cave, where they had planned to spend only an hour. The heroes who saved the Wild Boars In pictures: How the rescue unfolded The boys survived on water dripping from the cave Nine days passed before the boys were found by two British rescue divers. It was unclear at first how they would be brought out of the flooded cave. But with more rain expected, a risky rescue was attempted. Expert divers guided the boys and their coach through darkness and submerged passageways towards the exit. Each boy was accompanied by a diver who also carried his air supply. The boys were heavily sedated ahead of the rescue to prevent them panicking. The boys and their coach were rescued in three stages over three days. All 13 were transferred to the hospital in Chiang Rai where they received medical and psychological assistance. Who are the boys and their coach?

"Sir Cliff Richard is suing the BBC for damages at the ""top end"" of the scale Sir Cliff Richard is due to discover if he has successfully sued the BBC over coverage of a police raid of his home. Officers searched his home in Berkshire after an allegation of a historical child sex assault, but prosecutors later said there would be no charges. The singer, 77, said the BBC's reporting, which involved a helicopter filming his home, was a ""very serious invasion"" of his privacy. A High Court judge is due to announce his ruling on Wednesday morning. South Yorkshire Police previously agreed to pay Sir Cliff Â£400,000 and, according to his lawyers, the singer is seeking damages at the ""top end"" of the scale from the BBC. Sir Cliff case likely to have 'massive implications' A trial was held at the High Court in London in April and May where the BBC disputed his claims.

"They didn't escape defeat for long. Having squeaked through last night the government was beaten for only the second time ever in the Commons on key Brexit legislation. And guess what, it was on a vote they didn't expect to lose - Dr Phillip Lee, who quit the government to speak out on Brexit, put forward his own amendment to protect the links between the UK and the European Medicines Agency to ensure the smooth flow of medicines and new drugs for British patients after Brexit. Government survives key Brexit trade vote And he had enough to support to win it, just. An embarrassment for the government certainly. It is another reminder of how difficult it is for Theresa May to get her way in the House of Commons where she doesn't have her own majority. It is serious. A defeat is a problem. But it wasn't a complete disaster tonight for two reasons. First, the amendment isn't a million miles away from the government's own policy. While not straightforward, the vote hasn't forced a screeching U-turn. The more important reason is that the vote that followed, on keeping the UK in a customs union, went the other way. For many months, former Remain rebels have talked about this vote as being one of the critical moments when finally their bark would turn into a bite, the time when they would show their mettle and force the government to, as they see it, put jobs and economic stability ahead of their Brexit ideology. Tonight, a dozen of them, more than was needed to beat the government back in December, voted for the amendment. But the government won by six votes, because of four Labour MPs - long term advocates of leaving the EU - who voted with Theresa May. By all accounts, the government had to go to some pretty extreme attempts to keep the number of Tory rebels down to a dozen. Sources have told the BBC not just that the whips warned a government loss would lead to a vote of confidence in the prime minister, but also suggested the chaos that might ensue could tip them into a general election. But it was a vital victory, snatched from the jaws of defeat minutes earlier, because the prime minister has, for many months, expressly said that staying in a customs union is not possible, even if desirable. Rightly or wrongly, it is central to her strategy and to lose on that vote would have really have undermined her negotiating strategy only a day after Brexiteers undermined her from the other side. The numbers will still be a worry for the prime minister. Because if - as is likely when it comes to the final deal - all of the other parties vote against the government, it suggests there are enough Tories unhappy with the direction of travel to sink the government's plan. But for tonight, a win is a win, however chaotic, however dirty the tricks played to get the numbers there, and a massive defeat avoided - allowing Theresa May just about to keep the veneer that she can, more or less, get her business through the House of Commons. And the win will also provide ammunition for critics of the former Remain band, who, when push comes to shove, are not only less numerous than the ardent Brexiteers, but simply less willing to play hardball. It's no secret that instinctively and indeed, for many of them, proudly, they are more likely to argue for compromise, than some of the Eurosceptics. As one senior Tory joked, the Eurosceptics are more like Begbie from Trainspotting - and the Remainers are more like Penelope Keith's Margot from the Good Life. One senior Tory compared Remainers to The Good Life's Margot Begbie would fight, maybe to the death, for his cause. Margot would complain fervently and acidly, but she was never going to put the overall reputation of Surbiton at risk. That might sound ridiculous but this is one of the profound realities and a point we've discussed many times before. Some Brexiteers would rather risk an election than compromise. It is hard to find former Remainers who would do the same. That's been part of the calculations of Number 10 so far. But there has been so much turmoil in the last few weeks that it might not always be the case.

"The government won the vote by 307 to 301 The government has survived an attempt by pro-EU Conservative MPs to change its post-Brexit trade strategy. The MPs wanted the UK to join a customs union if it does not agree a free-trade deal with the EU. But the government, which says a customs union would stop it striking new trade deals, won by 307 to 301. Ahead of the vote, Tory MPs were told a defeat would lead to a vote of no confidence in the government, sources told the BBC's John Pienaar. The government did, however, lose a separate vote on its Trade Bill on the regulation of medicines after Brexit. MPs backed an amendment by 305 votes to 301 that would keep the UK in the European medicines regulatory network. There were 12 Tory rebels in both the customs and medicines votes - but the government's total was boosted by four Labour MPs in the customs vote. At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Brexit: All you need to know Plan 'delivers the Brexit UK voted for' Maternity leave MP accuses Tories over vote The customs union allows for tariff-free trading between members with a common tariff set for imports from the rest of the world. Please upgrade your browser The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but the two sides have yet to agree how their final trading relationship will work. The Commons has been debating two pieces of legislation - on customs and trade - and there have been several attempts to change them by both pro-Brexit and pro-EU MPs. The latest key vote was on customs, with a debate sparked by Tory MP Stephen Hammond's amendment to the Trade Bill. It stated that if a free trade area had not been negotiated by 21 January, ministers must change tack and start discussions on joining a customs union. Labour backs the idea of a customs union with the EU after Brexit - but the government says this would mean the UK is unable to strike its own international trade deals. During the debate on the Trade Bill, a minister tried to persuade Mr Hammond and his supporters to back down, promising to deal with the ""essence"" of their concerns when the bill goes to the House of Lords. Although this was rejected by Mr Hammond, the government won the vote and the bill was later approved by the House of Commons. The 12 MPs that voted against the government on customs and trade were: Heidi Allan, Guto Bebb, Ken Clarke, Jonathan Djanogly, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Hammond, Philip Lee, Nicky Morgan, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. On the other side, four Labour MPs voted with the government: Frank Field, Kate Hoey, John Mann, and Graham Stringer. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable and his predecessor Tim Farron - who were criticised after missing Monday night's knife-edge Brexit votes - were back at Westminster and voted against the government. But a former Lib Dem minister, Jo Swinson, complained that Tory MP Brandon Lewis participated in the votes despite having agreed to abstain. Ms Swinson, a Remain supporter who has recently given birth and was unable to vote,tweeted,externalMr Lewis did not keep to their arrangement to balance out her effective abstention - known as ""pairing"" - and accused the government of ""desperate stuff"". They didn't escape defeat for long. Having squeaked through last night the government was beaten for only the second time ever in the Commons on key Brexit legislation. And guess what, it was on a vote they didn't expect to lose - Dr Phillip Lee, who quit the government to speak out on Brexit, put forward his own amendment to protect the links between the UK and the European Medicines Agency to ensure the smooth flow of medicines and new drugs for British patients after Brexit.

Read Laura's blog The vote on medicine regulation was only the government's second defeat on Brexit in the House of Commons. MPs voted for the UK to take ""all necessary steps"" to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency after it leaves the EU. The agency, which evaluates and supervises medicines and helps national authorities authorise the sale of drugs across the EU, is currently based in London but is moving to Amsterdam after Brexit. There have been warnings that Brexit may cause delays in UK patients getting new drugs. The government says it is ""seeking participation"" in the agency after Brexit and would make an ""appropriate financial contribution"" in return. But it has not agreed to take ""all necessary steps"" to secure this. Responding to the defeat, the government said: ""We will now reflect on this amendment and seek to revisit in the Lords.""

"Tom Hubbard suffered life-changing injuries after being struck by 25,000 volts The number of teenagers taking risks on railway tracks has jumped by 80% in the last five years, new figures suggest. Rail safety data shows the number of young risk-takers doubles during the summer compared with winter months. Network Rail say a record number of young people have lost their life on railway tracks this year. To combat a lack of knowledge about the dangers, the rail industry and the British Transport Police have launched a campaign called You vs Train. A short film re-enacts the incident in which Tom Hubbard suffered third degree burns The campaign highlights the story of Tom Hubbard, who suffered life changing injuries after being struck by 25,000 volts of electricity when he came into contact with the overhead wires which power some trains.

"""Uneven pitches, bad drainage and huge puddles all over the place"" Only one in three pitches at grassroots level is of adequate quality, says the Football Association. The figure is part of the FA's written evidence for a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) parliamentary hearing on Wednesday about the possible sale of Wembley Stadium. The FA says it is ""considering a sale because it represents a transformative opportunity"" to change ""the poor state of community football facilities"". The DCMS hearing starts at 14:00 BST. The FA has received an offer of Â£600m for the national stadium from Fulham owner Shahid Khan - the governing body would retain Club Wembley rights which it values at Â£250m-Â£300m. Among those taking part in the DCMS hearing are Sports Minister Tracey Crouch and FA chief executive Martin Glenn. Sport England chair Nick Bitel, former England and Manchester United defender Gary Neville and Katrina Law, co-chair of the Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust, will also answer questions. There are 21,000 grassroots clubs, 50 county FAs, 25,000 schools and 330 local authorities which are catered for by the FA and, along with the finding that only one in three grassroots pitches are of adequate quality, the FA's written evidence also highlights: 150,000 matches were called off last season due to poor facilities One in six matches are called off due to poor pitch quality 33 of 50 county FAs are without their own 3G pitch Cancelled matches account for the equivalent of 5,000,000 playing opportunities lost this year because of poor facilities There are half the number of 3G pitches in England than there are in Germany ""The word for grassroots football is 'crisis,'"" said Kenny Saunders, who runs pressure group Save Grassroots Football. ""Government cuts to local councils are having a massive impact. ""Councils can't maintain pitches and more of them are selling them off. ""I would welcome the sale of Wembley if the money is ring-fenced for grassroots football and used wisely. We need to build from the bottom."" Since 2000, the FA says it has invested around Â£615m in grassroots football along with the Premier League, Sport England and the DCMS. The FA has put Â£127m back into every level of football during the 2017-18 season and this will rise to Â£180m from the 2018-19 campaign onwards. ""In 2017, investments included Â£13m in coaching and participation; Â£17m to the county FAs for the delivery of community football; Â£4m in disability, equality and child protection; Â£20m investment in community football facilities; Â£5m for women's football development (taking our total spend in women's football to Â£13m); Â£36m in FA competition prize funds; Â£18m of investments in other football organisations and Â£14m of various other investments,"" said the FA. The FA is set to increase the money it puts back into football from Â£127m (year ending July 2017) to Â£180m a year from the 2018-19 season The FA has said it would continue with its current strategic plans for grassroots football whether the stadium is sold or not. But it has said the sale would increase the pace of change: ""A sale would give the FA a further opportunity to significantly invest in community football facilities, in addition to what was announced on 9 January 2018 (an increase from Â£22m to Â£31m per annum), and as a result transform community football facilities across England. ""From the Â£600m gross sale proceeds, the FA and its partners would significantly accelerate its investment into community football facilities to more than Â£100m per year for the next 20 years. This would be transformative."" The FA has said extra money could implement the national football facilities strategy - developed by Sport England, the FA, the government and the Football Foundation - within 10 years, its aims include: Every FA-affiliated club to have access to a 3G artificial pitch for training and potentially matches Accelerated improvements to the key grass pitch sites across England to reduce fixture cancellations Talented players to benefit from more advanced training and competition Increased numbers of players, coaches, referees, volunteers and administrators A diverse football-based community that reflects the diversity of the nation Also, while any investment would be primarily for football, other sports stand to benefit from improved facilities. The FA spent Â£97m buying the land on which to build Wembley and the total cost of construction came to Â£695m. According to the FA's latest financial results, it still owes Â£107.5m to public bodies such as Sport England, the DCMS, plus the Greater London Authority (GLA), which helped pay to build the stadium that opened in 2007. The remaining debt would be paid off by the end of 2024, although the FA has said it would ""ring fence"" the money generated from selling Wembley solely for investment in ""community football"". ""The public sector funders who provided funds for the stadium originally, would see their funding returned in full and the FA is discussing with them how their funds could then be reinvested into community facilities for football,"" said the FA. In terms of the remaining debt ""this repayment schedule will not change as a result of whether the stadium is sold or not"" and ""it is not proposed that any funds from any prospective sale would be used to pay off this debt"". However, Supporters Direct, an organisation set up in 2000 to assist fan ownership and involvement in clubs, said: ""In the absence of greater clarity about the terms of any proposed transaction, it is not yet possible to fully assess the indirect financial consequences and the impact on the FA's future revenue streams to make a final judgement on a proposed sale."" If the sale is allowed to proceed, the FA has said it will ""open sale process to seek additional offers for the stadium"" in addition to the one from Shahid Khan. The FA's negotiating position when it comes to England games if Wembley is sold is that the stadium should host all key showpiece matches. In such a scenario, it would ""pay a pre-agreed hire fee for the use of the stadium on an event-by-event basis"". It would aim to protect events held at the venue including: England men's and women's internationals FA Cup semi-finals and final FA Vase and Trophy finals Community Shield Women's FA Cup final EFL play-off finals EFL Cup final EFL Trophy final National League play-off final Rugby League Challenge Cup final Any sale would need the consent of the stadium's public sector funders and formal approval from the Secretary of State for the DCMS. ""Ultimately, if we decide to proceed, we would envisage a full and open sale process is run to ensure value is maximised,"" said the FA.

"The cladding used on Grenfell Tower in west London meant the fire spread quickly The government's proposed ban on using combustible materialsfor new high-rise buildings does not go far enough, the Commons housing committee have said. The MPs' report says any ban should include existing buildings and those under construction. Current proposals only affect new buildings over 18m. The committee also says the wider use of sprinklers would save lives. The government said its plans for ""fundamental reform"" of regulations would keep people safe in their homes. The MPs' report comes a year after72 people died in the Grenfell Tower fire, in west London on 14 June 2017. Cladding panels used on on the tower block burnt quickly and spread the fire, leading the government to suggest a ban on combustible materials being used on planned buildings over 18m high. 'Catastrophic' Grenfell failures outlined What happened at Grenfell Tower? Listen: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair The committee said it was ""disappointing"" a review of building regulations -led earlier in the year by Dame Judith Hackitt- had not recommended a ban on materials that catch fire. In addition to extending the ban to more buildings, including high-risk properties such as hospitals, the committee said the government should pay for dangerous cladding to be removed. Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: ""The evidence from real fires in real tower blocks shows that using combustible materials on the external walls of high-rise buildings kills people. ""We continue to strongly urge the government to ban the use of any combustible materials - including cladding panels, insulation and other materials - on the external walls of high-rise and high-risk buildings."" Friends and relatives of Grenfell Tower fire victims at a church service mark the one year anniversary of the disaster The Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee chairman, Clive Betts, said a year on from ""the catastrophic events at Grenfell Tower"" the industry was ""still no closer to having a system that inspires confidence that residents can be safe and secure in their homes."" He said there was a need for both ""a fundamental change of culture"" in the industry but also measures that ""should be introduced now"".

"The cladding used on Grenfell Tower in west London meant the fire spread quickly The government's proposed ban on using combustible materialsfor new high-rise buildings does not go far enough, the Commons housing committee have said. The MPs' report says any ban should include existing buildings and those under construction. Current proposals only affect new buildings over 18m. The committee also says the wider use of sprinklers would save lives. The government said its plans for ""fundamental reform"" of regulations would keep people safe in their homes. The MPs' report comes a year after72 people died in the Grenfell Tower fire, in west London on 14 June 2017. Cladding panels used on on the tower block burnt quickly and spread the fire, leading the government to suggest a ban on combustible materials being used on planned buildings over 18m high. 'Catastrophic' Grenfell failures outlined What happened at Grenfell Tower? Listen: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair The committee said it was ""disappointing"" a review of building regulations -led earlier in the year by Dame Judith Hackitt- had not recommended a ban on materials that catch fire. In addition to extending the ban to more buildings, including high-risk properties such as hospitals, the committee said the government should pay for dangerous cladding to be removed. Lord Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said: ""The evidence from real fires in real tower blocks shows that using combustible materials on the external walls of high-rise buildings kills people. ""We continue to strongly urge the government to ban the use of any combustible materials - including cladding panels, insulation and other materials - on the external walls of high-rise and high-risk buildings."" Friends and relatives of Grenfell Tower fire victims at a church service mark the one year anniversary of the disaster The Housing, Communities and Local Government Select Committee chairman, Clive Betts, said a year on from ""the catastrophic events at Grenfell Tower"" the industry was ""still no closer to having a system that inspires confidence that residents can be safe and secure in their homes."" He said there was a need for both ""a fundamental change of culture"" in the industry but also measures that ""should be introduced now"". The MPs have urged the government to improve the building safety rules that govern the construction industry.

"The government won the vote by 307 to 301 The government has survived an attempt by pro-EU Conservative MPs to change its post-Brexit trade strategy. The MPs wanted the UK to join a customs union if it does not agree a free-trade deal with the EU. But the government, which says a customs union would stop it striking new trade deals, won by 307 to 301. Ahead of the vote, Tory MPs were told a defeat would lead to a vote of no confidence in the government, sources told the BBC's John Pienaar. The government did, however, lose a separate vote on its Trade Bill on the regulation of medicines after Brexit. MPs backed an amendment by 305 votes to 301 that would keep the UK in the European medicines regulatory network. There were 12 Tory rebels in both the customs and medicines votes - but the government's total was boosted by four Labour MPs in the customs vote. At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options Brexit: All you need to know Plan 'delivers the Brexit UK voted for' Maternity leave MP accuses Tories over vote The customs union allows for tariff-free trading between members with a common tariff set for imports from the rest of the world. Please upgrade your browser The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019 but the two sides have yet to agree how their final trading relationship will work. The Commons has been debating two pieces of legislation - on customs and trade - and there have been several attempts to change them by both pro-Brexit and pro-EU MPs. The latest key vote was on customs, with a debate sparked by Tory MP Stephen Hammond's amendment to the Trade Bill. It stated that if a free trade area had not been negotiated by 21 January, ministers must change tack and start discussions on joining a customs union. Labour backs the idea of a customs union with the EU after Brexit - but the government says this would mean the UK is unable to strike its own international trade deals. During the debate on the Trade Bill, a minister tried to persuade Mr Hammond and his supporters to back down, promising to deal with the ""essence"" of their concerns when the bill goes to the House of Lords. Although this was rejected by Mr Hammond, the government won the vote and the bill was later approved by the House of Commons. The 12 MPs that voted against the government on customs and trade were: Heidi Allan, Guto Bebb, Ken Clarke, Jonathan Djanogly, Dominic Grieve, Stephen Hammond, Philip Lee, Nicky Morgan, Bob Neill, Antoinette Sandbach, Anna Soubry and Sarah Wollaston. On the other side, four Labour MPs voted with the government: Frank Field, Kate Hoey, John Mann, and Graham Stringer. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable and his predecessor Tim Farron - who were criticised after missing Monday night's knife-edge Brexit votes - were back at Westminster and voted against the government. But a former Lib Dem minister, Jo Swinson, complained that Tory MP Brandon Lewis participated in the votes despite having agreed to abstain. Ms Swinson, a Remain supporter who has recently given birth and was unable to vote,tweeted,externalMr Lewis did not keep to their arrangement to balance out her effective abstention - known as ""pairing"" - and accused the government of ""desperate stuff"". They didn't escape defeat for long. Having squeaked through last night the government was beaten for only the second time ever in the Commons on key Brexit legislation. And guess what, it was on a vote they didn't expect to lose - Dr Phillip Lee, who quit the government to speak out on Brexit, put forward his own amendment to protect the links between the UK and the European Medicines Agency to ensure the smooth flow of medicines and new drugs for British patients after Brexit. And he had enough to support to win it, just. An embarrassment for the government certainly. It is another reminder of how difficult it is for Theresa May to get her way in the House of Commons where she doesn't have her own majority. It is serious. A defeat is a problem. But it wasn't a complete disaster tonight for two reasons. First, the amendment isn't a million miles away from the government's own policy. While not straightforward, the vote hasn't forced a screeching U-turn. The more important reason is that the vote that followed, on keeping the UK in a customs union, went the other way. Read Laura's blog The vote on medicine regulation was only the government's second defeat on Brexit in the House of Commons. MPs voted for the UK to take ""all necessary steps"" to participate in the regulatory network operated by the European Medicines Agency after it leaves the EU. The agency, which evaluates and supervises medicines and helps national authorities authorise the sale of drugs across the EU, is currently based in London but is moving to Amsterdam after Brexit. There have been warnings that Brexit may cause delays in UK patients getting new drugs. The government says it is ""seeking participation"" in the agency after Brexit and would make an ""appropriate financial contribution"" in return. But it has not agreed to take ""all necessary steps"" to secure this. Responding to the defeat, the government said: ""We will now reflect on this amendment and seek to revisit in the Lords.""
