Thanks for reading!  The oldest gay bar in San Francisco will close down permanently after 55 years due to a lack of revenue during the pandemic. The Stud,external, which has been around since 1966, will host a ""drag funeral"" for the bar on 31 May, according to owner Honey Mahogany. In mid-March, San Francisco became one of the first US cities to order residents to ""shelter in place"" to control the spread of the pandemic. As the summer holiday period approaches, many of us in the UK might be wondering when we can enjoy a getaway - at home or abroad. At the moment,the chances of going on a foreign holiday look unlikely.That's because Brits are being advised not to take any non-essential travel abroad, and various countries have restrictions which stop or limit foreign visitors. The UK is expected to introducea 14-day quarantine periodin early June for visitors and UK residents returning home from abroad, making things more complicated. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has suggested that""air bridges"" could be introduced, meaning travellers from countries with low infection rates could be exempt from quarantine. But this remains uncertain. As for a domestic getaway, people in England are free to drive any distance to other destinations in England, like parks and beaches, but they are not supposed to stay overnight away from home (including in any second property they own). Self-catering cottages, Airbnb properties, and UK campsites, hotels and holiday parks will remain shut until at least the beginning of July. This video can not be played The latest figures from Johns Hopkins University show that 1.9 million people have recovered from the virus, but the time it takes to recover can vary. Most people with Covid-19 will only develop mild symptoms, which usually take a week to recover from, maybe longer. But in more serious cases, it could take months, or even more than a year, to get fully better. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains recovery times and what you can do to help others. A member of the UK governmentâs scientific advisory group, known as SAGE, has told the BBC he would have liked the government to have acted earlier in the fight against coronavirus. Sir Ian Boyd, a professor of biology at St Andrews University, toldthe Coronavirus Newscast: âI would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate."" He suggested that the government based its initial assessment on the transmissibility of the SARS virus, which is less infectious than this coronavirus. He described the UK and other European countries as âa bit slower off the markâ and less prepared than countries that had experienced SARS in the early 2000s. ""I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasnât feasible because people wouldnât have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did,"" he said. Professor Boyd, who was the chief scientific adviser at the environment department from 2012-19, also called on ministers to stop saying they were âledâ by the science as it was ""slightly misleading"". The couple's daughter superimposed her parents on to various locations on their holiday itinerary British couple Ed and Barbara Higgins, from Norfolk, England, had been due to fly to New York to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary - and sail back on a luxury cruise ship. But the pandemic put a stop to their plans, like those of many others. Their family though did not want them to miss out so, as theEDP reports,external, they sent an itinerary, online tours, special dinners and mocked-up photos. The couple saidtheir virtual triphad ""brought tears of joy to our eyes"". Barbara and Ed Higgins should have been on the cruise ship in person Lucy WilliamsonBBC's Paris Correspondent A teacher in Nantes, west France, and her pupils wear masks after their school reopened The French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has told the BBC that poorer children are not returning to school as much as those from wealthier families. He said that reopening schools was a âsocial emergencyâ, and that the lockdown had increased inequality in France.  But so far, only 20% of primary school pupils have returned. ""Itâs true that children of poor families are coming less than the others,â Mr Blanquer said. âThatâs why it was important to start in May not in June, because we know that itâs [a] step-by-step [process].â Last week, France reopened 40,000 primary and nursery schools, and pupils returned to some middle schools on Monday. Itâs a voluntary process so far â a decision criticised by one mayor, who said it made things difficult for parents: âIf they send [their children] to school and they get sick, theyâll feel guilty; if they keep them home and they fall behind, theyâll feel guilty. If you govern, you need to take the decision.â The education ministry has issued 56 pages of detailed instructions to schools on how to keep premises clean and pupils safe, in the hope of building trust with parents. There must be no more than 15 children in a class, no shared toys, and arrivals at the school must be timed. Older children must also wear masks. There is so much thatâs compulsory for schools, some say, while the attendance is not.

The season begins in June and international charter flights to popular locations will resume in July, according to the country's prime minster. Greece has been praised for its handling of the pandemic. It has recorded 166 deaths and 2,850 confirmed cases. But how easy will it be for tourists to enter Greece for their holidays? The BBC's Quentin Sommervillearrived in Athens airportto see how things are working at the moment. More on that new data which emerged at today's Downing Street briefing suggesting about one in six Londoners and one in 20 people elsewhere in England have had coronavirus. How did those figures come about? Public Health England says it is carrying out a range of seroprevalence studies - where they measure antibodies in the blood of healthy people - to better understand past rates of infection across the population. In this case, they took 1,000 samples between mid-April and early May from each region. From this, they say they could make a crude estimate that between 4.5% and 13% of the population have coronavirus antibodies. With further statistical adjustments, they found about 17% of London adults had been infected; this compares to only 4.3% in the north-east of England. As antibodies can take up to four weeks to develop, it is likely that the level outside London will increase as more samples are tested in the coming weeks. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: âEarly surveillance suggests that rates of infection were higher in London than the rest of the country â which is consistent with data collected through our other systems. ""London was affected earlier and our data suggests that more of the London population became infected before the lockdown took effect."" ""I think I look better in the mask,"" Trump said. President Trump is touring a US auto plant that has been converted to make ventilators to fight Covid-19. Speaking to reporters, he held up a mask and said he wore one during his tour, but is now standing in an area where is it not required. Earlier this week, a Ford company spokesperson said he would be required to do so, but he has so far never been pictured wearing one. ""I wore one in this back area but I didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,"" said Trump, adding that he wore goggles as well. ""I was tested this morning, so it's not necessary,"" he continued. Asked why the car executives accompanying him are still wearing theirs, he said: ""That's their choice."" The pool reporter travelling with Trump asked the Ford executive if he can confirm that Trump was told he did not require a mask in that part of the factory. The executive shrugged and said, ""It's up to him"".

Wilson Roosevelt Jerman joined under President Eisenhower in 1957 and was a cleaner when First Lady Jackie Kennedy approached him and promoted him to butler. Years later a photo of him appeared in Michelle Obama's memoir Becoming after he had risen to the rank of maÃ®tre d'. His more than five decades of service have been studied by historians of African-Americans in politics. Like other African-American men of his generation, says Ohio State Universityâs Koritha Mitchell, author of From Slave Cabins to the White House, he showed dignity while serving in one of the few positions that was available to him at the time. She believes that he must have found it satisfying to end his career in the way that he did. He was working for Obama, âa dignified president who was also African Americanâ, she says, adding: âThat must have felt like a victory.â Read more A British woman who was stranded in Australia after falling ill has been reunited with her family after three long months.

He is one of the most feared men in Russia, says our Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg. The authoritarian leader of Russia's Chechnya region previously fought against Moscow as a Chechen nationalist but is now a key ally of President Vladimir Putin. He is the latest latest high-profile Russian official to show symptoms of the virus. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin only returned to work in the last few days after being treated in hospital for Covid-19. Russia has the second largest number of infections worldwide. Earlier, at the UK government's daily briefing, we heard news of a study which suggests that 17% of people in London and around 5% of the rest of the nation have virus antibodies. The new data comes as the government agreed a deal with a large pharmaceutical firm for more than 10 million antibody tests, to see if people have had the virus. The first in line for them will be health and social care staff, patients and care home residents. It's still unclear what level of immunity people develop once they have had it, but some experts hope a degree of immunity would last a year or two. However, there is no guarantee that having antibodies means a person will not pass the virus on to somebody else. At the briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said certificates were being looked at for people who test positive for coronavirus antibodies. ""It's not just about the clinical advances that these tests can bring,"" he said. ""It's that knowing that you have these antibodies will help us to understand more in the future if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, of dying from coronavirus and of transmitting coronavirus."" A temperature screening trial began at Heathrow airport on Thursday Heathrow launched atemperature screening trial on Thursday,externalfor arrivals in Terminal 2, but the airport's chief executive John Holland-Kaye has called for a ""common international standard"" to screen passengers on departure rather than arrival. âEvery country going into this crisis came up with their own
policy for screening people. But as we come out â and we try to get people
flying again â we need some consistency,"" he told the BBC. ""Weâre calling on the UK government to
work with other governments like the US and EU to establish a common
international standard, so when youâre travelling youâre confident youâll be
accepted into the country youâre going to, and will be kept safe on your
journey. ""And I think itâs important that the screen takes place at the
airport on departure, rather than at your destination, because you donât want to

your destination.â Russia's emergencies ministry sent disinfection equipment to crisis-hit Dagestan Exams for Russia's final-year secondary school students will go ahead in June, President Vladimir Putin has announced. Students will be given masks, gloves and other protective equipment in the exam rooms. The exams were originally supposed to take place on 25 May but the education ministry postponed them. Now, citing a ""decrease in coronavirus cases"", Putin told officials the exams would happen on 29 June. Russia has more than 317,000 cases of coronavirus, the second-highest number in the world.Dagestan, in southern Russia, is said to be experiencing a ""catastrophe"".

"A number of pro-democracy lawmakers were dragged out of Hong Kong's legislative chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill China's ruling Communist Party has set in motion a controversial national security law for Hong Kong, a move seen as a major blow to the city's freedoms. The law to ban ""secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" could bypass Hong Kong's lawmakers. Critics say Beijing is breaking its promise to allow Hong Kong freedoms not seen elsewhere in China. Pro-democracy activists have called for mass protests against what they see erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. Anger was already apparent on Friday, as a group of protesters descended on China's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. The draft law was submitted at the annual National People's Congress (NPC), which largely rubber-stamps decisions already taken by the Communist leadership, but is still the most important political event of the year. Hong Kong, a semi-autonomous region and an economic powerhouse, was required to introduce security legislation after the handover from British control to Chinese rule in 1997. After last year's wave of sustained and violent protest, Beijing is now attempting to push them through, arguing ""law-based and forceful measures"" must be taken to ""prevent, stop and punish"" such protests in the future. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? How bad are China's economic woes? China's Congress: Hong Kong, virus and money woes China scraps annual growth target for first time On Friday, Hong Kong's government said it would co-operate with Beijing to enact the law, adding it would not affect the city's freedoms. The law has rattled financial markets, causing Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (HSI) to drop by more than 5% on Friday. The ""draft decision"" - as it is known before approval by the NPC - was explained by Wang Chen, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee of the NPC. It consists of an introduction and seven articles. Article 4 may prove the most controversial. How is Hong Kong run? Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions That article says Hong Kong ""must improve"" national security, before adding: ""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies in Hong Kong to fulfil relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law."" A group of pro-democracy activists marched on the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong on Friday Addressing the congress, Premier Li Keqiang said: ""We'll establish sound legal systems and enforcement mechanisms for safeguarding national security in the two Special Administrative Regions."" Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam, who is seen as part of the pro-Beijing political establishment, said the law would help authorities tackle illegal activity in the city. Robin Brant, BBC China Correspondent China has long desired a new national security law for Hong Kong. Beijing believes almost a year of mass protests and, at times, paralysing confrontations on the streets shows that now it is needed more than ever. But critics point to what they say are ambiguities inherent in such a law and the broad, generalist framework it would bring to a place which has a very different legal tradition than the communist-controlled mainland. ""Secession, subversion, foreign interference and terrorism"" are open to some interpretation. Up to now, the worst charge most arrested protesters have faced has been for rioting. The notion of ""terrorism"" also features in this proposed law. That too could encompass wide-ranging acts and activities that the authoritarian rulers on the mainland consider far more menacing than those in Hong Kong, or for that matter elsewhere. China could essentially place the draft law intoAnnex III of the Basic Law,external, which covers national laws that must be implemented in Hong Kong - either by legislation, or decree. The NPC is expected to vote on the draft law at the end of its annual session, on 28 May. It will then be forwarded to the NPC's Standing Committee, China's top legislature, which is expected to finalise and enact the law by the end of June. Hong Kong is what is known as a ""special administrative region"" of China. It has observed a ""one country, two systems"" policy since Britain returned sovereignty in 1997, which has allowed it certain freedoms the rest of China does not have. Pro-democracy activists fear that China pushing through the law could mean ""the end of Hong Kong"" - that is, the effective end of its autonomy and these freedoms. ""This is the largest nuclear weapon the Chinese Communist Party has used in its mutual destruction of Hong Kong,"" Jimmy Sham, a pro-democracy activist who played a leading role in last year's protests. Last year's mass protests in Hong Kong were sparked by a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China. This video can not be played Former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten: ""UK should tell China this is outrageous"" The bill was paused, then withdrawn - but the protests continued until the coronavirus outbreak at the end of the year. The US has also weighed in, with President Trump saying the US would react strongly if it went through - without giving details. It is currently considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. The UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office said it was ""following reports and monitoring the situation closely"". ""We expect China to respect Hong Kong's rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy. As a party to the [Sino-British] Joint Declaration, the UK is committed to upholding Hong Kong's autonomy and respecting the 'One Country, Two Systems' model,"" a statement said. Mr Wang said the security risks had become ""increasingly notable"" - a reference to last year's protests. ""Considering Hong Kong's situation at present, efforts must be made at the state-level to establish and improve the legal system and enforcement mechanisms,"" he is quoted as saying in state media.

If last year's success for pro-democracy parties in district elections is repeated, government bills could potentially be blocked. In a separate development, a number of pro-democracy lawmakers were dragged out of Hong Kong's legislative chamber during a row about a Chinese national anthem bill on Friday. Hong Kong was under British control for more than 150 years up to 1997. The British and Chinese governments signed a treaty - the Sino-British Joint Declaration - that agreed Hong Kong would have ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"", for 50 years.

"Clashes in Hong Kong's legislature on Monday showed the continuing political unrest China is proposing to introduce a new security law in Hong Kong that could ban sedition, secession and subversion. The move is likely to provoke strong opposition internationally and in Hong Kong, which was last year rocked by months of pro-democracy protests. China's delayed National People's Congress, its legislature, will debate the issue when it opens on Friday. Chinese media said the move defended national security, but opponents said it could be the ""end of Hong Kong"". Demonstrators in Hong Kong have repeatedly protested against what they see as a gradual erosion of the territory's autonomy by the communist lead government in Beijing. The BBC's Robin Brant, in Shanghai, says that what makes the latest proposal so incendiary is that the Beijing government could bypass Hong Kong's elected officials and simply impose the changes. The last British governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, called the move a ""comprehensive assault on the city's autonomy"". President Donald Trump said the US would react strongly if China followed through with its proposals. What is the Basic Law and how does it work? Why are there protests in Hong Kong?

Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which provides the territory certain freedoms not available on the mainland, does require its government to bring in a security law. It had tried to enact the so-called ""sedition law"" in 2003 but more than 500,000 people took to the streets and it was dropped. A spokesman for the NPC said on Thursday that China was planning to improve on the ""one country, two systems"" policy that Hong Kong has observed.

(2015 video) A group of 15 prominent pro-democracy activists also appeared in court on Monday charged with organising and taking part in unlawful assemblies related to last year's protests. Five also face the more serious charge of incitement. Millions took to the streets for seven months last year in rallies that began peacefully but later spiralled into violent clashes. Those protests were initially about another controversial bill allowing extraditions to the mainland. It was later dropped. China's move also comes as the US is considering whether to extend Hong Kong's preferential trading and investment privileges. It must decide by the end of the month. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday expressed concern over Hong Kong's autonomy. Hong Kong was ruled by Britain as a colony for more than 150 years up to 1997. The Basic Law, which runs out in 2047, gives Hong Kong ""a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs"". As a result, Hong Kong's own legal system, borders, and rights - including freedom of assembly and free speech - are protected. For example, it is one of the few places in Chinese territory where people can commemorate the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown. But Beijing has the ability to veto any changes to the political system and has, for example, ruled out direct election of the chief executive.

"The treaty permits unarmed surveillance flights over 35 participating countries The US has announced it will withdraw from a major accord that permits unarmed aerial surveillance flights over dozens of participating countries. The Open Skies Treaty came into force in 2002 and is designed to boost confidence and assure against attacks. But senior US officials said the country was withdrawing due to repeated Russian violations of its terms. US President Donald Trump later said there was a ""very good chance we'll reach a new agreement"" with Russia. ""I think we have a very good relationship with Russia, but Russia didn't adhere to the treaty,"" Mr Trump said on Thursday, adding: ""Until they adhere we will pull out."" The US will formally withdraw from the accord in six months, officials said. ""During the course of this review it has become abundantly clear that it is no longer in America's interests to remain a party to the Open Skies Treaty,"" one official told Reuters news agency. Some 35 nations are party to the treaty, including Russia, Canada and the UK. Russia's Foreign Ministry insisted that it had not violated the treaty and that a US withdrawal would be ""very regrettable"", adding that the Trump administration was working to ""derail all agreements on arms control"". ""We reject any attempts to justify a way out of this fundamental agreement,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko told Russia's state-owned RIA Novosti news agency. ""Nothing prevents continuing the discussions over the technical issues, which the US is misrepresenting as violations by Russia,"" he added. He said that any withdrawal would affect the interests of all of the treaty's participants, who are also members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato). In abandoning the Open Skies Treaty, the Trump Administration is not just renouncing an arms control agreement that was seen as essential for transparency during the Cold War years, but he is also ditching an agreement that many experts believe still retains huge benefits for the US. The fact it comes at a time when the whole structure of arms control is collapsing and a new era of great power competition beckons is doubly troubling. The Open Skies Treaty came into force in January 2002 and some 34 countries have ratified the agreement. It allows for unarmed short-notice reconnaissance flights by specially equipped aircraft, over the entire territory of another country to collect data on troop deployments, military facilities and so on. There have been some problems in recent years and the US contends - with some justification -  that Russia has been preventing access to certain areas. But critics of the Trump administration's antipathy towards arms control say this is a reason for fixing the treaty, not abandoning it. Mr Trump seems to be holding out at least a chance that the US could stick with Open Skies, but that is clearly going to depend upon talks with Moscow. The Russian Foreign ministry says that a US withdrawal will affect the interests of all the participants. While the US can clearly use satellites for its intelligence gathering on Russia, Mr Trump's decision will cause tensions with Washington's European allies, few of whom have such satellite access. Earlier this year, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper accused Russia of violating the treaty by banning flights over the city of Kaliningrad and other areas near Georgia. ""I have a lot of concerns about the treaty as it stands now,"" he said at the time. ""This is important to many of our Nato allies, that they have the means to conduct the overflights."" US-Russia surveillance flights treaty under threat Trump to withdraw US from Arms Trade Treaty It marks the latest effort by President Donald Trump's administration to withdraw the US from a major global treaty. Last year,it pulled out of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF)with Russia.

Thanks for reading!  The oldest gay bar in San Francisco will close down permanently after 55 years due to a lack of revenue during the pandemic. The Stud,external, which has been around since 1966, will host a ""drag funeral"" for the bar on 31 May, according to owner Honey Mahogany. In mid-March, San Francisco became one of the first US cities to order residents to ""shelter in place"" to control the spread of the pandemic. As the summer holiday period approaches, many of us in the UK might be wondering when we can enjoy a getaway - at home or abroad. At the moment,the chances of going on a foreign holiday look unlikely.That's because Brits are being advised not to take any non-essential travel abroad, and various countries have restrictions which stop or limit foreign visitors. The UK is expected to introducea 14-day quarantine periodin early June for visitors and UK residents returning home from abroad, making things more complicated. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has suggested that""air bridges"" could be introduced, meaning travellers from countries with low infection rates could be exempt from quarantine. But this remains uncertain. As for a domestic getaway, people in England are free to drive any distance to other destinations in England, like parks and beaches, but they are not supposed to stay overnight away from home (including in any second property they own). Self-catering cottages, Airbnb properties, and UK campsites, hotels and holiday parks will remain shut until at least the beginning of July. This video can not be played The latest figures from Johns Hopkins University show that 1.9 million people have recovered from the virus, but the time it takes to recover can vary. Most people with Covid-19 will only develop mild symptoms, which usually take a week to recover from, maybe longer. But in more serious cases, it could take months, or even more than a year, to get fully better. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains recovery times and what you can do to help others. A member of the UK governmentâs scientific advisory group, known as SAGE, has told the BBC he would have liked the government to have acted earlier in the fight against coronavirus. Sir Ian Boyd, a professor of biology at St Andrews University, toldthe Coronavirus Newscast: âI would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate."" He suggested that the government based its initial assessment on the transmissibility of the SARS virus, which is less infectious than this coronavirus. He described the UK and other European countries as âa bit slower off the markâ and less prepared than countries that had experienced SARS in the early 2000s. ""I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasnât feasible because people wouldnât have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did,"" he said. Professor Boyd, who was the chief scientific adviser at the environment department from 2012-19, also called on ministers to stop saying they were âledâ by the science as it was ""slightly misleading"". The couple's daughter superimposed her parents on to various locations on their holiday itinerary British couple Ed and Barbara Higgins, from Norfolk, England, had been due to fly to New York to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary - and sail back on a luxury cruise ship. But the pandemic put a stop to their plans, like those of many others. Their family though did not want them to miss out so, as theEDP reports,external, they sent an itinerary, online tours, special dinners and mocked-up photos. The couple saidtheir virtual triphad ""brought tears of joy to our eyes"". Barbara and Ed Higgins should have been on the cruise ship in person Lucy WilliamsonBBC's Paris Correspondent A teacher in Nantes, west France, and her pupils wear masks after their school reopened The French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has told the BBC that poorer children are not returning to school as much as those from wealthier families. He said that reopening schools was a âsocial emergencyâ, and that the lockdown had increased inequality in France.  But so far, only 20% of primary school pupils have returned. ""Itâs true that children of poor families are coming less than the others,â Mr Blanquer said. âThatâs why it was important to start in May not in June, because we know that itâs [a] step-by-step [process].â Last week, France reopened 40,000 primary and nursery schools, and pupils returned to some middle schools on Monday. Itâs a voluntary process so far â a decision criticised by one mayor, who said it made things difficult for parents: âIf they send [their children] to school and they get sick, theyâll feel guilty; if they keep them home and they fall behind, theyâll feel guilty. If you govern, you need to take the decision.â The education ministry has issued 56 pages of detailed instructions to schools on how to keep premises clean and pupils safe, in the hope of building trust with parents. There must be no more than 15 children in a class, no shared toys, and arrivals at the school must be timed. Older children must also wear masks. There is so much thatâs compulsory for schools, some say, while the attendance is not.

The season begins in June and international charter flights to popular locations will resume in July, according to the country's prime minster. Greece has been praised for its handling of the pandemic. It has recorded 166 deaths and 2,850 confirmed cases. But how easy will it be for tourists to enter Greece for their holidays? The BBC's Quentin Sommervillearrived in Athens airportto see how things are working at the moment. More on that new data which emerged at today's Downing Street briefing suggesting about one in six Londoners and one in 20 people elsewhere in England have had coronavirus. How did those figures come about? Public Health England says it is carrying out a range of seroprevalence studies - where they measure antibodies in the blood of healthy people - to better understand past rates of infection across the population. In this case, they took 1,000 samples between mid-April and early May from each region. From this, they say they could make a crude estimate that between 4.5% and 13% of the population have coronavirus antibodies. With further statistical adjustments, they found about 17% of London adults had been infected; this compares to only 4.3% in the north-east of England. As antibodies can take up to four weeks to develop, it is likely that the level outside London will increase as more samples are tested in the coming weeks. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: âEarly surveillance suggests that rates of infection were higher in London than the rest of the country â which is consistent with data collected through our other systems. ""London was affected earlier and our data suggests that more of the London population became infected before the lockdown took effect."" ""I think I look better in the mask,"" Trump said. President Trump is touring a US auto plant that has been converted to make ventilators to fight Covid-19. Speaking to reporters, he held up a mask and said he wore one during his tour, but is now standing in an area where is it not required. Earlier this week, a Ford company spokesperson said he would be required to do so, but he has so far never been pictured wearing one. ""I wore one in this back area but I didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,"" said Trump, adding that he wore goggles as well. ""I was tested this morning, so it's not necessary,"" he continued. Asked why the car executives accompanying him are still wearing theirs, he said: ""That's their choice."" The pool reporter travelling with Trump asked the Ford executive if he can confirm that Trump was told he did not require a mask in that part of the factory. The executive shrugged and said, ""It's up to him"". Clive ColemanBBC legal correspondent In the UK, domestic violence referrals to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) during the coronavirus pandemic have increased by 3%. Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill QC told the Justice Committee the increase thus far was ""relatively small"". Domestic violence represents 13.6% of CPS work.

Wilson Roosevelt Jerman joined under President Eisenhower in 1957 and was a cleaner when First Lady Jackie Kennedy approached him and promoted him to butler. Years later a photo of him appeared in Michelle Obama's memoir Becoming after he had risen to the rank of maÃ®tre d'. His more than five decades of service have been studied by historians of African-Americans in politics. Like other African-American men of his generation, says Ohio State Universityâs Koritha Mitchell, author of From Slave Cabins to the White House, he showed dignity while serving in one of the few positions that was available to him at the time. She believes that he must have found it satisfying to end his career in the way that he did. He was working for Obama, âa dignified president who was also African Americanâ, she says, adding: âThat must have felt like a victory.â Read more A British woman who was stranded in Australia after falling ill has been reunited with her family after three long months.

He is one of the most feared men in Russia, says our Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg. The authoritarian leader of Russia's Chechnya region previously fought against Moscow as a Chechen nationalist but is now a key ally of President Vladimir Putin. He is the latest latest high-profile Russian official to show symptoms of the virus. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin only returned to work in the last few days after being treated in hospital for Covid-19. Russia has the second largest number of infections worldwide. Earlier, at the UK government's daily briefing, we heard news of a study which suggests that 17% of people in London and around 5% of the rest of the nation have virus antibodies. The new data comes as the government agreed a deal with a large pharmaceutical firm for more than 10 million antibody tests, to see if people have had the virus. The first in line for them will be health and social care staff, patients and care home residents. It's still unclear what level of immunity people develop once they have had it, but some experts hope a degree of immunity would last a year or two. However, there is no guarantee that having antibodies means a person will not pass the virus on to somebody else. At the briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said certificates were being looked at for people who test positive for coronavirus antibodies. ""It's not just about the clinical advances that these tests can bring,"" he said. ""It's that knowing that you have these antibodies will help us to understand more in the future if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, of dying from coronavirus and of transmitting coronavirus."" A temperature screening trial began at Heathrow airport on Thursday Heathrow launched atemperature screening trial on Thursday,externalfor arrivals in Terminal 2, but the airport's chief executive John Holland-Kaye has called for a ""common international standard"" to screen passengers on departure rather than arrival. âEvery country going into this crisis came up with their own
policy for screening people. But as we come out â and we try to get people
flying again â we need some consistency,"" he told the BBC. ""Weâre calling on the UK government to
work with other governments like the US and EU to establish a common
international standard, so when youâre travelling youâre confident youâll be
accepted into the country youâre going to, and will be kept safe on your
journey. ""And I think itâs important that the screen takes place at the
airport on departure, rather than at your destination, because you donât want to
run the gauntlet of not knowing if youâll be quarantined or turned around at
your destination.â Russia's emergencies ministry sent disinfection equipment to crisis-hit Dagestan Exams for Russia's final-year secondary school students will go ahead in June, President Vladimir Putin has announced. Students will be given masks, gloves and other protective equipment in the exam rooms. The exams were originally supposed to take place on 25 May but the education ministry postponed them. Now, citing a ""decrease in coronavirus cases"", Putin told officials the exams would happen on 29 June. Russia has more than 317,000 cases of coronavirus, the second-highest number in the world.Dagestan, in southern Russia, is said to be experiencing a ""catastrophe"".

"Nicola Sturgeon has unveiled details of a four-phase ""route map"" towards easing the country's lockdown restrictions The first begins after 28 May and there will be a review every three weeks The R number is below one and has been so for three weeks, allowing a slow lifting of lockdown The first phase of lifting lockdown will allow different households to see each other in ""small groups"" and only in ""outdoor spaces"" The fourth phase could see ""mass gatherings resuming in line with public health advice"" and all types of ""shopping, eating out and drinking"" allowed Children in Scotland will go back to the classroom from 11 August, but they will not be there every day The government says the approach will be a ""blended"" one in which pupils will be in school on certain days and at home on others BBC Scotland News Today we were given the first detailed indication of how Scotland may move out of lockdown:  The situation will be reviewed every three weeks and the government has cautioned it may take months or longer before we can move into Phase 4, when mass gatherings and normal school interaction will be possible. In other news, the Scottish Conservatives have called for the resignation of Health Secretary Jeane Freeman after it emerged that far more elderly people were released from hospital into care homes to clear beds, than she previously said. On Reporting Scotland Nicola Sturgeon rejected the call. We'll be back early tomorrow with more live updates of the latest developments. Don't forget the weekly Clap for Carers event. Reporting Scotland The Scottish Conservatives have demanded the resignation of Jeane Freeman after it emerged far more elderly people were discharged from hospitals without testing than was first revealed. In mid-April Ms Freeman said about 900 ""delayed discharge"" patients had left hospital, primarily to return to their own home. But the Scottish government now admits this was the figure released to care homes - and another 1,500 were released to their own homes. The Scottish Tory health spokesman Miles Briggs said the health secretary had lost the confidence of the public. But the first minister rejected the call, saying Ms Freeman has her ""absolute confidence"". ""I believe she should and does have the confidence of the public. She has been literally for three months working round the clock to make sure this crisis is managed in the best way possible,"" she told Reporting Scotland.  Reporting Scotland The first minister was asked for more detail on how the guidance on meeting other households would work, and how many households they could see - at a distance - outside. She asked people to ""use their judgement"" on who they meet after the rules are relaxed. She stressed that people should continue to stay near their homes to avoid places like beaches and beauty spots becoming overcrowded. But Ms Sturgeon said their would be more flexibility for people travelling further to see family - for instance ""to see your elderly mother"" in her garden. Reporting Scotland Appearing on Reporting Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon was asked why the lockdown could not be relaxed right away. She said that ""it's important we are really confident"" the virus is in decline. The first minister added that we also need to have the test, trace and isolate programme in place, which it will be from the start of next month. The trade body for Scotland's housebuilders has said that 6,000 households are ""stuck in limbo"", despite plans to ease restrictions on the construction industry as part of a phased return to work. Homes for Scotland chief executive Nicola Barclay was responding to the announcement by the Scottish government which referred to âplanning
for the construction sector to implement the first two phases in its restart
planâ. Ms Barclay said: ""The
biggest question still remains in relation to the 6,000 households currently
waiting to move into what are largely complete homes requiring only internal
finishing touches that can be easily and safely undertaken. ""There is
absolutely no mention of how or when they can be completed. ""With all these
customers still stuck in limbo, they have been given no indication today of
when they can move on with their lives and government
needs to urgently provide further clarity on this.""   The Scottish government has set out a four-phase plan for relaxing the lockdown restrictions and restarting the economy. Phase 1 could start in a week's time, on 28 May, if the R-number and new infections remain low. Here's a rough guide of how we'll come out of lockdown: Phase 1 - You should be able to meet another household outside in small numbers. Sunbathing is allowed, along with some outdoor activities like golf and fishing. Garden centres and drive-through takeaways can reopen, some outdoor work can resume, and childminding services can begin. Phase 2  -You can meet larger groups outdoors, and meet another household indoors. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories and small shops can resume work. Playgrounds and sports courts can reopen, and professional sport can begin again. Phase 3 -You can meet people from more than one household indoors. Non-essential offices would reopen, along with gyms, museums, libraries, cinemas, larger shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and dentists. Live events could take place with restricted numbers and physical distancing restrictions. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Phase 4- University and college campuses can reopen in full, mass gatherings are allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. For a more detailed rundown of how it will work,click here.  Reporting Scotland Coming up on Reporting Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon explains the thinking behind her plan to ease Scotland out of lockdown. Starts on BBC One Scotland shortly. Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Willie MacLeod of UK Hospitality warns of between 70,000 to 100,000 job losses in the sector by the end of the pandemic. If accommodation and hotels cannot open until the middle of July, this will be bad for tourism in Scotland he tells Drivetime. He says redundancies are already being made because businesses cannot sustain the level of cash burn they are taking at the moment.  He says hotels are ""burning"" an average Â£60,000 a month to stay afloat. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick explains for many farmers and crofters, the lockdown has not been as onerous as for other sectors due to the need to provide food. But he welcomes the reopening of recycling centres as fly tipping is especially common on agricultural land. The farming union is also working with the Scottish government on how it will go about recruiting staff for the picking season, with the option of cohorts who share accommodation and work spaces being considered. The
Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has welcomed the news that some businesses
could return to trading from next Thursday if they make adequate provisions to
protect workers and customers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has unveileda four-phase ""route map"" aimed at restarting societywhile suppressing the virus. The FSB is  calling on the Scottish government to  urgently provide clear, realistic
guidance to all businesses about the steps they should take before re-opening. Andrew
McRae, FSBâs Scotland policy chairman, said at the
moment thereâs little guidance for firms in Scotland regarding what alterations might be required. âWhile
the first minister said today that this guidance is coming in the days ahead,
there is no time to lose."" âWhile
we recognise that this is a public health crisis, it is also an economic
crisis."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney continued to answer listeners' questions on Drivetime: Q: Is it the teachers' responsibility to keep the children two metres apart? A:It is part of the whole approach of the school environment to make sure young people are exercising physical distancing. That is much more challenging among the youngest of pupils. Models are going to have to use outdoor space a great deal more or operate in smaller numbers. Q: How can someone work full-time if their child or children are at school part-time? A:Our society is going to have to adapt as a whole - not just the schools - to the presence of coronavirus. So the first minister in parliament today talked about the possibility of employers arranging shorter working weeks, perhaps four rather than five days. It might involve more home working. Q: Does this put the onus on parents and employers to reach arrangements that allow for schooling? A:We put this in our route map about working or running a business and some of the arrangements around remote working that we would want to be encouraging. The school system is not the only bit of society that has to adapt. NHS staff and care workers from overseas are to be exempt from paying a surcharge to use the health service after mounting pressure from MPs. Boris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had asked the Home Office and Department for Health to exempt NHS and care workers ""as soon as possible"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a victory for common decency"", while SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford welcomed what he called a ""U-turn on this cruel Tory policy"". The health immigration surcharge on non-EU migrants is Â£400 per year and set to rise to Â£624 in October. Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg whether the prime minister ""changed his mind"" when he decided to waive the NHS usage fees, Matt Hancock says Boris Johnson has himself ""been a beneficiary"" of workers from abroad. The Scottish government has set out itsfour-phase routemap,externalfor reopening. Here is a brief summary of what the points are: Lockdownâ Stay at home except for exercise, medicine and essential work Phase 1â Virus not yet contained but cases falling. Start of easing from 28 May allowing some meeting outdoors. Phase 2â Virus controlled. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories, and small shops start to resume work. Professional sport can begin again. Phase 3â Virus suppressed. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Non-essential offices, gyms, museums, libraries and cinemas can open along with some live events. Larger shops, pubs, restuarants, hairdressers and dentists reopen. Phase 4â Virus no longer âsignificant threatâ. University and college campuses reopen in full, mass gatherings allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney has been answering questions from the listeners. Q: What if I have two children and one is at school and the other at home, how do I go back to work? A:What we've injected into the framework we've publlished today is sufficient local flexibility for schools and local authorities on how scenarios like that can be addressed to ensure that young people can get access to learning and families can get the opp to get back to work. There's a lot of school and parental dialogue that goes on on a constant basis. Q: When we went into lockdown, we were told that many classes had two or three people in them as parents kept their kids off school. When children go back, will that be mandatory? A:Yes, it is. Q: Will this be an exam year, or will grades be awarded as it has been this year? A:That's a difficult question to answer at this stage. The document published today makes clear that the exam diet for 2020-21 is being prepared as we speak. But what I don't know at this stage is how much of the educational year is going to be disrupted by this blended model. We'll set out a clear position on that when it is available. Scottish business leaders have described plans to ease restrictions on garden centres as well as the agriculture, forestry and construction sectors as a ""helpful start"", after Nicola Sturgeonunveiled her route map for easing lockdown. Welcoming the move, Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron called for the publication of ""detailed sectoral guidelines"" to be accelerated to help businesses prepare for a restart. CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said the Scottish government's four-phase plan provided a ""helpful
starting point for firms preparing for the restart and those already working
hard to ensure their operations are as safe as possible for staff and
customers"". Malcolm Cannon, head of the Institute of Directors Scotland, said his organisation was ""encouraged"" by the proposed easing of restrictions. The Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland also welcomed the easing of some restrictions, but called on ministers to provide ""as a matter of
urgency, clear, realistic guidance to all businesses about the steps they
should take before reopening"". Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Class sizes may have to be limited to allow for social distancing The ""whole of Scottish society is going to have to work collaboratively"" to ensure the education system works while ""wrestling with coronavirus for some time to come"". So Education Secretary John Swinney tells BBC Radio Scotland as he explains the combination of learning in school and learning at home that will be required when pupils return to school on 11 August. Insisting that the plan is ""thought through and inevitable"", he gives the example of a school in Glasgow with 2000 pupils and 200 staff and stresses that the government could not allow that many people in the school at the one time. ""It would be impossible to deliver physical distancing, which will still be required when schools return on 11 August,"" Mr Swinney states. ""I appreciate that throws up challenges for parents because it isn't the full-time learning model they have been accustomed to and will be reflected in their working patterns"" Here's the UK government graph showing the daily number of confirmed deaths among people who have tested positive for Covid-19. Staff working in the kitchens of a Lanarkshire general hospital have tested positive for coronavirus. It has been reported that several workers at University Hospital Wishaw are confirmed to have the virus and several more have been tested. NHS Lanarkshire said that all appropriate infection prevention and control measures had been taken. A spokeswoman for the health board told the BBC: ""We wouldn't comment on the number of staff due to confidentiality. ""A small number of staff are self-isolating at home as per national guidelines."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Blended learning will be the biggest curriculum challenge in the last 30 years, the EIS teaching union has said. General secretary Larry Flanagan said the shift would require a ""huge effort"" from all those involved in education. Education Scotland will need to play a big part in providing the remote offer and the Scottish government must provide advice on what the curriculum should focus on, he said. The
EIS has been taking part in the government's education recovery group which has
todaypublished
a strategic framework for the return of schools,external. Mr Flanagan welcomed the August target date for schools reopening, which he said would reassure members on safety. He also said PPE should be available in schools but it is not anticipated it will be routinely required in classrooms. Â© 2025 BBC.

As the summer holiday period approaches, many of us in the UK might be wondering when we can enjoy a getaway - at home or abroad. At the moment,the chances of going on a foreign holiday look unlikely.That's because Brits are being advised not to take any non-essential travel abroad, and various countries have restrictions which stop or limit foreign visitors. The UK is expected to introducea 14-day quarantine periodin early June for visitors and UK residents returning home from abroad, making things more complicated. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has suggested that""air bridges"" could be introduced, meaning travellers from countries with low infection rates could be exempt from quarantine. But this remains uncertain. As for a domestic getaway, people in England are free to drive any distance to other destinations in England, like parks and beaches, but they are not supposed to stay overnight away from home (including in any second property they own). Self-catering cottages, Airbnb properties, and UK campsites, hotels and holiday parks will remain shut until at least the beginning of July.

Most people with Covid-19 will only develop mild symptoms, which usually take a week to recover from, maybe longer. But in more serious cases, it could take months, or even more than a year, to get fully better. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains recovery times and what you can do to help others. A member of the UK governmentâs scientific advisory group, known as SAGE, has told the BBC he would have liked the government to have acted earlier in the fight against coronavirus. Sir Ian Boyd, a professor of biology at St Andrews University, toldthe Coronavirus Newscast: âI would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate."" He suggested that the government based its initial assessment on the transmissibility of the SARS virus, which is less infectious than this coronavirus. He described the UK and other European countries as âa bit slower off the markâ and less prepared than countries that had experienced SARS in the early 2000s. ""I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasnât feasible because people wouldnât have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did,"" he said. Professor Boyd, who was the chief scientific adviser at the environment department from 2012-19, also called on ministers to stop saying they were âledâ by the science as it was ""slightly misleading"". The couple's daughter superimposed her parents on to various locations on their holiday itinerary British couple Ed and Barbara Higgins, from Norfolk, England, had been due to fly to New York to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary - and sail back on a luxury cruise ship. But the pandemic put a stop to their plans, like those of many others. Their family though did not want them to miss out so, as theEDP reports,external, they sent an itinerary, online tours, special dinners and mocked-up photos. The couple saidtheir virtual triphad ""brought tears of joy to our eyes"". Barbara and Ed Higgins should have been on the cruise ship in person Lucy WilliamsonBBC's Paris Correspondent A teacher in Nantes, west France, and her pupils wear masks after their school reopened The French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has told the BBC that poorer children are not returning to school as much as those from wealthier families. He said that reopening schools was a âsocial emergencyâ, and that the lockdown had increased inequality in France.  But so far, only 20% of primary school pupils have returned. ""Itâs true that children of poor families are coming less than the others,â Mr Blanquer said. âThatâs why it was important to start in May not in June, because we know that itâs [a] step-by-step [process].â Last week, France reopened 40,000 primary and nursery schools, and pupils returned to some middle schools on Monday. Itâs a voluntary process so far â a decision criticised by one mayor, who said it made things difficult for parents: âIf they send [their children] to school and they get sick, theyâll feel guilty; if they keep them home and they fall behind, theyâll feel guilty. If you govern, you need to take the decision.â The education ministry has issued 56 pages of detailed instructions to schools on how to keep premises clean and pupils safe, in the hope of building trust with parents. There must be no more than 15 children in a class, no shared toys, and arrivals at the school must be timed. Older children must also wear masks. There is so much thatâs compulsory for schools, some say, while the attendance is not.

The season begins in June and international charter flights to popular locations will resume in July, according to the country's prime minster. Greece has been praised for its handling of the pandemic. It has recorded 166 deaths and 2,850 confirmed cases. But how easy will it be for tourists to enter Greece for their holidays? The BBC's Quentin Sommervillearrived in Athens airportto see how things are working at the moment. More on that new data which emerged at today's Downing Street briefing suggesting about one in six Londoners and one in 20 people elsewhere in England have had coronavirus. How did those figures come about? Public Health England says it is carrying out a range of seroprevalence studies - where they measure antibodies in the blood of healthy people - to better understand past rates of infection across the population. In this case, they took 1,000 samples between mid-April and early May from each region. From this, they say they could make a crude estimate that between 4.5% and 13% of the population have coronavirus antibodies. With further statistical adjustments, they found about 17% of London adults had been infected; this compares to only 4.3% in the north-east of England. As antibodies can take up to four weeks to develop, it is likely that the level outside London will increase as more samples are tested in the coming weeks. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: âEarly surveillance suggests that rates of infection were higher in London than the rest of the country â which is consistent with data collected through our other systems. ""London was affected earlier and our data suggests that more of the London population became infected before the lockdown took effect."" ""I think I look better in the mask,"" Trump said. President Trump is touring a US auto plant that has been converted to make ventilators to fight Covid-19. Speaking to reporters, he held up a mask and said he wore one during his tour, but is now standing in an area where is it not required. Earlier this week, a Ford company spokesperson said he would be required to do so, but he has so far never been pictured wearing one. ""I wore one in this back area but I didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,"" said Trump, adding that he wore goggles as well. ""I was tested this morning, so it's not necessary,"" he continued. Asked why the car executives accompanying him are still wearing theirs, he said: ""That's their choice."" The pool reporter travelling with Trump asked the Ford executive if he can confirm that Trump was told he did not require a mask in that part of the factory. The executive shrugged and said, ""It's up to him"". Clive ColemanBBC legal correspondent In the UK, domestic violence referrals to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) during the coronavirus pandemic have increased by 3%. Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill QC told the Justice Committee the increase thus far was ""relatively small"". Domestic violence represents 13.6% of CPS work. A report by MPs has revealedphone calls to a national domestic abuse helpline rose by 49%and killings doubled weeks after lockdown. If you or someone you know have been affected by domestic abuse or violence, you can find advice from the following: Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington Wilson Roosevelt Jerman finished his career caring for the Obama family A White House staff member who cared for 11 US presidents has died with coronavirus at the age of 91, according to his family. Wilson Roosevelt Jerman joined under President Eisenhower in 1957 and was a cleaner when First Lady Jackie Kennedy approached him and promoted him to butler. Years later a photo of him appeared in Michelle Obama's memoir Becoming after he had risen to the rank of maÃ®tre d'. His more than five decades of service have been studied by historians of African-Americans in politics. Like other African-American men of his generation, says Ohio State Universityâs Koritha Mitchell, author of From Slave Cabins to the White House, he showed dignity while serving in one of the few positions that was available to him at the time. She believes that he must have found it satisfying to end his career in the way that he did. He was working for Obama, âa dignified president who was also African Americanâ, she says, adding: âThat must have felt like a victory.â Read more A British woman who was stranded in Australia after falling ill has been reunited with her family after three long months. Mother-of-three Jeanette Hall, from Sheffield, England, was visiting her sister in southern Australia when she developed sepsis. But cancelled flights - due to the pandemic - meant there was no way to get back home. She missed her son's 21st but said it was the ""best feeling"" to finally see her husband Steve and children after flying home on Sunday. Read more on Jeanette's storyhere. Steve and Jeanette Hall spent three months apart Like many around the world, people in Britain clap weekly for hospital staff and other key workers, to thank them for their dedication and sacrifice during the pandemic. At south London's St George's hospital, medical workers clapped from a helipad. You can watch it below.

He is one of the most feared men in Russia, says our Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg. The authoritarian leader of Russia's Chechnya region previously fought against Moscow as a Chechen nationalist but is now a key ally of President Vladimir Putin. He is the latest latest high-profile Russian official to show symptoms of the virus. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin only returned to work in the last few days after being treated in hospital for Covid-19. Russia has the second largest number of infections worldwide. Earlier, at the UK government's daily briefing, we heard news of a study which suggests that 17% of people in London and around 5% of the rest of the nation have virus antibodies. The new data comes as the government agreed a deal with a large pharmaceutical firm for more than 10 million antibody tests, to see if people have had the virus. The first in line for them will be health and social care staff, patients and care home residents. It's still unclear what level of immunity people develop once they have had it, but some experts hope a degree of immunity would last a year or two. However, there is no guarantee that having antibodies means a person will not pass the virus on to somebody else. At the briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said certificates were being looked at for people who test positive for coronavirus antibodies. ""It's not just about the clinical advances that these tests can bring,"" he said. ""It's that knowing that you have these antibodies will help us to understand more in the future if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, of dying from coronavirus and of transmitting coronavirus."" A temperature screening trial began at Heathrow airport on Thursday Heathrow launched atemperature screening trial on Thursday,externalfor arrivals in Terminal 2, but the airport's chief executive John Holland-Kaye has called for a ""common international standard"" to screen passengers on departure rather than arrival. âEvery country going into this crisis came up with their own
policy for screening people. But as we come out â and we try to get people
flying again â we need some consistency,"" he told the BBC. ""Weâre calling on the UK government to
work with other governments like the US and EU to establish a common
international standard, so when youâre travelling youâre confident youâll be
accepted into the country youâre going to, and will be kept safe on your
journey. ""And I think itâs important that the screen takes place at the
airport on departure, rather than at your destination, because you donât want to
run the gauntlet of not knowing if youâll be quarantined or turned around at
your destination.â Russia's emergencies ministry sent disinfection equipment to crisis-hit Dagestan Exams for Russia's final-year secondary school students will go ahead in June, President Vladimir Putin has announced. Students will be given masks, gloves and other protective equipment in the exam rooms. The exams were originally supposed to take place on 25 May but the education ministry postponed them. Now, citing a ""decrease in coronavirus cases"", Putin told officials the exams would happen on 29 June. Russia has more than 317,000 cases of coronavirus, the second-highest number in the world.Dagestan, in southern Russia, is said to be experiencing a ""catastrophe"". Trump speaks before departing for Michigan US President Donald Trump has just spoken to reporters on his way to tour an automotive plant in Michigan. He says that he took a coronavirus test today, which came back ""positively toward negative"". He said: ""I tested very positively in another sense. So this morning, yeah, I tested positively toward negative. ""Right, so, I tested perfectly this morning. Meaning, I tested negative."" Trump is visiting later today a Ford factory that has been manufacturing ventilators. Earlier this week a company spokesperson said the president would be required to wear a mask during the tour. Trump has yet to be seen wearing a face mask since the outbreak began. Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence have been receiving daily tests after several White House staff members tested positive.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock was asked whether the PM changed his mind on the fees NHS staff and care workers from overseas will no longer have to pay an extra charge towards the health service after mounting pressure from MPs. Boris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had asked the Home Office and Department for Health to exempt NHS and care workers ""as soon as possible"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a victory for common decency"". The health immigration surcharge on non-EU migrants is Â£400 per year and set to rise to Â£624 in October. The move to grant the exemption came after the PM's spokesman defended the fee earlier on Thursday. Officials are now working on the detail and more will be announced ""in the coming days"". But it is understood the plan will include exemptions for all NHS workers, including porters and cleaners, as well as independent health workers and social care workers. Government defends NHS fee for overseas carers Bereaved families of NHS staff can stay in UK The UK health tax hurting foreign nurses The chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, Dame Donna Kinnair, said the charge had created ""an unfair and unjust financial burden"", adding: ""At last the government has agreed with us. ""This will ease the pressure on families who may be struggling financially or emotionally as a result."" Mr Johnson himself stood by the charge on Wednesday, telling MPs he ""understood the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff"", but said the government ""must look at the realities"" of funding the NHS. It caused a backlash, with a number of Tory MPs joining opposition MPs in calling for him to reconsider - including the Tory chairman of the Commons public administration select committee, William Wragg, and his backbench colleague Sir Roger Gale. It all happened pretty quickly. Just yesterday when the Labour leader Keir Starmer pressed Boris Johnson to change his mind, the prime minister was firm. He was adamant, it was the right thing to stick with the plan. But overnight, there was disquiet - some chatter among Tory MPs - a few of them breaking cover to say they thought it was the wrong thing to stick with the charge. And, lo and behold, just after four o'clock this afternoon, Downing Street announced that the prime minister would be thinking carefully. For the government's critics, of course, it has been portrayed immediately as a screaming U turn. A way for Downing Street to close down a political row. But many people who thought it was the wrong thing might be pleased that the prime minister, in their view, has seen sense on this occasion. Earlier, No 10 defended the levy, saying the money ""goes directly back into the NHS to help save lives"".

""The purpose of the NHS surcharge is to benefit the NHS, help to care for the sick and save lives.  NHS and care workers from abroad who are granted visas are doing this already by the fantastic contribution which they make."" The change was welcomed by Labour, as the party had been planning to seek an amendment to the Immigration Bill to secure the exemption.

""This is a victory for common decency and the right thing to do. We cannot clap our carers one day and then charge them to use our NHS the next."" Mr Wragg also praised the decision, saying the PM had ""shown true leadership, listened and reflected"".

"Time is running out to finalise a test, track and trace strategy to avoid a possible second surge in coronavirus cases, NHS bosses have said. The NHS Confederation warned of ""severe"" consequences to staff and patients if the right system was not established quickly. It said lockdown measures should not be eased until a clear plan was in place. It follows the PM's pledge to introducea ""world-beating"" contact tracing systemin England from June. Contact tracingidentifies those who may have come into contact with an infected person - either through an app or by phone and email - so they can avoid potentially passing the disease on. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the confederation, which represents health and care leaders, welcomed Boris Johnson's pledge made at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. But in aletter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock,external, Mr Dickson said without a clear strategy the UK was at greater risk of a second peak of the virus and emphasised the importance of involving local health organisations in the plan. He said a test, track and trace strategy should have been in place sooner and if the right system was not instigated rapidly the ramifications for the NHS ""could be severe"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Dickson said: ""We are absolutely clear that contact tracing is the right thing to do, it is absolutely critical, it has got to be in place to prevent any notion of a second surge if the lockdown is being further released."" He added the government was acting ""quite late in the day [and] we haven't yet seen the detail"". How will contact tracing work in the UK? Track and trace system in place from June - PM Multiple security flaws found in NHS virus app Meanwhile, a further 338 people have died of coronavirus in the UK as of 17:00 BST on Wednesday, the Department of Health said, taking the total to 36,042. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - a membership group for England's NHS trusts - told BBC Breakfast his members have ""not had clear information and instructions about what their role will be"" in the system. Security minister James Brokenshire said Mr Hopson's comments ""will not be lost on anyone"" at the Department of Health - and will be followed up on ""at pace"". Downing Street has confirmed that 24,000 manual contact tracers have been hired, with plans to employ an additional 1,000 people before the test, track and trace scheme starts on 1 June. The prime minister's official spokesman said ""test and trace"" would start shortly. This video can not be played Johnson: ""Test, track and trace system in place in the UK by June 1"" On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new cases a day, would be in place by 1 June. It coincides with the earliest possible date for the gradual reopening of schools and non-essential shops in England. Northern Irelandalready has a telephone contact tracing systemin place, while the Scottish government iscurrently trialling one. The Welsh government wantsits programmeoperational by the end of May. One of the government's most senior scientific advisers previously said an effective tracing system needed to be in place before lockdown restrictions could be changed. What this letter indicates is that, for all the rhetoric, the NHS Confederation does not yet believe that the government has a robust plan for virus testing and tracking of contacts of those who are infected. And that comes even after the prime minister's statement that such a programme will be in place by 1 June with 25,000 contact tracers appointed. A widespread testing and tracing system is seen as a necessity if lockdown restrictions are to be further eased, including the reopening of schools. The confederation, which represents health leaders and organisations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, does welcome Mr Johnson's commitment to a testing and tracing programme. But tellingly it notes that its members are not yet reassured, and that if there is not rapid action there could be a second wave of infections and serious consequences for NHS patients and staff. Mr Brokenshire said the contact tracing system will be in place on 1 June - with or withoutan NHS tracing appwhich will be rolled out ""in the coming weeks"". The University of Nottingham's Prof Keith Neal said the app would be most useful if people were out in public at places such as supermarkets. ""That's where the app comes in because it will allow later on to identify who you've been in contact with but don't know their name or phone number,"" he said. ""We can do contact tracing even without the app because that is a matter of finding the most high-risk contacts in close and prolonged contact, and you tend to only have close and prolonged contact with people you actually know."" The anonymous contact tracer says he and around ""90 odd people"" had online training for the role One newly-hired contact tracer, a graduate who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC at the moment ""it's not very productive at all"". He applied for a job as a ""work at home customer service agent"", he says - ""nothing to do with the NHS"". A few days later he passed the application process and joined an online training session. ""Whenever we asked questions he would try but the main answer was 'wait for the coming days, you'll get an email or something',"" he says. He adds the work is ""quite boring"" as ""we're just kind of sat there doing absolutely nothing for the majority of the day"". ""Right now, I'm just sat scrolling through Netflix. A lot of people are chilling on games. ""People say we can't complain, we're getting paid, which is very true, but at the same time it's like why would they set us up doing this if we're just sat around waiting."" Contact tracing for coronavirus began when the UK identified its first two cases at the end of January. But it was stopped in mid-March after England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said it was ""no longer necessary for us to identify every case"". On Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Mr Johnson over that decision, describing it as a ""huge hole in our defences"". In response, the prime minister said he was ""confident"" that England would have a track and trace operation which would allow the country to make ""progress"". Contact tracingis already being used in Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany. On Thursday, the government also announced ithad agreed a deal to make antibody tests for the virus available on the NHS. These tests check if a person has had coronavirus and would be prioritised for NHS and care workers.

"Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 Boris Johnson will not face a criminal investigation into his dealings with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri when he was Mayor of London. The Independent Office for Police Conductsaid in its report,externalthat there was ""some evidence"" the pair had an ""intimate relationship"". But there was no evidence Mr Johnson had influenced payments to Ms Arcuri or her companies. The prime minister has always denied any wrongdoing. His spokesman said: ""We welcome the fact that this politically-motivated complaint has been thrown out. ""Such vexatious claims of impropriety in office were untrue and unfounded."" The spokesman added that it was ""not a policing matter, and we consider this was a waste of police time"". Grant awarded to Arcuri company 'appropriate' Arcuri says PM 'cast me aside like some gremlin' The PM now faces a separate inquiry by the Greater London Assembly into allegations of conflict of interest during his time as London Mayor, between 2008 and 2016. The Assembly investigation had been put on hold until the IOPC published its findings. Mr Johnson was referred to the police watchdog in September over allegations of misconduct in a public office, as the role of the mayor of London is also London's police and crime commissioner. The investigation was sparked by a report in the Sunday Times that Ms Arcuri joined trade missions he led, and that she received thousands of pounds in sponsorship grants. IOPC Director General Michael Lockwood said: ""While there was no evidence that Mr Johnson influenced the payment of sponsorship monies or participation in trade missions, there was evidence to suggest that those officers making decisions about sponsorship monies and attendance on trade missions thought that there was a close relationship between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri, and this influenced their decision-making."" The review ""established there was a close association between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri and there may have been an intimate relationship"", the watchdog said. It said that if Mr Johnson was in an intimate relationship with Ms Arcuri, ""it would have been wise for him to have declared this as a conflict of interest"". But the GLA's code of conduct at the time meant that he was under no obligation to do so, the watchdog says, and it recommends a series of measures to tighten up the code. The IOPC said its review had taken longer than expected because some of the records it had wanted to see ""either never existed or have been deleted"". Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group on the London Assembly and chair of the GLA's oversight committee, said: ""The IOPC was looking specifically at whether he committed a criminal offence. ""That's not our remit and their decision doesn't have any real bearing on our investigation, which will focus on his conduct as Mayor of London."" The Assembly's investigation will look at whether Mr Johnson ""conducted himself in a way that's expected"" from a senior public official, said Mr Duval. But the Conservative MP for Orpington in South London, Gareth Bacon, said: ""Labour politicians in City Hall have wasted police time with malicious complaints. ""They now want to waste taxpayers' money with more petty and partisan point scoring."" In October last year, an internal government review found ""no impropriety"" in a 2019 decision by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to award a Â£100,000 grant to Hacker House, a company owned by Ms Arcuri.

Sefton Council's ""Wish you weren't here!"" campaignhas been launched ahead of the Bank Holiday after many people headed to the seaside when coronavirus travel restrictions eased last week. ""Beaches are tempting but are not able to cope with high visitor levels at the moment,"" said councillor Ian Moncur. Beach car parks and public toilets will stay shut but there will be lifeguards. With foreign holidays up in the air this summer,could campsites and caravans provide a ""staycation"" solution if the coronavirus lockdown eases?

Southend beach had thousands of visitors on Wednesday People living in seaside resorts have saidthey are ""horrified"" by the influx of visitorsas temperatures soared ahead of the bank holiday weekend. Thousands of people have headed to English beaches, with many apparently unconcerned about public health issues. ""Hundreds die every day yet people think it's OK to have a jolly on the beach,"" a walker in Southend said. Norfolk Chief Constable Simon Bailey said he feared there was a perception that lockdown was ""done and dusted"". Northern Ballet opened a performance the day before the UK went into lockdown A ballet company says it has lost Â£1m after its 50th anniversary celebrations were hit by the coronavirus crisis. The Leeds-based Northern Ballet had just launched a new show which opened for one night before being cancelled as the UK went into lockdown, while dancers have been furloughed and are currently training at home. Performances are being shown online on a ""pay as you feel"" basis but it is unclear when live shows will return. Chief executive Mark Skipper said: ""If social distancing has to continue in theatre auditoriums you might be reducing a capacity of a 1,000 down to 200 - that really doesn't make things financially viable."" A 'snake' made of hundreds of brightly painted rocks and pebbles has captured a community's imagination in lockdown. About 300 stones now make up the body of the rocky reptile which was started by Gemma Keech who lives on the Love's Farm development in St Neots, Cambridgeshire. She put up a sign asking people to add, but not to take away to see how long it could grow.

He said he had the option to make it mandatory in London only, which he said he would be considering next week. Existing guidance from Transport for London only goes as far as advising passengers to wear face coverings, which is in line with nationwide policy. Mr Khan told the London Assembly he would lobby the government to try to ""reach a sensible compromise"", noting some train services in London were not under his control.

Rob EnglandBBC News Following the warm weather across the UK on Wednesday, public parks and beaches saw littering as people packed into open spaces to enjoy the sunshine. Lockdown restrictions were eased last week, allowing people to enjoy open spaces and take unlimited exercise. Earlier today Rachelle Abbott, who was passing through Clissold Park in Hackney, said she came across gardeners who had spent two hours cleaning up rubbish. ""They have done such a good job of looking after this green space, they deserve more than this,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Officials are beginning to enforce social distancing Dr Yousef was the first in his family to get tested for Covid-19 - and the first to die. ""He came home and said, 'I'm not feeling well and I think I have the virus',"" Behtarin Paktiawal tells me, recalling what was a fateful day for his family. They would end up losing three loved ones to the virus, which is stalking Afghanistan at a speed and scale still perilously uncertain. For an embattled nation already fighting on multiple fronts, the world's health crisis is yet another disaster threatening to overwhelm a fragile health system, and exhaust people weary of endless war. And with each week that passes, both violence and the virus spread. Paktiawal's brother, Dr Yousef Khan Ariubi, had tested positive for Covid-19 - but he wasn't sent his test results. He was expecting them from the Afghan-Japan government hospital in Kabul, which is playing a central role in Afghanistan's fight against the coronavirus. ""I said to them, 'why didn't you call us?'"" Paktiawal recounts as he cradles a small photo album with a photograph of his brother tucked in its plastic cover. ""They told me they made a mistake."" Then the hospital tested the entire family. A month and half on, he says their results are still missing - but as they wait, his brother Fazel and sister Gul Khumar have also died. Behtarin Paktiawal cradles a small album with photos of his late brother ""They are absolutely right when they say people have died because there's no testing equipment,"" admits Afghan Vice-President Amrullah Saleh. ""My response to them is this test equipment is so rare that even if we'd had a billion dollars in spare money to buy them, they were not available anywhere."" A global rush for resources has pushed poorer nations like his own to the back of the queue. ""This caught us by surprise - a nation in the midst of violence and fighting, and coping with so much internal displacement,"" Mr Saleh insists. ""Our health infrastructure was not designed to cope with a hyper-event like a coronavirus pandemic."" Afghans are dying every week from the war against the Taliban and extremist groups like Islamic State, and many more could be killed by hunger if there is a strict shutdown, like those prescribed the world over to stem the spread of the highly contagious virus. Afghan leaders have also been distracted, and resources drained, by a bitter months-long battle for power between President Ashraf Ghani and his challenger Dr Abdullah Abdullah, which has only just been resolved. ""First, this issue wasn't taken seriously enough and then they were overly ambitious with announcements of plans and targets,"" an aid official in Kabul involved in mobilising resources tells me. ""But now they are going in the right direction."" When Paktiawal stood outside the Afghan-Japan hospital, wearing a face mask to record a furious Facebook cry for help, he finally got the attention of senior health officials. ""I think the service is better now,"" he comments, while still declaring that rich and poor must be treated equally - an echo of complaints that the powerful are again vaulting ahead when it comes to keeping well. But the situation is still breathtakingly fragile. A few weeks ago, all testing at all labs abruptly stopped when the country ran out of reagents, a crucial substance used in the testing for Covid-19, because global supplies ran short. ""I had some sleepless nights,"" recalls Dr Rik Peeperkorn, who heads the World Health Organization (WHO) in Afghanistan. ""We managed to get a small quantity and resume testing within two days."" As Eid approaches, some mosques have implemented social distancing Two months ago, Afghanistan had no functional labs for Covid-19 testing. Now nine testing centres, established with the support of WHO, are up and running across the country, with plans to expand more. ""We certainly need more tests to give us a better grip on how this virus is spreading,"" emphasises Dr Peeperkorn, who has spent seven years working on healthcare in Afghanistan. ""Resources are in short supply and so is global solidarity."" Afghanistan's relatively low number of cases is both positive and a puzzle. As of 19 March, there were a little more than 7,600 confirmed cases and fewer than 200 dead. That's in stark contrast to neighbouring Iran, with more than 122,000 cases and 7,000 confirmed dead - and with strong suspicions the real toll is far higher. A nervous question mark still hovers over the massive influx of more than 200,000 Afghans who surged across the border once the virus struck. UN officials say they believe the disease may only reach its peak in Afghanistan in a month or so - but there are also worries it may be spreading undetected, as the anxious and ill fear hospital stays and the social stigma of this strange new disease. And a recent random sample of 500 Kabul residents sent more alarm bells ringing, when nearly 30% tested positive. Like countries the world over, Afghan media are now flooded with messaging about ""social distancing"" and ""washing your hands"". In the eastern province of Nangarhar, Governor Shah Mahmood Miakhel, who gave up own his own salary to establish a special Corona Fund account, tries to lead by example. ""I stopped shaking hands three months ago,"" he says when I reach him by telephone in the provincial capital Jalalabad. When old friends and notables showed up for the funeral of a prominent police chief who came from his district, he didn't buckle under enormous social pressure. ""It was very difficult for people to accept,"" he reflects. ""I am happy with my decision, but social distancing in our culture is extremely difficult."" Afghan girls make ventilators out of car parts The woman nursing the babies of murdered mothers This video can not be played Amina was one of the youngest survivors of an attack on an Afghan hospital As the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan approaches, with all its special rituals of shopping for the Eid celebration, lockdowns in some major cities have been eased. But Afghan officials are stepping up their warnings as the number of cases climbs higher. Weeks ago, bazaars across the country lost some of their bustle as shopkeepers dutifully shuttered shops. But there are still children working on the streets, some clutching stacks of face masks to sell so their families can eat. Zabiullah, one of millions of day labourers, returned to a Kabul market with his rusting wheelbarrow. It's all he has to make the difference between hope and hunger. He tried to stay at home, but says a government programme to distribute bread to the poorest through bakeries passed him by. ""No-one came to help me even with one [piece of] bread,"" he laments. ""I fear hunger. Coronavirus won't kill us, but definitely we will die from hunger."" ""12.4 million people could face severe food insecurity in the coming months, with a third one step away from famine,"" warns Toby Lanzer, the UN's humanitarian co-ordinator in Afghanistan. ""We need to scale up in a significant way now to keep people alive."" Lockdowns in wealthier nations, which can afford to unfurl vast safety nets, are about protecting health systems under strain. Afghan doctors who've seen almost everything - but not this - say they feel exposed. They don't want their names to be known, but want their stories to be told. ""We lost three good doctors this week of Covid,"" a Kabul doctor tells me on a telephone call in the din of a busy hospital ward. It's his first day back at work after recovering from Covid-19. ""They were in contact with suspected Covid patients, they didn't have good enough PPE and sadly they're not with us anymore."" Doctors in Afghanistan already work under difficult conditions (file photo) From Faryab province in northern Afghanistan, another doctor explains that ""a lot of older doctors have closed their clinics because they're at risk and don't have enough protection"". In Herat, the worst-affected province bordering Iran, doctors speak of shortages of critical equipment like ventilators and protective clothing in intensive care units, and the twice-daily risks of ""all of us travelling on one minibus with no distance between us"". And in the south, close to Taliban front lines, doctors at the Emergency NGO hospital in Lashkar Gah are disinfecting and distancing. But in their operating theatres they're treating victims of violence, not the virus. In nearby villages, the Taliban have been seeking greater assistance from aid agencies to fight Covid-19, but are shunning repeated calls for a humanitarian ceasefire. ""The Taliban is the greater corona and the other corona is the little one,"" says Vice-President Saleh. Both violence and the virus now threaten people who dared to hope this would be the year of peace talks, but who are instead fighting on multiple fronts.

"Many migrants have also taken their families along on their difficult journeys Tens of thousands of daily-wage migrant workers suddenly found themselves without jobs or a source of income when India announced a lockdown on 24 March. Overnight, the cities they had helped build and run seemed to have turned their backs on them, the trains and buses which should have carried them home suspended. So with the looming fear of hunger, men, women and children were forced to begin arduous journeys back to their villages - cycling or hitching rides on tuk-tuks, lorries, water tankers and milk vans. For many, walking was the only option. Some travelled for a few hundred kilometres, while others covered more than a thousand to go home. They weren't always alone - some had young children and others had pregnant wives, and the life they had built for themselves packed into their ragtag bags. Many never made it. Here, the BBC tells the story of just a handful of the hundreds who have lost their lives on the road home. Rajan Yadav, his wife Sanju and their two children wanted to make it big in Mumbai Sanju Yadav and her husband, Rajan, and their two children - Nitin and Nandini - arrived in India's financial capital, Mumbai, a decade ago with their meagre belongings and dreams of a brighter future. Her children, she hoped, would thrive growing up in the city. ""It was not like she didn't like the village life,"" Rajan explained. ""She just knew that Mumbai offered better opportunities for all of us."" Indeed, it was Sanju that encouraged Rajan to push himself. ""I used to do an eight-hour shift in a factory. Sanju motivated me do something more, so we bought a food cart and started selling snacks from 16:00 to 22:00. ""She pushed me to think big, she used to say that having our business was way better than a job. Job had a fixed salary, but business allowed us to grow."" Two years ago, all the hard work seemed to be paying off. Rajan used his savings and a bank loan to buy a tuk-tuk. The vehicle-for-hire brought more money for Sanju and her family. But then came coronavirus. Thousands of people have left the cities The couple first heard Prime Minister Narendra Modi talk about the virus on TV on 19 March. A full, three-week lockdown was announced less than a week later. They used up most of their savings to pay rent, repay the loan and buy groceries in March and April. They were hoping that the city would reopen in May, but then the lockdown was extended again. Out of money and options, they decided to go back to their village in Jaunpur district in Uttar Pradesh state. They applied for tickets on the special trains that were being run for migrants, but had no luck for a week. Desperate and exhausted, they decided to undertake the 1,500-km long journey in their tuk-tuk. The family-of-four left Mumbai on 9 May. Many were travelling with small children Rajan would drive from 05:00 to 11:00. He would then rest during the day, and at 18:00 the family would be back on the road until 23:00. ""We ate whatever dry food we had packed and slept on pavements. The prospect of being in the safety of our village kept us going,"" he says. But in the early hours of 12 May - just 200km from their village - a truck rammed into the tuk-tuk from behind. Sanju and Nandini died on the spot. Rajan and Nitin escaped with minor injuries. ""It all ended so quickly,"" Rajan says. ""We were so close to our village. We were so excited. But I have nothing left now - just a big void."" He says he can't help but keep thinking about the train tickets that never came. ""I wish I had gotten the tickets. I wish I had never started the journeyâ¦ I wish I was not poor."" Lallu Ram Yadav was excited to spend time with his family Lallu Ram Yadav used to meet his cousin Ajay Kumar every Sunday to reminisce about the village he had left for Mumbai a decade earlier, in search of a better life for his wife and six children. For 10 years, the 55-year-old had worked as a security guard, 12 hours a day, six days a week. But his hard work amounted to little once the lockdown began, and the cousins both found their savings quickly ran out. Lallu Ram called his family to say they were coming home - at least, he would now get to spend time with his children, he said. And so Lallu Ram and Ajay Kumar joined the desperate scramble to find a way home to the village in Uttar Pradesh's Allahabad district, some 1,400km away. But the price demanded by lorry drivers proved too much. Instead, inspired by the migrants walking home they saw on the television, they packed small bags and began the journey on foot with four friends. Many migrants say they don't want to come back to cities The covered around 400km in the first 48 hours - hitchhiking in lorries along the way. But  the journey was more difficult than they had imagined. ""It was really hot and we would get tired quickly,"" Ajay Kumar said. ""The leather shoes we were wearing were extremely uncomfortable."" They all had blisters on their feet after walking for a day, but giving up was not an option. One evening, Lallu Ram started complaining about breathing difficulties. They had just entered Madhya Pradesh state - they still had a long way to go, but they decided to rest for a while before starting again. Lallu Ram never woke up. When they took him to a nearby hospital, they were told he had died of a cardiac arrest, triggered by exhaustion and fatigue. Many found it difficult to find food during their journeys They didn't know what to do with the body. An ambulance was going to take five to eight hours to reach them. The group had around 15,000 rupees ($199; Â£163) between them - half the amount needed to hire a lorry. But one driver agreed to take the rest of the payment later. And that's how they took the body back home. Lallu Ram couldn't fulfil the promise of spending more time with his children. ""The family's only breadwinner is gone,"" says Ajay Kumar. ""Nobody helped us. My cousin didn't have to die - but it was a choice between hunger and the long journey. ""We poor people often have to pick the best from several bad choices. It didn't work out for my cousin this time. It seldom works out for poor people like him."" Sagheer Ansari was an expert tailor but had lost his job recently Sagheer and Sahib Ansari were good tailors. They never struggled to find work in Delhi's booming garment factories - until the lockdown. Within days, they lost their jobs. The brothers thought things would go back to normal in a few weeks and stayed put in their tiny one-room house. When their money ran out, they asked family members in the village for help. When the lockdown was further extended in May, their patience ran out. ""We couldn't have asked the family for more money. We were supposed to help them, not take money from them,"" Sahib says. They would wait in queues for food being distributed by the government. But, Sahib says, it was never enough and they always felt hungry. So the brothers discussed the idea of going back to their village in Motihari district in Bihar state, some 1,200km from Delhi. Sagheer has left behind his wife and three young children They and their friends decided to buy used bicycles, but could only afford six for eight people. So they decided that they would all take turns to ride pillion. They left Delhi in the early hours of 5 May. It was a hot day and the group felt tired after every 10km. ""Our knees would hurt, but we kept pedalling. We hardly got a proper meal and that made it more difficult to pedal,"" Sahib says. After riding for five days, the group reached Lucknow - the capital of Uttar Pradesh. It had been two days since they had had a proper meal and they were mostly surviving on puffed rice. ""All of us were very hungry. We sat on a road divider to eat because there was hardly any traffic,"" he says. Many migrants have had to travel in overcrowded lorries But then a car came out of nowhere, hitting the barrier and striking Sagheer. He died in a hospital a few hours later. ""My world came crashing down,"" Sahib says. ""I had no idea what I was going to tell his two children and his wife. ""He used to love home-cooked food and was looking forward to it. He died without having a proper meal for days."" Sahib eventually reached home with his brother's body, brought by an ambulance. But he couldn't mourn with his family for long, as he was put into a quarantine centre right after the burial. ""I don't know who to blame for his death - coronavirus, hunger or poverty. I have understood one thing: I will never leave my village. I will make less money but at least I will stay alive."" Naresh Singh with his wife (standing to his right) and children Jaikrishna Kumar, 17, regrets encouraging his father Balram to come home after the lockdown started. Balram was from a village in Bihar's Khagadia district, but was working in Gujarat - one of the states worst-hit by the coronavirus - when much of India closed down in March. He and his friend Naresh Singh, a maintenance worker for mobile phone towers, were both working hard so their sons back in Bihar could have better futures. Balram wanted Jaikrishna to go to college, Nikram wanted his sons to become government officers. They started their journey on foot, but about 400km into it, policemen helped them and others to hitch a ride in a lorry. The ""ride"" involved them all being precariously perched on top of cargo - a common sight on Indian highways. People have taken extreme risks to get home But this time, the driver lost control in Dausa town in Rajasthan state, ramming the lorry into a tree. Both Naresh and Balram died in the accident. Now Jaikrishna Kumar says he will probably have to quit studying and find a job to support the family. ""The accident took away my father and my dreams of getting an education. I wish there was another way. I don't like the idea of going to a city to work, but what other option do I have? ""My father wanted me to break the cycle of poverty. I don't know how to do it without him.""  A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? UPLIFTING STORY: '' I got a life-changing opportunity in lockdown' POST-COVID WORLD:Will we ever shake hands again?

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock was asked whether the PM changed his mind on the fees NHS staff and care workers from overseas will no longer have to pay an extra charge towards the health service after mounting pressure from MPs. Boris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had asked the Home Office and Department for Health to exempt NHS and care workers ""as soon as possible"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a victory for common decency"". The health immigration surcharge on non-EU migrants is Â£400 per year and set to rise to Â£624 in October. The move to grant the exemption came after the PM's spokesman defended the fee earlier on Thursday. Officials are now working on the detail and more will be announced ""in the coming days"". But it is understood the plan will include exemptions for all NHS workers, including porters and cleaners, as well as independent health workers and social care workers. Government defends NHS fee for overseas carers Bereaved families of NHS staff can stay in UK The UK health tax hurting foreign nurses The chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, Dame Donna Kinnair, said the charge had created ""an unfair and unjust financial burden"", adding: ""At last the government has agreed with us. ""This will ease the pressure on families who may be struggling financially or emotionally as a result."" Mr Johnson himself stood by the charge on Wednesday, telling MPs he ""understood the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff"", but said the government ""must look at the realities"" of funding the NHS. It caused a backlash, with a number of Tory MPs joining opposition MPs in calling for him to reconsider - including the Tory chairman of the Commons public administration select committee, William Wragg, and his backbench colleague Sir Roger Gale. It all happened pretty quickly. Just yesterday when the Labour leader Keir Starmer pressed Boris Johnson to change his mind, the prime minister was firm. He was adamant, it was the right thing to stick with the plan. But overnight, there was disquiet - some chatter among Tory MPs - a few of them breaking cover to say they thought it was the wrong thing to stick with the charge. And, lo and behold, just after four o'clock this afternoon, Downing Street announced that the prime minister would be thinking carefully. For the government's critics, of course, it has been portrayed immediately as a screaming U turn. A way for Downing Street to close down a political row. But many people who thought it was the wrong thing might be pleased that the prime minister, in their view, has seen sense on this occasion. Earlier, No 10 defended the levy, saying the money ""goes directly back into the NHS to help save lives"". This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer: ""This is a victory for common sense"" But now Mr Johnson's spokesman has said: ""[The PM] has been thinking about this a great deal. He has been a personal beneficiary of carers from abroad and understands the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff. ""The purpose of the NHS surcharge is to benefit the NHS, help to care for the sick and save lives.  NHS and care workers from abroad who are granted visas are doing this already by the fantastic contribution which they make."" The change was welcomed by Labour, as the party had been planning to seek an amendment to the Immigration Bill to secure the exemption. Sir Keir tweeted: ""Boris Johnson is right to have u-turned and backed our proposal to remove the NHS charge for health professionals and care workers. ""This is a victory for common decency and the right thing to do. We cannot clap our carers one day and then charge them to use our NHS the next."" Mr Wragg also praised the decision, saying the PM had ""shown true leadership, listened and reflected"". The leader of the SNP in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said he was ""pleased to see the change of heart after pressure"", while the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, called it ""a great cross-party win"". The change was also welcomed by of Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. But the charity's chief executive Satbir Singh added: ""It's depressing that it's taken nearly two months for the government to listen."" The surcharge is currently paid by non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals coming to the UK for longer than six months. There are exemptions for victims of slavery or trafficking, children taken into care, and the dependants of armed forces personnel. The current rate of Â£400 a year is double what it what it was when first introduced in 2015. It is due to be extended to EEA citizens moving to the UK from from next January, after the post-Brexit transition period ends. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank has estimated that exempting NHS and social care workers in England would cost around Â£90m a year. EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

News of the exemption came as the government announced a trial for a coronavirus test that does not need to be sent to a lab and gives results in 20 minutes. It has also been announced that 10 million antibody tests - that check if someone has had the virus in the past - will start being rolled out next week. Meanwhile, lockdown restrictions in Scotlandare likely to be relaxed slightlyfrom next Thursday. And in Northern Ireland, Education Minister Peter Weir has said the reopening of schools will begin for ""key cohort years"" in August, followed by a phased provision for all pupils in September.

"Time is running out to finalise a test, track and trace strategy to avoid a possible second surge in coronavirus cases, NHS bosses have said. The NHS Confederation warned of ""severe"" consequences to staff and patients if the right system was not established quickly. It said lockdown measures should not be eased until a clear plan was in place. It follows the PM's pledge to introducea ""world-beating"" contact tracing systemin England from June. Contact tracingidentifies those who may have come into contact with an infected person - either through an app or by phone and email - so they can avoid potentially passing the disease on. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the confederation, which represents health and care leaders, welcomed Boris Johnson's pledge made at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. But in aletter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock,external, Mr Dickson said without a clear strategy the UK was at greater risk of a second peak of the virus and emphasised the importance of involving local health organisations in the plan. He said a test, track and trace strategy should have been in place sooner and if the right system was not instigated rapidly the ramifications for the NHS ""could be severe"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Dickson said: ""We are absolutely clear that contact tracing is the right thing to do, it is absolutely critical, it has got to be in place to prevent any notion of a second surge if the lockdown is being further released."" He added the government was acting ""quite late in the day [and] we haven't yet seen the detail"". How will contact tracing work in the UK? Track and trace system in place from June - PM Multiple security flaws found in NHS virus app Meanwhile, a further 338 people have died of coronavirus in the UK as of 17:00 BST on Wednesday, the Department of Health said, taking the total to 36,042. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - a membership group for England's NHS trusts - told BBC Breakfast his members have ""not had clear information and instructions about what their role will be"" in the system. Security minister James Brokenshire said Mr Hopson's comments ""will not be lost on anyone"" at the Department of Health - and will be followed up on ""at pace"". Downing Street has confirmed that 24,000 manual contact tracers have been hired, with plans to employ an additional 1,000 people before the test, track and trace scheme starts on 1 June. The prime minister's official spokesman said ""test and trace"" would start shortly. This video can not be played Johnson: ""Test, track and trace system in place in the UK by June 1"" On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new cases a day, would be in place by 1 June. It coincides with the earliest possible date for the gradual reopening of schools and non-essential shops in England. Northern Irelandalready has a telephone contact tracing systemin place, while the Scottish government iscurrently trialling one. The Welsh government wantsits programmeoperational by the end of May. One of the government's most senior scientific advisers previously said an effective tracing system needed to be in place before lockdown restrictions could be changed. What this letter indicates is that, for all the rhetoric, the NHS Confederation does not yet believe that the government has a robust plan for virus testing and tracking of contacts of those who are infected. And that comes even after the prime minister's statement that such a programme will be in place by 1 June with 25,000 contact tracers appointed. A widespread testing and tracing system is seen as a necessity if lockdown restrictions are to be further eased, including the reopening of schools. The confederation, which represents health leaders and organisations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, does welcome Mr Johnson's commitment to a testing and tracing programme. But tellingly it notes that its members are not yet reassured, and that if there is not rapid action there could be a second wave of infections and serious consequences for NHS patients and staff. Mr Brokenshire said the contact tracing system will be in place on 1 June - with or withoutan NHS tracing appwhich will be rolled out ""in the coming weeks"". The University of Nottingham's Prof Keith Neal said the app would be most useful if people were out in public at places such as supermarkets. ""That's where the app comes in because it will allow later on to identify who you've been in contact with but don't know their name or phone number,"" he said. ""We can do contact tracing even without the app because that is a matter of finding the most high-risk contacts in close and prolonged contact, and you tend to only have close and prolonged contact with people you actually know."" The anonymous contact tracer says he and around ""90 odd people"" had online training for the role One newly-hired contact tracer, a graduate who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC at the moment ""it's not very productive at all"". He applied for a job as a ""work at home customer service agent"", he says - ""nothing to do with the NHS"". A few days later he passed the application process and joined an online training session. ""Whenever we asked questions he would try but the main answer was 'wait for the coming days, you'll get an email or something',"" he says. He adds the work is ""quite boring"" as ""we're just kind of sat there doing absolutely nothing for the majority of the day"". ""Right now, I'm just sat scrolling through Netflix. A lot of people are chilling on games. ""People say we can't complain, we're getting paid, which is very true, but at the same time it's like why would they set us up doing this if we're just sat around waiting."" Contact tracing for coronavirus began when the UK identified its first two cases at the end of January. But it was stopped in mid-March after England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said it was ""no longer necessary for us to identify every case"". On Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Mr Johnson over that decision, describing it as a ""huge hole in our defences"". In response, the prime minister said he was ""confident"" that England would have a track and trace operation which would allow the country to make ""progress"". Contact tracingis already being used in Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany. On Thursday, the government also announced ithad agreed a deal to make antibody tests for the virus available on the NHS. These tests check if a person has had coronavirus and would be prioritised for NHS and care workers.

Thanks for reading!  The oldest gay bar in San Francisco will close down permanently after 55 years due to a lack of revenue during the pandemic. The Stud,external, which has been around since 1966, will host a ""drag funeral"" for the bar on 31 May, according to owner Honey Mahogany. In mid-March, San Francisco became one of the first US cities to order residents to ""shelter in place"" to control the spread of the pandemic. As the summer holiday period approaches, many of us in the UK might be wondering when we can enjoy a getaway - at home or abroad. At the moment,the chances of going on a foreign holiday look unlikely.That's because Brits are being advised not to take any non-essential travel abroad, and various countries have restrictions which stop or limit foreign visitors. The UK is expected to introducea 14-day quarantine periodin early June for visitors and UK residents returning home from abroad, making things more complicated. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has suggested that""air bridges"" could be introduced, meaning travellers from countries with low infection rates could be exempt from quarantine. But this remains uncertain. As for a domestic getaway, people in England are free to drive any distance to other destinations in England, like parks and beaches, but they are not supposed to stay overnight away from home (including in any second property they own). Self-catering cottages, Airbnb properties, and UK campsites, hotels and holiday parks will remain shut until at least the beginning of July. This video can not be played The latest figures from Johns Hopkins University show that 1.9 million people have recovered from the virus, but the time it takes to recover can vary. Most people with Covid-19 will only develop mild symptoms, which usually take a week to recover from, maybe longer. But in more serious cases, it could take months, or even more than a year, to get fully better. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains recovery times and what you can do to help others. A member of the UK governmentâs scientific advisory group, known as SAGE, has told the BBC he would have liked the government to have acted earlier in the fight against coronavirus. Sir Ian Boyd, a professor of biology at St Andrews University, toldthe Coronavirus Newscast: âI would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate."" He suggested that the government based its initial assessment on the transmissibility of the SARS virus, which is less infectious than this coronavirus. He described the UK and other European countries as âa bit slower off the markâ and less prepared than countries that had experienced SARS in the early 2000s. ""I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasnât feasible because people wouldnât have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did,"" he said. Professor Boyd, who was the chief scientific adviser at the environment department from 2012-19, also called on ministers to stop saying they were âledâ by the science as it was ""slightly misleading"". The couple's daughter superimposed her parents on to various locations on their holiday itinerary British couple Ed and Barbara Higgins, from Norfolk, England, had been due to fly to New York to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary - and sail back on a luxury cruise ship. But the pandemic put a stop to their plans, like those of many others. Their family though did not want them to miss out so, as theEDP reports,external, they sent an itinerary, online tours, special dinners and mocked-up photos. The couple saidtheir virtual triphad ""brought tears of joy to our eyes"". Barbara and Ed Higgins should have been on the cruise ship in person Lucy WilliamsonBBC's Paris Correspondent A teacher in Nantes, west France, and her pupils wear masks after their school reopened The French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has told the BBC that poorer children are not returning to school as much as those from wealthier families. He said that reopening schools was a âsocial emergencyâ, and that the lockdown had increased inequality in France.  But so far, only 20% of primary school pupils have returned. ""Itâs true that children of poor families are coming less than the others,â Mr Blanquer said. âThatâs why it was important to start in May not in June, because we know that itâs [a] step-by-step [process].â Last week, France reopened 40,000 primary and nursery schools, and pupils returned to some middle schools on Monday. Itâs a voluntary process so far â a decision criticised by one mayor, who said it made things difficult for parents: âIf they send [their children] to school and they get sick, theyâll feel guilty; if they keep them home and they fall behind, theyâll feel guilty. If you govern, you need to take the decision.â The education ministry has issued 56 pages of detailed instructions to schools on how to keep premises clean and pupils safe, in the hope of building trust with parents. There must be no more than 15 children in a class, no shared toys, and arrivals at the school must be timed. Older children must also wear masks. There is so much thatâs compulsory for schools, some say, while the attendance is not.

The season begins in June and international charter flights to popular locations will resume in July, according to the country's prime minster. Greece has been praised for its handling of the pandemic. It has recorded 166 deaths and 2,850 confirmed cases. But how easy will it be for tourists to enter Greece for their holidays? The BBC's Quentin Sommervillearrived in Athens airportto see how things are working at the moment. More on that new data which emerged at today's Downing Street briefing suggesting about one in six Londoners and one in 20 people elsewhere in England have had coronavirus. How did those figures come about? Public Health England says it is carrying out a range of seroprevalence studies - where they measure antibodies in the blood of healthy people - to better understand past rates of infection across the population. In this case, they took 1,000 samples between mid-April and early May from each region. From this, they say they could make a crude estimate that between 4.5% and 13% of the population have coronavirus antibodies. With further statistical adjustments, they found about 17% of London adults had been infected; this compares to only 4.3% in the north-east of England. As antibodies can take up to four weeks to develop, it is likely that the level outside London will increase as more samples are tested in the coming weeks. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: âEarly surveillance suggests that rates of infection were higher in London than the rest of the country â which is consistent with data collected through our other systems. ""London was affected earlier and our data suggests that more of the London population became infected before the lockdown took effect."" ""I think I look better in the mask,"" Trump said. President Trump is touring a US auto plant that has been converted to make ventilators to fight Covid-19. Speaking to reporters, he held up a mask and said he wore one during his tour, but is now standing in an area where is it not required. Earlier this week, a Ford company spokesperson said he would be required to do so, but he has so far never been pictured wearing one. ""I wore one in this back area but I didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,"" said Trump, adding that he wore goggles as well. ""I was tested this morning, so it's not necessary,"" he continued. Asked why the car executives accompanying him are still wearing theirs, he said: ""That's their choice."" The pool reporter travelling with Trump asked the Ford executive if he can confirm that Trump was told he did not require a mask in that part of the factory. The executive shrugged and said, ""It's up to him"". Clive ColemanBBC legal correspondent In the UK, domestic violence referrals to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) during the coronavirus pandemic have increased by 3%. Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill QC told the Justice Committee the increase thus far was ""relatively small"". Domestic violence represents 13.6% of CPS work.

Wilson Roosevelt Jerman joined under President Eisenhower in 1957 and was a cleaner when First Lady Jackie Kennedy approached him and promoted him to butler. Years later a photo of him appeared in Michelle Obama's memoir Becoming after he had risen to the rank of maÃ®tre d'. His more than five decades of service have been studied by historians of African-Americans in politics. Like other African-American men of his generation, says Ohio State Universityâs Koritha Mitchell, author of From Slave Cabins to the White House, he showed dignity while serving in one of the few positions that was available to him at the time. She believes that he must have found it satisfying to end his career in the way that he did. He was working for Obama, âa dignified president who was also African Americanâ, she says, adding: âThat must have felt like a victory.â Read more A British woman who was stranded in Australia after falling ill has been reunited with her family after three long months.

He is one of the most feared men in Russia, says our Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg. The authoritarian leader of Russia's Chechnya region previously fought against Moscow as a Chechen nationalist but is now a key ally of President Vladimir Putin. He is the latest latest high-profile Russian official to show symptoms of the virus. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin only returned to work in the last few days after being treated in hospital for Covid-19. Russia has the second largest number of infections worldwide. Earlier, at the UK government's daily briefing, we heard news of a study which suggests that 17% of people in London and around 5% of the rest of the nation have virus antibodies. The new data comes as the government agreed a deal with a large pharmaceutical firm for more than 10 million antibody tests, to see if people have had the virus. The first in line for them will be health and social care staff, patients and care home residents. It's still unclear what level of immunity people develop once they have had it, but some experts hope a degree of immunity would last a year or two. However, there is no guarantee that having antibodies means a person will not pass the virus on to somebody else. At the briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said certificates were being looked at for people who test positive for coronavirus antibodies. ""It's not just about the clinical advances that these tests can bring,"" he said. ""It's that knowing that you have these antibodies will help us to understand more in the future if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, of dying from coronavirus and of transmitting coronavirus."" A temperature screening trial began at Heathrow airport on Thursday Heathrow launched atemperature screening trial on Thursday,externalfor arrivals in Terminal 2, but the airport's chief executive John Holland-Kaye has called for a ""common international standard"" to screen passengers on departure rather than arrival. âEvery country going into this crisis came up with their own
policy for screening people. But as we come out â and we try to get people
flying again â we need some consistency,"" he told the BBC. ""Weâre calling on the UK government to
work with other governments like the US and EU to establish a common
international standard, so when youâre travelling youâre confident youâll be
accepted into the country youâre going to, and will be kept safe on your
journey. ""And I think itâs important that the screen takes place at the
airport on departure, rather than at your destination, because you donât want to
run the gauntlet of not knowing if youâll be quarantined or turned around at
your destination.â Russia's emergencies ministry sent disinfection equipment to crisis-hit Dagestan Exams for Russia's final-year secondary school students will go ahead in June, President Vladimir Putin has announced. Students will be given masks, gloves and other protective equipment in the exam rooms. The exams were originally supposed to take place on 25 May but the education ministry postponed them. Now, citing a ""decrease in coronavirus cases"", Putin told officials the exams would happen on 29 June. Russia has more than 317,000 cases of coronavirus, the second-highest number in the world.Dagestan, in southern Russia, is said to be experiencing a ""catastrophe"". Trump speaks before departing for Michigan US President Donald Trump has just spoken to reporters on his way to tour an automotive plant in Michigan. He says that he took a coronavirus test today, which came back ""positively toward negative"". He said: ""I tested very positively in another sense. So this morning, yeah, I tested positively toward negative. ""Right, so, I tested perfectly this morning. Meaning, I tested negative."" Trump is visiting later today a Ford factory that has been manufacturing ventilators. Earlier this week a company spokesperson said the president would be required to wear a mask during the tour. Trump has yet to be seen wearing a face mask since the outbreak began. Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence have been receiving daily tests after several White House staff members tested positive.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock was asked whether the PM changed his mind on the fees NHS staff and care workers from overseas will no longer have to pay an extra charge towards the health service after mounting pressure from MPs. Boris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had asked the Home Office and Department for Health to exempt NHS and care workers ""as soon as possible"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a victory for common decency"". The health immigration surcharge on non-EU migrants is Â£400 per year and set to rise to Â£624 in October. The move to grant the exemption came after the PM's spokesman defended the fee earlier on Thursday. Officials are now working on the detail and more will be announced ""in the coming days"". But it is understood the plan will include exemptions for all NHS workers, including porters and cleaners, as well as independent health workers and social care workers. Government defends NHS fee for overseas carers Bereaved families of NHS staff can stay in UK The UK health tax hurting foreign nurses The chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, Dame Donna Kinnair, said the charge had created ""an unfair and unjust financial burden"", adding: ""At last the government has agreed with us. ""This will ease the pressure on families who may be struggling financially or emotionally as a result."" Mr Johnson himself stood by the charge on Wednesday, telling MPs he ""understood the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff"", but said the government ""must look at the realities"" of funding the NHS. It caused a backlash, with a number of Tory MPs joining opposition MPs in calling for him to reconsider - including the Tory chairman of the Commons public administration select committee, William Wragg, and his backbench colleague Sir Roger Gale. It all happened pretty quickly. Just yesterday when the Labour leader Keir Starmer pressed Boris Johnson to change his mind, the prime minister was firm. He was adamant, it was the right thing to stick with the plan. But overnight, there was disquiet - some chatter among Tory MPs - a few of them breaking cover to say they thought it was the wrong thing to stick with the charge. And, lo and behold, just after four o'clock this afternoon, Downing Street announced that the prime minister would be thinking carefully. For the government's critics, of course, it has been portrayed immediately as a screaming U turn. A way for Downing Street to close down a political row. But many people who thought it was the wrong thing might be pleased that the prime minister, in their view, has seen sense on this occasion. Earlier, No 10 defended the levy, saying the money ""goes directly back into the NHS to help save lives"". This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer: ""This is a victory for common sense"" But now Mr Johnson's spokesman has said: ""[The PM] has been thinking about this a great deal. He has been a personal beneficiary of carers from abroad and understands the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff. ""The purpose of the NHS surcharge is to benefit the NHS, help to care for the sick and save lives.  NHS and care workers from abroad who are granted visas are doing this already by the fantastic contribution which they make."" The change was welcomed by Labour, as the party had been planning to seek an amendment to the Immigration Bill to secure the exemption. Sir Keir tweeted: ""Boris Johnson is right to have u-turned and backed our proposal to remove the NHS charge for health professionals and care workers. ""This is a victory for common decency and the right thing to do. We cannot clap our carers one day and then charge them to use our NHS the next."" Mr Wragg also praised the decision, saying the PM had ""shown true leadership, listened and reflected"". The leader of the SNP in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said he was ""pleased to see the change of heart after pressure"", while the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, called it ""a great cross-party win"". The change was also welcomed by of Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. But the charity's chief executive Satbir Singh added: ""It's depressing that it's taken nearly two months for the government to listen."" The surcharge is currently paid by non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals coming to the UK for longer than six months. There are exemptions for victims of slavery or trafficking, children taken into care, and the dependants of armed forces personnel. The current rate of Â£400 a year is double what it what it was when first introduced in 2015. It is due to be extended to EEA citizens moving to the UK from from next January, after the post-Brexit transition period ends. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank has estimated that exempting NHS and social care workers in England would cost around Â£90m a year. EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

"European countries have reported 1.74 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 A surge in visitors to beaches in northern Europe after coronavirus lockdowns were eased and temperatures rose has alarmed officials and experts. Three towns in north-western France shut their beaches on Wednesday because of the ""unacceptable"" failure of people to observe social-distancing rules. Municipalities in the Netherlands urged German tourists not to visit. And in England, the town council in Southend said it might take action after sunseekers flocked there. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 around the world has now passed five million, but the number of new infections has been falling across most of Europe. European countries had reported 1.74 million cases and 164,349 deaths as of Wednesday, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Those with the most fatalities are the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Belgium. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that there is ""still a long way to go in this pandemic"", and called on people in countries where restrictions are being eased to continue to adapt their behaviour to minimise transmission of Covid-19.

People also headed to beaches across England on Wednesday on the hottest day of the year so far, a week after lockdown rules were eased. But people in England should not travel to Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland, where the public is still being told to avoid any travel which is not essential.

"This video can not be played Cyclone Amphan causes havoc in India and Bangladesh The eastern Indian city of Kolkata has been devastated by a powerful cyclone which has killed at least 84 people across India and Bangladesh. Amphan made landfall on Wednesday, lashing coastal areas with ferocious wind and rain. The storm is weakening as it moves north into Bhutan. Thousands of trees were uprooted in the gales, electricity and telephone lines brought down and houses flattened. Many of Kolkata's roads are flooded and its 14 million people without power. Most of those who died were hit by falling trees or debris The storm is the first super cyclone to form in the Bay of Bengal since 1999. Though its winds had weakened by the time it struck, it was still classified as a very severe cyclone. Coronavirus restrictions have been hindering emergency and relief efforts. Covid-19 and social-distancing measures made mass evacuations more difficult, with shelters unable to be used to full capacity. Bay of Bengal: world hotbed of tropical cyclones When extreme weather and Covid-19 collide Amphan began hitting the Sundarbans, a mangrove area around the India-Bangladesh border home to four million people on Wednesday afternoon, before carving north and north-eastwards towards Kolkata, a historic city that was the capital of the British Raj and widely known as Calcutta. Parts of West Bengal and Orissa (also known as Odisha) states in India, and areas in south-west Bangladesh, bore the brunt, with winds gusting up to 185km/h (115mph). At least 72 people have died in India's West Bengal state, and 12 deaths have been confirmed in Bangladesh. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said the devastation in Kolkata, the state capital, was ""a bigger disaster than Covid-19"". ""Area after area has been ruined,"" Ms Banerjee was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency. ""I have experienced a war-like situation today."" How cyclones get their names What is a cyclone? Three districts in West Bengal - South and North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore - were very badly hit. In Bangladesh, there are reports of tens of thousands of homes damaged or destroyed and many villages submerged by storm surges in low-lying coastal areas like Khulna and Satkhira. The authorities evacuated nearly 2.5 million people ahead of the cyclone. Initial assessments of the damage are being hampered by blocked roads and flooding in all these areas. By Shamik Bag, Kolkata On one of Kolkata's oldest streets, Rabindra Sarani, special prayers are being offered at the Kumartuli Sai Baba temple. Nobody died yesterday, a local says. A giant banyan tree has fallen, bringing down a small Shiva temple with it. While human casualties in have been low, the uprooted tree and temple are a reminder that gods or prayers couldn't halt the riotous run of the fierce Cyclone Amphan. The conjunction of the two disasters - Covid-19 and Cyclone Amphan - and the challenging recovery effort facing administrators is highlighted by a narrow lane at a crossing point in the city. Its entrance is blocked as it's a Covid hotspot and containment zone but it is also immersed in flood waters which came with the cyclone. Near the gates of the esteemed Presidency College, I spy the unique sight of a small catfish being preyed upon by a street dog. The catfish must have come with the floods but couldn't make it back home when the waters receded. The fish still has life and its sharp flailing about manages to keep the dog curious and a little intimidated too. Images shared on social media showed electricity transformers exploding in busy neighbourhoods as the storm swept the city. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Thank God, we are safe,"" said one resident, who shared footage of tiled roofs being peeled off by the force of the wind and blown away.

This video can not be played Cyclone Amphan batters India and Bangladesh Kajal Basu, who lives on the 12th floor of a high-rise building in the city, wrote on Facebook after the storm began: ""It is like the vault of hell outside."" The apartment building seemed to be ""swaying from side to side, mimicking an earthquake"", he said. Parts of Kolkata airport are submerged after the storm Most people were at home when the storm struck. Kolkata and the rest of India is in lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. Officials in Bangladesh feared Amphan would be the deadliest storm since Cyclone Sidr which killed about 3,500 people in 2007. Most died as a result of sea water surging in. India's weather department had predicted storm surges as high as 10-16 feet (3-5 metres) from Amphan. The rising of sea levels in this way can send deadly walls of water barrelling far inland, devastating communities. The total level of devastation in Bangladesh remains to be assessed but it's clear that there has been widespread destruction in areas that were in the path of the storm. In the city of Khulna, north of the Sundarbans,at least 83,000 homes were either destroyed or damaged, the Dhaka Tribune reports.,external Fewer people appear to have been killed than in India but the government fears about $1.5bn worth of damages, the newspaper says.

In mid-March, San Francisco became one of the first US cities to order residents to ""shelter in place"" to control the spread of the pandemic. As the summer holiday period approaches, many of us in the UK might be wondering when we can enjoy a getaway - at home or abroad. At the moment,the chances of going on a foreign holiday look unlikely.That's because Brits are being advised not to take any non-essential travel abroad, and various countries have restrictions which stop or limit foreign visitors. The UK is expected to introducea 14-day quarantine periodin early June for visitors and UK residents returning home from abroad, making things more complicated. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has suggested that""air bridges"" could be introduced, meaning travellers from countries with low infection rates could be exempt from quarantine. But this remains uncertain. As for a domestic getaway, people in England are free to drive any distance to other destinations in England, like parks and beaches, but they are not supposed to stay overnight away from home (including in any second property they own). Self-catering cottages, Airbnb properties, and UK campsites, hotels and holiday parks will remain shut until at least the beginning of July. This video can not be played The latest figures from Johns Hopkins University show that 1.9 million people have recovered from the virus, but the time it takes to recover can vary. Most people with Covid-19 will only develop mild symptoms, which usually take a week to recover from, maybe longer. But in more serious cases, it could take months, or even more than a year, to get fully better. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains recovery times and what you can do to help others. A member of the UK governmentâs scientific advisory group, known as SAGE, has told the BBC he would have liked the government to have acted earlier in the fight against coronavirus. Sir Ian Boyd, a professor of biology at St Andrews University, toldthe Coronavirus Newscast: âI would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate."" He suggested that the government based its initial assessment on the transmissibility of the SARS virus, which is less infectious than this coronavirus. He described the UK and other European countries as âa bit slower off the markâ and less prepared than countries that had experienced SARS in the early 2000s. ""I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasnât feasible because people wouldnât have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did,"" he said. Professor Boyd, who was the chief scientific adviser at the environment department from 2012-19, also called on ministers to stop saying they were âledâ by the science as it was ""slightly misleading"". The couple's daughter superimposed her parents on to various locations on their holiday itinerary British couple Ed and Barbara Higgins, from Norfolk, England, had been due to fly to New York to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary - and sail back on a luxury cruise ship.

He said that reopening schools was a âsocial emergencyâ, and that the lockdown had increased inequality in France.  But so far, only 20% of primary school pupils have returned. ""Itâs true that children of poor families are coming less than the others,â Mr Blanquer said. âThatâs why it was important to start in May not in June, because we know that itâs [a] step-by-step [process].â Last week, France reopened 40,000 primary and nursery schools, and pupils returned to some middle schools on Monday. Itâs a voluntary process so far â a decision criticised by one mayor, who said it made things difficult for parents: âIf they send [their children] to school and they get sick, theyâll feel guilty; if they keep them home and they fall behind, theyâll feel guilty. If you govern, you need to take the decision.â The education ministry has issued 56 pages of detailed instructions to schools on how to keep premises clean and pupils safe, in the hope of building trust with parents. There must be no more than 15 children in a class, no shared toys, and arrivals at the school must be timed. Older children must also wear masks. There is so much thatâs compulsory for schools, some say, while the attendance is not.

More on that new data which emerged at today's Downing Street briefing suggesting about one in six Londoners and one in 20 people elsewhere in England have had coronavirus. How did those figures come about? Public Health England says it is carrying out a range of seroprevalence studies - where they measure antibodies in the blood of healthy people - to better understand past rates of infection across the population. In this case, they took 1,000 samples between mid-April and early May from each region. From this, they say they could make a crude estimate that between 4.5% and 13% of the population have coronavirus antibodies. With further statistical adjustments, they found about 17% of London adults had been infected; this compares to only 4.3% in the north-east of England. As antibodies can take up to four weeks to develop, it is likely that the level outside London will increase as more samples are tested in the coming weeks. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: âEarly surveillance suggests that rates of infection were higher in London than the rest of the country â which is consistent with data collected through our other systems. ""London was affected earlier and our data suggests that more of the London population became infected before the lockdown took effect."" ""I think I look better in the mask,"" Trump said. President Trump is touring a US auto plant that has been converted to make ventilators to fight Covid-19. Speaking to reporters, he held up a mask and said he wore one during his tour, but is now standing in an area where is it not required. Earlier this week, a Ford company spokesperson said he would be required to do so, but he has so far never been pictured wearing one. ""I wore one in this back area but I didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,"" said Trump, adding that he wore goggles as well. ""I was tested this morning, so it's not necessary,"" he continued. Asked why the car executives accompanying him are still wearing theirs, he said: ""That's their choice."" The pool reporter travelling with Trump asked the Ford executive if he can confirm that Trump was told he did not require a mask in that part of the factory. The executive shrugged and said, ""It's up to him"".

Mother-of-three Jeanette Hall, from Sheffield, England, was visiting her sister in southern Australia when she developed sepsis. But cancelled flights - due to the pandemic - meant there was no way to get back home. She missed her son's 21st but said it was the ""best feeling"" to finally see her husband Steve and children after flying home on Sunday. Read more on Jeanette's storyhere. Steve and Jeanette Hall spent three months apart Like many around the world, people in Britain clap weekly for hospital staff and other key workers, to thank them for their dedication and sacrifice during the pandemic. At south London's St George's hospital, medical workers clapped from a helipad. You can watch it below.

He is one of the most feared men in Russia, says our Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg. The authoritarian leader of Russia's Chechnya region previously fought against Moscow as a Chechen nationalist but is now a key ally of President Vladimir Putin. He is the latest latest high-profile Russian official to show symptoms of the virus. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin only returned to work in the last few days after being treated in hospital for Covid-19. Russia has the second largest number of infections worldwide. Earlier, at the UK government's daily briefing, we heard news of a study which suggests that 17% of people in London and around 5% of the rest of the nation have virus antibodies. The new data comes as the government agreed a deal with a large pharmaceutical firm for more than 10 million antibody tests, to see if people have had the virus. The first in line for them will be health and social care staff, patients and care home residents. It's still unclear what level of immunity people develop once they have had it, but some experts hope a degree of immunity would last a year or two. However, there is no guarantee that having antibodies means a person will not pass the virus on to somebody else. At the briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said certificates were being looked at for people who test positive for coronavirus antibodies. ""It's not just about the clinical advances that these tests can bring,"" he said. ""It's that knowing that you have these antibodies will help us to understand more in the future if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, of dying from coronavirus and of transmitting coronavirus."" A temperature screening trial began at Heathrow airport on Thursday Heathrow launched atemperature screening trial on Thursday,externalfor arrivals in Terminal 2, but the airport's chief executive John Holland-Kaye has called for a ""common international standard"" to screen passengers on departure rather than arrival. âEvery country going into this crisis came up with their own
policy for screening people. But as we come out â and we try to get people
flying again â we need some consistency,"" he told the BBC. ""Weâre calling on the UK government to
work with other governments like the US and EU to establish a common
international standard, so when youâre travelling youâre confident youâll be
accepted into the country youâre going to, and will be kept safe on your
journey. ""And I think itâs important that the screen takes place at the
airport on departure, rather than at your destination, because you donât want to
run the gauntlet of not knowing if youâll be quarantined or turned around at
your destination.â Russia's emergencies ministry sent disinfection equipment to crisis-hit Dagestan Exams for Russia's final-year secondary school students will go ahead in June, President Vladimir Putin has announced. Students will be given masks, gloves and other protective equipment in the exam rooms. The exams were originally supposed to take place on 25 May but the education ministry postponed them. Now, citing a ""decrease in coronavirus cases"", Putin told officials the exams would happen on 29 June. Russia has more than 317,000 cases of coronavirus, the second-highest number in the world.Dagestan, in southern Russia, is said to be experiencing a ""catastrophe"". Trump speaks before departing for Michigan US President Donald Trump has just spoken to reporters on his way to tour an automotive plant in Michigan. He says that he took a coronavirus test today, which came back ""positively toward negative"". He said: ""I tested very positively in another sense. So this morning, yeah, I tested positively toward negative. ""Right, so, I tested perfectly this morning. Meaning, I tested negative."" Trump is visiting later today a Ford factory that has been manufacturing ventilators. Earlier this week a company spokesperson said the president would be required to wear a mask during the tour. Trump has yet to be seen wearing a face mask since the outbreak began. Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence have been receiving daily tests after several White House staff members tested positive.

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock was asked whether the PM changed his mind on the fees NHS staff and care workers from overseas will no longer have to pay an extra charge towards the health service after mounting pressure from MPs. Boris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had asked the Home Office and Department for Health to exempt NHS and care workers ""as soon as possible"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a victory for common decency"". The health immigration surcharge on non-EU migrants is Â£400 per year and set to rise to Â£624 in October. The move to grant the exemption came after the PM's spokesman defended the fee earlier on Thursday. Officials are now working on the detail and more will be announced ""in the coming days"". But it is understood the plan will include exemptions for all NHS workers, including porters and cleaners, as well as independent health workers and social care workers. Government defends NHS fee for overseas carers Bereaved families of NHS staff can stay in UK The UK health tax hurting foreign nurses The chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, Dame Donna Kinnair, said the charge had created ""an unfair and unjust financial burden"", adding: ""At last the government has agreed with us. ""This will ease the pressure on families who may be struggling financially or emotionally as a result."" Mr Johnson himself stood by the charge on Wednesday, telling MPs he ""understood the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff"", but said the government ""must look at the realities"" of funding the NHS. It caused a backlash, with a number of Tory MPs joining opposition MPs in calling for him to reconsider - including the Tory chairman of the Commons public administration select committee, William Wragg, and his backbench colleague Sir Roger Gale. It all happened pretty quickly. Just yesterday when the Labour leader Keir Starmer pressed Boris Johnson to change his mind, the prime minister was firm. He was adamant, it was the right thing to stick with the plan. But overnight, there was disquiet - some chatter among Tory MPs - a few of them breaking cover to say they thought it was the wrong thing to stick with the charge. And, lo and behold, just after four o'clock this afternoon, Downing Street announced that the prime minister would be thinking carefully. For the government's critics, of course, it has been portrayed immediately as a screaming U turn. A way for Downing Street to close down a political row. But many people who thought it was the wrong thing might be pleased that the prime minister, in their view, has seen sense on this occasion. Earlier, No 10 defended the levy, saying the money ""goes directly back into the NHS to help save lives"". This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer: ""This is a victory for common sense"" But now Mr Johnson's spokesman has said: ""[The PM] has been thinking about this a great deal. He has been a personal beneficiary of carers from abroad and understands the difficulties faced by our amazing NHS staff. ""The purpose of the NHS surcharge is to benefit the NHS, help to care for the sick and save lives.  NHS and care workers from abroad who are granted visas are doing this already by the fantastic contribution which they make."" The change was welcomed by Labour, as the party had been planning to seek an amendment to the Immigration Bill to secure the exemption. Sir Keir tweeted: ""Boris Johnson is right to have u-turned and backed our proposal to remove the NHS charge for health professionals and care workers. ""This is a victory for common decency and the right thing to do. We cannot clap our carers one day and then charge them to use our NHS the next."" Mr Wragg also praised the decision, saying the PM had ""shown true leadership, listened and reflected"". The leader of the SNP in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said he was ""pleased to see the change of heart after pressure"", while the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, called it ""a great cross-party win"". The change was also welcomed by of Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants. But the charity's chief executive Satbir Singh added: ""It's depressing that it's taken nearly two months for the government to listen."" The surcharge is currently paid by non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals coming to the UK for longer than six months. There are exemptions for victims of slavery or trafficking, children taken into care, and the dependants of armed forces personnel. The current rate of Â£400 a year is double what it what it was when first introduced in 2015. It is due to be extended to EEA citizens moving to the UK from from next January, after the post-Brexit transition period ends. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think-tank has estimated that exempting NHS and social care workers in England would cost around Â£90m a year. EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out?

He was working for Obama, âa dignified president who was also African Americanâ, she says, adding: âThat must have felt like a victory.â Read more A British woman who was stranded in Australia after falling ill has been reunited with her family after three long months. Mother-of-three Jeanette Hall, from Sheffield, England, was visiting her sister in southern Australia when she developed sepsis. But cancelled flights - due to the pandemic - meant there was no way to get back home. She missed her son's 21st but said it was the ""best feeling"" to finally see her husband Steve and children after flying home on Sunday. Read more on Jeanette's storyhere. Steve and Jeanette Hall spent three months apart Like many around the world, people in Britain clap weekly for hospital staff and other key workers, to thank them for their dedication and sacrifice during the pandemic. At south London's St George's hospital, medical workers clapped from a helipad. You can watch it below.

He is one of the most feared men in Russia, says our Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg. The authoritarian leader of Russia's Chechnya region previously fought against Moscow as a Chechen nationalist but is now a key ally of President Vladimir Putin. He is the latest latest high-profile Russian official to show symptoms of the virus. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin only returned to work in the last few days after being treated in hospital for Covid-19. Russia has the second largest number of infections worldwide. Earlier, at the UK government's daily briefing, we heard news of a study which suggests that 17% of people in London and around 5% of the rest of the nation have virus antibodies. The new data comes as the government agreed a deal with a large pharmaceutical firm for more than 10 million antibody tests, to see if people have had the virus. The first in line for them will be health and social care staff, patients and care home residents. It's still unclear what level of immunity people develop once they have had it, but some experts hope a degree of immunity would last a year or two. However, there is no guarantee that having antibodies means a person will not pass the virus on to somebody else. At the briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said certificates were being looked at for people who test positive for coronavirus antibodies. ""It's not just about the clinical advances that these tests can bring,"" he said. ""It's that knowing that you have these antibodies will help us to understand more in the future if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, of dying from coronavirus and of transmitting coronavirus."" A temperature screening trial began at Heathrow airport on Thursday Heathrow launched atemperature screening trial on Thursday,externalfor arrivals in Terminal 2, but the airport's chief executive John Holland-Kaye has called for a ""common international standard"" to screen passengers on departure rather than arrival. âEvery country going into this crisis came up with their own
policy for screening people. But as we come out â and we try to get people
flying again â we need some consistency,"" he told the BBC. ""Weâre calling on the UK government to
work with other governments like the US and EU to establish a common
international standard, so when youâre travelling youâre confident youâll be
accepted into the country youâre going to, and will be kept safe on your
journey. ""And I think itâs important that the screen takes place at the
airport on departure, rather than at your destination, because you donât want to
run the gauntlet of not knowing if youâll be quarantined or turned around at
your destination.â Russia's emergencies ministry sent disinfection equipment to crisis-hit Dagestan Exams for Russia's final-year secondary school students will go ahead in June, President Vladimir Putin has announced. Students will be given masks, gloves and other protective equipment in the exam rooms. The exams were originally supposed to take place on 25 May but the education ministry postponed them. Now, citing a ""decrease in coronavirus cases"", Putin told officials the exams would happen on 29 June. Russia has more than 317,000 cases of coronavirus, the second-highest number in the world.Dagestan, in southern Russia, is said to be experiencing a ""catastrophe"". Trump speaks before departing for Michigan US President Donald Trump has just spoken to reporters on his way to tour an automotive plant in Michigan. He says that he took a coronavirus test today, which came back ""positively toward negative"". He said: ""I tested very positively in another sense. So this morning, yeah, I tested positively toward negative. ""Right, so, I tested perfectly this morning. Meaning, I tested negative."" Trump is visiting later today a Ford factory that has been manufacturing ventilators. Earlier this week a company spokesperson said the president would be required to wear a mask during the tour. Trump has yet to be seen wearing a face mask since the outbreak began. Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence have been receiving daily tests after several White House staff members tested positive.

"This video can not be played Mark Zuckerberg told the BBC's Simon Jack that Facebook would 'take down' coronavirus misinformation Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has told the BBC that it had and would remove any content likely to result in ""immediate and imminent harm"" to users. ""Even if something isn't going to lead to imminent physical harm, we don't want misinformation to be the content that is going viral,"" he said. It removed Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's claim that scientists had ""proved"" there was a coronavirus cure. This was removed because it was ""obviously"" not true, he said. He also said that Facebook had removed content from groups claiming that the rollout of the 5G digital network was a cause of the spread of the virus and in some cases encouraged those who believed that to damage the networks physical infrastructure. Facebook recently removed content from former broadcaster and conspiracy theorist David Icke for ""repeatedly violating our policies on harmful misinformation"". Mr Icke had suggested that 5G mobile phone networks are linked to the spread of the virus and in another video he suggested a Jewish group was behind the virus. Mr Zuckerberg said: ""We work with independent fact checkers. Since the Covid outbreak, they have issued 7,500 notices of misinformation which has led to us issuing 50 million warning labels on posts. ""We know these are effective because 95% of the time, users don't click through to the content with a warning label."" However, Facebook has insisted that unless there was the prospect of real imminent harm, then the company would and should allow what he called the ""widest possible aperture"" for freedom of expression on the internet. He also told the BBC that preventing electoral interference is an ""arms race"" against countries such as Russia, Iran and China. He admitted that the firm was ""behind"" in the 2016 US presidential election. In his first UK broadcast interview in five years, he said that Facebook had been unprepared for state-sponsored interference in 2016. But he added the company was confident it had since learnt its lessons. Facebook was previously embroiled in a political scandal in which tens of millions of its users' data ended up in the hands of political interest groups including Cambridge Analytica. However, he said the social media giant, which also owns Whatsapp and Instagram, was now better prepared than other companies, and even governments, to prevent future attempts to influence political outcomes. In-app shops launched on Facebook and Instagram Facebook and Google extend working from home ""Countries are going to continue to try and interfere and we are going to see issues like that but we have learnt a lot since 2016 and I feel pretty confident that we are going to be able to protect the integrity of the upcoming election"". Mr Zuckerberg also defended his level of personal control over arguably the world's most powerful media platforms. Although Facebook is a public company worth nearly $700bn (Â£574bn), he ultimately exerts total individual control thanks to an ownership structure that gives him a controlling interest even though he owns a small fraction of the shares. He said it had allowed Facebook to make longer-term strategic decisions which have proved to be correct such as waiting to improve the Facebook experience before launching it on smartphones and not selling out early to rivals. ""If it had been different then we would have sold out to Yahoo years ago and who knows what would have happened then. "" Yahoo is now worth 1/20th as much as Facebook. Facebook continues to face criticism over its reluctance to describe or define itself as a publisher and thus embrace the kind of editorial responsibility that newspapers and traditional broadcasters are legally bound by. However, it would be hard to argue that Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram have not provided billions of people with the kind of connectivity with friends and family that has been important during this global pandemic and the consequent restrictions on movement and freedom. In fact, after many years of courting controversy and opprobrium, it seems clear that Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg are feeling more confident about their public roles. If there are any winners out of this public health emergency, digital companies like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon are among them. However, no one is totally immune to the deep downturn that is already upon us and the evidence for which is confirmed with every new economic release. Facebook knows that and is one of the reasons it is keen to help small businesses online through this week's launch of a service called Facebook Shops. It's a mutually beneficial exchange.

"This video can not be played Cyclone Amphan causes havoc in India and Bangladesh The eastern Indian city of Kolkata has been devastated by a powerful cyclone which has killed at least 84 people across India and Bangladesh. Amphan made landfall on Wednesday, lashing coastal areas with ferocious wind and rain. The storm is weakening as it moves north into Bhutan. Thousands of trees were uprooted in the gales, electricity and telephone lines brought down and houses flattened. Many of Kolkata's roads are flooded and its 14 million people without power. Most of those who died were hit by falling trees or debris The storm is the first super cyclone to form in the Bay of Bengal since 1999. Though its winds had weakened by the time it struck, it was still classified as a very severe cyclone. Coronavirus restrictions have been hindering emergency and relief efforts. Covid-19 and social-distancing measures made mass evacuations more difficult, with shelters unable to be used to full capacity. Bay of Bengal: world hotbed of tropical cyclones When extreme weather and Covid-19 collide Amphan began hitting the Sundarbans, a mangrove area around the India-Bangladesh border home to four million people on Wednesday afternoon, before carving north and north-eastwards towards Kolkata, a historic city that was the capital of the British Raj and widely known as Calcutta. Parts of West Bengal and Orissa (also known as Odisha) states in India, and areas in south-west Bangladesh, bore the brunt, with winds gusting up to 185km/h (115mph). At least 72 people have died in India's West Bengal state, and 12 deaths have been confirmed in Bangladesh. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said the devastation in Kolkata, the state capital, was ""a bigger disaster than Covid-19"". ""Area after area has been ruined,"" Ms Banerjee was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency. ""I have experienced a war-like situation today."" How cyclones get their names What is a cyclone? Three districts in West Bengal - South and North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore - were very badly hit. In Bangladesh, there are reports of tens of thousands of homes damaged or destroyed and many villages submerged by storm surges in low-lying coastal areas like Khulna and Satkhira. The authorities evacuated nearly 2.5 million people ahead of the cyclone. Initial assessments of the damage are being hampered by blocked roads and flooding in all these areas. By Shamik Bag, Kolkata On one of Kolkata's oldest streets, Rabindra Sarani, special prayers are being offered at the Kumartuli Sai Baba temple. Nobody died yesterday, a local says. A giant banyan tree has fallen, bringing down a small Shiva temple with it. While human casualties in have been low, the uprooted tree and temple are a reminder that gods or prayers couldn't halt the riotous run of the fierce Cyclone Amphan. The conjunction of the two disasters - Covid-19 and Cyclone Amphan - and the challenging recovery effort facing administrators is highlighted by a narrow lane at a crossing point in the city. Its entrance is blocked as it's a Covid hotspot and containment zone but it is also immersed in flood waters which came with the cyclone. Near the gates of the esteemed Presidency College, I spy the unique sight of a small catfish being preyed upon by a street dog. The catfish must have come with the floods but couldn't make it back home when the waters receded. The fish still has life and its sharp flailing about manages to keep the dog curious and a little intimidated too.

"European countries have reported 1.74 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 A surge in visitors to beaches in northern Europe after coronavirus lockdowns were eased and temperatures rose has alarmed officials and experts. Three towns in north-western France shut their beaches on Wednesday because of the ""unacceptable"" failure of people to observe social-distancing rules. Municipalities in the Netherlands urged German tourists not to visit. And in England, the town council in Southend said it might take action after sunseekers flocked there. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 around the world has now passed five million, but the number of new infections has been falling across most of Europe. European countries had reported 1.74 million cases and 164,349 deaths as of Wednesday, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Those with the most fatalities are the UK, Italy, France, Spain and Belgium. The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that there is ""still a long way to go in this pandemic"", and called on people in countries where restrictions are being eased to continue to adapt their behaviour to minimise transmission of Covid-19.

"This video can not be played 'There is no blueprint' - IOC President Thomas Bach talks to BBC sports editor Dan Roan about rescheduling the 2020 Olympic Games International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach says he understands why the rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Games would have to be cancelled if it cannot take place next summer. Local organisers have said they have no back-up plan after the event waspostponed by a year because of the coronavirus crisis. ""You cannot forever employ 3,000 to 5,000 people in an organising committee,"" Bach told BBC Sport. ""You cannot have the athletes being in uncertainty."" In a wide-ranging interview, Bach also: admitted the job of re-organising the Games was ""a mammoth task"" warned that the event would ""definitely be different"" with a focus on ""essentials"" would not be drawn on whether a vaccine for Covid-19 would be needed for the event to take place insisted staging the Games behind closed doors was ""not what we want"", but he needs more time to consider whether that was feasible Bach said he hoped the first ever postponed Games, which are due to take place from 23 July to 8 August 2021, could prove ""unique"" and send ""a message of solidarity among the entire world, coming for the first time together again, and celebrating the triumph over coronavirus"". ""There is no blueprint for it so we have to reinvent the wheel day by day. It's very challenging and at the same time fascinating."" 2020 Olympics will be 'scrapped' instead of delayed again, says Games chief Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has admitted it may be ""difficult"" to stage the Games if the country does not successfully contain the virus, and the head of the Japan Medical Association has suggested it depends on finding a vaccine. When asked directly if he agreed, Bach said: ""For this question, we are relying on the advice of the World Health Organisation. ""We have established one principle: to organise these Games in a safe environment for all the participants. Nobody knows what the world will look like in one year, in two months. ""So we have to rely on [experts] and then take the appropriate decision at the appropriate time based on this advice."" The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics are due to take place in China just six months after the Tokyo Games, and Bach said that Prime Minister Abe had made it clear to him that, as far as Japan was concerned, next summer was ""the last option"". ""Quite frankly, I have some understanding for this, because you cannot forever employ 3,000, or 5,000, people in an Organising Committee,"" said Bach. ""You cannot every year change the entire sports schedule worldwide of all the major federations. You cannot have the athletes being in uncertainty. ""You cannot have so much overlapping with a future Olympic Games, so I have some understanding for this approach by our Japanese partners."" When asked how confident he was that the Games would go ahead, Bach said: ""We have to be prepared for different scenarios. There is the clear commitment to having these games in July next year. ""At the same time, looking at the scenarios this may require towards the organisation, with regard to health measures, these maybe need quarantine for the athletes, for part of the athletes, for other participants. ""What could this mean for the life in an Olympic Village and so on? All these different scenarios are under consideration and this is why I'm saying it's a mammoth task, because there are so many different options that it's not easy to address them [now]. When we have a clear view on how the world will look on 23 July, 2021, then [we will] take the appropriate decisions."" The director general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said it is possible but ""not easy"" for 11,000 athletes from more than 200 teams to come together in Tokyo. Japan has recorded more than 17,100 cases and 797 deaths from the pandemic, but the numbers of infections are falling sharply and it has been affected far less than some other countries. IOC president Thomas Bach was speaking to the BBC in his first broadcast interview since Tokyo postponement If social distancing restrictions are still in force in Japan next summer, some have suggested the Games may have to be staged behind closed doors. Bach said such a scenario remained ""speculation"". ""This is not what we want,"" he said. ""Because the Olympic spirit is about also uniting the fans and this is what makes the Games so unique that they're in an Olympic Stadium, all the fans from all over the world are together. ""But when it then would come to the decision... I would ask you to give me some more time for consultation with the athletes, with the World Health Organisation, with the Japanese partners."" The IOC has set aside $800m (Â£654m) to help with the financial impact caused by the postponement of Tokyo 2020. The total additional cost to Japan has been estimated at between two and six billion dollars. But Bach said there would also have to be cutbacks to the Games. ""They will definitely be different, and they have to be different,"" he said. ""If we all have learned something during this crisis, [it is] to look to the essentials and not so much on the nice-to-have things. ""So this concentration on the essentials should be reflected in the organisation of these Games... there should be no taboo."" Two months ago, Bach faced unprecedented criticism from athletes for not postponing the Games earlier. ""The developments were so fast that you could not know what would happen tomorrow,"" he said when asked if he would do anything differently now. 'To find the balance between the more optimistic experts, saying, 'wait, you still have time. It's still some months away. Let's see how it goes', and the others saying, 'this will be a total disaster - why don't you take this decision right now?' This was the challenge every day. ""And this had to be done in consultation with our Japanese partners, because we could have cancelled the Games alone, without them, and that would have been an easy decision in one way. ""We could have said, 'OK, this is it.' We would have got our money being paid by insurance. And we could have started to prepare for Paris [2024 Games]. But this was not a real option because this would have deprived the athletes of this unique Olympic experience."" Bach said he was ""happy"" last weekend to see the Bundesliga resume in his native Germany, even though fans were not present. ""I wish that now all the other sports are coming back,"" he said. ""On the other hand, I was a little bit feeling for the players, how strange it must be for them, playing in these huge stadiums... ""So I hope now that is the first step. Sport has to respect the rules, like any other organisation and area of society. But that slowly, we can come back and then maybe lift these restrictions in a responsible way."" Bach appealed to governments around the world to do what they can to help sports deal with the financial crisis caused by the pandemic. ""There is, first of all, the contribution of sport to health, and everybody realises that we must concentrate more on health in in the in the future,"" he said. ""Secondly, sport makes the great contribution to the inclusivity of society... sport is the best glue for a society. ""And thirdly, sport is also a very important economic factor. We had a study that about 3% of all the jobs being offered in Europe are sports-related. ""And this is why we are urging the governments to honour and to acknowledge the role of sport, and to include them in their recovery programmes.""

"Nicola Sturgeon has unveiled details of a four-phase ""route map"" towards easing the country's lockdown restrictions The first begins after 28 May and there will be a review every three weeks The R number is below one and has been so for three weeks, allowing a slow lifting of lockdown The first phase of lifting lockdown will allow different households to see each other in ""small groups"" and only in ""outdoor spaces"" The fourth phase could see ""mass gatherings resuming in line with public health advice"" and all types of ""shopping, eating out and drinking"" allowed Children in Scotland will go back to the classroom from 11 August, but they will not be there every day The government says the approach will be a ""blended"" one in which pupils will be in school on certain days and at home on others BBC Scotland News Today we were given the first detailed indication of how Scotland may move out of lockdown:  The situation will be reviewed every three weeks and the government has cautioned it may take months or longer before we can move into Phase 4, when mass gatherings and normal school interaction will be possible. In other news, the Scottish Conservatives have called for the resignation of Health Secretary Jeane Freeman after it emerged that far more elderly people were released from hospital into care homes to clear beds, than she previously said. On Reporting Scotland Nicola Sturgeon rejected the call. We'll be back early tomorrow with more live updates of the latest developments. Don't forget the weekly Clap for Carers event. Reporting Scotland The Scottish Conservatives have demanded the resignation of Jeane Freeman after it emerged far more elderly people were discharged from hospitals without testing than was first revealed. In mid-April Ms Freeman said about 900 ""delayed discharge"" patients had left hospital, primarily to return to their own home. But the Scottish government now admits this was the figure released to care homes - and another 1,500 were released to their own homes. The Scottish Tory health spokesman Miles Briggs said the health secretary had lost the confidence of the public. But the first minister rejected the call, saying Ms Freeman has her ""absolute confidence"". ""I believe she should and does have the confidence of the public. She has been literally for three months working round the clock to make sure this crisis is managed in the best way possible,"" she told Reporting Scotland.  Reporting Scotland The first minister was asked for more detail on how the guidance on meeting other households would work, and how many households they could see - at a distance - outside. She asked people to ""use their judgement"" on who they meet after the rules are relaxed. She stressed that people should continue to stay near their homes to avoid places like beaches and beauty spots becoming overcrowded. But Ms Sturgeon said their would be more flexibility for people travelling further to see family - for instance ""to see your elderly mother"" in her garden. Reporting Scotland Appearing on Reporting Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon was asked why the lockdown could not be relaxed right away. She said that ""it's important we are really confident"" the virus is in decline. The first minister added that we also need to have the test, trace and isolate programme in place, which it will be from the start of next month. The trade body for Scotland's housebuilders has said that 6,000 households are ""stuck in limbo"", despite plans to ease restrictions on the construction industry as part of a phased return to work. Homes for Scotland chief executive Nicola Barclay was responding to the announcement by the Scottish government which referred to âplanning
for the construction sector to implement the first two phases in its restart
planâ. Ms Barclay said: ""The
biggest question still remains in relation to the 6,000 households currently
waiting to move into what are largely complete homes requiring only internal
finishing touches that can be easily and safely undertaken. ""There is
absolutely no mention of how or when they can be completed. ""With all these
customers still stuck in limbo, they have been given no indication today of
when they can move on with their lives and government
needs to urgently provide further clarity on this.""   The Scottish government has set out a four-phase plan for relaxing the lockdown restrictions and restarting the economy. Phase 1 could start in a week's time, on 28 May, if the R-number and new infections remain low. Here's a rough guide of how we'll come out of lockdown: Phase 1 - You should be able to meet another household outside in small numbers. Sunbathing is allowed, along with some outdoor activities like golf and fishing. Garden centres and drive-through takeaways can reopen, some outdoor work can resume, and childminding services can begin. Phase 2  -You can meet larger groups outdoors, and meet another household indoors. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories and small shops can resume work. Playgrounds and sports courts can reopen, and professional sport can begin again. Phase 3 -You can meet people from more than one household indoors. Non-essential offices would reopen, along with gyms, museums, libraries, cinemas, larger shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and dentists. Live events could take place with restricted numbers and physical distancing restrictions. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Phase 4- University and college campuses can reopen in full, mass gatherings are allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. For a more detailed rundown of how it will work,click here.  Reporting Scotland Coming up on Reporting Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon explains the thinking behind her plan to ease Scotland out of lockdown. Starts on BBC One Scotland shortly. Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Willie MacLeod of UK Hospitality warns of between 70,000 to 100,000 job losses in the sector by the end of the pandemic. If accommodation and hotels cannot open until the middle of July, this will be bad for tourism in Scotland he tells Drivetime. He says redundancies are already being made because businesses cannot sustain the level of cash burn they are taking at the moment.  He says hotels are ""burning"" an average Â£60,000 a month to stay afloat. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick explains for many farmers and crofters, the lockdown has not been as onerous as for other sectors due to the need to provide food. But he welcomes the reopening of recycling centres as fly tipping is especially common on agricultural land. The farming union is also working with the Scottish government on how it will go about recruiting staff for the picking season, with the option of cohorts who share accommodation and work spaces being considered. The
Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has welcomed the news that some businesses
could return to trading from next Thursday if they make adequate provisions to
protect workers and customers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has unveileda four-phase ""route map"" aimed at restarting societywhile suppressing the virus. The FSB is  calling on the Scottish government to  urgently provide clear, realistic
guidance to all businesses about the steps they should take before re-opening. Andrew
McRae, FSBâs Scotland policy chairman, said at the
moment thereâs little guidance for firms in Scotland regarding what alterations might be required. âWhile
the first minister said today that this guidance is coming in the days ahead,
there is no time to lose."" âWhile
we recognise that this is a public health crisis, it is also an economic
crisis."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney continued to answer listeners' questions on Drivetime: Q: Is it the teachers' responsibility to keep the children two metres apart? A:It is part of the whole approach of the school environment to make sure young people are exercising physical distancing. That is much more challenging among the youngest of pupils. Models are going to have to use outdoor space a great deal more or operate in smaller numbers. Q: How can someone work full-time if their child or children are at school part-time? A:Our society is going to have to adapt as a whole - not just the schools - to the presence of coronavirus. So the first minister in parliament today talked about the possibility of employers arranging shorter working weeks, perhaps four rather than five days. It might involve more home working. Q: Does this put the onus on parents and employers to reach arrangements that allow for schooling? A:We put this in our route map about working or running a business and some of the arrangements around remote working that we would want to be encouraging. The school system is not the only bit of society that has to adapt. NHS staff and care workers from overseas are to be exempt from paying a surcharge to use the health service after mounting pressure from MPs. Boris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had asked the Home Office and Department for Health to exempt NHS and care workers ""as soon as possible"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a victory for common decency"", while SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford welcomed what he called a ""U-turn on this cruel Tory policy"". The health immigration surcharge on non-EU migrants is Â£400 per year and set to rise to Â£624 in October. Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg whether the prime minister ""changed his mind"" when he decided to waive the NHS usage fees, Matt Hancock says Boris Johnson has himself ""been a beneficiary"" of workers from abroad. The Scottish government has set out itsfour-phase routemap,externalfor reopening. Here is a brief summary of what the points are: Lockdownâ Stay at home except for exercise, medicine and essential work Phase 1â Virus not yet contained but cases falling. Start of easing from 28 May allowing some meeting outdoors. Phase 2â Virus controlled. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories, and small shops start to resume work. Professional sport can begin again. Phase 3â Virus suppressed. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Non-essential offices, gyms, museums, libraries and cinemas can open along with some live events. Larger shops, pubs, restuarants, hairdressers and dentists reopen. Phase 4â Virus no longer âsignificant threatâ. University and college campuses reopen in full, mass gatherings allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney has been answering questions from the listeners. Q: What if I have two children and one is at school and the other at home, how do I go back to work? A:What we've injected into the framework we've publlished today is sufficient local flexibility for schools and local authorities on how scenarios like that can be addressed to ensure that young people can get access to learning and families can get the opp to get back to work. There's a lot of school and parental dialogue that goes on on a constant basis. Q: When we went into lockdown, we were told that many classes had two or three people in them as parents kept their kids off school. When children go back, will that be mandatory? A:Yes, it is. Q: Will this be an exam year, or will grades be awarded as it has been this year? A:That's a difficult question to answer at this stage. The document published today makes clear that the exam diet for 2020-21 is being prepared as we speak. But what I don't know at this stage is how much of the educational year is going to be disrupted by this blended model. We'll set out a clear position on that when it is available. Scottish business leaders have described plans to ease restrictions on garden centres as well as the agriculture, forestry and construction sectors as a ""helpful start"", after Nicola Sturgeonunveiled her route map for easing lockdown. Welcoming the move, Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron called for the publication of ""detailed sectoral guidelines"" to be accelerated to help businesses prepare for a restart. CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said the Scottish government's four-phase plan provided a ""helpful
starting point for firms preparing for the restart and those already working
hard to ensure their operations are as safe as possible for staff and
customers"". Malcolm Cannon, head of the Institute of Directors Scotland, said his organisation was ""encouraged"" by the proposed easing of restrictions. The Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland also welcomed the easing of some restrictions, but called on ministers to provide ""as a matter of
urgency, clear, realistic guidance to all businesses about the steps they
should take before reopening"". Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Class sizes may have to be limited to allow for social distancing The ""whole of Scottish society is going to have to work collaboratively"" to ensure the education system works while ""wrestling with coronavirus for some time to come"". So Education Secretary John Swinney tells BBC Radio Scotland as he explains the combination of learning in school and learning at home that will be required when pupils return to school on 11 August. Insisting that the plan is ""thought through and inevitable"", he gives the example of a school in Glasgow with 2000 pupils and 200 staff and stresses that the government could not allow that many people in the school at the one time. ""It would be impossible to deliver physical distancing, which will still be required when schools return on 11 August,"" Mr Swinney states. ""I appreciate that throws up challenges for parents because it isn't the full-time learning model they have been accustomed to and will be reflected in their working patterns"" Here's the UK government graph showing the daily number of confirmed deaths among people who have tested positive for Covid-19. Staff working in the kitchens of a Lanarkshire general hospital have tested positive for coronavirus. It has been reported that several workers at University Hospital Wishaw are confirmed to have the virus and several more have been tested. NHS Lanarkshire said that all appropriate infection prevention and control measures had been taken. A spokeswoman for the health board told the BBC: ""We wouldn't comment on the number of staff due to confidentiality. ""A small number of staff are self-isolating at home as per national guidelines."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Blended learning will be the biggest curriculum challenge in the last 30 years, the EIS teaching union has said. General secretary Larry Flanagan said the shift would require a ""huge effort"" from all those involved in education. Education Scotland will need to play a big part in providing the remote offer and the Scottish government must provide advice on what the curriculum should focus on, he said. The
EIS has been taking part in the government's education recovery group which has
todaypublished
a strategic framework for the return of schools,external. Mr Flanagan welcomed the August target date for schools reopening, which he said would reassure members on safety. He also said PPE should be available in schools but it is not anticipated it will be routinely required in classrooms. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 Boris Johnson will not face a criminal investigation into his dealings with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri when he was Mayor of London. The Independent Office for Police Conductsaid in its report,externalthat there was ""some evidence"" the pair had an ""intimate relationship"". But there was no evidence Mr Johnson had influenced payments to Ms Arcuri or her companies. The prime minister has always denied any wrongdoing. His spokesman said: ""We welcome the fact that this politically-motivated complaint has been thrown out. ""Such vexatious claims of impropriety in office were untrue and unfounded."" The spokesman added that it was ""not a policing matter, and we consider this was a waste of police time"". Grant awarded to Arcuri company 'appropriate' Arcuri says PM 'cast me aside like some gremlin' The PM now faces a separate inquiry by the Greater London Assembly into allegations of conflict of interest during his time as London Mayor, between 2008 and 2016. The Assembly investigation had been put on hold until the IOPC published its findings. Mr Johnson was referred to the police watchdog in September over allegations of misconduct in a public office, as the role of the mayor of London is also London's police and crime commissioner. The investigation was sparked by a report in the Sunday Times that Ms Arcuri joined trade missions he led, and that she received thousands of pounds in sponsorship grants. IOPC Director General Michael Lockwood said: ""While there was no evidence that Mr Johnson influenced the payment of sponsorship monies or participation in trade missions, there was evidence to suggest that those officers making decisions about sponsorship monies and attendance on trade missions thought that there was a close relationship between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri, and this influenced their decision-making."" The review ""established there was a close association between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri and there may have been an intimate relationship"", the watchdog said. It said that if Mr Johnson was in an intimate relationship with Ms Arcuri, ""it would have been wise for him to have declared this as a conflict of interest"". But the GLA's code of conduct at the time meant that he was under no obligation to do so, the watchdog says, and it recommends a series of measures to tighten up the code. The IOPC said its review had taken longer than expected because some of the records it had wanted to see ""either never existed or have been deleted"". Len Duvall, leader of the Labour group on the London Assembly and chair of the GLA's oversight committee, said: ""The IOPC was looking specifically at whether he committed a criminal offence. ""That's not our remit and their decision doesn't have any real bearing on our investigation, which will focus on his conduct as Mayor of London."" The Assembly's investigation will look at whether Mr Johnson ""conducted himself in a way that's expected"" from a senior public official, said Mr Duval. But the Conservative MP for Orpington in South London, Gareth Bacon, said: ""Labour politicians in City Hall have wasted police time with malicious complaints. ""They now want to waste taxpayers' money with more petty and partisan point scoring."" In October last year, an internal government review found ""no impropriety"" in a 2019 decision by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to award a Â£100,000 grant to Hacker House, a company owned by Ms Arcuri.

Non-essential offices, gyms, museums, libraries and cinemas can open along with some live events. Larger shops, pubs, restuarants, hairdressers and dentists reopen. Phase 4â Virus no longer âsignificant threatâ. University and college campuses reopen in full, mass gatherings allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney has been answering questions from the listeners. Q: What if I have two children and one is at school and the other at home, how do I go back to work? A:What we've injected into the framework we've publlished today is sufficient local flexibility for schools and local authorities on how scenarios like that can be addressed to ensure that young people can get access to learning and families can get the opp to get back to work. There's a lot of school and parental dialogue that goes on on a constant basis. Q: When we went into lockdown, we were told that many classes had two or three people in them as parents kept their kids off school. When children go back, will that be mandatory? A:Yes, it is. Q: Will this be an exam year, or will grades be awarded as it has been this year? A:That's a difficult question to answer at this stage. The document published today makes clear that the exam diet for 2020-21 is being prepared as we speak. But what I don't know at this stage is how much of the educational year is going to be disrupted by this blended model. We'll set out a clear position on that when it is available. Scottish business leaders have described plans to ease restrictions on garden centres as well as the agriculture, forestry and construction sectors as a ""helpful start"", after Nicola Sturgeonunveiled her route map for easing lockdown. Welcoming the move, Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron called for the publication of ""detailed sectoral guidelines"" to be accelerated to help businesses prepare for a restart. CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said the Scottish government's four-phase plan provided a ""helpful
starting point for firms preparing for the restart and those already working
hard to ensure their operations are as safe as possible for staff and
customers"". Malcolm Cannon, head of the Institute of Directors Scotland, said his organisation was ""encouraged"" by the proposed easing of restrictions. The Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland also welcomed the easing of some restrictions, but called on ministers to provide ""as a matter of
urgency, clear, realistic guidance to all businesses about the steps they
should take before reopening"". Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Class sizes may have to be limited to allow for social distancing The ""whole of Scottish society is going to have to work collaboratively"" to ensure the education system works while ""wrestling with coronavirus for some time to come"". So Education Secretary John Swinney tells BBC Radio Scotland as he explains the combination of learning in school and learning at home that will be required when pupils return to school on 11 August. Insisting that the plan is ""thought through and inevitable"", he gives the example of a school in Glasgow with 2000 pupils and 200 staff and stresses that the government could not allow that many people in the school at the one time. ""It would be impossible to deliver physical distancing, which will still be required when schools return on 11 August,"" Mr Swinney states. ""I appreciate that throws up challenges for parents because it isn't the full-time learning model they have been accustomed to and will be reflected in their working patterns"" Here's the UK government graph showing the daily number of confirmed deaths among people who have tested positive for Covid-19. Staff working in the kitchens of a Lanarkshire general hospital have tested positive for coronavirus. It has been reported that several workers at University Hospital Wishaw are confirmed to have the virus and several more have been tested. NHS Lanarkshire said that all appropriate infection prevention and control measures had been taken. A spokeswoman for the health board told the BBC: ""We wouldn't comment on the number of staff due to confidentiality. ""A small number of staff are self-isolating at home as per national guidelines."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Blended learning will be the biggest curriculum challenge in the last 30 years, the EIS teaching union has said. General secretary Larry Flanagan said the shift would require a ""huge effort"" from all those involved in education. Education Scotland will need to play a big part in providing the remote offer and the Scottish government must provide advice on what the curriculum should focus on, he said. The
EIS has been taking part in the government's education recovery group which has
todaypublished
a strategic framework for the return of schools,external. Mr Flanagan welcomed the August target date for schools reopening, which he said would reassure members on safety. He also said PPE should be available in schools but it is not anticipated it will be routinely required in classrooms. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Cyclone Amphan causes havoc in India and Bangladesh The eastern Indian city of Kolkata has been devastated by a powerful cyclone which has killed at least 84 people across India and Bangladesh. Amphan made landfall on Wednesday, lashing coastal areas with ferocious wind and rain. The storm is weakening as it moves north into Bhutan. Thousands of trees were uprooted in the gales, electricity and telephone lines brought down and houses flattened. Many of Kolkata's roads are flooded and its 14 million people without power. Most of those who died were hit by falling trees or debris The storm is the first super cyclone to form in the Bay of Bengal since 1999. Though its winds had weakened by the time it struck, it was still classified as a very severe cyclone. Coronavirus restrictions have been hindering emergency and relief efforts. Covid-19 and social-distancing measures made mass evacuations more difficult, with shelters unable to be used to full capacity. Bay of Bengal: world hotbed of tropical cyclones When extreme weather and Covid-19 collide Amphan began hitting the Sundarbans, a mangrove area around the India-Bangladesh border home to four million people on Wednesday afternoon, before carving north and north-eastwards towards Kolkata, a historic city that was the capital of the British Raj and widely known as Calcutta. Parts of West Bengal and Orissa (also known as Odisha) states in India, and areas in south-west Bangladesh, bore the brunt, with winds gusting up to 185km/h (115mph). At least 72 people have died in India's West Bengal state, and 12 deaths have been confirmed in Bangladesh. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said the devastation in Kolkata, the state capital, was ""a bigger disaster than Covid-19"". ""Area after area has been ruined,"" Ms Banerjee was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency. ""I have experienced a war-like situation today."" How cyclones get their names What is a cyclone? Three districts in West Bengal - South and North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore - were very badly hit. In Bangladesh, there are reports of tens of thousands of homes damaged or destroyed and many villages submerged by storm surges in low-lying coastal areas like Khulna and Satkhira. The authorities evacuated nearly 2.5 million people ahead of the cyclone. Initial assessments of the damage are being hampered by blocked roads and flooding in all these areas. By Shamik Bag, Kolkata On one of Kolkata's oldest streets, Rabindra Sarani, special prayers are being offered at the Kumartuli Sai Baba temple. Nobody died yesterday, a local says. A giant banyan tree has fallen, bringing down a small Shiva temple with it. While human casualties in have been low, the uprooted tree and temple are a reminder that gods or prayers couldn't halt the riotous run of the fierce Cyclone Amphan. The conjunction of the two disasters - Covid-19 and Cyclone Amphan - and the challenging recovery effort facing administrators is highlighted by a narrow lane at a crossing point in the city. Its entrance is blocked as it's a Covid hotspot and containment zone but it is also immersed in flood waters which came with the cyclone. Near the gates of the esteemed Presidency College, I spy the unique sight of a small catfish being preyed upon by a street dog. The catfish must have come with the floods but couldn't make it back home when the waters receded. The fish still has life and its sharp flailing about manages to keep the dog curious and a little intimidated too. Images shared on social media showed electricity transformers exploding in busy neighbourhoods as the storm swept the city. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The apartment building seemed to be ""swaying from side to side, mimicking an earthquake"", he said. Parts of Kolkata airport are submerged after the storm Most people were at home when the storm struck. Kolkata and the rest of India is in lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. Officials in Bangladesh feared Amphan would be the deadliest storm since Cyclone Sidr which killed about 3,500 people in 2007. Most died as a result of sea water surging in. India's weather department had predicted storm surges as high as 10-16 feet (3-5 metres) from Amphan. The rising of sea levels in this way can send deadly walls of water barrelling far inland, devastating communities. The total level of devastation in Bangladesh remains to be assessed but it's clear that there has been widespread destruction in areas that were in the path of the storm. In the city of Khulna, north of the Sundarbans,at least 83,000 homes were either destroyed or damaged, the Dhaka Tribune reports.,external Fewer people appear to have been killed than in India but the government fears about $1.5bn worth of damages, the newspaper says.

Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before.

"Time is running out to finalise a test, track and trace strategy to avoid a possible second surge in coronavirus cases, NHS bosses have said. The NHS Confederation warned of ""severe"" consequences to staff and patients if the right system was not established quickly. It said lockdown measures should not be eased until a clear plan was in place. It follows the PM's pledge to introducea ""world-beating"" contact tracing systemin England from June. Contact tracingidentifies those who may have come into contact with an infected person - either through an app or by phone and email - so they can avoid potentially passing the disease on. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the confederation, which represents health and care leaders, welcomed Boris Johnson's pledge made at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. But in aletter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock,external, Mr Dickson said without a clear strategy the UK was at greater risk of a second peak of the virus and emphasised the importance of involving local health organisations in the plan. He said a test, track and trace strategy should have been in place sooner and if the right system was not instigated rapidly the ramifications for the NHS ""could be severe"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Dickson said: ""We are absolutely clear that contact tracing is the right thing to do, it is absolutely critical, it has got to be in place to prevent any notion of a second surge if the lockdown is being further released."" He added the government was acting ""quite late in the day [and] we haven't yet seen the detail"". How will contact tracing work in the UK? Track and trace system in place from June - PM Multiple security flaws found in NHS virus app Meanwhile, a further 338 people have died of coronavirus in the UK as of 17:00 BST on Wednesday, the Department of Health said, taking the total to 36,042. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - a membership group for England's NHS trusts - told BBC Breakfast his members have ""not had clear information and instructions about what their role will be"" in the system. Security minister James Brokenshire said Mr Hopson's comments ""will not be lost on anyone"" at the Department of Health - and will be followed up on ""at pace"". Downing Street has confirmed that 24,000 manual contact tracers have been hired, with plans to employ an additional 1,000 people before the test, track and trace scheme starts on 1 June. The prime minister's official spokesman said ""test and trace"" would start shortly. This video can not be played Johnson: ""Test, track and trace system in place in the UK by June 1"" On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new cases a day, would be in place by 1 June. It coincides with the earliest possible date for the gradual reopening of schools and non-essential shops in England. Northern Irelandalready has a telephone contact tracing systemin place, while the Scottish government iscurrently trialling one. The Welsh government wantsits programmeoperational by the end of May. One of the government's most senior scientific advisers previously said an effective tracing system needed to be in place before lockdown restrictions could be changed. What this letter indicates is that, for all the rhetoric, the NHS Confederation does not yet believe that the government has a robust plan for virus testing and tracking of contacts of those who are infected. And that comes even after the prime minister's statement that such a programme will be in place by 1 June with 25,000 contact tracers appointed. A widespread testing and tracing system is seen as a necessity if lockdown restrictions are to be further eased, including the reopening of schools. The confederation, which represents health leaders and organisations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, does welcome Mr Johnson's commitment to a testing and tracing programme. But tellingly it notes that its members are not yet reassured, and that if there is not rapid action there could be a second wave of infections and serious consequences for NHS patients and staff. Mr Brokenshire said the contact tracing system will be in place on 1 June - with or withoutan NHS tracing appwhich will be rolled out ""in the coming weeks"". The University of Nottingham's Prof Keith Neal said the app would be most useful if people were out in public at places such as supermarkets. ""That's where the app comes in because it will allow later on to identify who you've been in contact with but don't know their name or phone number,"" he said. ""We can do contact tracing even without the app because that is a matter of finding the most high-risk contacts in close and prolonged contact, and you tend to only have close and prolonged contact with people you actually know."" The anonymous contact tracer says he and around ""90 odd people"" had online training for the role One newly-hired contact tracer, a graduate who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC at the moment ""it's not very productive at all"". He applied for a job as a ""work at home customer service agent"", he says - ""nothing to do with the NHS"". A few days later he passed the application process and joined an online training session. ""Whenever we asked questions he would try but the main answer was 'wait for the coming days, you'll get an email or something',"" he says. He adds the work is ""quite boring"" as ""we're just kind of sat there doing absolutely nothing for the majority of the day"". ""Right now, I'm just sat scrolling through Netflix. A lot of people are chilling on games. ""People say we can't complain, we're getting paid, which is very true, but at the same time it's like why would they set us up doing this if we're just sat around waiting."" Contact tracing for coronavirus began when the UK identified its first two cases at the end of January. But it was stopped in mid-March after England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said it was ""no longer necessary for us to identify every case"". On Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Mr Johnson over that decision, describing it as a ""huge hole in our defences"". In response, the prime minister said he was ""confident"" that England would have a track and trace operation which would allow the country to make ""progress"". Contact tracingis already being used in Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany. On Thursday, the government also announced ithad agreed a deal to make antibody tests for the virus available on the NHS. These tests check if a person has had coronavirus and would be prioritised for NHS and care workers.

"This video can not be played Johnson: ""Test, track and trace system in place in the UK by June 1"" The PM says England will have a ""world-beating"" tracing system from June, as he was accused of leaving a ""huge hole"" in the country's coronavirus defences. Boris Johnson said 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new cases a day, would be in place by 1 June. BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said it was unlikely to be a ""fully-functioning perfect system"" by then. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM over the absence of a tracing system since March. Contact tracing is a system used to slow the spread of infectious diseases like coronavirus, and is already being used in Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany. One method involves the infected person listing all the people with whom they have had prolonged and recent contact, to be tracked down by phone or email. Another uses a location-tracking mobile app, which identifies people the patient has been in contact with. The NHS contact tracing app - which iscurrently being trialled on the Isle of Wightand was initially meant to be launched across England in mid-May - will be rolled out at a later date, No 10 suggested. Northern Irelandalready has a telephone contact tracing systemin place, whilethe Scottish government is currently triallingone.The Welsh government wants its ""test, trace, protect""programme operational by the end of May. It comes as the number of people who died after testing positive for the virus increased by 363 to 35,704, the government said on Wednesday. How does contact tracing work? Multiple security flaws found in NHS virus app Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir asked why there had been ""no effective"" attempt to trace the contacts of those infected with Covid-19 since 12 March ""when tracing was abandoned"". Mr Johnson replied: ""We have growing confidence that we will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes, it will be in place by June 1."" He added that 24,000 contact tracers had already been recruited. The 1 June deadline will also mark the earliest possible date for the gradual reopening of schools and non-essential shops in England. The government's deputy chief scientific adviser Prof Dame Angela McLean previously said an effective system for tracing new coronavirus cases needed to be in place before lockdown restrictions could be changed. Do not expect a fully-functioning perfect track-and-trace system to be up-and-running by 1 June. What will be launched will effectively be a prototype. The app may not be ready by that point, but the army of contract tracers will be available. Given where we are today (and plenty argue mistakes have been made, which means we are in a weaker position than we should be) this is perhaps understandable. The government does not have the luxury of testing and piloting this behind the scenes for months to come. So, the system will have to evolve as it goes. The question is whether it will be robust enough to provide a track-and-trace service that will work on a basic level and help contain local outbreaks, which of course is vital as we gradually move out of lockdown. The prime minister's assertion that it will be able to deal with 10,000 new cases a day is interesting. It sounds a lot. The daily figures suggest there are only a few thousand positive cases a day. But remember those figures have not been capturing all the infections - until this week when testing was extended to all over-fives eligibility was quite restricted. However, surveillance data provided by the Office for National Statistics suggests we may well be seeing around that number. The work that has been done so far is about to be put to the test. LOUIS THEROUX:The 15 songs getting him through lockdown FAKE-AWAY:The best fast food recipes you can make at home The PM also insisted that the UK was now testing more than ""virtually every country in Europe"", and promised that the system would be stepped up in the next fortnight. Leading scientist Prof Hugh Pennington said the pledge was ""good news"" as it was ""essential if we're going to go anywhere near getting out of lockdown, opening schools"". ""It's taken a long time. As to world-beating, well we've been beaten by quite a few other countries by having such a system running."" He added that contact tracing was ""really very labour-intensive work"". This video can not be played The PM promised 200,000 tests in the UK, after he was challenged by Sir Keir Starmer over care home testing. Also at PMQs, Sir Keir queried whether people were being tested in care homes, after the boss of a body representing care homes in England said on Tuesday thatthere were problems. Mr Johnson said 125,000 care home staff have been tested and that the government was ""absolutely confident"" it would be able to increase testing in care homes and ""across the whole of the community"". He added: ""And thanks to the hard work of [Health Secretary Matt Hancock] and his teams, we will get up to 200,000 tests in the country by the end of this month.""

"Time is running out to finalise a test, track and trace strategy to avoid a possible second surge in coronavirus cases, NHS bosses have said. The NHS Confederation warned of ""severe"" consequences to staff and patients if the right system was not established quickly. It said lockdown measures should not be eased until a clear plan was in place. It follows the PM's pledge to introducea ""world-beating"" contact tracing systemin England from June. Contact tracingidentifies those who may have come into contact with an infected person - either through an app or by phone and email - so they can avoid potentially passing the disease on. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the confederation, which represents health and care leaders, welcomed Boris Johnson's pledge made at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. But in aletter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock,external, Mr Dickson said without a clear strategy the UK was at greater risk of a second peak of the virus and emphasised the importance of involving local health organisations in the plan. He said a test, track and trace strategy should have been in place sooner and if the right system was not instigated rapidly the ramifications for the NHS ""could be severe"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Dickson said: ""We are absolutely clear that contact tracing is the right thing to do, it is absolutely critical, it has got to be in place to prevent any notion of a second surge if the lockdown is being further released."" He added the government was acting ""quite late in the day [and] we haven't yet seen the detail"". How will contact tracing work in the UK? Track and trace system in place from June - PM Multiple security flaws found in NHS virus app Meanwhile, a further 338 people have died of coronavirus in the UK as of 17:00 BST on Wednesday, the Department of Health said, taking the total to 36,042. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - a membership group for England's NHS trusts - told BBC Breakfast his members have ""not had clear information and instructions about what their role will be"" in the system. Security minister James Brokenshire said Mr Hopson's comments ""will not be lost on anyone"" at the Department of Health - and will be followed up on ""at pace"". Downing Street has confirmed that 24,000 manual contact tracers have been hired, with plans to employ an additional 1,000 people before the test, track and trace scheme starts on 1 June. The prime minister's official spokesman said ""test and trace"" would start shortly. This video can not be played Johnson: ""Test, track and trace system in place in the UK by June 1"" On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new cases a day, would be in place by 1 June. It coincides with the earliest possible date for the gradual reopening of schools and non-essential shops in England. Northern Irelandalready has a telephone contact tracing systemin place, while the Scottish government iscurrently trialling one. The Welsh government wantsits programmeoperational by the end of May. One of the government's most senior scientific advisers previously said an effective tracing system needed to be in place before lockdown restrictions could be changed. What this letter indicates is that, for all the rhetoric, the NHS Confederation does not yet believe that the government has a robust plan for virus testing and tracking of contacts of those who are infected. And that comes even after the prime minister's statement that such a programme will be in place by 1 June with 25,000 contact tracers appointed. A widespread testing and tracing system is seen as a necessity if lockdown restrictions are to be further eased, including the reopening of schools. The confederation, which represents health leaders and organisations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, does welcome Mr Johnson's commitment to a testing and tracing programme. But tellingly it notes that its members are not yet reassured, and that if there is not rapid action there could be a second wave of infections and serious consequences for NHS patients and staff. Mr Brokenshire said the contact tracing system will be in place on 1 June - with or withoutan NHS tracing appwhich will be rolled out ""in the coming weeks"". The University of Nottingham's Prof Keith Neal said the app would be most useful if people were out in public at places such as supermarkets. ""That's where the app comes in because it will allow later on to identify who you've been in contact with but don't know their name or phone number,"" he said. ""We can do contact tracing even without the app because that is a matter of finding the most high-risk contacts in close and prolonged contact, and you tend to only have close and prolonged contact with people you actually know."" The anonymous contact tracer says he and around ""90 odd people"" had online training for the role One newly-hired contact tracer, a graduate who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC at the moment ""it's not very productive at all"". He applied for a job as a ""work at home customer service agent"", he says - ""nothing to do with the NHS"". A few days later he passed the application process and joined an online training session. ""Whenever we asked questions he would try but the main answer was 'wait for the coming days, you'll get an email or something',"" he says. He adds the work is ""quite boring"" as ""we're just kind of sat there doing absolutely nothing for the majority of the day"". ""Right now, I'm just sat scrolling through Netflix. A lot of people are chilling on games. ""People say we can't complain, we're getting paid, which is very true, but at the same time it's like why would they set us up doing this if we're just sat around waiting."" Contact tracing for coronavirus began when the UK identified its first two cases at the end of January. But it was stopped in mid-March after England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said it was ""no longer necessary for us to identify every case"". On Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Mr Johnson over that decision, describing it as a ""huge hole in our defences"". In response, the prime minister said he was ""confident"" that England would have a track and trace operation which would allow the country to make ""progress"". Contact tracingis already being used in Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany. On Thursday, the government also announced ithad agreed a deal to make antibody tests for the virus available on the NHS. These tests check if a person has had coronavirus and would be prioritised for NHS and care workers.

The Stud,external, which has been around since 1966, will host a ""drag funeral"" for the bar on 31 May, according to owner Honey Mahogany. In mid-March, San Francisco became one of the first US cities to order residents to ""shelter in place"" to control the spread of the pandemic. As the summer holiday period approaches, many of us in the UK might be wondering when we can enjoy a getaway - at home or abroad. At the moment,the chances of going on a foreign holiday look unlikely.That's because Brits are being advised not to take any non-essential travel abroad, and various countries have restrictions which stop or limit foreign visitors. The UK is expected to introducea 14-day quarantine periodin early June for visitors and UK residents returning home from abroad, making things more complicated. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has suggested that""air bridges"" could be introduced, meaning travellers from countries with low infection rates could be exempt from quarantine. But this remains uncertain. As for a domestic getaway, people in England are free to drive any distance to other destinations in England, like parks and beaches, but they are not supposed to stay overnight away from home (including in any second property they own). Self-catering cottages, Airbnb properties, and UK campsites, hotels and holiday parks will remain shut until at least the beginning of July. This video can not be played The latest figures from Johns Hopkins University show that 1.9 million people have recovered from the virus, but the time it takes to recover can vary. Most people with Covid-19 will only develop mild symptoms, which usually take a week to recover from, maybe longer. But in more serious cases, it could take months, or even more than a year, to get fully better. BBC health correspondent Laura Foster explains recovery times and what you can do to help others. A member of the UK governmentâs scientific advisory group, known as SAGE, has told the BBC he would have liked the government to have acted earlier in the fight against coronavirus. Sir Ian Boyd, a professor of biology at St Andrews University, toldthe Coronavirus Newscast: âI would have loved to have seen us acting a week or two weeks earlier and it would have made quite a big difference to the steepness of the curve of infection and therefore the death rate."" He suggested that the government based its initial assessment on the transmissibility of the SARS virus, which is less infectious than this coronavirus. He described the UK and other European countries as âa bit slower off the markâ and less prepared than countries that had experienced SARS in the early 2000s. ""I think some politicians would have loved to have reacted earlier but in their political opinion it probably wasnât feasible because people wouldnât have perhaps responded in the way they eventually did,"" he said. Professor Boyd, who was the chief scientific adviser at the environment department from 2012-19, also called on ministers to stop saying they were âledâ by the science as it was ""slightly misleading"". The couple's daughter superimposed her parents on to various locations on their holiday itinerary British couple Ed and Barbara Higgins, from Norfolk, England, had been due to fly to New York to celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary - and sail back on a luxury cruise ship. But the pandemic put a stop to their plans, like those of many others. Their family though did not want them to miss out so, as theEDP reports,external, they sent an itinerary, online tours, special dinners and mocked-up photos. The couple saidtheir virtual triphad ""brought tears of joy to our eyes"". Barbara and Ed Higgins should have been on the cruise ship in person Lucy WilliamsonBBC's Paris Correspondent A teacher in Nantes, west France, and her pupils wear masks after their school reopened The French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, has told the BBC that poorer children are not returning to school as much as those from wealthier families. He said that reopening schools was a âsocial emergencyâ, and that the lockdown had increased inequality in France.  But so far, only 20% of primary school pupils have returned. ""Itâs true that children of poor families are coming less than the others,â Mr Blanquer said. âThatâs why it was important to start in May not in June, because we know that itâs [a] step-by-step [process].â Last week, France reopened 40,000 primary and nursery schools, and pupils returned to some middle schools on Monday. Itâs a voluntary process so far â a decision criticised by one mayor, who said it made things difficult for parents: âIf they send [their children] to school and they get sick, theyâll feel guilty; if they keep them home and they fall behind, theyâll feel guilty. If you govern, you need to take the decision.â The education ministry has issued 56 pages of detailed instructions to schools on how to keep premises clean and pupils safe, in the hope of building trust with parents. There must be no more than 15 children in a class, no shared toys, and arrivals at the school must be timed. Older children must also wear masks. There is so much thatâs compulsory for schools, some say, while the attendance is not.

The season begins in June and international charter flights to popular locations will resume in July, according to the country's prime minster. Greece has been praised for its handling of the pandemic. It has recorded 166 deaths and 2,850 confirmed cases. But how easy will it be for tourists to enter Greece for their holidays? The BBC's Quentin Sommervillearrived in Athens airportto see how things are working at the moment. More on that new data which emerged at today's Downing Street briefing suggesting about one in six Londoners and one in 20 people elsewhere in England have had coronavirus. How did those figures come about? Public Health England says it is carrying out a range of seroprevalence studies - where they measure antibodies in the blood of healthy people - to better understand past rates of infection across the population. In this case, they took 1,000 samples between mid-April and early May from each region. From this, they say they could make a crude estimate that between 4.5% and 13% of the population have coronavirus antibodies. With further statistical adjustments, they found about 17% of London adults had been infected; this compares to only 4.3% in the north-east of England. As antibodies can take up to four weeks to develop, it is likely that the level outside London will increase as more samples are tested in the coming weeks. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at Public Health England, said: âEarly surveillance suggests that rates of infection were higher in London than the rest of the country â which is consistent with data collected through our other systems. ""London was affected earlier and our data suggests that more of the London population became infected before the lockdown took effect."" ""I think I look better in the mask,"" Trump said. President Trump is touring a US auto plant that has been converted to make ventilators to fight Covid-19. Speaking to reporters, he held up a mask and said he wore one during his tour, but is now standing in an area where is it not required. Earlier this week, a Ford company spokesperson said he would be required to do so, but he has so far never been pictured wearing one. ""I wore one in this back area but I didn't want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,"" said Trump, adding that he wore goggles as well. ""I was tested this morning, so it's not necessary,"" he continued. Asked why the car executives accompanying him are still wearing theirs, he said: ""That's their choice."" The pool reporter travelling with Trump asked the Ford executive if he can confirm that Trump was told he did not require a mask in that part of the factory. The executive shrugged and said, ""It's up to him"".

Years later a photo of him appeared in Michelle Obama's memoir Becoming after he had risen to the rank of maÃ®tre d'. His more than five decades of service have been studied by historians of African-Americans in politics. Like other African-American men of his generation, says Ohio State Universityâs Koritha Mitchell, author of From Slave Cabins to the White House, he showed dignity while serving in one of the few positions that was available to him at the time. She believes that he must have found it satisfying to end his career in the way that he did.

He is one of the most feared men in Russia, says our Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg. The authoritarian leader of Russia's Chechnya region previously fought against Moscow as a Chechen nationalist but is now a key ally of President Vladimir Putin. He is the latest latest high-profile Russian official to show symptoms of the virus. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin only returned to work in the last few days after being treated in hospital for Covid-19. Russia has the second largest number of infections worldwide. Earlier, at the UK government's daily briefing, we heard news of a study which suggests that 17% of people in London and around 5% of the rest of the nation have virus antibodies. The new data comes as the government agreed a deal with a large pharmaceutical firm for more than 10 million antibody tests, to see if people have had the virus. The first in line for them will be health and social care staff, patients and care home residents. It's still unclear what level of immunity people develop once they have had it, but some experts hope a degree of immunity would last a year or two. However, there is no guarantee that having antibodies means a person will not pass the virus on to somebody else. At the briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said certificates were being looked at for people who test positive for coronavirus antibodies. ""It's not just about the clinical advances that these tests can bring,"" he said. ""It's that knowing that you have these antibodies will help us to understand more in the future if you are at lower risk of catching coronavirus, of dying from coronavirus and of transmitting coronavirus.""

policy for screening people. But as we come out â and we try to get people
flying again â we need some consistency,"" he told the BBC. ""Weâre calling on the UK government to
work with other governments like the US and EU to establish a common
international standard, so when youâre travelling youâre confident youâll be
accepted into the country youâre going to, and will be kept safe on your
journey. ""And I think itâs important that the screen takes place at the
airport on departure, rather than at your destination, because you donât want to
run the gauntlet of not knowing if youâll be quarantined or turned around at
your destination.â Russia's emergencies ministry sent disinfection equipment to crisis-hit Dagestan Exams for Russia's final-year secondary school students will go ahead in June, President Vladimir Putin has announced. Students will be given masks, gloves and other protective equipment in the exam rooms. The exams were originally supposed to take place on 25 May but the education ministry postponed them. Now, citing a ""decrease in coronavirus cases"", Putin told officials the exams would happen on 29 June. Russia has more than 317,000 cases of coronavirus, the second-highest number in the world.Dagestan, in southern Russia, is said to be experiencing a ""catastrophe"". Trump speaks before departing for Michigan US President Donald Trump has just spoken to reporters on his way to tour an automotive plant in Michigan. He says that he took a coronavirus test today, which came back ""positively toward negative"". He said: ""I tested very positively in another sense.

"This video can not be played Cyclone Amphan causes havoc in India and Bangladesh The eastern Indian city of Kolkata has been devastated by a powerful cyclone which has killed at least 84 people across India and Bangladesh. Amphan made landfall on Wednesday, lashing coastal areas with ferocious wind and rain. The storm is weakening as it moves north into Bhutan. Thousands of trees were uprooted in the gales, electricity and telephone lines brought down and houses flattened. Many of Kolkata's roads are flooded and its 14 million people without power. Most of those who died were hit by falling trees or debris The storm is the first super cyclone to form in the Bay of Bengal since 1999. Though its winds had weakened by the time it struck, it was still classified as a very severe cyclone. Coronavirus restrictions have been hindering emergency and relief efforts. Covid-19 and social-distancing measures made mass evacuations more difficult, with shelters unable to be used to full capacity. Bay of Bengal: world hotbed of tropical cyclones When extreme weather and Covid-19 collide Amphan began hitting the Sundarbans, a mangrove area around the India-Bangladesh border home to four million people on Wednesday afternoon, before carving north and north-eastwards towards Kolkata, a historic city that was the capital of the British Raj and widely known as Calcutta. Parts of West Bengal and Orissa (also known as Odisha) states in India, and areas in south-west Bangladesh, bore the brunt, with winds gusting up to 185km/h (115mph). At least 72 people have died in India's West Bengal state, and 12 deaths have been confirmed in Bangladesh. West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said the devastation in Kolkata, the state capital, was ""a bigger disaster than Covid-19"". ""Area after area has been ruined,"" Ms Banerjee was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency. ""I have experienced a war-like situation today."" How cyclones get their names What is a cyclone? Three districts in West Bengal - South and North 24 Parganas and East Midnapore - were very badly hit. In Bangladesh, there are reports of tens of thousands of homes damaged or destroyed and many villages submerged by storm surges in low-lying coastal areas like Khulna and Satkhira. The authorities evacuated nearly 2.5 million people ahead of the cyclone. Initial assessments of the damage are being hampered by blocked roads and flooding in all these areas. By Shamik Bag, Kolkata On one of Kolkata's oldest streets, Rabindra Sarani, special prayers are being offered at the Kumartuli Sai Baba temple. Nobody died yesterday, a local says. A giant banyan tree has fallen, bringing down a small Shiva temple with it. While human casualties in have been low, the uprooted tree and temple are a reminder that gods or prayers couldn't halt the riotous run of the fierce Cyclone Amphan. The conjunction of the two disasters - Covid-19 and Cyclone Amphan - and the challenging recovery effort facing administrators is highlighted by a narrow lane at a crossing point in the city. Its entrance is blocked as it's a Covid hotspot and containment zone but it is also immersed in flood waters which came with the cyclone. Near the gates of the esteemed Presidency College, I spy the unique sight of a small catfish being preyed upon by a street dog. The catfish must have come with the floods but couldn't make it back home when the waters receded. The fish still has life and its sharp flailing about manages to keep the dog curious and a little intimidated too.

India's weather department had predicted storm surges as high as 10-16 feet (3-5 metres) from Amphan. The rising of sea levels in this way can send deadly walls of water barrelling far inland, devastating communities. The total level of devastation in Bangladesh remains to be assessed but it's clear that there has been widespread destruction in areas that were in the path of the storm. In the city of Khulna, north of the Sundarbans,at least 83,000 homes were either destroyed or damaged, the Dhaka Tribune reports.,external Fewer people appear to have been killed than in India but the government fears about $1.5bn worth of damages, the newspaper says.

People are being urged to avoid travelling to Exmoor over the bank holiday weekend, even if they feel tempted to enjoy the great sunny outdoors. Sarah Bryan, chief executive of Exmoor National Park, said: ""Thoughtless behaviour such as lighting BBQs, illicit overnight stays and unnecessary risk-taking add to the pressure on our local services.""

"This video can not be played Mark Zuckerberg told the BBC's Simon Jack that Facebook would 'take down' coronavirus misinformation Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has told the BBC that it had and would remove any content likely to result in ""immediate and imminent harm"" to users. ""Even if something isn't going to lead to imminent physical harm, we don't want misinformation to be the content that is going viral,"" he said. It removed Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's claim that scientists had ""proved"" there was a coronavirus cure. This was removed because it was ""obviously"" not true, he said. He also said that Facebook had removed content from groups claiming that the rollout of the 5G digital network was a cause of the spread of the virus and in some cases encouraged those who believed that to damage the networks physical infrastructure. Facebook recently removed content from former broadcaster and conspiracy theorist David Icke for ""repeatedly violating our policies on harmful misinformation"". Mr Icke had suggested that 5G mobile phone networks are linked to the spread of the virus and in another video he suggested a Jewish group was behind the virus. Mr Zuckerberg said: ""We work with independent fact checkers. Since the Covid outbreak, they have issued 7,500 notices of misinformation which has led to us issuing 50 million warning labels on posts. ""We know these are effective because 95% of the time, users don't click through to the content with a warning label."" However, Facebook has insisted that unless there was the prospect of real imminent harm, then the company would and should allow what he called the ""widest possible aperture"" for freedom of expression on the internet. He also told the BBC that preventing electoral interference is an ""arms race"" against countries such as Russia, Iran and China. He admitted that the firm was ""behind"" in the 2016 US presidential election. In his first UK broadcast interview in five years, he said that Facebook had been unprepared for state-sponsored interference in 2016. But he added the company was confident it had since learnt its lessons. Facebook was previously embroiled in a political scandal in which tens of millions of its users' data ended up in the hands of political interest groups including Cambridge Analytica. However, he said the social media giant, which also owns Whatsapp and Instagram, was now better prepared than other companies, and even governments, to prevent future attempts to influence political outcomes. In-app shops launched on Facebook and Instagram Facebook and Google extend working from home ""Countries are going to continue to try and interfere and we are going to see issues like that but we have learnt a lot since 2016 and I feel pretty confident that we are going to be able to protect the integrity of the upcoming election"". Mr Zuckerberg also defended his level of personal control over arguably the world's most powerful media platforms. Although Facebook is a public company worth nearly $700bn (Â£574bn), he ultimately exerts total individual control thanks to an ownership structure that gives him a controlling interest even though he owns a small fraction of the shares. He said it had allowed Facebook to make longer-term strategic decisions which have proved to be correct such as waiting to improve the Facebook experience before launching it on smartphones and not selling out early to rivals. ""If it had been different then we would have sold out to Yahoo years ago and who knows what would have happened then. "" Yahoo is now worth 1/20th as much as Facebook. Facebook continues to face criticism over its reluctance to describe or define itself as a publisher and thus embrace the kind of editorial responsibility that newspapers and traditional broadcasters are legally bound by. However, it would be hard to argue that Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram have not provided billions of people with the kind of connectivity with friends and family that has been important during this global pandemic and the consequent restrictions on movement and freedom. In fact, after many years of courting controversy and opprobrium, it seems clear that Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg are feeling more confident about their public roles. If there are any winners out of this public health emergency, digital companies like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon are among them. However, no one is totally immune to the deep downturn that is already upon us and the evidence for which is confirmed with every new economic release. Facebook knows that and is one of the reasons it is keen to help small businesses online through this week's launch of a service called Facebook Shops. It's a mutually beneficial exchange.

"This video can not be played 'There is no blueprint' - IOC President Thomas Bach talks to BBC sports editor Dan Roan about rescheduling the 2020 Olympic Games International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach says he understands why the rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Games would have to be cancelled if it cannot take place next summer. Local organisers have said they have no back-up plan after the event waspostponed by a year because of the coronavirus crisis. ""You cannot forever employ 3,000 to 5,000 people in an organising committee,"" Bach told BBC Sport. ""You cannot have the athletes being in uncertainty."" In a wide-ranging interview, Bach also: admitted the job of re-organising the Games was ""a mammoth task"" warned that the event would ""definitely be different"" with a focus on ""essentials"" would not be drawn on whether a vaccine for Covid-19 would be needed for the event to take place insisted staging the Games behind closed doors was ""not what we want"", but he needs more time to consider whether that was feasible Bach said he hoped the first ever postponed Games, which are due to take place from 23 July to 8 August 2021, could prove ""unique"" and send ""a message of solidarity among the entire world, coming for the first time together again, and celebrating the triumph over coronavirus"". ""There is no blueprint for it so we have to reinvent the wheel day by day. It's very challenging and at the same time fascinating."" 2020 Olympics will be 'scrapped' instead of delayed again, says Games chief Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has admitted it may be ""difficult"" to stage the Games if the country does not successfully contain the virus, and the head of the Japan Medical Association has suggested it depends on finding a vaccine. When asked directly if he agreed, Bach said: ""For this question, we are relying on the advice of the World Health Organisation. ""We have established one principle: to organise these Games in a safe environment for all the participants. Nobody knows what the world will look like in one year, in two months. ""So we have to rely on [experts] and then take the appropriate decision at the appropriate time based on this advice."" The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics are due to take place in China just six months after the Tokyo Games, and Bach said that Prime Minister Abe had made it clear to him that, as far as Japan was concerned, next summer was ""the last option"". ""Quite frankly, I have some understanding for this, because you cannot forever employ 3,000, or 5,000, people in an Organising Committee,"" said Bach. ""You cannot every year change the entire sports schedule worldwide of all the major federations. You cannot have the athletes being in uncertainty. ""You cannot have so much overlapping with a future Olympic Games, so I have some understanding for this approach by our Japanese partners."" When asked how confident he was that the Games would go ahead, Bach said: ""We have to be prepared for different scenarios. There is the clear commitment to having these games in July next year. ""At the same time, looking at the scenarios this may require towards the organisation, with regard to health measures, these maybe need quarantine for the athletes, for part of the athletes, for other participants. ""What could this mean for the life in an Olympic Village and so on? All these different scenarios are under consideration and this is why I'm saying it's a mammoth task, because there are so many different options that it's not easy to address them [now]. When we have a clear view on how the world will look on 23 July, 2021, then [we will] take the appropriate decisions."" The director general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said it is possible but ""not easy"" for 11,000 athletes from more than 200 teams to come together in Tokyo. Japan has recorded more than 17,100 cases and 797 deaths from the pandemic, but the numbers of infections are falling sharply and it has been affected far less than some other countries. IOC president Thomas Bach was speaking to the BBC in his first broadcast interview since Tokyo postponement If social distancing restrictions are still in force in Japan next summer, some have suggested the Games may have to be staged behind closed doors. Bach said such a scenario remained ""speculation"". ""This is not what we want,"" he said. ""Because the Olympic spirit is about also uniting the fans and this is what makes the Games so unique that they're in an Olympic Stadium, all the fans from all over the world are together. ""But when it then would come to the decision... I would ask you to give me some more time for consultation with the athletes, with the World Health Organisation, with the Japanese partners."" The IOC has set aside $800m (Â£654m) to help with the financial impact caused by the postponement of Tokyo 2020. The total additional cost to Japan has been estimated at between two and six billion dollars. But Bach said there would also have to be cutbacks to the Games. ""They will definitely be different, and they have to be different,"" he said. ""If we all have learned something during this crisis, [it is] to look to the essentials and not so much on the nice-to-have things. ""So this concentration on the essentials should be reflected in the organisation of these Games... there should be no taboo."" Two months ago, Bach faced unprecedented criticism from athletes for not postponing the Games earlier. ""The developments were so fast that you could not know what would happen tomorrow,"" he said when asked if he would do anything differently now. 'To find the balance between the more optimistic experts, saying, 'wait, you still have time. It's still some months away. Let's see how it goes', and the others saying, 'this will be a total disaster - why don't you take this decision right now?' This was the challenge every day. ""And this had to be done in consultation with our Japanese partners, because we could have cancelled the Games alone, without them, and that would have been an easy decision in one way. ""We could have said, 'OK, this is it.' We would have got our money being paid by insurance. And we could have started to prepare for Paris [2024 Games]. But this was not a real option because this would have deprived the athletes of this unique Olympic experience."" Bach said he was ""happy"" last weekend to see the Bundesliga resume in his native Germany, even though fans were not present. ""I wish that now all the other sports are coming back,"" he said. ""On the other hand, I was a little bit feeling for the players, how strange it must be for them, playing in these huge stadiums... ""So I hope now that is the first step. Sport has to respect the rules, like any other organisation and area of society. But that slowly, we can come back and then maybe lift these restrictions in a responsible way."" Bach appealed to governments around the world to do what they can to help sports deal with the financial crisis caused by the pandemic. ""There is, first of all, the contribution of sport to health, and everybody realises that we must concentrate more on health in in the in the future,"" he said. ""Secondly, sport makes the great contribution to the inclusivity of society... sport is the best glue for a society. ""And thirdly, sport is also a very important economic factor. We had a study that about 3% of all the jobs being offered in Europe are sports-related. ""And this is why we are urging the governments to honour and to acknowledge the role of sport, and to include them in their recovery programmes.""

"Time is running out to finalise a test, track and trace strategy to avoid a possible second surge in coronavirus cases, NHS bosses have said. The NHS Confederation warned of ""severe"" consequences to staff and patients if the right system was not established quickly. It said lockdown measures should not be eased until a clear plan was in place. It follows the PM's pledge to introducea ""world-beating"" contact tracing systemin England from June. Contact tracingidentifies those who may have come into contact with an infected person - either through an app or by phone and email - so they can avoid potentially passing the disease on. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the confederation, which represents health and care leaders, welcomed Boris Johnson's pledge made at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday. But in aletter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock,external, Mr Dickson said without a clear strategy the UK was at greater risk of a second peak of the virus and emphasised the importance of involving local health organisations in the plan. He said a test, track and trace strategy should have been in place sooner and if the right system was not instigated rapidly the ramifications for the NHS ""could be severe"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Dickson said: ""We are absolutely clear that contact tracing is the right thing to do, it is absolutely critical, it has got to be in place to prevent any notion of a second surge if the lockdown is being further released."" He added the government was acting ""quite late in the day [and] we haven't yet seen the detail"". How will contact tracing work in the UK? Track and trace system in place from June - PM Multiple security flaws found in NHS virus app Meanwhile, a further 338 people have died of coronavirus in the UK as of 17:00 BST on Wednesday, the Department of Health said, taking the total to 36,042. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - a membership group for England's NHS trusts - told BBC Breakfast his members have ""not had clear information and instructions about what their role will be"" in the system. Security minister James Brokenshire said Mr Hopson's comments ""will not be lost on anyone"" at the Department of Health - and will be followed up on ""at pace"". Downing Street has confirmed that 24,000 manual contact tracers have been hired, with plans to employ an additional 1,000 people before the test, track and trace scheme starts on 1 June. The prime minister's official spokesman said ""test and trace"" would start shortly. This video can not be played Johnson: ""Test, track and trace system in place in the UK by June 1"" On Wednesday, Mr Johnson said 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new cases a day, would be in place by 1 June. It coincides with the earliest possible date for the gradual reopening of schools and non-essential shops in England. Northern Irelandalready has a telephone contact tracing systemin place, while the Scottish government iscurrently trialling one. The Welsh government wantsits programmeoperational by the end of May. One of the government's most senior scientific advisers previously said an effective tracing system needed to be in place before lockdown restrictions could be changed. What this letter indicates is that, for all the rhetoric, the NHS Confederation does not yet believe that the government has a robust plan for virus testing and tracking of contacts of those who are infected. And that comes even after the prime minister's statement that such a programme will be in place by 1 June with 25,000 contact tracers appointed. A widespread testing and tracing system is seen as a necessity if lockdown restrictions are to be further eased, including the reopening of schools. The confederation, which represents health leaders and organisations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, does welcome Mr Johnson's commitment to a testing and tracing programme. But tellingly it notes that its members are not yet reassured, and that if there is not rapid action there could be a second wave of infections and serious consequences for NHS patients and staff. Mr Brokenshire said the contact tracing system will be in place on 1 June - with or withoutan NHS tracing appwhich will be rolled out ""in the coming weeks"". The University of Nottingham's Prof Keith Neal said the app would be most useful if people were out in public at places such as supermarkets. ""That's where the app comes in because it will allow later on to identify who you've been in contact with but don't know their name or phone number,"" he said. ""We can do contact tracing even without the app because that is a matter of finding the most high-risk contacts in close and prolonged contact, and you tend to only have close and prolonged contact with people you actually know."" The anonymous contact tracer says he and around ""90 odd people"" had online training for the role One newly-hired contact tracer, a graduate who wished to remain anonymous, told the BBC at the moment ""it's not very productive at all"". He applied for a job as a ""work at home customer service agent"", he says - ""nothing to do with the NHS"". A few days later he passed the application process and joined an online training session. ""Whenever we asked questions he would try but the main answer was 'wait for the coming days, you'll get an email or something',"" he says. He adds the work is ""quite boring"" as ""we're just kind of sat there doing absolutely nothing for the majority of the day"". ""Right now, I'm just sat scrolling through Netflix. A lot of people are chilling on games. ""People say we can't complain, we're getting paid, which is very true, but at the same time it's like why would they set us up doing this if we're just sat around waiting."" Contact tracing for coronavirus began when the UK identified its first two cases at the end of January. But it was stopped in mid-March after England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said it was ""no longer necessary for us to identify every case"". On Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged Mr Johnson over that decision, describing it as a ""huge hole in our defences"". In response, the prime minister said he was ""confident"" that England would have a track and trace operation which would allow the country to make ""progress"". Contact tracingis already being used in Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany. On Thursday, the government also announced ithad agreed a deal to make antibody tests for the virus available on the NHS. These tests check if a person has had coronavirus and would be prioritised for NHS and care workers.

"This video can not be played 'There is no blueprint' - IOC President Thomas Bach talks to BBC sports editor Dan Roan about rescheduling the 2020 Olympic Games International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach says he understands why the rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Games would have to be cancelled if it cannot take place next summer. Local organisers have said they have no back-up plan after the event waspostponed by a year because of the coronavirus crisis. ""You cannot forever employ 3,000 to 5,000 people in an organising committee,"" Bach told BBC Sport. ""You cannot have the athletes being in uncertainty."" In a wide-ranging interview, Bach also: admitted the job of re-organising the Games was ""a mammoth task"" warned that the event would ""definitely be different"" with a focus on ""essentials"" would not be drawn on whether a vaccine for Covid-19 would be needed for the event to take place insisted staging the Games behind closed doors was ""not what we want"", but he needs more time to consider whether that was feasible Bach said he hoped the first ever postponed Games, which are due to take place from 23 July to 8 August 2021, could prove ""unique"" and send ""a message of solidarity among the entire world, coming for the first time together again, and celebrating the triumph over coronavirus"". ""There is no blueprint for it so we have to reinvent the wheel day by day. It's very challenging and at the same time fascinating."" 2020 Olympics will be 'scrapped' instead of delayed again, says Games chief Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has admitted it may be ""difficult"" to stage the Games if the country does not successfully contain the virus, and the head of the Japan Medical Association has suggested it depends on finding a vaccine. When asked directly if he agreed, Bach said: ""For this question, we are relying on the advice of the World Health Organisation. ""We have established one principle: to organise these Games in a safe environment for all the participants. Nobody knows what the world will look like in one year, in two months. ""So we have to rely on [experts] and then take the appropriate decision at the appropriate time based on this advice."" The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics are due to take place in China just six months after the Tokyo Games, and Bach said that Prime Minister Abe had made it clear to him that, as far as Japan was concerned, next summer was ""the last option"". ""Quite frankly, I have some understanding for this, because you cannot forever employ 3,000, or 5,000, people in an Organising Committee,"" said Bach. ""You cannot every year change the entire sports schedule worldwide of all the major federations. You cannot have the athletes being in uncertainty. ""You cannot have so much overlapping with a future Olympic Games, so I have some understanding for this approach by our Japanese partners."" When asked how confident he was that the Games would go ahead, Bach said: ""We have to be prepared for different scenarios. There is the clear commitment to having these games in July next year. ""At the same time, looking at the scenarios this may require towards the organisation, with regard to health measures, these maybe need quarantine for the athletes, for part of the athletes, for other participants. ""What could this mean for the life in an Olympic Village and so on? All these different scenarios are under consideration and this is why I'm saying it's a mammoth task, because there are so many different options that it's not easy to address them [now]. When we have a clear view on how the world will look on 23 July, 2021, then [we will] take the appropriate decisions."" The director general of the World Health Organisation (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said it is possible but ""not easy"" for 11,000 athletes from more than 200 teams to come together in Tokyo. Japan has recorded more than 17,100 cases and 797 deaths from the pandemic, but the numbers of infections are falling sharply and it has been affected far less than some other countries. IOC president Thomas Bach was speaking to the BBC in his first broadcast interview since Tokyo postponement If social distancing restrictions are still in force in Japan next summer, some have suggested the Games may have to be staged behind closed doors. Bach said such a scenario remained ""speculation"". ""This is not what we want,"" he said. ""Because the Olympic spirit is about also uniting the fans and this is what makes the Games so unique that they're in an Olympic Stadium, all the fans from all over the world are together. ""But when it then would come to the decision... I would ask you to give me some more time for consultation with the athletes, with the World Health Organisation, with the Japanese partners."" The IOC has set aside $800m (Â£654m) to help with the financial impact caused by the postponement of Tokyo 2020. The total additional cost to Japan has been estimated at between two and six billion dollars. But Bach said there would also have to be cutbacks to the Games. ""They will definitely be different, and they have to be different,"" he said. ""If we all have learned something during this crisis, [it is] to look to the essentials and not so much on the nice-to-have things. ""So this concentration on the essentials should be reflected in the organisation of these Games... there should be no taboo."" Two months ago, Bach faced unprecedented criticism from athletes for not postponing the Games earlier. ""The developments were so fast that you could not know what would happen tomorrow,"" he said when asked if he would do anything differently now. 'To find the balance between the more optimistic experts, saying, 'wait, you still have time. It's still some months away. Let's see how it goes', and the others saying, 'this will be a total disaster - why don't you take this decision right now?' This was the challenge every day. ""And this had to be done in consultation with our Japanese partners, because we could have cancelled the Games alone, without them, and that would have been an easy decision in one way. ""We could have said, 'OK, this is it.' We would have got our money being paid by insurance. And we could have started to prepare for Paris [2024 Games]. But this was not a real option because this would have deprived the athletes of this unique Olympic experience."" Bach said he was ""happy"" last weekend to see the Bundesliga resume in his native Germany, even though fans were not present. ""I wish that now all the other sports are coming back,"" he said. ""On the other hand, I was a little bit feeling for the players, how strange it must be for them, playing in these huge stadiums... ""So I hope now that is the first step. Sport has to respect the rules, like any other organisation and area of society. But that slowly, we can come back and then maybe lift these restrictions in a responsible way."" Bach appealed to governments around the world to do what they can to help sports deal with the financial crisis caused by the pandemic. ""There is, first of all, the contribution of sport to health, and everybody realises that we must concentrate more on health in in the in the future,"" he said. ""Secondly, sport makes the great contribution to the inclusivity of society... sport is the best glue for a society. ""And thirdly, sport is also a very important economic factor. We had a study that about 3% of all the jobs being offered in Europe are sports-related. ""And this is why we are urging the governments to honour and to acknowledge the role of sport, and to include them in their recovery programmes.""

"Mr Trump repeated a debunked conspiracy theory accusing a TV host of murder A US TV host has furiously rebuked President Donald Trump for falsely suggesting her husband and co-presenter may have got away with murder. In tweets, Mr Trump has appeared to link MSNBC anchor Joe Scarborough to the death of an aide two decades ago, a conspiracy theory debunked by police. ""Donald, you're a sick person,"" anchor Mika Brzezinski said on air as she defended her husband. She also demanded Twitter take down the president's incendiary tweets. ""He's once again tweeting conspiracy theories about Joe, falsely accusing him of murder,"" Ms Brzezinski said on her MSNBC show Morning Joe on Wednesday, before addressing the president directly. She questioned how the president could subject the family of a congressional aide - who authorities said died of natural causes in Mr Scarborough's office in 2001 - to such ""BS"". ""Donald, you're a sick person,"" Ms Brzezinski said. ""You're really a cruel, sick, disgusting person."" Trump accepts Obama was born in US How conspiracy theories spread after Epstein's death QAnon: What's the truth behind a pro-Trump conspiracy theory? She said the president's tweets were merely a ploy to deflect from the Covid-19 pandemic because her husband ""speaks the truth"" about Mr Trump's ""lack of ability to handle this massive human catastrophe"". MSNBC, Ms Brzezinski and Mr Scarborough have been highly critical of the president's handling of the US coronavirus outbreak. Countrywide, cases have surpassed 1.5 million. Ms Brzezinski then turned to Twitter, saying the company should remove Mr Trump's tweets. ""You should be ashamed of yourself,"" she scolded the social media giant. It is by no means the president's first clash with the couple. In 2017, he referred to Ms Brzezinski on Twitter as ""low IQ Crazy Mika"" and claimed she had been ""bleeding badly from a face-lift"" when he saw her once near his Florida home.

On Wednesday, Mr Trump complained that his convicted former adviser Roger Stone had been treated unfairly, ""while guys like Low Ratings Psycho Joe Scarborough are allowed to walk the streets? Open Cold Case!"" Last week he tweeted: ""When will they open a Cold Case on the Psycho Joe Scarborough matter in Florida. Did he get away with murder? Some people think so. Why did he leave Congress so quietly and quickly? Isn't it obvious? What's happening now? A total nut job!"" The president first directed the baseless charge at Mr Scarborough in November 2017, suggesting he should be fired ""based on the 'unsolved mystery' that took place in Florida years ago"". However, the case the president is apparently referring to is not a cold case. Mr Scarborough is a former Republican congressman who represented a Florida district from 1995 to 2001. In July 2001, a member of his staff, 28-year-old Lori Klausutis, was found dead in the lawmaker's office in Fort Walton Beach. Mr Scarborough was in Washington DC at the time. Despite the president's suggestion of something untoward in his exit from Congress, Mr Scarborough had stepped down before Klausutis' death. Authorities determined Klausutis died after losing consciousness from an abnormal heart rhythm, before collapsing and striking her head. She had told a colleague a day earlier that she felt unwell. Police found no foul play and a medical examiner established Klausutis had suffered an acute subdural hematoma, or blood clot, ruling her death accidental. After Mr Trump's tweet about the matter on 12 May, Mr Scarborough said live on air: ""Why don't you turn off the television, and why don't you start working, OK?"" Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough are co-presenters of the Morning Joe show on MSNBC Mr Trump was the most high-profile supporter of the bogus ""birther"" theory that former President Barack Obama was born in Kenya and ineligible for the presidency. In 2016, Mr Trump suggested the father of his then-Republican presidential rival Ted Cruz had been seen with John F Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, before the president's death. His source for the claim was an unverified tabloid report. Last April, Mr Trump suggested that the noise from windmills causes cancer. Scientists have found no such health risks. The president has also shared a baseless theory that former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton were connected to last year's prison suicide of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

'To find the balance between the more optimistic experts, saying, 'wait, you still have time. It's still some months away. Let's see how it goes', and the others saying, 'this will be a total disaster - why don't you take this decision right now?' This was the challenge every day. ""And this had to be done in consultation with our Japanese partners, because we could have cancelled the Games alone, without them, and that would have been an easy decision in one way. ""We could have said, 'OK, this is it.' We would have got our money being paid by insurance. And we could have started to prepare for Paris [2024 Games]. But this was not a real option because this would have deprived the athletes of this unique Olympic experience."" Bach said he was ""happy"" last weekend to see the Bundesliga resume in his native Germany, even though fans were not present. ""I wish that now all the other sports are coming back,"" he said. ""On the other hand, I was a little bit feeling for the players, how strange it must be for them, playing in these huge stadiums... ""So I hope now that is the first step. Sport has to respect the rules, like any other organisation and area of society. But that slowly, we can come back and then maybe lift these restrictions in a responsible way."" Bach appealed to governments around the world to do what they can to help sports deal with the financial crisis caused by the pandemic. ""There is, first of all, the contribution of sport to health, and everybody realises that we must concentrate more on health in in the in the future,"" he said. ""Secondly, sport makes the great contribution to the inclusivity of society... sport is the best glue for a society. ""And thirdly, sport is also a very important economic factor. We had a study that about 3% of all the jobs being offered in Europe are sports-related. ""And this is why we are urging the governments to honour and to acknowledge the role of sport, and to include them in their recovery programmes.""

"Elie Seidman became CEO of dating app Tinder in 2017 Coronavirus has had a ""dramatic"" effect on the way people use the dating app Tinder, its boss has told BBC News, though the changes may suit plans he already had in store for the platform. The coronavirus outbreak and lockdown conditions have brought mixed fortunes to online-dating platforms like Tinder, according to its chief executive Elie Seidman. On the one hand, user engagement is up, a trend other dating apps have reported too. Tinder users made 3 billion swipes worldwide on Sunday 29 March, the most the app has ever recorded in a single day. In the UK, daily conversations rose by 12% between mid-February and the end of March. There has been a ""dramatic shift"" in behaviour metrics which are normally stable, says Mr Seidman. However, the economic impact of lockdown means people have less money to spend. This is not such good news for Tinder, which is free but relies on premium subscriptions for its revenue. âThe [US] unemployment figures are hard to see,â says Mr Seidman. âIâm very concerned about what happens economically for our society and the impact it will have on so many of our members."" Tinder has been downloaded more than 340 million times since its launch in 2012. But the vast majority of its revenues come from just 6 million subscribers who pay for the ""gold"" service. The rate at which it picked up those precious paying-users declined as lockdown struck. The companyâs data show that new sign-ups for premium membership pick up where lockdowns start to ease, says Mr Siedman. âYou can literally see the comeback on a state by state basis [in the US], as things come out and start to loosen up, as the peak crisis starts to pass.â Other platforms which offer free sign-up have noticed something similar during lockdown. âWeâve seen a surge in activity,â says Charly Lester, dating expert for The Inner Circle platform. âMatches have risen by 15% and the number of messages sent is up by 10%, but weâve also noticed less willingness to pay.â Charly Lester is dating expert for The Inner Circle Mr Siedman says you might have to wait two or three financial quarters to see the full economic impact on Tinder, as the scale of the global crisis becomes clear. The other issue that will become clear with time is whether the popularity of virtual dating, by video call, is here to stay, once physical meet-ups with strangers become more possible. Platforms like eHarmony, OKCupid and Match have reported a big rise in video dates. Tinder is planning to roll out its own video dating function in June, says Mr Seidman. The video call service will operate on a double opt-in policy, so both sides of the match would have to agree to it. It will be free and supported by a team of moderators. The changes to dating brought in by coronavirus lockdowns have merely accelerated a generational change the company was already tracking in focus groups, says Mr Seidman. The 18-year-olds joining the app now, unlike their predecessors who joined in 2012, have grown up immersed in social media apps and see that virtual world as something quite natural, he explains. For this generation online matches arenât just about organising a meet-up in real life, they are about having fulfilling online experiences too. This video can not be played Is this a new way of dating during lockdown? For this reason the company has been working on making Tinder less of a place to organise ""hook ups"" offline and more of a place to hang out online, to get to know people. It is trialling virtual spaces and live events where people can meet and match on the platform, like Swipe Nights and quizzes. Mr Seidman sums up the creed of the new young crop of Tinder users: âYour digital life is as important as your social life in the physical world.â In a world of continued social distancing, this creed may also have to be embraced to some extent by older daters too.

"This video can not be played Mark Zuckerberg told the BBC's Simon Jack that Facebook would 'take down' coronavirus misinformation Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has told the BBC that it had and would remove any content likely to result in ""immediate and imminent harm"" to users. ""Even if something isn't going to lead to imminent physical harm, we don't want misinformation to be the content that is going viral,"" he said. It removed Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro's claim that scientists had ""proved"" there was a coronavirus cure. This was removed because it was ""obviously"" not true, he said. He also said that Facebook had removed content from groups claiming that the rollout of the 5G digital network was a cause of the spread of the virus and in some cases encouraged those who believed that to damage the networks physical infrastructure. Facebook recently removed content from former broadcaster and conspiracy theorist David Icke for ""repeatedly violating our policies on harmful misinformation"". Mr Icke had suggested that 5G mobile phone networks are linked to the spread of the virus and in another video he suggested a Jewish group was behind the virus. Mr Zuckerberg said: ""We work with independent fact checkers. Since the Covid outbreak, they have issued 7,500 notices of misinformation which has led to us issuing 50 million warning labels on posts. ""We know these are effective because 95% of the time, users don't click through to the content with a warning label."" However, Facebook has insisted that unless there was the prospect of real imminent harm, then the company would and should allow what he called the ""widest possible aperture"" for freedom of expression on the internet. He also told the BBC that preventing electoral interference is an ""arms race"" against countries such as Russia, Iran and China. He admitted that the firm was ""behind"" in the 2016 US presidential election. In his first UK broadcast interview in five years, he said that Facebook had been unprepared for state-sponsored interference in 2016. But he added the company was confident it had since learnt its lessons. Facebook was previously embroiled in a political scandal in which tens of millions of its users' data ended up in the hands of political interest groups including Cambridge Analytica. However, he said the social media giant, which also owns Whatsapp and Instagram, was now better prepared than other companies, and even governments, to prevent future attempts to influence political outcomes. In-app shops launched on Facebook and Instagram Facebook and Google extend working from home ""Countries are going to continue to try and interfere and we are going to see issues like that but we have learnt a lot since 2016 and I feel pretty confident that we are going to be able to protect the integrity of the upcoming election"". Mr Zuckerberg also defended his level of personal control over arguably the world's most powerful media platforms. Although Facebook is a public company worth nearly $700bn (Â£574bn), he ultimately exerts total individual control thanks to an ownership structure that gives him a controlling interest even though he owns a small fraction of the shares. He said it had allowed Facebook to make longer-term strategic decisions which have proved to be correct such as waiting to improve the Facebook experience before launching it on smartphones and not selling out early to rivals. ""If it had been different then we would have sold out to Yahoo years ago and who knows what would have happened then. "" Yahoo is now worth 1/20th as much as Facebook. Facebook continues to face criticism over its reluctance to describe or define itself as a publisher and thus embrace the kind of editorial responsibility that newspapers and traditional broadcasters are legally bound by. However, it would be hard to argue that Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram have not provided billions of people with the kind of connectivity with friends and family that has been important during this global pandemic and the consequent restrictions on movement and freedom. In fact, after many years of courting controversy and opprobrium, it seems clear that Facebook and Mr Zuckerberg are feeling more confident about their public roles. If there are any winners out of this public health emergency, digital companies like Facebook, Netflix and Amazon are among them. However, no one is totally immune to the deep downturn that is already upon us and the evidence for which is confirmed with every new economic release. Facebook knows that and is one of the reasons it is keen to help small businesses online through this week's launch of a service called Facebook Shops. It's a mutually beneficial exchange. Those businesses are Facebook's current and future customers. What's good for them is good for Facebook.

"Tackling harmful drinking during the lockdown will be ""an integral part of the nation's recovery"", an editorial in the BMJ says. With supermarket sales of alcohol having risen, it warns cases of alcoholic liver disease could increase too. And the writers fear drinking could be fuelling a rise in calls to domestic violence charities. They say greater investment in alcohol treatment services is needed. ""Many people reacted to the closure of pubs and restaurants by stocking up to drink at home in isolation,"" says the article, by Prof Sir Ian Gilmore, who chairs Alcohol Health Alliance UK, and Ilora Finlay, who chairs the House of Lords Commission on Alcohol Harms. Sales of alcohol in supermarkets and corner shops jumped by 22% in March. Sales of alcohol in off-licences rose by 31% in the same month - but this accounts for just 1% of alcohol sales. And with the lockdown starting on 23 March, figures for the whole of April are likely to be much higher. ""It is increasingly clear that if we don't prepare for emerging from the pandemic, we will see the toll of increased alcohol harm for a generation,""the editorial says,external. Two groups need particular attention - those: already struggling with alcohol dependence ""on the brink of dependence during lockdown and beyond"" Growth in sales of alcoholic drinks outstripped even that of food purchases And bereavement, job insecurity and troubled relationships could all trigger alcohol dependence. ""Before Covid-19, only one in five harmful and dependent drinkers got the help they need,"" the writers say. ""The proportion will be even lower now."" RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? Charity Drinkaware says lockdown and isolation could have affected many people's drinking habits. A survey of 2,000 UK adults found: a quarter were drinking more than normal 17% were drinking less The proportion of those now drinking on days they wouldn't usually was: 28% of those now furloughed 26% of those now working from home And of the furloughed workers: One in seven was having their first drink earlier in the day One in 10 was drinking in secret ""Changes like these are signs of potentially problematic behaviours that, over time, can develop into alcohol dependency,"" Elaine Hindal, from Drinkaware, said. ""It is vital that this new normal does not lead to an 'out of sight, out of mind' mentality, particularly when it comes to the health and wellbeing of the UK workforce."" Employers should ensure their staff did not become disconnected during the furlough period and plan for a return to work ""that prioritises employee health and wellbeing"", she added.

"Search interest in online casinos has hit an all-time high in the UK since lockdown began, data show. Google Trends shows gambling has moved online amid theclosure of physical gambling venues and cancellation of sports events. Problem gamblers told the BBC lockdown measures were a ""recipe for disaster"". Watchdog the Gambling Commission said there had been a rise in some online gambling, but there was no evidence yet of a rise in problem gambling. Despite anoverall drop in gambling, the commission said across the industry there had been an increase in some customers playing online slots, poker, casino gaming and virtual sports. Engaged gamblers are also spending more time or money during lockdown,data show,external. Anna Hemmings, chief executive of GamCare, a UK charity to help with problem gambling, saidthere was ""a concerning context for people at risk"". She said ""contributing factors [to gambling problems], such as financial distress, isolation and boredom"" were increasing with Covid-19. The watchdog has givennew guidelines,externalto gambling companies to help their customers. ""We are monitoring online operators closely and if we see irresponsible behaviour we will step in immediately, suspending licences if we need to,"" commission chief executive Neil McArthur said. â¯ The BBC spoke to people in recovery from compulsive gambling on condition of anonymity. Steve, who works as a manager and is married, had maxed out his credit cards and had 14 concurrent payday loans to cover his debts before he sought help. ""The access to online gambling on mobile phones during lockdown is a recipe for disaster,"" he said. The gambling industry pledged earlier this month to halt radio and TV advertising during the lockdown but gamblers in recovery have voicedconcerns over exposure to online ads. ""I'm certain bonus offers with gambling companies are better than they have ever been,"" Steve said. ""I worry about anyone who is not quite in a problem area but is close, as there are no other distractions."" Paulhas not gambled for two years and four months since joining Gamblers Anonymous. He said it was easy to become a ""concealed gambler"" as the click of a mobile phone button could start the spin of an online roulette wheel while you were sat on the sofa at home. The father-of-two said many people he had met in recovery had previously turned to gambling to improve their mood when they were stressed or anxious. Former landscape gardenerDanaccumulated Â£50,000 in debts in a ""short amount of time"". ""I would be trying to borrow money from friends and family with no real intention of paying it back and you end up being blacklisted by those people without anyone understanding the problem because you become a compulsive liar. ""With this situation at present [lockdown], without the right help, there's going to be a real surge of financial ruin down to gambling. ""If I was left to my own accord, not working, I would have been on it all day on my phone."" Using credit cards and e-wallets like PayPal, Skrill, and Neteller for gamblingwas banned,externalin Great Britain from 14 April. GamCare said the ability to use credit cards had exacerbated some people's issues as they chased gambling losses with additional funds they could not afford to repay. More than Â£16.5m had already been gambled on HSBC UK credit cards since the start of this year, with an average transaction value of Â£65, the bank said. Since lockdown began, its customers had spent more than Â£1.6m on gambling transactions. HSBC UK, which has worked with GamCare to train a team to help customers with gambling addictions, said its call centre was currently receiving an average of 1,000 calls a month about gambling. Since 31 March, all online gambling operators in Britain have had to be registered with Gamstop. Gamstop is a free service that allows gamblers to self-exclude from online gambling sites with one registration. They choose a minimum exclusion period of either six months, one year, or five years. There has been a rise since lockdown began in people asking Gamstop for their self-exclusion to be reversed but once registered, the system does not allow them to cancel until the minimum period they originally chose, has expired. In the past 30 days, searches for casinos not on Gamstop however have also increased, according to Google. Gamstop said this was a sign ""in one sense that the new regulatory system was working"". ""However, it is obviously irresponsible for anyone to promote unlicensed websites that are not regulated by the Gambling Commission and consumers are strongly advised not to use them,"" it said. Gamblers Anonymous said it did not remove the temptation by stopping using credit cards when gambling. ""It just makes it a bit more difficult,"" it said. ""If a compulsive gambler wishes to gamble online, they will find a way."" Steve said systems set up by gambling companies to protect customers were purely ""tick-box exercises"" but ""99% of operators"" were covered by Gamstop. The commission said it had suspended the operating licences of two operators whoinitially failed to sign up to Gamstop,external. Where it saw individuals or companies not licensed in Britain, illegally interacting with British consumers, it said it would act to close them down. It said it expected operators to step in when they saw evidence of gambling-related harm and to carry out checks on people's source of funds. ""We take failures to do this extremely seriously,"" the commission said. If you or someone you know has been affected by addiction, help and support is available atbbc.co.uk/actionline.

"Nicola Sturgeon has unveiled details of a four-phase ""route map"" towards easing the country's lockdown restrictions The first begins after 28 May and there will be a review every three weeks The R number is below one and has been so for three weeks, allowing a slow lifting of lockdown The first phase of lifting lockdown will allow different households to see each other in ""small groups"" and only in ""outdoor spaces"" The fourth phase could see ""mass gatherings resuming in line with public health advice"" and all types of ""shopping, eating out and drinking"" allowed Children in Scotland will go back to the classroom from 11 August, but they will not be there every day The government says the approach will be a ""blended"" one in which pupils will be in school on certain days and at home on others BBC Scotland News Today we were given the first detailed indication of how Scotland may move out of lockdown:  The situation will be reviewed every three weeks and the government has cautioned it may take months or longer before we can move into Phase 4, when mass gatherings and normal school interaction will be possible. In other news, the Scottish Conservatives have called for the resignation of Health Secretary Jeane Freeman after it emerged that far more elderly people were released from hospital into care homes to clear beds, than she previously said. On Reporting Scotland Nicola Sturgeon rejected the call. We'll be back early tomorrow with more live updates of the latest developments. Don't forget the weekly Clap for Carers event. Reporting Scotland The Scottish Conservatives have demanded the resignation of Jeane Freeman after it emerged far more elderly people were discharged from hospitals without testing than was first revealed. In mid-April Ms Freeman said about 900 ""delayed discharge"" patients had left hospital, primarily to return to their own home. But the Scottish government now admits this was the figure released to care homes - and another 1,500 were released to their own homes. The Scottish Tory health spokesman Miles Briggs said the health secretary had lost the confidence of the public. But the first minister rejected the call, saying Ms Freeman has her ""absolute confidence"". ""I believe she should and does have the confidence of the public. She has been literally for three months working round the clock to make sure this crisis is managed in the best way possible,"" she told Reporting Scotland.  Reporting Scotland The first minister was asked for more detail on how the guidance on meeting other households would work, and how many households they could see - at a distance - outside. She asked people to ""use their judgement"" on who they meet after the rules are relaxed. She stressed that people should continue to stay near their homes to avoid places like beaches and beauty spots becoming overcrowded. But Ms Sturgeon said their would be more flexibility for people travelling further to see family - for instance ""to see your elderly mother"" in her garden. Reporting Scotland Appearing on Reporting Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon was asked why the lockdown could not be relaxed right away. She said that ""it's important we are really confident"" the virus is in decline. The first minister added that we also need to have the test, trace and isolate programme in place, which it will be from the start of next month. The trade body for Scotland's housebuilders has said that 6,000 households are ""stuck in limbo"", despite plans to ease restrictions on the construction industry as part of a phased return to work. Homes for Scotland chief executive Nicola Barclay was responding to the announcement by the Scottish government which referred to âplanning
for the construction sector to implement the first two phases in its restart
planâ. Ms Barclay said: ""The
biggest question still remains in relation to the 6,000 households currently
waiting to move into what are largely complete homes requiring only internal
finishing touches that can be easily and safely undertaken. ""There is
absolutely no mention of how or when they can be completed. ""With all these
customers still stuck in limbo, they have been given no indication today of
when they can move on with their lives and government
needs to urgently provide further clarity on this.""   The Scottish government has set out a four-phase plan for relaxing the lockdown restrictions and restarting the economy. Phase 1 could start in a week's time, on 28 May, if the R-number and new infections remain low. Here's a rough guide of how we'll come out of lockdown: Phase 1 - You should be able to meet another household outside in small numbers. Sunbathing is allowed, along with some outdoor activities like golf and fishing. Garden centres and drive-through takeaways can reopen, some outdoor work can resume, and childminding services can begin. Phase 2  -You can meet larger groups outdoors, and meet another household indoors. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories and small shops can resume work. Playgrounds and sports courts can reopen, and professional sport can begin again. Phase 3 -You can meet people from more than one household indoors. Non-essential offices would reopen, along with gyms, museums, libraries, cinemas, larger shops, pubs, restaurants, hairdressers and dentists. Live events could take place with restricted numbers and physical distancing restrictions. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Phase 4- University and college campuses can reopen in full, mass gatherings are allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. For a more detailed rundown of how it will work,click here.  Reporting Scotland Coming up on Reporting Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon explains the thinking behind her plan to ease Scotland out of lockdown. Starts on BBC One Scotland shortly. Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Willie MacLeod of UK Hospitality warns of between 70,000 to 100,000 job losses in the sector by the end of the pandemic. If accommodation and hotels cannot open until the middle of July, this will be bad for tourism in Scotland he tells Drivetime. He says redundancies are already being made because businesses cannot sustain the level of cash burn they are taking at the moment.  He says hotels are ""burning"" an average Â£60,000 a month to stay afloat. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland NFU Scotland president Andrew McCornick explains for many farmers and crofters, the lockdown has not been as onerous as for other sectors due to the need to provide food. But he welcomes the reopening of recycling centres as fly tipping is especially common on agricultural land. The farming union is also working with the Scottish government on how it will go about recruiting staff for the picking season, with the option of cohorts who share accommodation and work spaces being considered. The
Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has welcomed the news that some businesses
could return to trading from next Thursday if they make adequate provisions to
protect workers and customers. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has unveileda four-phase ""route map"" aimed at restarting societywhile suppressing the virus. The FSB is  calling on the Scottish government to  urgently provide clear, realistic
guidance to all businesses about the steps they should take before re-opening. Andrew
McRae, FSBâs Scotland policy chairman, said at the
moment thereâs little guidance for firms in Scotland regarding what alterations might be required. âWhile
the first minister said today that this guidance is coming in the days ahead,
there is no time to lose."" âWhile
we recognise that this is a public health crisis, it is also an economic
crisis."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney continued to answer listeners' questions on Drivetime: Q: Is it the teachers' responsibility to keep the children two metres apart? A:It is part of the whole approach of the school environment to make sure young people are exercising physical distancing. That is much more challenging among the youngest of pupils. Models are going to have to use outdoor space a great deal more or operate in smaller numbers. Q: How can someone work full-time if their child or children are at school part-time? A:Our society is going to have to adapt as a whole - not just the schools - to the presence of coronavirus. So the first minister in parliament today talked about the possibility of employers arranging shorter working weeks, perhaps four rather than five days. It might involve more home working. Q: Does this put the onus on parents and employers to reach arrangements that allow for schooling? A:We put this in our route map about working or running a business and some of the arrangements around remote working that we would want to be encouraging. The school system is not the only bit of society that has to adapt. NHS staff and care workers from overseas are to be exempt from paying a surcharge to use the health service after mounting pressure from MPs. Boris Johnson's spokesman said the PM had asked the Home Office and Department for Health to exempt NHS and care workers ""as soon as possible"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a victory for common decency"", while SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford welcomed what he called a ""U-turn on this cruel Tory policy"". The health immigration surcharge on non-EU migrants is Â£400 per year and set to rise to Â£624 in October. Asked by the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg whether the prime minister ""changed his mind"" when he decided to waive the NHS usage fees, Matt Hancock says Boris Johnson has himself ""been a beneficiary"" of workers from abroad. The Scottish government has set out itsfour-phase routemap,externalfor reopening. Here is a brief summary of what the points are: Lockdownâ Stay at home except for exercise, medicine and essential work Phase 1â Virus not yet contained but cases falling. Start of easing from 28 May allowing some meeting outdoors. Phase 2â Virus controlled. Construction, factories, warehouses, laboratories, and small shops start to resume work. Professional sport can begin again. Phase 3â Virus suppressed. Schools should reopen from 11 August. Non-essential offices, gyms, museums, libraries and cinemas can open along with some live events. Larger shops, pubs, restuarants, hairdressers and dentists reopen. Phase 4â Virus no longer âsignificant threatâ. University and college campuses reopen in full, mass gatherings allowed. All workplaces open and public transport is back at full capacity. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney has been answering questions from the listeners. Q: What if I have two children and one is at school and the other at home, how do I go back to work? A:What we've injected into the framework we've publlished today is sufficient local flexibility for schools and local authorities on how scenarios like that can be addressed to ensure that young people can get access to learning and families can get the opp to get back to work. There's a lot of school and parental dialogue that goes on on a constant basis. Q: When we went into lockdown, we were told that many classes had two or three people in them as parents kept their kids off school. When children go back, will that be mandatory? A:Yes, it is. Q: Will this be an exam year, or will grades be awarded as it has been this year? A:That's a difficult question to answer at this stage. The document published today makes clear that the exam diet for 2020-21 is being prepared as we speak. But what I don't know at this stage is how much of the educational year is going to be disrupted by this blended model. We'll set out a clear position on that when it is available. Scottish business leaders have described plans to ease restrictions on garden centres as well as the agriculture, forestry and construction sectors as a ""helpful start"", after Nicola Sturgeonunveiled her route map for easing lockdown. Welcoming the move, Scottish Chambers of Commerce chief executive Liz Cameron called for the publication of ""detailed sectoral guidelines"" to be accelerated to help businesses prepare for a restart. CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said the Scottish government's four-phase plan provided a ""helpful
starting point for firms preparing for the restart and those already working
hard to ensure their operations are as safe as possible for staff and
customers"". Malcolm Cannon, head of the Institute of Directors Scotland, said his organisation was ""encouraged"" by the proposed easing of restrictions. The Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland also welcomed the easing of some restrictions, but called on ministers to provide ""as a matter of
urgency, clear, realistic guidance to all businesses about the steps they
should take before reopening"". Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Class sizes may have to be limited to allow for social distancing The ""whole of Scottish society is going to have to work collaboratively"" to ensure the education system works while ""wrestling with coronavirus for some time to come"". So Education Secretary John Swinney tells BBC Radio Scotland as he explains the combination of learning in school and learning at home that will be required when pupils return to school on 11 August. Insisting that the plan is ""thought through and inevitable"", he gives the example of a school in Glasgow with 2000 pupils and 200 staff and stresses that the government could not allow that many people in the school at the one time. ""It would be impossible to deliver physical distancing, which will still be required when schools return on 11 August,"" Mr Swinney states. ""I appreciate that throws up challenges for parents because it isn't the full-time learning model they have been accustomed to and will be reflected in their working patterns"" Here's the UK government graph showing the daily number of confirmed deaths among people who have tested positive for Covid-19. Staff working in the kitchens of a Lanarkshire general hospital have tested positive for coronavirus. It has been reported that several workers at University Hospital Wishaw are confirmed to have the virus and several more have been tested. NHS Lanarkshire said that all appropriate infection prevention and control measures had been taken. A spokeswoman for the health board told the BBC: ""We wouldn't comment on the number of staff due to confidentiality. ""A small number of staff are self-isolating at home as per national guidelines."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Blended learning will be the biggest curriculum challenge in the last 30 years, the EIS teaching union has said. General secretary Larry Flanagan said the shift would require a ""huge effort"" from all those involved in education. Education Scotland will need to play a big part in providing the remote offer and the Scottish government must provide advice on what the curriculum should focus on, he said. The
EIS has been taking part in the government's education recovery group which has
todaypublished
a strategic framework for the return of schools,external. Mr Flanagan welcomed the August target date for schools reopening, which he said would reassure members on safety. He also said PPE should be available in schools but it is not anticipated it will be routinely required in classrooms. Â© 2025 BBC.

"More than a million and a half people took up the opportunity to delay their mortgage payments under the scheme. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is believed to be discussing ways of extending three month mortgage holidays with regulators and banks. The Financial Times reports,externalthe government hopes to prolong the scheme for borrowers struggling with payments because of the impact of coronavirus. More than 1.6 million mortgage customers have taken advantage of the relief from making payments. The banking body, UK Finance, estimates this is an average of Â£755 a month. The government brought in the mortgage break scheme in mid-March, which allows people to apply to defer their payments, without their credit reference being affected. That respite from payments would end for the first applicants in June. This is not free money. It will still have to be paid back later on, so mortgage customers will face higher bills once the so-called holiday comes to an end. The problem the Treasury is grappling with is that an abrupt end to the scheme could produce a cliff-edge effect, with families facing money problems as bad, if not worse, as they did when the virus struck. A spokesman for the financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA,) would not comment on any talks but said it was vital that customers should have advice and support at the end of a payment freeze. He said: ""We are currently considering what support will be needed for customers reaching the end of a mortgage payment freeze. We have not yet made any final decisions but we will make an announcement soon."" One idea is that the mortgage scheme would be extended for a further three months, but that there would be no blanket extension and the rules on applications could be tightened. A spokesman for the Treasury said: ""We're not commenting on speculation."" EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"England is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to return More than 35 councils in England have warned that not all of their primary schools will be ready to reopen on 1 June. Some of them have expressed opposition to opening at all amid safety concerns. The government says it will listen to the concerns of parents and teachers about the plans to reopen schools. At the daily No 10 briefing, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the move would only go ahead if ministers ""can be sure of children's safety"". He also said he wanted schools in England to return at the same time, after his cabinet colleague Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told BBC Breakfast there may not be a ""uniform approach"". Mr Dowden said: ""It is best, and the government has said this repeatedly, that we move as a whole nation, and that would include of course the whole of England in doing so."" But he suggested there could be different measures in ""micro-hotspots"" where there was an outbreak of new coronavirus cases. Earlier, teaching union NASUWT said it remained ""unconvinced"" reopening schools was ""appropriate or practicable"". Do I have to send my children back to school? Schools 'safe' to reopen, Michael Gove insists Coronavirus: How much do children spread it? Reopening schools 'will cause suffering and death' For most pupils, schools have been closed since 20 March. From 1 June, children in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 in England will be able to return to school if infection rates and the government's other tests at the time allow it. England isthe only UK nation to set a return date so far. Schools in Wales will not reopen on 1 June, while those in Scotland and Northern Ireland may not restart before the summer holidays. But on Tuesday, Calderdale Council, in West Yorkshire, followed Bury,Liverpooland Hartlepool in advising its schools against wider reopening. Other local authorities expressed concern: Conservative-led Solihull Council warned some school places may not be ready for the first week of June Manchester Council said its schools will have to ""work at their own pace"" to gradually increase numbers Birmingham City Council said it may not be possible for some schools to safely open to more pupils by 1 June Leeds City Council saidit would not expect all its schools to reopen to all pupils ""from day one"",external Stockport Council said its schools would not open until 10 June Slough Borough Council said schools would not welcome more pupils until 8 June at the earliest Brighton and Hove City Council said it had advised schools only to reopen whenrisk assessments indicated it is ""safe to do so"".,external A number of the 153 English local authorities have acknowledged safety concerns but have not urged all their schools to reject the proposed timeframe. Academies have the freedom to make their own decision, unlike the two thirds of primary schools supported by local authorities. The government's plan to reopen primary schools to some year groups was a key part of the strategy for getting the country to take the next steps out of lockdown. But it's run into fierce opposition. Persuading people that it's safe to begin thinking about the path back towards normality was always going to be a challenge. And Downing Street is stressing that 1 June was only put forward as the earliest possible date for any reopening of schools (and non-essential retail, set for the same day) - conditional on the five tests for controlling the virus being met. But the admission from cabinet minister Robert Buckland that the picture across the country might not be ""uniform"" - is a reminder that the government in Westminster is not ultimately in control of what happens in schools across the country next month. And it's problematic for ministers that a key date for adjustment to restrictions - albeit one that came with caveats - is now in question. There is already variation between the nations on when schools will return - now there's likely to be differences across England too. Emma Knights, the chief executive of the National Governance Association, which advises school governors, told the BBC it would be hard for governors to ignore the position of their local authorities. She said as councils might be legally judged the employers of school staff, governors would need a very strong reason to make a different decision. The decision to begin reopening schools came after the reproduction, or R number - the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average -came down across every part of the UK. But multiple research groups, including thoseat the University of Cambridge,external, show it varies across the country - it has come down most in London but is higher in the north-east of England. Metro mayors in the north-west of England have made an ""urgent""call for the release of regional Covid-19 reproduction rate figures, saying it would help residents making ""informed decisions about the risk and help decide whether they wish to take a more cautious approach to the relaxation of the lockdown rules"". Meanwhile, a survey of 29,000 members of the teachers' union NASUWT found just one in 20 thought it would be safe for more pupils to return next month. Patrick Roach, the union's general secretary, called for all the scientific evidence from the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to be made available to teachers and schools as soon as possible. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? Mother-of-three Amy Hughes says her eldest daughter is eligible to return to school on 1 June, but she will not send her back then. ""We're actually waiting to see if there's a second wave to decide whether to let our other daughter start school in September,"" she adds. She moved her family out of inner city Bristol last year when one of her daughters caught a virus that made her lungs collapse. Ms Hughes, who now lives in Lincolnshire with her children aged six, four and one, says the experience had made her ""hyper sensitive about viruses"". Lincolnshire GP Grace Hurdley, who is currently on maternity leave, says although school life will be ""different"", sending her five-year-old son back on 1 June is ""the best thing"" for him. While home schooling has not been a problem, she told BBC Radio 5 Live her son was ""really struggling"" spending so long at home. Ms Hurdley believes it would be ""better for him to play alongside his friends than to continue being isolated"". She is reassured by plans to split his usual class size of 30 into 15, so that he is in a ""bubble"" with some other children and his teacher, with their own meal and play times. He would also get used to washing his hands more regularly - a habit she says the family are ""very keen on at home"" in light of their new baby and the pandemic. Dr Peter English from the doctors' union, the British Medical Association,said in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat schools should reopen ""as soon as it is safe to do so"", but warned ""a zero-risk approach is not possible"". Last week,the BMA said Covid-19 infection rates were too high for England's schools to reopen. Attendance by primary school pupils will be voluntary and schools are reporting varied levels of interest from the parents. Secondary schools are likely to stay closed until September but the government hopes those facing exams next year - Years 10 and 12 - will get some time in school before the summer holidays. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We want children back in schools as soon as possible, because being with their teachers and friends is so important for their education and their wellbeing. She insisted plans for the ""cautious"" return of some pupils from 1 June are ""based on the best scientific and medical advice"" and said No 10 had ""engaged closely"" with relevant groups including the unions, and will continue to do so.
