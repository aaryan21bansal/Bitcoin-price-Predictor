"The National Records of Scotland figures cover the period when the pandemic was at its peak in Scotland The number of people who died in Scotland at the height of the coronavirus outbreak was a third higher than usual, according to official figures. National Records of Scotland (NRS) said 18,201 deaths had been registered between April and June. This was 4,515 higher than the five-year average. Covid-19 was the underlying cause in 3,739 deaths, accounting for 83% of the excess deaths. Deaths from diabetes, dementia and Alzheimer's Disease were about a quarter higher than the five-year average, the NRS said. And deaths from diseases of the genitourinary system increased by 22.5%. However, deaths from respiratory diseases decreased by 20.6% and deaths from transport accidents were down by 69.1%. Chief Medical Officer Gregor Smith said the reasons for the higher than usual number of deaths would be better understood ""in the fullness of time"", and urged people to seek treatment for any medical concerns they may have. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland The three-month period covers the height of the coronavirus lockdown in Scotland when schools and businesses were closed, and traffic on all roads was significantly reduced. Regular health care had been disrupted after NHS Scotland was placedon an emergency footingin mid-March to deal with the outbreak. Accident and Emergency attendances dropped tobelow half their normal levelsduring April, Public Health Scotland data shows. It is also possible that some deaths attributed to other causes at the start of the outbreak were undiagnosed Covid-19 cases. Dr Smith said there were ""signals"" from the latest data that ""shows excess deaths go beyond what we would expect directly from Covid"", highlighting those linked to Alzheimers and dementia in particular. He said: ""We need to understand why that is the case - are these deaths being contributed to by Covid, or are they for some other reasons? ""Over the fullness of time we will be able to much better understand why these deaths are apparent in the system."" Earlier in the pandemic there was a concern that an increase in deaths linked to cardiovascular conditions may have been down to ""people not presenting for treatment"" when they needed it. Dr Smith said: ""The message we've had all along is that for these urgent conditions, the NHS remains open. ""If you have symptoms we urge you to seek help and don't just sit on it - there is capacity in the NHS for you to get the care you need."" Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland was at a ""dangerous point"" in the fight against coronavirus, with cases on the rise Age Scotland said the steep rise in excess deaths from dementia, diabetes and other causes during the lockdown was ""extremely concerning"" and needed further investigation. The charity's chief executive, Brian Sloan, said older people had ""borne the brunt"" of the pandemic and had been at greater risk of dying from other causes. ""While it's hard to speculate on the reasons, it's likely there is a link to the pandemic,"" he said. ""We know that health and social services were under a huge strain during these months, and many people were reluctant or unable to seek medical assistance."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said every death linked to the virus ""represents the loss of an irreplaceable individual"". The latest NRS report said only two deaths had been recorded in the week to Sunday where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, with none of them in care homes for the first time in the pandemic. However, Ms Sturgeon warned that people must be vigilant about increasing numbers of cases. And she did not rule out Scotland following England in reducing the number of people who can meet at the same time. She said the number of new cases of coronavirus reported each day in Scotland had ""roughly trebled"" over the past three weeks. The rolling seven day average of new daily cases over the past week was 152 - compared to 52 three weeks earlier. The percentage of people tested who return a positive result has also gone up from being ""around 1%"" to consistently being around 2%. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I hope you can see why the situation just now is a matter of concern to us, and why we need to continue to work as hard as we can to keep the virus under control.""

"CCTV caught Salman Abedi in the arena foyer just seconds before he blew himself up Evidence of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi discussing martyrdom was seized almost three years before the attack, an inquiry has heard. The hearing was told Abedi, who killed 22 people in the May 2017 atrocity, had first been linked to ""subjects of interest"" in 2010. A mobile phone seized in February 2017 showed regular contact between Abedi and a convicted terrorist organiser. Paul Greaney QC said their relationship was of ""some significance"". The inquiry heard the device was confiscated from British-Libyan national Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was jailed in 2016 for helping others to reach Syria. Phone analysis revealed he had been in contact with Abedi, who went to visit him in prison, in the months leading up to the attack. In 2014, during investigations into Abdallah, counter terrorism police had evidence of discussions with Abedi regarding ""martyrdom, including the martyrdom of a senior al-Qaeda figure"", the inquiry heard. Mr Greaney said Abdallah had refused to answer any questions put to him by inquiry staff, but investigators were ""determined"" to get to the bottom of their relationship. The inquiry will also examine what intelligence and information was or should have been available to security services and the police about Abedi. Mr Greaney said MI5 had received intelligence about Abedi on two separate occasions in the months prior to the bombing, ""the significance of which was not fully appreciated at the time"". ""In retrospect"", he said, it could ""be seen to be highly relevant to the planned attack"". On 1 May 2017, the inquiry further heard, Abedi had been assessed as meeting the threshold to be considered for further investigation by MI5. He was due to be considered for referral on 31 May 2017 but ""tragically this was overtaken by matters nine days earlier"", Mr Greaney said. The inquiry is being held at Manchester Magistrates' Court, less than a mile away from where the bombing happened During the third day of proceedings, photographs of the 22 victims were displayed on a screen as the public inquiry heard their final movements. Relatives of some of the victims wiped away tears in the hearing room at Manchester Magistrates' Court, while other families watched proceedings from a nearby annexe. The inquiry heard how 21 of the victim suffered injuries which were said to be unsurvivable. But bomb blast experts believe the injuries of John Atkinson, 28, may have been potentially survivable. The bombing after an Ariana Grande concert killed 22 people and injured hundreds more The public inquiry will look at a number of factors including the emergency response to the bombing. It was told how problems with communication and incorrect reports of an ""active shooter"" meant fire engines carrying specialist equipment and stretchers did not arrive for another two hours and six minutes after the blast at 22:31 BST on 22 May 2017. Mr Greaney said the inquiry would need to consider ""whether that absence contributed or may have contributed to the loss of life that occurred"" and ""whether a better response by the emergency services would have saved more lives"". ""There can be no doubt there was a need for such joint working on the night of 22 May 2017 in Manchester,"" he said during the third day of the inquiry. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? The hearing was told North West Fire Control was first notified at 22:34 BST that there had been an explosion and mass casualties, and police were looking for a second device. They also received reports, wrongly, of an ""active shooter"" and some casualties with gunshot wounds. Tributes were left in in St Ann's Square in Manchester city centre in the wake of the bombing But there appeared to be confusion about whether Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) should follow procedures based on the incident being an explosion or a terror bombing. Station manager Simon Berry, of GMFRS, was told a rendezvous point was arranged with police at Manchester Cathedral nearby, but this was rejected in favour of a different ""muster point"" three miles away from the arena. This decision would be ""critical"" to the understanding of how the fire service was delayed so long in deploying to the arena, Mr Greaney said. An expert report on GMFRS's response to the attack found it ""inadequate and ineffective"" and said there was a lack of effective leadership, though ""no single individual"" was responsible for the failings.

"This video can not be played The prime minister said the new measures were ""not another national lockdown"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said ""we must act"" to avoid another lockdown as virus cases rise in England. He set out a new ""rule of six"",restricting gatherings to a maximum of six people,external, enforced by police able to issue fines or make arrests. Mr Johnson also outlined a ""moonshot"" plan to control the virus with mass testing, possibly by next spring. It comes as the UK reported another 2,659 coronavirus cases, the fourth day running of over 2,000 reported cases. ""I want to be absolutely clear, these measures are not another national lockdown. The whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown,"" Mr Johnson said in the first Downing Street coronavirus briefing since July. He added ""it breaks my heart to have to insist on these restrictions"". How many cases in your area? What are the new rules? Will unis be exempt? And other questions 'It makes children's parties illegal gatherings' In the last week, cases have risen from 12.5 infections per 100,000 people to 19.7 per 100,000 across the UK. Coronavirus was more prevalent among young people, with 54 cases per 100,000 people in the 19 to 21-year-old age group. Mr Johnson also announced that: Venues such as pubs and restaurants will be legally required to request contact details of everyone visiting, hold it for 21 days and provide it to NHS Test and Trace. They face fines of Â£1,000 if they fail to comply Business opening hours could be restricted across the whole nation if cases continue to rise. But initially the measure will be limited to local lockdown areas such as Bolton, where venues must close between 22:00 and 05:00 ""Covid-secure marshals"" will be introduced to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres The passenger locator form, filled out by travellers arriving in the UK to enforce quarantine rules, will be simplified and Border Force will increase enforcement Plans to try out larger audiences in venues later this month will be revised, and the government isreviewing its plan to allow spectators back into sports stadiums from 1 October Mr Johnson said the rules had ""become quite complicated and confusing"" and the government was ""simplifying and strengthening"" them after feedback from police and the public. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the new rules on gatherings were a reflection that ""poor communications were a large part of the problem"" with the spread of the virus. Sir Keir said the government also needed to improve testing, which was ""all over the place"", following reports that some people have been unable to book tests. The prime minister said the government was ""working hard"" to increase testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, but urged people only to book a test if they had coronavirus symptoms. He said they also want to use new types of test ""in the near future"" to identify people who do not have coronavirus and are not infectious so they can live life ""in a more normal way"". He said these swab or saliva tests could be turned around in 90 or even 20 minutes, with millions processed each day. However, BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said such tests were still at the piloting stage, and so were unlikely to be manufactured or distributed before the end of the year. Discussing the plans, the prime minister evoked the Apollo space programme, describing the ""giant collaborative effort"" of this testing programme as a ""moonshot"", which could restore a more normal way of life even if a vaccine or treatment is not available. A report in the BMJ,externalsaid the UK has drawn up plans to carry out up to 10 million Covid-19 tests a day by early next year, at a cost of more than Â£100bn. But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the BMA, said it was unclear how the ""moonshot"" testing would work given the ""huge problems"" currently seen with lab capacity. The Department of Health declined to comment directly on the report, but said it wanted to boost the number of tests with a rapid turnaround time. For all the talk of vaccines and rapid testing, it was clear - certainly listening to UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - that this winter will be hard. Respiratory viruses tend to do better in the autumn and winter because of the colder weather and the fact people mix indoors more. That is why we see flu cases and, sadly, deaths rise every winter. Many experts believe the same will happen in the coming months, despite the latest measures. That means the government faces some very difficult decisions. It has to balance the impact of further restrictions - which can harm health in other ways, as well as damage education and the economy - against the risk of letting the virus spread. The public has a huge role to play. But on its own that may not be enough. Behind the scenes there is lots of focus on how to protect the vulnerable - that could mean locking down care homes and asking people to shield again. But the UK is in a stronger position than it was at the start of the pandemic. The lockdown bought us time. Better treatments are available and, while many problems remain with testing and tracing, the systems in place are an advance on where we were when the virus first hit the UK. These new tests will be piloted with audiences attending indoor and outdoor venues in Salford from next month. But the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the technology needed to be ""tested carefully"" and it would be ""completely wrong to assume this is a slam dunk"". The measures that needed to be taken against coronavirus were ""damaging"" socially, economically and to people with other health conditions, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty acknowledged. ""We have to do them because the alternative is worse,"" he said. He added that ""the period between now and spring is going to be difficult"" and people shouldn't see the restrictions ""as a very short term thing"" because they were unlikely to be lifted after just two or three weeks. Mr Johnson said it was ""too early to say"" if big parties could be held over Christmas, but added that he was ""still hopeful"" some aspects of life could return to normal by the festive season. He said the restrictions would be in place only ""as long as necessary"". ""I'm sorry about that. I wish we did not have to take this step, but as your prime minister I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and save lives,"" he said. The new ""rule of six"" means: Social gatheringsof more than six peoplein England will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 September The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces Itapplies to all ages The ruledoes not apply to schools and workplaces, to people living together or in the same support bubble, or to weddings, funerals and organised team sports Thefull list of exemptions,externalalso includesprotests and political activitiessubject to ""strict risk assessments"", jury service and providing emergency assistance Peoplewho ignore the policecould be fined Â£100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 The chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, Ken Marsh, said the new rules were "" very flimsy"" and would be difficult to enforce. At present, the guidance says two households of any size are allowed to meet indoors or outdoors, or up to six people from different households outdoors. Until now the police have had no powers to stop gatherings unless they exceeded 30. The number of people allowed to meet inside or outside varies in the UK's four nations. If you are meeting indoors:up to eight people,externalfrom three different households can meet inScotland;up to six people,externalfrom two households inNorthern Ireland;up to four households,externalcan form an ""extended household"" inWales.

"Philippa Barton's plans for an eight-person birthday party have left her in a quandary From Monday social gatherings of more than six people - with some exceptions - will become illegal, in a bid to stem the growing number of coronavirus cases. With its numerous parks and open spaces, the university city of Cambridge knows a thing or two about gatherings. So the BBC headed there to see how the new rules were going down. ""I wish I'd waited to send out the invites - I'm not really sure what we'll do at the minute,"" says research assistant Philippa Barton. The scientist, who has just completed a PhD at Cambridge University, is 29 today and had planned to celebrate her birthday in a little over a week's time. She had planned to hold a garden party for eight people at a friend's house. ""So that can't happen any more,"" she says. ""I mean it is a bit awkward now that I've already sent out the invites because you can't just scrap two people off the list - I think that would be really awful. ""I'm not really sure what we'll do at the minute. I might have to do two smaller things on separate weekends."" The law change will ban larger groups meeting anywhere socially indoors or outdoors It will not apply to schools, workplaces or Covid-secure weddings, funerals and organised team sports It will be enforceable through a Â£100 fine if people fail to comply, doubling on each offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200 The new rules - which come into force on 14 September - mark a change to England's current guidance Source:BBC Hannah Batchelor fears the new rules mean she can no longer run children's birthday parties Hannah Batchelor runs both the Stardust Dance Academy, in the Orchard Park area of the city, and a children's party business. Both sides of her business, she believes, will be affected. She fears the party side will grind to a total halt. ""I think mainly it will affect class numbers,"" she says. ""I think it is going to affect parents' confidence in sending children to after-school and extra-curricular activities. I think it is going to have a negative impact on my dance school. ""I also think it is going to definitely going to have a negative impact on my party business as with the new guidelines I can't really run children's parties. ""It would make such parties effectively illegal gatherings and I don't think that's something parents are going to want. ""That part of my business I won't be able to run for the foreseeable future."" The scene earlier in Cambridge as punters enjoy a leisurely trip along the River Cam - punt operators do not think they will be affected by the new rules Just out of the city, on the Cambridge Science Park in Milton, James Hirst is about to start an outdoor fitness class. His sessions, he says, only started back up in the middle of July, in line with the government's guidelines. As an outdoor fitness business, he can accommodate up to 30 people each session and so he will not fall foul of the new restrictions. Cambs Boot Camp owner James Hirst says he wants to redouble his firm's efforts to keep everybody safe ""Obviously, we have to stay within the guidelines for social distancing and we are running within the Football Association's rules on outdoor training,"" he says. ""We have four sites around Cambridge and we have about 18 to 20 sessions a week. They are being really well attended; we've had new people joining up. ""The other side of our work, the corporate work side, has really died down. There's only one that I'm training with in town, whereas it used to be four or five a week."" Jesus Green is a popular place to relax in Cambridge on summer days He says he is not concerned about the new rules ""at the moment"" because of the outdoor sports exemption. Quarantine lifting 'gives us quality family time' How will places of worship change after lockdown? How sickle cell families are coping ""And it is not affecting business, and it is not affecting sports, so as things stand we're quite happy that this won't affect us. ""But for us it is just so important that we keep hold of the social-distancing guidelines because, while it is OK to have 30 people out, we have to be so careful that they are always more than 2m (about 6ft) apart.

"Are young people to blame for the rise in UK coronavirus cases? That's what the health secretary told us this week. Matt Hancock told Radio 1 Newsbeat listeners:""Don't kill your gran by catching coronavirus and then passing it on."" But many are unhappy with being singled out and say the government has been giving ""mixed messages"". Sophie Morgan hasn't seen her grandparents since February and is taking care not to spread the virus. The 23-year-old says other people her age are doing the same. ""I've cancelled a holiday to Italy and try to limit how much I need to go outside, even to the supermarket,"" she says. ""There's nothing that I'm doing which puts me at risk. Even with a nail appointment I'm wearing a mask."" Sophie feels the government waited too long to make face coverings mandatory Linzi Cormack has also changed her habits and is following the rules. She's really cautious about touching door handles and surfaces. ""I use my feet to push them open and don't touch my face as much. ""I'm just cautious about touch points."" Her life has become more online-focused because of the virus and not wanting to ""be around other people"". ""I've decided to shop online all of the time and stop going to supermarkets."" ""It's not about catching it myself, it's about protecting others,"" Linzi says And as for the weekly drink in the pub - the higher number of positive cases mean Linzi isn't visiting as much as she normally would. ""I've been once since it reopened, and not for a long amount of time because I felt really uncomfortable."" Tom Hardy, who works in a school in Leicestershire, is a keen traveller but has stopped visiting different parts of the country. ""Mainly to protect the people around me. I'm also in a fairly high-risk job so I don't want to put my colleagues and students at risk."" Tom says the rules can cause a divide in friendship groups as some people are tired of the restrictions Like Linzi, the recent rise in cases has forced the 20-year-old to take more precautions. ""I've started shopping online a lot more, and not going to places as I did much outside of work."" Linzi isn't surprised by the focus on young people because there are some ""who feel they are untouchable"" when it comes to the virus. ""Especially when people start drinking more, they become a bit careless."" But she says generalising is wrong and ""it's unfair to single out young people"" with some older people ""not wearing masks or social distancing"" in shops. Sophie says the constant changing of rules may be to blame for people being confused and not always following them. ""Every update was confusing which means the rules are confusing and leave you thinking 'are we doing this now?'"" She no longer pays attention to what the government says and says she is going to continue to wash her hands and keep her distance from people. Tom disagrees with Sophie and says the government's been ""as clear as they can be"". He says the young people visiting restaurant and bars have been encouraged by the government to do so through schemes like Eat Out to Help Out. And he adds it's important to consider the role mental health might play when someone breaks rules. What should I do to stay safe and stop the spread? How do I get a coronavirus test? ""Especially if you live at home with your parents, you can feel quite isolated from the people you used to spend a lot of time with. ""I'm not saying it's OK, but there are factors to suggest why people would."" Tom says he's followed all of the rules - with the exception of seeing his dad during lockdown. ""I made sure precautions were in place, but looking back, I probably shouldn't have done that."" Starting university next week, Aisha says she needs to be âextra carefulâ Aisha Mirza says there's been mixed messages from the government. ""The rules haven't been clear. By saying local lockdowns, but keeping some things open, it defeats the purpose because you are still mixing with people."" She says the government shouldn't be surprised by a spike after Eat Out to Help Out. ""We are used to meeting people regularly. ""So when the government starts making these things available to us, we're obviously going to make use of that right away,"" she says. The 18-year-old adds: ""You do get minorities in all groups that mess about and don't do things right."" Despite being ""fed up"" by restrictions, Sophie, Linzi and Tom and Aisha all agree about the threat of coronavirus and remain worried about the rising numbers in recent days. ""I think it's important to be worried and be cautious because there's people in my family who need to shield,"" Linzi says. ""It's more for other people. I couldn't live with myself if I passed it on to someone and they got really ill, it's horrible."" Tom's job is a cause for concern because of difficulties in keeping a distance. ""There's 1,200 people in the building, so it's hard to maintain a social distance from everyone,"" he adds. But he will ""be careful"" and continue to see his family unless told otherwise by the government. With no vaccine yet and the virus being quite new, Sophie is still worried.

"There is more than one ""rule of six"". Who knew? It's what a legendary Hollywood film editor used to describe the best of way making a must-watch movie, mixing six different elements like emotion and space (his name is Walter Murch, if you are on the hunt for trivia). The other rule of six is part of the code that rules corporate takeovers, more familiar to City lawyers. You may indeed have your own obscure examples. But ministers hope now the government's new rule of six will very quickly become familiar to the country and will immediately change people's behaviour too. 'We must act' to prevent second lockdown, says PM What are the new rules for meeting my friends? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? From Monday, it will be illegal in England, apart from at school or work or under other few exceptions, to meet more than five other people at a time. The police will have the power to stop that happening - you can read exactly how the new restrictions will workhere. After weeks when the government has been trying to cheerlead the country back to the office, urging pupils back to school and taking steps to roll back coronavirus restrictions it is quite the change of tone, change of pace, and change of heart. The prime minister also acknowledged publicly, after many weeks of questions about the layers of anomalies and different rules and regulations, that complicated messages had made the rules hard for people to follow. THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? Boris Johnson can hope that the public in England will be willing to follow a new, clearer instruction. But it is not obvious that the public will all comply. The reason for the change however, aswe discussed yesterday, is crystal clear. The number of cases has started to rise, and rise quickly, and ministers want to slam on the brakes. The new rule is a significant move, and it's plain it could mean limits on our lives for many months. The prime minister today acknowledged that even Christmas may not be much like normal. The changes are designed to prevent the disease taking off again, and to stop the need for another full national lockdown, something the government is desperate to avoid. But other measures are waiting in the wings too. At the bottom of the government'sguidance,externalissued today, there is a rather bland, technical sounding paragraph: ""The government will restrict the opening hours of premises, initially in local lockdown areas, with the option of national action in the future. This has been introduced in Bolton, following a steep rise in cases, and will seek to restrict activities that may lead to a spread in the virus."" In other words, if the rise in cases doesn't slow, the government could bring in a national curfew on opening hours, a more radical step. Government sources emphasise this is not about to happen. But by laying out the option, it's clear the rule of six could be followed by more radical steps. How many confirmed cases are there in your area? How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid?

"The government says there is ""high demand"" for coronavirus tests Officials are alarmed by the latest rise in coronavirus cases. Newly diagnosed cases have topped 2,000 for the past three days. The average rate of new infections is now four times higher than it was in mid-July. The rise is real, but is it quite as sharp as it looks? Here are five things to consider. The confirmed cases chart is one we have all got used to. It shows the number of positive Covid-19 tests a day. In April, there were days when 6,000 new cases a day were recorded, so the level of infections in the past few days appears to be some way towards that peak. But at the start of the pandemic, the UK was only largely able to test hospital patients. There was limited testing capacity. This targeted testing meant infections in the community were completely missed, whereas now we have mass testing in the community. It means that if we compare numbers now to numbers during the peak, we are essentially comparing apples with pears. Estimates from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggest there may have been as many as 100,000 cases a day at the end of March. Mass testing in the community only started in the second half of May. Clearly not all cases are now being picked up, although the surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics suggests a large proportion are, whereas earlier in the pandemic maybe only 5% of cases were being detected. So while cases may be rising, the level of infection being seen is still very low compared with the peak. Even after mass testing was launched, the number of tests carried out on a daily and weekly basis has still been increasing. This is because more testing centres have opened and lab capacity to process the tests has increased. It means we are able to look more closely for virus circulating in the community than we were when mass testing first started. If you look at the trend solely in terms of positive cases, the pattern looks like this: But we have to factor in that big increase in testing - there has been an 80% rise since mid-June. When you adjust for the numbers of tests carried out and calculate the percentage of positive tests, the trend looks more like this: The rise seems to be smaller, slower and to have happened more recently. How do I get a coronavirus test? Cases are rising, what should I do? What is the R number and how is it calculated? The increase in testing capacity means the government now has a flexible army of testing facilities. A network of more than 100 mobile units can be dispatched around the country. And despite the current problems with lab capacity, which have meant some people in some places have struggled to get a test, resources are still being focused on areas with the highest rates. Random testing in neighbourhoods has also started in hotspot areas, with people offered tests even if they don't have symptoms. By looking in areas with highest rates of infection, you are more likely to get positive tests. It is telling that over the past week to Sunday, a quarter of new cases were in the 20 local authority areas with the highest rates. They represent just 5% of total local authorities. Over the past few days hospital admissions have started to slowly tick up - though not as much as cases, and it's too soon to know if this is statistically significant. They are a small fraction of the number of admissions back in March, and they are rising much more gradually than they were around the peak. One theory is that more testing is uncovering a larger number of mild cases which don't need treatment. Another is that more of the cases are among younger people, who are less likely to become very ill. But the rise suggests the virus could be taking hold in the community again, and could quickly escalate. Public Health England data shows people in the 20-39 age bracket are testing positive at higher rates than any other age group, and at higher rates than they were earlier in the pandemic. What's harder to say is why that is. It could be behavioural or demographic - that younger people are more likely to have to go out to work, have public facing jobs, live in shared housing and go out to socialise. But it could also be a function of how eligibility for testing has expanded. Younger age groups are much less likely to get seriously sick with coronavirus, and so earlier this year would not have found themselves in hospital where they would have been tested.

"Philippa Barton's plans for an eight-person birthday party have left her in a quandary From Monday social gatherings of more than six people - with some exceptions - will become illegal, in a bid to stem the growing number of coronavirus cases. With its numerous parks and open spaces, the university city of Cambridge knows a thing or two about gatherings. So the BBC headed there to see how the new rules were going down. ""I wish I'd waited to send out the invites - I'm not really sure what we'll do at the minute,"" says research assistant Philippa Barton. The scientist, who has just completed a PhD at Cambridge University, is 29 today and had planned to celebrate her birthday in a little over a week's time. She had planned to hold a garden party for eight people at a friend's house. ""So that can't happen any more,"" she says. ""I mean it is a bit awkward now that I've already sent out the invites because you can't just scrap two people off the list - I think that would be really awful. ""I'm not really sure what we'll do at the minute. I might have to do two smaller things on separate weekends."" The law change will ban larger groups meeting anywhere socially indoors or outdoors It will not apply to schools, workplaces or Covid-secure weddings, funerals and organised team sports It will be enforceable through a Â£100 fine if people fail to comply, doubling on each offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200 The new rules - which come into force on 14 September - mark a change to England's current guidance Source:BBC Hannah Batchelor fears the new rules mean she can no longer run children's birthday parties Hannah Batchelor runs both the Stardust Dance Academy, in the Orchard Park area of the city, and a children's party business. Both sides of her business, she believes, will be affected. She fears the party side will grind to a total halt. ""I think mainly it will affect class numbers,"" she says. ""I think it is going to affect parents' confidence in sending children to after-school and extra-curricular activities. I think it is going to have a negative impact on my dance school. ""I also think it is going to definitely going to have a negative impact on my party business as with the new guidelines I can't really run children's parties. ""It would make such parties effectively illegal gatherings and I don't think that's something parents are going to want. ""That part of my business I won't be able to run for the foreseeable future."" The scene earlier in Cambridge as punters enjoy a leisurely trip along the River Cam - punt operators do not think they will be affected by the new rules Just out of the city, on the Cambridge Science Park in Milton, James Hirst is about to start an outdoor fitness class. His sessions, he says, only started back up in the middle of July, in line with the government's guidelines. As an outdoor fitness business, he can accommodate up to 30 people each session and so he will not fall foul of the new restrictions. Cambs Boot Camp owner James Hirst says he wants to redouble his firm's efforts to keep everybody safe ""Obviously, we have to stay within the guidelines for social distancing and we are running within the Football Association's rules on outdoor training,"" he says. ""We have four sites around Cambridge and we have about 18 to 20 sessions a week. They are being really well attended; we've had new people joining up. ""The other side of our work, the corporate work side, has really died down. There's only one that I'm training with in town, whereas it used to be four or five a week."" Jesus Green is a popular place to relax in Cambridge on summer days He says he is not concerned about the new rules ""at the moment"" because of the outdoor sports exemption.

How sickle cell families are coping ""And it is not affecting business, and it is not affecting sports, so as things stand we're quite happy that this won't affect us. ""But for us it is just so important that we keep hold of the social-distancing guidelines because, while it is OK to have 30 people out, we have to be so careful that they are always more than 2m (about 6ft) apart.

"Boris Johnson has urged MPs to support a bill which modifies the Brexit deal he signed with the EU in January. The PM said theInternal Markets Bill,externalwould ""ensure the integrity of the UK internal market"" and hand power to Scotland and Wales. He also claimed it would protect the Northern Ireland peace process. Critics say the move will damage the UK's international standing after a minister admitted the plans break international law. The Scottish government has not ruled out legal action to prevent it becoming law. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""The Tories' proposed bill for a so-called UK internal market is an abomination. It is a naked power grab which would cripple devolution."" The Taoiseach (Ireland's prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin has spoken to Mr Johnson ""in forthright terms"" about ""the breach of an international treaty, the absence of bilateral engagement and the serious implications for Northern Ireland"", the Irish government said. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will hold emergency talks in London on Thursday with EU Commissioner Maros Sefcovic to discuss the contents of the bill. The European Commission had requested a meeting as soon as possible to clarify what the legislation means for the Brexit deal. Meanwhile, the latest scheduled round of negotiations on securing a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU are also due to wrap up on Thursday. As it happened: PM questions How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? Senior government lawyer quits over Brexit plans UK firms 'under-prepared' for new EU trade rules Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted,external: ""Very concerned about announcements from the British government on its intentions to breach the Withdrawal Agreement. This would break international law and undermines trust."" Downing Street said the EU Withdrawal Agreement - repeatedly described as ""oven ready"" by Mr Johnson during last year's general election - contained ""ambiguities"" and lacked clarity in ""key areas"". EU negotiator Michel Barnier arrives in London for talks The PM's spokesman said it had been agreed ""at pace in the most challenging possible political circumstances"" to ""deliver on a decision by the British people"". It had been signed ""on the assumption that subsequent agreements to clarify these aspects could be reached"", the spokesman added. The new bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. But senior Conservatives have warned it risks undermining the UK's reputation as an upholder of international law. Former PM Sir John Major fears the UK will lose its reputation for keeping its word Former Prime Minister Sir John Major said: ""For generations, Britain's word - solemnly given - has been accepted by friend and foe. Our signature on any treaty or agreement has been sacrosanct."" He added: ""If we lose our reputation for honouring the promises we make, we will have lost something beyond price that may never be regained."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to consider ""the reputational risk that it's taking in the proposed way forward"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the UK government should consider the âreputational riskâ in its approach. But Sir Keir - who campaigned for a second Brexit referendum - added that the ""way forward"" now was to get a trade deal, adding ""if you fail to get a deal, prime minister, you own that failure"". ""The outstanding issues are not difficult. They can be resolved. So what I say to the prime minister is, you promised a good deal, get on, negotiate it,"" he added. ""That's what's in the national interest and focus then on the issue in hand which is tackling this pandemic."" In the withdrawal agreement with the EU, Northern Ireland is still in the UK, but it has to follow elements of the EU's customs code. This bill will be seen by the EU as a pretty brazen attempt to override the deal that has been done. The bill contains the words ""notwithstanding"" - that basically means this law sets aside a law we have already agreed. That was described to me earlier in the week as being a completely nuclear option. And they have pressed it. This row isn't going to go away. The Democratic Unionist Party, which has been pressing for changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, said the bill was a ""step forward"" but the government must ensure Northern Ireland is not ""restrained in a state aid straight jacket unlike the rest of the UK"". But the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein's Michelle O' Neill, said the Withdrawal Agreement protected the Good Friday Agreement and it was ""astounding"" the UK government ""thinks its fine"" to wreck an international treaty they had signed up to. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""My job is to uphold the integrity of the UK but also to protect the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. ""And to do that, we need a legal safety net to protect our country against extreme or irrational interpretations of the Protocol, which could lead to a border down the Irish Sea, in a way that I believe would be prejudicial to the interests of the Good Friday Agreement and prejudicial to the interests of peace in our country. And that has to be our priority."" Commenting on a similar argument by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, a former minister told the BBC: ""I cannot allow anyone to get away with saying the government is doing this to protect the peace process. This does the precise opposite."" The legislation will see Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland handed powers in areas such as air quality and building efficiency currently regulated at EU level. It will also set up a new body - the Office for the Internal Market - to make sure standards adopted in different parts of the UK do not undermine cross-border trade. The Scottish government fears the UK single market will cut across areas that are usually devolved. For example, if the UK government decides some food imports are acceptable in England then they would also be allowed in Scotland, even though agriculture is devolved. The new body will be able to issue non-binding recommendations to the UK Parliament and devolved administrations when clashes emerge. This video can not be played Ian Blackford asks Boris Johnson if he thinks he is above the law regarding a bill on future trade. The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, described the Internal Markets Bill as ""nothing short of an attack on Scotland's parliament and an affront to people of Scotland"". Mr Johnson said the bill would protect jobs and growth - and was a ""massive devolutionary act"" that would represent a ""very substantial transfer of power and sovereignty"" to Scotland and Wales. But his words did not preventthe resignation of a senior Conservative in Wales, where the party is in opposition. David Melding, shadow Counsel General, said in his resignation letter that the PM's actions in the past few days had ""gravely aggravated"" the dangers facing ""our 313-year-old Union"".

"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says increasing numbers of people in England are seeking tests when they don't have any Covid-19 symptoms. He said this ""inappropriate"" use of the system was making it harder for people who needed tests to get one. It comes after the boss of England's testing system apologised to people who were struggling to get tests. The Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for the government to ""accept there is a problem"" and ""get it fixed"". In the Commons, Boris Johnson responded saying ""we are working flat out to address all the issues confronting us today"", adding that demand was ""acute"" and there were too many people requesting tests who did not have symptoms.

Mr Hancock denied the testing system was failing, pointing out the UK had the biggest testing system per head of population of all major European countries. ""Right now, we have the highest capacity for testing that we've ever had - increased compared to last week. ""And that testing means that we can find these cases, and therefore help keep the virus under control with the contact-tracing system as well. ""However, in the last couple of weeks we have seen an increase in demand, including an increase in demand for people who are not eligible for tests, and people who don't have symptoms,"" Mr Hancock said. ""We have seen an increase of about 25% of people who are coming forward that don't have symptoms and aren't eligible. They don't have a reason for it. ""I've even heard stories of people saying, 'I'm going on holiday next week, therefore I'm going to get a test'. No - that is not what the testing system is there for. ""We've got to be firmer, I'm afraid, with the rules around eligibility for testing."" The BBC has asked the Department of Health and Social Care how the 25% figure has been calculated, but is still waiting for a response. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""It beggars belief that after weeks of encouraging people to have a test if feeling unwell, ministers are seeking to blame people for simply doing what they were advised. ""With children returning to school and thousands returning to the office, it's obvious extra testing capacity would be needed. ""The fact ministers failed to plan is yet more staggering incompetence."" On Tuesday, the director of testing in England, Sarah-Jane Marsh said she offered her ""heartfelt"" apologies to people who could not get a test. A new lab is due to open in Loughborough in about a fortnight, which will increase testing capacity by about a fifth.

"Obina Ezeoke denied murdering Annie Besala Ekofo and Bervil Kalikaka-Ekofo A man who faced an unprecedented five trials over four years for the shooting of a mother-of-nine and her nephew has been found guilty of murder. Annie Ekofo, 53, and Bervil Ekofo, 21, were killed in their home in East Finchley, north London, in 2016. Obina Ezeoke first went on trial in 2017 but it collapsed, while juries in two more failed to reach verdicts and the other was halted by coronavirus. At his fifth trial, the 28-year-old was found guilty of two counts of murder. An Old Bailey jury convicted Ezeoke by a majority of 11 to one after deliberating for 41 hours over eight days. The defendant was found guilty of two counts of murder after a fifth trial The court heard Ezeoke, of Cambridge Heath, had ""crept noiselessly"" into Mrs Ekofo's home on 15 September 2016 just after dawn. He then shot her 21-year-old nephew, who happened to be staying there that night, while he slept and killed Ms Ekofo in the hall when she went to investigate what had happened. Prosecutor Mark Heywood QC said the 28-year-old drug dealer had gone to kill one of the teenage boys in the family as ""part of a vendetta of violence"". ""His hate was such that he did not falter when confronted by a second person - he simply took her life as well,"" he said. The key evidence centred around firearms residue found in Ezeoke's car, which was used in the getaway, and on his top recovered from a female friend's home. Ezeoke, who denied murder, told successive trials he had an alibi for the time of the shootings and suggested the gunshot residue in the vehicle must have been from a previous shooting. Ezeoke crept into Ms Ekofo's house just before dawn to carry out the killings, the court heard When the fourth trial was halted, the defendant's lawyer James Scobie QC claimed the case should not go to a fifth trial, saying it ""would be oppressive"" and ""enough is enough"". But Mr Heywood successfully argued the ""public interest"" in a case ""of this exceptional kind and such gravity"". Sally-Anne Russell, from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Ezeoke's actions ""have devastated a family"". ""He went to the flat to carry out a revenge attack... When he couldn't find the person he was looking for, he murdered a young man and a mother-of-nine instead,"" she added. Ezeoke will be sentenced on 1 October.

"The fire safety guidance for what materials could be used on Grenfell Tower was ""confusing"", the director of the company which installed the cladding has told an inquiry. Ray Bailey, director of Harley Facades, said there was ""quite widespread"" confusion in the building industry at the time of the refurbishment. The cladding has been blamed for fuelling the fire at the tower block. The inquiry into the fire, which killed 72 people, is in its second phase. It is now looking into how the 24-storey tower in west London came to be covered in such cladding during its refurbishment between 2012 and 2016, before the fire on 14 June 2017. Grenfell cladding company 'did not check safety' Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? The inquiry is investigating whether the confusion about fire ratings was one of the reasons dangerous cladding and insulation was used to refurbish the tower. Mr Bailey said he had a ""misunderstanding"" about which materials were approved for use on tall buildings. One section of the guidance for meeting the government's building regulations stated that materials used on towers above 18m needed to have a Class 0 (zero) rating, though another European classification was equally acceptable. The government has always insisted that another section of the guidance required the insulation used in cladding systems to be of ""limited combustibility"" as well. Under questioning, Mr Bailey said he had believed at the time that if the materials were Class 0 ""throughout"" this also meant they were also classed as being of ""limited combustibility"" - in other words, less likely to burn. However, Class 0 is only a classification of the way the surface of a product such as cladding resists the spread of flames, not its overall combustibility. The insulation panels used on Grenfell Tower were rated Class 0, but were not of limited combustibility. Neither was the cladding, Reynobond PE, which had a core made from flammable plastic. The inquiry also heard that the manufacturer of the cladding - Arconic - had tested various configurations of its product in 2013, and found they had achieved poor ratings for fire safety. The product performed worse when it was shaped into ""cassette"" boxes, the design used at Grenfell Tower. According to a manager's statement, shown at the inquiry, one test had to be stopped due to a 'flash-over', meaning the cladding could only be rated E, out of a possible A to F. The tests werefirst revealed following a BBC investigation in 2018,which found the company did not pass the results to the body which issues product certificates in the UK, relied on by the building industry. The certificate for Reynobond PE, the cladding used at Grenfell, stated it had a class B rating. Arconic sent Mr Bailey this certificate in April 2014, as the materials for Grenfell were being chosen, but made no mention of the poor test results in the covering email. Mr Bailey told the inquiry he was unaware of the tests. The role of the manufacturer will be examined when it gives evidence later in the inquiry. The inquiry continues.

"A social-distancing app which alerts someone when a colleague is too close is being used by Network Rail. Mind The Gap was designed by London start-up Hack Partners for the company, to keep employees safe at work. The technology uses audio and Bluetooth signals to detect if users are in close proximity to one another. Network Rail staff now use the app widely, and it's being rolled out to other companies. ""I am immensely proud of our entire workforce for the part they have played to keep the country running throughout the pandemic,"" Martin Frobisher, Network Rail's safety, technical and engineering director said. ""As we start to plan for a return to office working, we've been looking at absolutely everything to make sure we can continue to keep our people safe."" Employees can choose to download the app and set their desired distance,in line with government guidelines. They will then receive a notification when another user of the app is too close. Mind The Gap uses inaudible ultra-high frequency sounds and Bluetooth to calculate the distance between phones, so it does not require an active internet connection to work. The app sends a notification if you are too close to your colleagues Although many contact-tracing apps have found it hard to accurately detect distances with Bluetooth, Hack Partners says the combination of the technology with audio measuring, gives an accuracy of between 6-8cm. The app will continue to work in the background, which means it could drain phone battery. Tests so far have shown that the high frequency sounds do not affect children, dogs, cats or hearing aids, said River Tamoor Baig, chief executive of Hack Partners. ""It's very easy to relax back into old patterns with colleagues and forget to distance, so this is a reminder,"" he said. ""Also, the sound notification can help users avoid awkward conversations with colleagues who may not be social distancing - a lot of us would find it difficult to tell our boss to move away!"" Built with user-privacy in mind, Mind The Gap does not track people and no sensitive data is collected, stored or shared. This means employers will not be able to monitor employees' movements, either past or present. At Network Rail, downloading the app is optional for employees. Hack Partners hopes workplaces will use the app to encourage those who want to return to the office to feel safer. The firm is also in talks with contact-tracing app developers who are struggling to get accurate distance results using Bluetooth. ""Using technology to maintain social distancing has the potential to help restart the economy by enabling more people to work in offices, and give a much-needed boost to infrastructure projects through on-site construction work,"" said Will Cavendish, engineering consultancy Arup's digital lead.

"George Bizos is best known for defending Nelson Mandela at his trials Top South African human rights lawyer George Bizos, who famously defended Nelson Mandela, has died aged 92. After representing some of the country's best known political activists during the apartheid years, Mr Bizos became one of the architects of South Africa's new constitution. President Cyril Ramaphosa announced his death, saying Mr Bizos had ""contributed immensely to our democracy"". His family said he ""died peacefully at home of natural causes"". Leading tributes on Wednesday, President Ramaphosa described Mr Bizos as an ""incisive legal mind"", and said his death was ""very sad for us as a country"". The Nelson Mandela Foundation said ""another giant of South African history and of global struggles for justice has fallen."" George Bizos is most widely known for his work with Nelson Mandela. The pair met while studying law in Johannesburg and Mr Bizos went on to represent his friend and other anti-apartheid figures in various court cases. Who was Nelson Mandela? Memories of a Robben Island prisoner Last man on trial with Nelson Mandela dies aged 95 He was one of the lawyers who represented Mandela at his treason trial, which began in 1956. He also represented Mandela during the Rivonia Trial, when he and other anti-apartheid activists were sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 on charges of seeking to overthrow the apartheid government. Mr Bizos is credited with adding the words ""if needs be"" to Mandela's famous speech at the trial, in which he said he was prepared to die. Excerpts: Mandela's Rivonia speech The Nelson Mandela Foundation said Mr Bizos played a ""critical role... both professionally and as a family friend"" during the years of Mandela's incarceration. In his autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela describes Mr Bizos as ""a man who combined a sympathetic nature with an incisive mind"". The foundation said the friendship between the men ""spanned more than seven decades and was legendary."" ""In the last years of Mandela's life, they were often to be found together, just catching up, sharing memories, or heading off on car rides to see, one more time, places of significance in their life journeys,"" it added. George Bizos was born in Greece but came to South Africa at the age of 13 as a World War Two refugee. Before moving to South Africa, he and his father helpedseven New Zealand soldiers to escape Nazi-occupied Greece.,external He fell out of education for an extended period of time and worked instead in a Greek shop, after arriving in Johannesburg with no English. He later trained as a lawyer at South Africa's Witwatersrand university, before being admitted to the Johannesburg Bar. After the end of white minority rule, Mr Bizos helped to write South Africa's new constitution. He also represented families of anti-apartheid activists who had been killed during apartheid at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission. In one of his last major trials, he secured government payouts for families of34 mine workers who were killed by South African police in 2012.

"O'Farrell's other novels include This Must Be the Place and After You'd Gone Author Maggie O'Farrell has won this year's Women's Prize for Fiction for Hamnet, a novel inspired by and named after William Shakespeare's only son. The Northern Irish writer beat Hilary Mantel, Bernardine Evaristo and three other authors to the Â£30,000 prize. Hamnet is a fictionalised account of the life of the Bard's son, who died in 1596 when he was just 11. Chair of judges Martha Lane Fox praised the book for expressing ""something profound about the human experience"". She said: ""The euphoria of being in the same room for the final judging meeting was quickly eclipsed by the excitement we all feel about this exceptional winner."" O'Farrell is the 25th recipient of the prize, which was first presented as the Orange Prize for Fiction in 1996. Previous winners include Eimear McBride, Ali Smith, Zadie Smith and Andrea Levy. Joe Willis played Hamnet Shakespeare in the BBC comedy Upstart Crow By Rebecca Jones, BBC arts correspondent It must have been a particularly tough call spurning the Booker winners Hilary Mantel and Bernardine Evaristo. But Maggie O'Farrell is a worthy winner. Hamnet is a beautifully written and intensely moving novel about grief and loss. But don't let that put you off. It is also a richly drawn and immersive portrait of life in 16th Century England, from the smells of bread rolls baking in a hot kitchen to the sight of bees teeming on a honeycomb. It is clever too. Shakespeare is never named. This is a book about a woman and her three children - and their lives are vividly imagined. And it is timely. Plague killed Hamnet in 1596 and there is a gripping chapter exploring how the disease reaches Stratford via a flea on a monkey in Alexandria and a glassmaker in Venice. Trade and travel are to blame and parallels with the current pandemic are unavoidable. Evaristo was shortlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction for Girl, Woman, Other,which shared last year's Booker Prizewith Margaret Atwood's The Testaments. Mantel's nomination came for The Mirror and the Light, the conclusion to her trilogy of novels about Thomas Cromwell. This is the fourth time the two-time Booker winner has missed out on the award, having been previously shortlisted in 2006, 2010 and 2013. Angie Cruz, Natalie Haynes and Jenny Offill were also nominated for Dominicana, A Thousand Ships and Weather respectively. This year's award ceremony was to have taken place on 3 June, but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Wednesday's virtual event saw O'Farrell named the winner in London and given her award in her home town of Edinburgh. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"Svetlana Alexievich pictured at home in Minsk surrounded by European diplomats European diplomats have been photographed at the home of a Nobel Prize-winning writer in Belarus after she said masked men tried to break in. Svetlana Alexievich called journalists to her home on Wednesday after the incident. She is the last leading member of the opposition Co-ordination Council still in Belarus who has not been detained. The government has cracked down on dissent after protests swept the country following a disputed election. Maria Kolesnikova, one of three women who joined forces to challenge authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in August's vote, is in detention aftershe resisted attempts by the authorities to expel her to Ukraine earlier this week. And on Wednesday witnesses reportedly saw Maxim Znak, a lawyer and another member of the Co-ordination Council, being led down a street in the capital Minsk by masked men in plain clothes. Belarusian authorities said both were being held on suspicion of harming national security and destabilising the country. What's happening in Belarus? 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change Thousands of people have been arrested in the crackdown on the opposition and its supporters. Authorities announced on Wednesday that 121 people had been detained at protests nationwide the day before.Hundreds more people were arrested on Sundayduring the fourth consecutive weekend of anti-government demonstrations. Ms Alexievich, a Nobel Prize-winning writer and journalist, saidshe had asked supporters to come to her home after she was harassed,externalwith door knocks and phone calls. She said masked men had earlier attempted to break into her apartment. Sweden's Foreign Minister Ann Linde tweeted an image,externalof the author at home in Minsk surrounded by European diplomats late on Wednesday morning. ""Harassments, arrests [and] forced exile of opposition... is a serious violation of peaceful protests,"" she said. ""Happy to share this photo taken a moment ago in Minsk."" Svetlana Alexievich called journalists and supporters to her home, alleging masked men had tried to break in Ina statement posted on the website of the Belarusian PEN Centre,external, Ms Alexievich said the Co-ordination Council ""wanted a dialogue to begin in society"". The opposition set up the committee in the wake of the election calling for a peaceful transfer of power. ""We were not preparing a coup. We wanted to prevent a split in our country,"" she wrote. ""It was not the [council] that revolted. The country revolted."" The 39-year-old, who previously worked as a lawyer for jailed presidential candidate Viktor Babaryko, was due to take part in a video call on Wednesday but failed to dial in. When a colleague called him, Mr Znak said someone had arrived and then hung up. He then texted the word ""masks"" to a group, one activist told local media. This is believed to be a reference to the face masks worn by the Belarusian security services. This video can not be played What lies behind the Belarus protests? Witnesses then reported seeing Mr Znak being led away. On Monday, Mr Znak had told the BBC he was concerned about his safety. ""I'm pretending to be relaxed,"" he said. ""It's a professional habit - but actually I'm very concerned and scared."" The police are yet to comment on reports of his detention. On Wednesday, exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya visited the Polish capital Warsaw where she delivered a speech at a university and called for the protests in Belarus to remain peaceful. ""I think it is impossible to fight violence and give violence,"" she said. She also called for the immediate release of Mr Znak. ""The methods employed by the so-called authorities are outrageous,"" she said in a statement. ""It's clear Lukashenko is afraid of negotiations and is trying... to paralyse the work of the Co-ordination Council and intimidate its members."" This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets of Minsk and demonstrated outside the presidential palace on Sunday Ms Tikhanovskaya, the chief opposition rival to Mr Lukashenko in last month's election, was forced to go into exile in neighbouring Lithuania shortly after the vote. She entered the race after her husband Sergei Tikhanovsky and another candidate were jailed. Mr Lukashenko, meanwhile, is set to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on 14 September. The pair will discuss energy co-operation, regional conflicts and many other topics, Russia's Ria news agency reports.

"The government should ban placing under-18s in care in unregulated homes amid concerns over sexual and criminal exploitation, the children's commissioner for England has said. Some vulnerable teenagers are ""at risk every day of the week"", Anne Longfield told BBC Newsnight. She called them ""inappropriate"" places for any child. The government is consulting on proposals to introduce new minimum standards to the sector. Ithas already told local authorities to stop placing under 16s in these homes. But Ms Longfield said the plans do not address ""the real problem"" of allowing older teenagers aged 16 and over in care to be placed in such accommodation. One in eight children in care - around 12,000 - spent time in an unregulated home in 2018-19, her report reveals. It comes following a year long investigation by BBC Newsnight into the care sector. Teens in unregulated homes face 'organised abuse' Children 'to be banned' from unregulated homes Sent-away children are 'easy victims' It also highlights evidence that providers linked to organised crime are exploiting the lack of regulation to gain access to children. Police have told her that criminality in the sector is ""rife"" and children are being groomed to sell drugs and for sexual exploitation. Unlike children's homes registered with Ofsted, unregulated homes - often known as semi-independent or supported accommodation - are not inspected by a regulator in England or Wales. The hostels, flats, bedsits and even caravans come with differing levels of staff support to help 16 to 18-year olds gain independence. Three-quarters (73%) of the sector is privately run and ""allows for high profit-making without the checks and balances that are seen in other care settings"", Ms Longfield said. Children's Minister Vicky Ford said the government was taking steps to drive up the quality of care provided to vulnerable children. She added: ""In some circumstances, semi-independent accommodation can be the right choice for 16 and 17 year-olds as they move towards adult life, but only when it is of high quality and meets their needs.""

"There are fears about the rising number of coronavirus cases in some valleys areas Merthyr Tydfil could be the next area in Wales to see a local lockdown, according to a health data expert. The former head of health analysis at the Office for National Statistics highlighted the rising proportion of positive coronavirus tests in the area. In the past seven days, 6% of tests in and around Merthyr were positive. That is more than the 5.1% in Caerphilly,which has gone into lockdown, and almost double the 3.2% in Rhondda Cynon Taff. Valleys towns braced for 'nerve-wracking lockdown' In Caerphilly, the opening dates of testing centres at the town's leisure centre and Penallta House council offices have been extended until 15 September. At Porth, in Rhondda Cynon Taff, a temporary testing centre will open at Oldway House from 09:30 BST on Thursday. Rhondda MP Chris Bryant has warned a local lockdown could be enforced in the area ""by the weekend"" if cases continued to rise. But data expert Jamie Jenkins said: ""If you look at the data across the whole of Wales, Merthyr Tydfil would be the one you would be more concerned about rather than Rhondda Cynon Taff."" Mr Jenkins said fewer people were talking about Merthyr rather than Rhondda Cynon Taff ""because the numbers are smaller but the local authority of Merthyr is much smaller."" Warning over lockdown pub get-togethers Rhondda Cynon Taff could be in lockdown 'in days' Coronavirus cases rise by 150 in Wales He added: ""But if we're looking at where the next risk of a local lockdown is going to be, it's probably Merthyr above [RCT], if they apply the same principle of looking at the stats."" Merthyr Tydfil council has been asked to comment. The number of positive tests across Wales was also ""a concern"", said Mr Jenkins, with the proportion more than doubling, from 1% to 2.5% in the space of the past four weeks. The case rate - the proportion of cases for the size of its population - is now 51.4 per 100,000 - which is 31 cases in the past seven days. It has the highest case rate total after Caerphilly, which is 83.4 per 100,000. The rate in Rhondda Cynon Taff is 41.4, in Powys 21.9 and in Wrexham it is 20.6. Public Health Wales is investigating a small number of cases at a factory in Merthyr. More than 250 people work at the General Dynamics plant, which assembles armoured vehicles for the Army. The Welsh Government felt it had little option but to introduce a local lockdown in Caerphilly county, because of a dramatic rise in the coronavirus case rate - the proportion of cases to the population. Not quite as startling, but still significant, has been the case rate rises in Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil. But public health experts won't just be looking at those figures, they are also looking at how many tests are coming back positive. The average in Wales over the last week has been 2.5%, but in Caerphilly it's more than double that - 5.1% In RCT currently, about three tests in every 100 come back positive. That's actually that's lower than Newport. But if we look at Merthyr Tydfil, 6% of tests are coming back positive, so no wonder alarm bells are ringing. I believe if that was replicated across Wales, we might be back to a blanket lockdown. As it stands, it seems almost inevitable there will be more restrictions as time goes on. But they might be different, depending on local circumstances. The message health officials are trying to stress at the moment is, wherever you live, is if you want to avoid a form of local lockdown, be careful, observe social distancing and take the coronavirus risk seriously. Visits to care homes in the county have already been stopped, while six supermarkets have been given improvement orders after checks by public health officials found they were not adhering to coronavirus regulations. They are Tesco in Talbot Green, Aldi and Morrison's in Porth, Lidl in Aberdare, Iceland in Taff Street, Pontypridd, and Co-op in Ynysybwl. This video can not be played Rhondda Cynon Taff is facing the possibility of lockdown They have 48 hours to correct the issues highlighted or they could face further action, including closure. There have been warnings over social distancing due to small clusters around Porth, Penygraig and Tonypandy. The spread of Covid-19 here has so far been of a different nature to the infections in Caerphilly, where there has been community transmission. Council leader Andrew Morgan saidthere were just days to ""get on top""of rising infections and a temporary testing centre has opened in Porth. Morrison's in Porth is one of six shops found to be not adhering to coronavirus regulations Mr Morgan also announced pubs would be inspected in a similar way to check they were complying with legislation. ""We don't want to see pubs having to close early or be closed altogether,"" he said. How do I get a coronavirus test? False information hampering tracing Mr Bryant also said he feared a lockdown could be imminent: ""If we carry on as we are then there will be a lockdown, perhaps by the weekend, because a small minority of people are being fundamentally irresponsible. ""They are refusing to isolate when they come home from holiday, refusing to be tested when they are showing symptoms, going to caravan sites in groups of six, seven, eight families together, holding parties in houses, giving false names to pubs so they can't be traced. ""The truth is that we are all in this together. Some people think they and the people they love are magically immune but if we don't take this seriously there will be a major lockdown, which will affect people's livelihoods and finances.""

"With social distancing restrictions ending in England and easing further in Scotland on 19 July, good ventilation will remain very important in avoiding Covid. For months we've been told to wash our hands and maintain social distancing to beat the virus. But scientists and engineers say we also need to think about the air we breathe inside buildings. Good ventilation matters in five ways. When you walk into a room and the air feels stale, something is wrong with the ventilation. Not enough fresh air is being introduced, which increases your chances of getting infected by coronavirus. Recent research shows that in confined spaces there can be ""airborne transmission"" of the virus - with tiny virus particles lingering in the air. According toworkplace regulations set up before the pandemic,external, everyone should get 10 litres of fresh air every second, and that matters more than ever now. So if a place seems stuffy, just turn around and leave, saysDr Hywel Davies,external, technical director of the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers. He says that it's vital to have a flow of clean air: ""If you've got someone who's infected in a building, and you're bringing in plenty of outside air, you're diluting whatever infectious material they're giving off. You're reducing the risk of other people becoming infected."" From offices to shops, air conditioning is welcome on hot days - but check the type of unit. The simplest is a slender white box mounted on walls or ceilings, known as a split air conditioner. This draws in air from a room, chills it and then blows it back out again. A split air conditioner In other words, it's recirculating the air. This is no problem for a quick visit but may be a risk over a period of hours. Astudy of a restaurant in China,externalblamed this type of air conditioner for spreading the virus. One customer was ""pre-symptomatic"" - in other words, he was infected but did not realise because he had yet to develop symptoms. Scientists reckon he released the virus as he breathed and talked, and it was pushed around the room by swirling air currents from the units on the wall. The result was that nine other people became infected. Dr Davies points again to the importance of fresh air: ""If there had been a good supply of outside air, very likely fewer people would have become infected - if any."" In a modern building where the windows are sealed, how can you get enough fresh air? You're relying on a ventilation system in which stale air is extracted from the rooms and piped to an air handling unit, often on the roof. A rooftop air conditioning unit There, fresh air can be pulled in from outside and mixed with the old inside air, before being sent back into the building. Given the risk of coronavirus infection, the professional advice is to maximise the fresh supply. ""Having 100% outside air or close to 100% is a good thing,"" says Prof Cath Noakes of the University of Leeds and chair of the environmental panel of the government's SAGE advisers, speaking in a personal capacity. ""The more fresh air, the less you're running the risk of recirculating the virus through the building."" The precise mix is decided by the building's managers, who may be working for the owners or the tenants.  . The drawback to running 100% fresh air is the cost - the incoming air has to be heated in winter and cooled in summer, all of which requires energy. A modern ventilation system will have filters but these are not fool-proof. In the US, researchers investigating the Oregon Health & Science University Hospital found that traces of coronavirus were trapped by the filters but some had somehow slipped through. Prof Kevin van den Wymelenberg, who led the project, believes that swabbing the filters could reveal if there's someone infected working in a building. In South Korea, a call centre on the 11th floor of an office building saw one person infect more than 90 others. If the filters had been checked more frequently, the presence of the virus might have been spotted sooner. Prof van den Wymelenberg says data from filters can ""show us where to punch and when to punch"" in tackling infections. Talk to any expert in the field and they will say that fresh air is the key. But one specialist in modelling the movement of air says it's not that simple. Nick Wirth used to design Formula 1 racing cars, and now advises supermarkets and food-processing companies on how to manage air flow to keep people safe. He worries that if someone sitting beside an open window turns out to be infectious, they could shed virus to others downwind. ""If you open a window, where is the air going to go?"" he asks. ""We don't want people in a direct line of that airflow. ""More fresh air in general is better but if it's flowing horizontally and full of virus it could have unintended consequences."" I put this scenario to Prof Cath Noakes. She says the benefits of plentiful fresh air diluting the virus will outweigh any risks. An open window might lead to more people receiving the virus but in smaller, less risky amounts, in her view. It's no surprise there are disagreements - there's a lot we still don't know about the virus. But the air we breathe is bound to be part of any effort to make buildings safer.

"This video can not be played Allowing fans back inside grounds is 'absolutely critical' - Premier League CEO Plans for spectators to attend sporting events in England from 1 October are to be reviewed, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has confirmed. Johnson, speaking at a Downing Street news conference, also said pilot events in September would be restricted to 1,000 fans with social distancing measures in place. âWe must revise plans to pilot larger audiences in venues later this month and review our intention to return audiences to stadiums from 1 October,"" said Johnson. ""But that doesn't mean we are going to scrap the programme entirely. We are just going to have to review it and abridge it."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said: ""In light of increasing transmission rates, the government is reviewing the proposed sports and business events pilots ahead of 1 October and we will unfortunately need to scale some back. ""We know fans and audiences are eager to return, and jobs depend on this too, so work continues around the clock on the 'moonshot project' with the ambition of having audiences back much closer to normal by Christmas, if safe to do so."" The majority of sports in England have been played behind closed doors since the coronavirus lockdown in March, including Premier League football, the FA Cup final, England Test matches and two Formula 1 races at Silverstone. Earlier on Wednesday, Premier League chief executiveRichard Masters said it was ""absolutely critical""that fans were allowed back inside stadiums as soon as possible and failure to do so would cost clubs Â£700m during the 2020-21 season, which starts on Saturday. At the end of August, 2,500 people watched a friendly between Brighton and Chelsea at the Seagulls' Amex Stadium - the first time fans had been allowed into a Premier League ground in almost six months. About 300 fans were allowed to watch last month's World Snooker Championship final between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Kyren Wilson at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, but original plans to admit fans for all days of the tournament were reversed. More than 2,500 spectators bought tickets for Doncaster on Wednesday as the St Leger meeting started, the first crowd at a British horse racing fixture in six months, althoughthe rest of the meeting will be held behind closed doors. The Women's Super League match between Arsenal and West Ham on 12 September was one of the pilot events that were planned with a limited number of fans in attendance. Other planned pilot events include football's non-league finals day at Wembley on 27 September, race meetings at Warwick and Newmarket on 21 and 24 September respectively, a basketball exhibition match in Newcastle on 18 September and a speedway event in Ipswich on 26 September.

"Racing has been held behind closed doors since 1 June before the pilot event started at Doncaster on Wednesday Doncaster Racecourse has been told by local health officials to stop spectators attending its St Leger meeting after Wednesday's opening day. ""On the grounds of public health and public safety I have instructed the course to hold the St Leger Festival behind closed doors from tomorrow,"" said Dr Rupert Suckling, director of Public Health for Doncaster. More than 2,500 spectators bought tickets for Doncaster on Wednesday as the Leger meeting started amid uncertainty over new government rules. It was the first crowd at a British horse racing fixture in six months - since the coronavirus pandemic lockdown - as part of a government pilot scheme for sporting events. Arena Racing Company (Arc), which runs Doncaster Racecourse, confirmed the remainder of the four-day meeting will be held without spectators. It says the decision will cost the company about Â£250,000. ""It's cost a lot trying to get this right. The team have done an amazing job and I feel so sorry for them - some have only been back off furlough for two weeks,"" said Mark Spincer, the managing director of Arena's racing division. ""This isn't just a blow for racing, it's sport. It's going to make it slower and harder for everyone to get back, but we have to follow the advice."" The next racing pilots scheduled at Warwick and Newmarket this month are still set to go ahead, but with a reduced capacity of 1,000. Spectators were allowed at Doncaster on the first day of the St Leger meeting The government said on Tuesday night that social gatherings in England would reduce from a maximum of 30 to six people from Monday in response to rising numbers of coronavirus cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said more details will be announced on Wednesday. The rate of infection in Doncaster has been among the lowest in the country - and was at 10.6 per 100,000 on Wednesday. But Doncaster mayor Ros Jones said the risk of holding the fixture with crowds was ""too great"" and welcomed the reversal. ""I believe holding the St Leger Festival behind closed doors is the right thing to do for the safety of the borough, given the latest change in Government's advice overnight and the increase in infection rates both in Doncaster and nationally,"" said the mayor. ""I welcome this decision and as I have said consistently that the risks were too great for Doncaster."" Racing has been held behind closed doors since resuming on 1 June after a 10-week suspension because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Up to 3,640 people were permitted entry on Wednesday, and the racecourse says more than 2,500 tickets have been sold. A limit of 6,202 was planned on the other days, including Saturday, when the Leger - the world's oldest Classic race - is staged. Allow Twitter content?

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo Harry Dunn's family say they have been told prosecutors do not believe the woman accused of killing the teenager in a crash had diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn, 19, died last August when his motorbike was in collision with a car allegedly driven by Anne Sacoolas outside a US airbase in the UK. His parents said the director of public prosecutions was ""actively considering"" a virtual trial of Mrs Sacoolas. The US government has previously declined a UK extradition request. However, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn said they were ""extremely disappointed"" and felt let down after their meeting with Max Hill QC at the Crown Prosecution Service headquarters. Mrs Sacoolas, 42, the wife of a US intelligence official, claimed diplomatic immunity following the crash in Croughton, Northamptonshire, and was able to return to her home country, sparking an international controversy. She was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December but an extradition requestwas rejected by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Radd Seiger, the family's spokesman, told reporters the family felt ""hopeless"" after the meeting and that the US had not changed its position on the immunity claimed by Mrs Sacoolas. Call for 'virtual trial' in Harry Dunn case Timeline: Events after Harry Dunn crash death Mr Dunn's family have also filed a civil claim for damages against Mrs Sacoolas. Mr Seiger said the claim for damages for wrongful death had been made at the courts in the US state of Virginia. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Commenting after the meeting, Greg McGill, the CPS director of legal services, said: ""Today we have met with the family of Harry Dunn to update them on the various steps the CPS has taken over the last 10 months to secure justice in this tragic case. ""The challenges and complexity of this case are well known, but the CPS and other partners have been working tirelessly to do all they can so that Anne Sacoolas faces the charge we have brought - causing death by dangerous driving.

"O'Farrell's other novels include This Must Be the Place and After You'd Gone Author Maggie O'Farrell has won this year's Women's Prize for Fiction for Hamnet, a novel inspired by and named after William Shakespeare's only son. The Northern Irish writer beat Hilary Mantel, Bernardine Evaristo and three other authors to the Â£30,000 prize. Hamnet is a fictionalised account of the life of the Bard's son, who died in 1596 when he was just 11. Chair of judges Martha Lane Fox praised the book for expressing ""something profound about the human experience"". She said: ""The euphoria of being in the same room for the final judging meeting was quickly eclipsed by the excitement we all feel about this exceptional winner."" O'Farrell is the 25th recipient of the prize, which was first presented as the Orange Prize for Fiction in 1996. Previous winners include Eimear McBride, Ali Smith, Zadie Smith and Andrea Levy. Joe Willis played Hamnet Shakespeare in the BBC comedy Upstart Crow By Rebecca Jones, BBC arts correspondent It must have been a particularly tough call spurning the Booker winners Hilary Mantel and Bernardine Evaristo. But Maggie O'Farrell is a worthy winner. Hamnet is a beautifully written and intensely moving novel about grief and loss. But don't let that put you off. It is also a richly drawn and immersive portrait of life in 16th Century England, from the smells of bread rolls baking in a hot kitchen to the sight of bees teeming on a honeycomb. It is clever too. Shakespeare is never named. This is a book about a woman and her three children - and their lives are vividly imagined. And it is timely. Plague killed Hamnet in 1596 and there is a gripping chapter exploring how the disease reaches Stratford via a flea on a monkey in Alexandria and a glassmaker in Venice. Trade and travel are to blame and parallels with the current pandemic are unavoidable. Evaristo was shortlisted for the Women's Prize for Fiction for Girl, Woman, Other,which shared last year's Booker Prizewith Margaret Atwood's The Testaments. Mantel's nomination came for The Mirror and the Light, the conclusion to her trilogy of novels about Thomas Cromwell. This is the fourth time the two-time Booker winner has missed out on the award, having been previously shortlisted in 2006, 2010 and 2013. Angie Cruz, Natalie Haynes and Jenny Offill were also nominated for Dominicana, A Thousand Ships and Weather respectively. This year's award ceremony was to have taken place on 3 June, but was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Wednesday's virtual event saw O'Farrell named the winner in London and given her award in her home town of Edinburgh. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

But in practice, that is a huge challenge for officers who are being asked to monitor behaviour that, until March last year, was perfectly legal. Police chiefs have followed a system called ""The Four Es"". Before fines are issued to rule-breakers, police will first: Engage with people, to ask why they appear to be breaking the rules Explain the law, stressing the risks to public health and the NHS Encourage them to change their behaviour The fourth ""E"" is ""Enforce"" by issuing penalty notices, as a last resort. Covid rule-breakers are now ""increasingly likely"" to be finedby officers, the Metropolitan Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick has said. The police have a legal duty to make sure the rules are enforced, alongside council, environmental health and trading standards officers. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live If you break coronavirus regulations, you could get a fixed penalty notice , the Covid equivalent of a traffic offence like speeding. Since March, 32,000 have been issued in England and Wales. Penalties rose sharply during England's November lockdown. Almost 6,500 penalty tickets were handed out as police moved more quickly to enforcement. In England and Northern Ireland fines start at Â£200. Fines start at Â£60in Wales,external, andin Scotland,external, although this is reduced to Â£30 if paid within 28 days. Large parties can also be shut down by the police - with fines of up to Â£10,000. In extreme circumstances, you could be prosecuted and face an even greater fine imposed by a court. Hundreds of people were caught on a drone camera at an illegal party by West Midlands Police Yes. All of England is now in a ""tier four"" national lockdown, with similar measures in place across the rest of the UK. Under the new lockdown law, you must stay at home unless you have a ""reasonable excuse"" to be outside. Your home includes property such as a garden, shed or garage - and also access to it. The government's lockdown guidance sets outexamples of reasonable excuses,external. Police won't fine you for leaving home to go shopping for essential goods, or to use a business that can remain open, or for going to work or education, training or childcare. There are other reasonable excuses - such as helping other people in their moment of need. Police chiefs are telling frontline officers to use their judgement if they come across a situation not defined in the regulations. If you want to take part in a protest, the law does not define that as a reasonable excuse to leave home. There is, however, an exception for joining a picket as part of lawful industrial action. Exercise is one of the reasonable excuses for being outside in a public space. You cannot be fined for exercising. But there has been enormous confusion since last March over how long people could exercise for. Cabinet Minister Michael Gove pronounced that spring that he thought half an hour was enough. There are also questions over how far you can go to exercise. Boris Johnson has beencriticised for travelling seven miles from Downing Streetto go cycling during lockdown. There are no restrictions in law in England on how you exercise and for how long. You cannot exercise in groups, but you can run or go on a wander with someone else from your household, support bubble or one person you don't live with. The government's Covid guidance for exercise explains that law - andmixes it with a non-legal recommendation,externalto only go out once a day - and to stay local. It says local ""means stay in the village, town, or part of the city where you live"", but that has no legal force. Derbyshire Police have been taking the ""stay local"" principle seriously. Officers have issued tickets to people who drive five miles to their local beauty spot - includingtwo women accused of an illegal picnicbecause they were carrying takeaway cups of tea. They might. This refers to the ban on ""gatherings"". The last-but-one version of the restrictions made it a potential crime to ""mingle"". That language has now gone from the law - but the rules are far stricter. While the law in England doesn't criminalise bumping into someone in the street, you can no longer meet anyone socially - other than those in your household, support bubble or people you care for. The Home Office has given the police an extra Â£30m to pay for Covid patrols in England and Wales. Over Christmas there were more than 800 fines for what Home Secretary Priti Patel says were ""egregious"" breaches of the rules. The National Police Chiefs' Council hasn't abandoned the Four Es - but expect more fines and more officers asking people what they are doing. Leicester woman fined for Wales trip to see horse Group fined for playing dominoes in restaurant Border police patrols to double after travel ban Police patrols were stepped up around the Scotland-England border around Christmas For instance, the Metropolitan Police has told officers to issue fines ""more quickly"" to anyone committing obvious, wilful and serious breaches. Derbyshire Police, who famouslyput a drone up over hikersin the first lockdown, has issued a similar warning. Yes - while in shops and on public transport. You could face a fixed penalty notice if you don't. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? If you have returned from an overseas Covid hotspot, or have been told by the NHS Test and Trace system to stay at home, you must quarantine for 10 days. The police can now check the NHS Test and Trace database to investigate a tip-off about a quarantine-breaker. Police won't get to see your personal health records.

"Philippa Barton's plans for an eight-person birthday party have left her in a quandary From Monday social gatherings of more than six people - with some exceptions - will become illegal, in a bid to stem the growing number of coronavirus cases. With its numerous parks and open spaces, the university city of Cambridge knows a thing or two about gatherings. So the BBC headed there to see how the new rules were going down. ""I wish I'd waited to send out the invites - I'm not really sure what we'll do at the minute,"" says research assistant Philippa Barton. The scientist, who has just completed a PhD at Cambridge University, is 29 today and had planned to celebrate her birthday in a little over a week's time. She had planned to hold a garden party for eight people at a friend's house. ""So that can't happen any more,"" she says. ""I mean it is a bit awkward now that I've already sent out the invites because you can't just scrap two people off the list - I think that would be really awful. ""I'm not really sure what we'll do at the minute. I might have to do two smaller things on separate weekends."" The law change will ban larger groups meeting anywhere socially indoors or outdoors It will not apply to schools, workplaces or Covid-secure weddings, funerals and organised team sports It will be enforceable through a Â£100 fine if people fail to comply, doubling on each offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200 The new rules - which come into force on 14 September - mark a change to England's current guidance Source:BBC Hannah Batchelor fears the new rules mean she can no longer run children's birthday parties Hannah Batchelor runs both the Stardust Dance Academy, in the Orchard Park area of the city, and a children's party business. Both sides of her business, she believes, will be affected. She fears the party side will grind to a total halt. ""I think mainly it will affect class numbers,"" she says. ""I think it is going to affect parents' confidence in sending children to after-school and extra-curricular activities. I think it is going to have a negative impact on my dance school. ""I also think it is going to definitely going to have a negative impact on my party business as with the new guidelines I can't really run children's parties. ""It would make such parties effectively illegal gatherings and I don't think that's something parents are going to want. ""That part of my business I won't be able to run for the foreseeable future."" The scene earlier in Cambridge as punters enjoy a leisurely trip along the River Cam - punt operators do not think they will be affected by the new rules Just out of the city, on the Cambridge Science Park in Milton, James Hirst is about to start an outdoor fitness class. His sessions, he says, only started back up in the middle of July, in line with the government's guidelines. As an outdoor fitness business, he can accommodate up to 30 people each session and so he will not fall foul of the new restrictions. Cambs Boot Camp owner James Hirst says he wants to redouble his firm's efforts to keep everybody safe ""Obviously, we have to stay within the guidelines for social distancing and we are running within the Football Association's rules on outdoor training,"" he says. ""We have four sites around Cambridge and we have about 18 to 20 sessions a week. They are being really well attended; we've had new people joining up. ""The other side of our work, the corporate work side, has really died down. There's only one that I'm training with in town, whereas it used to be four or five a week."" Jesus Green is a popular place to relax in Cambridge on summer days He says he is not concerned about the new rules ""at the moment"" because of the outdoor sports exemption. Quarantine lifting 'gives us quality family time' How will places of worship change after lockdown? How sickle cell families are coping ""And it is not affecting business, and it is not affecting sports, so as things stand we're quite happy that this won't affect us. ""But for us it is just so important that we keep hold of the social-distancing guidelines because, while it is OK to have 30 people out, we have to be so careful that they are always more than 2m (about 6ft) apart.

"Ambassador Liu Xiaoming has had a Twitter account since late last year China's UK embassy has asked Twitter to ""make thorough investigations"" after its ambassador's official account liked a pornographic clip. Liu Xiaoming's account also liked posts that criticised the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and showed blindfolded Uighurs being detained. Officials claimed that ""anti-Chinese elements [had] viciously attacked"" Mr Liu's account in a ""despicable"" plot designed to ""deceive the public"". Twitter has yet to comment. The activity first drew attention after the account liked a 10-second video posted by an adult-themed page containing clips with Chinese-language descriptions. A London-based human rights campaigner flagged this to other Twitter users just after 09:00 GMT with a screenshot as proof. The clip was subsequently unliked by whoever was controlling the account. But some other tweets remained liked for a time before they too were reversed. One included claims that officials had ""paid lip service to non-interference"" in order to get away with killing members of the Chinese public. A second featured drone-captured footage of Uighur Muslims being taken to what the post described as a ""concentration camp"". Beijing has previously denied holding large numbers of people from the ethnic minority in camps against their will in the western Xinjiang region. And the ambassador denied his country was carrying out a programme of sterilisation of Uighur women, when he was shown the drone footage by the BBC earlier in the year. This video can not be played WATCH: Liu Xiaoming told the BBC in July there was not a concentration camp in Xinjiang Twitter is blocked within mainland China. But over the past year Chinese officials have become more active on the platform, and Mr Liu's account was created in October. The app's likes are sometimes used as a kind of bookmark facility rather than to express support, and the heart-shaped icon that activates them can be easily selected by mistake. Some of the social network's users have suggested the pornographic clip might have been liked by accident and then the others selected as part of a cover story. But Chinese officials have dismissed the suggestion. ""The embassy has reported this to Twitter and urged the latter to make thorough investigations and handle this matter seriously,""said a statement,external. ""The embassy reserves the right to take further actions and hope that the public will not believe or spread such rumour[s]."" Mr Liu's account now only has two likes - both related to tweets it posted in 2019. It has also tweeted aproverb in reaction to the affair,external, suggesting the ambassador is not concerned about being attacked: ""A good anvil does not fear the hammer.""

"Online retail giant Amazon paid Â£293m in tax in the UK last year, while its sales surged 26% to Â£13.73bn. The firm, which employs 33,000 people in the UK, said the taxes included business rates, corporation tax, stamp duty and other contributions. Amazon and other tech firms have faced scrutiny over how much tax they pay in the UK, prompting the government to launch a digital sales tax in April. Amazon said it pays ""all taxes required in the UK"". ""We are investing heavily in creating jobs and infrastructure across the UK - more than Â£23bn since 2010,"" the company said in a statement. ""We pay all taxes required in the UK and every country where we operate,"" it said.

"US President Donald Trump knew Covid-19 was deadlier than the flu before it hit the country but wanted to play down the crisis, according to a new book. Bob Woodward, who broke the Watergate scandal and is one of the nation's most respected journalists, interviewed Mr Trump 18 times from December to July. Mr Trump is quoted as telling him the virus was ""deadly stuff"" before the first US death was confirmed. Responding, the president said he had wanted to avoid causing public panic. Some 190,000 Americans have been recorded as dying with Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. On Wednesday, some US media released parts of the interviews between the president and the journalist, revealing his reported remarks on the outbreak as well as on race and other issues. Here are some of the key quotes so far from Rage, which will be released on 15 September. Mr Trump indicated that he knew more about the severity of the illness than he had said publicly. According to a tape of the call, Mr Trump told Woodward in February that the coronavirus was deadlier than the flu. This video can not be played How Trump's attitude toward coronavirus shifted between March and April ""It goes through the air,"" Mr Trump told the author on 7 February. ""That's always tougher than the touch. You don't have to touch things. Right? But the air, you just breathe the air and that's how it's passed. ""And so that's a very tricky one. That's a very delicate one. It's also more deadly than even your strenuous flus.""Â Later that month, Mr Trump promised the virus was ""very much under control"", and that the case count would soon be close to zero. He also publicly implied the flu was more dangerous than Covid-19. This video can not be played The lost six weeks when the US failed to control the virus Speaking on Capitol Hill on 10 March, Mr Trump said: ""Just stay calm. It will go away."" From 2018: Woodward on Trump - the explosive quotes How Trump's attitude toward coronavirus has shifted Nine days later, after the White House declared the pandemic a national emergency, the president told Woodward: ""I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down, because I don't want to create a panic."" In a tweet on Thursday, Mr Trump asked why Bob Woodward had not reported his quotes on Covid-19 earlier if he thought they were ""bad and dangerous"". ""He knew they were good and proper answers,"" Mr Trump said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking from the White House earlier on Wednesday, he told reporters: ""I don't want people to be frightened, I don't want to create panic, as you say, and certainly I'm not going to drive this country or the world into a frenzy. ""We want to show confidence, we want to show strength."" The president - who is running for re-election in November - said the Woodward book was ""a political hit job"". Responding to reporters' questions on the book, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said: ""The president never downplayed the virus, once again. The president expressed calm. The president was serious about this."" Things US has got wrong - and got right In a tweet, Mr Trump's Democratic White House challenger Joe Biden said that ""while a deadly disease ripped through our nation, [the president] failed to do his job"".

Analysis by Tara McKelvey, BBC White House correspondent Leaders are responsible for keeping people calm but there is a fine line between avoiding panic and making a crisis worse. President Trump told Woodward Covid-19 was deadlier than the flu but in public he downplayed the danger. Other leaders took a different approach. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said bluntly that people would die: ""Many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time."" Mr Trump often downplayed the virus from the beginning. In recent weeks, his advisers began speaking of the coronavirus in the past tense - as if the problem were gone. Scientists disagree, saying there is likely to be a surge in the autumn, following the pattern of other respiratory diseases. One fact is irrefutable, however. Mr Trump wants people to see him as a strong leader. He also wants them to go to the polls and vote - and not to worry about the virus. Mr Woodward writes that he brought up the Black Lives Matter protests in a conversation with the president on 19 June, suggesting that ""white, privileged"" people like themselves ought to work to understand how black Americans feel. ""You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you?"" Mr Trump said. ""Just listen to you."" The nationwide protests against police brutality and racism were sparked by George Floyd's death in Minnesota in May. Mr Trump also repeated the suggestion that he had done more for African Americans than any president aside from Abraham Lincoln, who abolished slavery. Later, on 8 July, Mr Trump again reiterated that he had ""done a tremendous amount for the black community"" but was ""not feeling any love"". The Washington Post also cited an interview where Woodward asked the president about whether America has systemic racism. Mr Trump said while these problems exist everywhere, ""I think probably less here than most places, or less here than many places"". The president also acknowledged racism affected the lives of people in the US, saying it was ""unfortunate"". Mr Woodward's book also cites dozens of letters between Mr Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong-un. In the letters, filled with flowery language, Mr Kim reportedly referred to Mr Trump as ""Your Excellency"" and noted their ""deep and special friendship will work as a magical force"". According to US media, Mr Trump told Mr Woodward of his connection with Mr Kim: ""You meet a woman. In one second, you know whether or not it's going to happen. It doesn't take you 10 minutes and it doesn't take you six weeks. It's like, whoa. OK. You know? It takes somewhat less than a second."" In a tweet on Thursday, Mr Trump wrote: ""Kim Jong Un is in good health. Never underestimate him!"" There have been sporadic reports about Mr Kim's health,including one in April that he was seriously ill or even dead. Mr Trump also reportedly told Woodward that he felt his predecessor, Barack Obama, was ""highly overrated"". ""I don't think Obama's smart,"" Mr Trump reportedly said. ""And I don't think he's a great speaker."" According to CNN, Mr Trump told Mr Woodward he made President George W Bush ""look like a stupid moron, which he was"".

"CCTV caught Salman Abedi in the arena foyer just seconds before he blew himself up Evidence of Manchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi discussing martyrdom was seized almost three years before the attack, an inquiry has heard. The hearing was told Abedi, who killed 22 people in the May 2017 atrocity, had first been linked to ""subjects of interest"" in 2010. A mobile phone seized in February 2017 showed regular contact between Abedi and a convicted terrorist organiser. Paul Greaney QC said their relationship was of ""some significance"". The inquiry heard the device was confiscated from British-Libyan national Abdalraouf Abdallah, who was jailed in 2016 for helping others to reach Syria. Phone analysis revealed he had been in contact with Abedi, who went to visit him in prison, in the months leading up to the attack. In 2014, during investigations into Abdallah, counter terrorism police had evidence of discussions with Abedi regarding ""martyrdom, including the martyrdom of a senior al-Qaeda figure"", the inquiry heard. Mr Greaney said Abdallah had refused to answer any questions put to him by inquiry staff, but investigators were ""determined"" to get to the bottom of their relationship. The inquiry will also examine what intelligence and information was or should have been available to security services and the police about Abedi. Mr Greaney said MI5 had received intelligence about Abedi on two separate occasions in the months prior to the bombing, ""the significance of which was not fully appreciated at the time"". ""In retrospect"", he said, it could ""be seen to be highly relevant to the planned attack"". On 1 May 2017, the inquiry further heard, Abedi had been assessed as meeting the threshold to be considered for further investigation by MI5. He was due to be considered for referral on 31 May 2017 but ""tragically this was overtaken by matters nine days earlier"", Mr Greaney said. The inquiry is being held at Manchester Magistrates' Court, less than a mile away from where the bombing happened During the third day of proceedings, photographs of the 22 victims were displayed on a screen as the public inquiry heard their final movements. Relatives of some of the victims wiped away tears in the hearing room at Manchester Magistrates' Court, while other families watched proceedings from a nearby annexe. The inquiry heard how 21 of the victim suffered injuries which were said to be unsurvivable. But bomb blast experts believe the injuries of John Atkinson, 28, may have been potentially survivable. The bombing after an Ariana Grande concert killed 22 people and injured hundreds more The public inquiry will look at a number of factors including the emergency response to the bombing. It was told how problems with communication and incorrect reports of an ""active shooter"" meant fire engines carrying specialist equipment and stretchers did not arrive for another two hours and six minutes after the blast at 22:31 BST on 22 May 2017. Mr Greaney said the inquiry would need to consider ""whether that absence contributed or may have contributed to the loss of life that occurred"" and ""whether a better response by the emergency services would have saved more lives"". ""There can be no doubt there was a need for such joint working on the night of 22 May 2017 in Manchester,"" he said during the third day of the inquiry. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? The hearing was told North West Fire Control was first notified at 22:34 BST that there had been an explosion and mass casualties, and police were looking for a second device. They also received reports, wrongly, of an ""active shooter"" and some casualties with gunshot wounds. Tributes were left in in St Ann's Square in Manchester city centre in the wake of the bombing But there appeared to be confusion about whether Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) should follow procedures based on the incident being an explosion or a terror bombing. Station manager Simon Berry, of GMFRS, was told a rendezvous point was arranged with police at Manchester Cathedral nearby, but this was rejected in favour of a different ""muster point"" three miles away from the arena. This decision would be ""critical"" to the understanding of how the fire service was delayed so long in deploying to the arena, Mr Greaney said.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Jean Mackenzie spoke to people at the Moria camp months before it was destroyed and reflects on her experiences there Fires have destroyed Greece's largest migrant camp, an overcrowded facility on the island of Lesbos, leaving nearly 13,000 people without shelter. Some 20 firefighters battled the blaze at the Moria camp - designed for fewer than 3,000 people - as migrants, many suffering from smoke exposure, fled. Greece's migration minister said the fires ""began with the asylum seekers"", but did not elaborate. Police blocked roads from the camp to prevent migrants entering nearby towns. Many attempted to carry their belongings to the port town of Mytilene but access was cordoned off. Reports suggest many slept in fields after the fire. EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson has said she has agreed to finance the transfer of 400 unaccompanied teenagers and children to accommodation on the mainland. Fires broke out in more than three places in a short space of time, local fire chief Konstantinos Theofilopoulos told state television channel ERT. Some protesting migrants hindered firefighters who tried to tackle the flames, he said. The main blaze, which was initially fanned by high winds, was put out by Wednesday morning, although Mr Theofilopoulos said there were still some small fires burning inside some containers at the site. Accommodation is urgently required for some 400 unaccompanied minors One local resident told the BBC almost the whole camp was burning. ""Now with the first light I can see that there is a few tents that make it, they are okay, but the rest of the camp, as I can see from this distance, is burnt out,"" Thanasis Voulgarakis said. How the migrant crisis changed Europe Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts Some locals reportedly attacked and prevented migrants from passing through a nearby village after they fled the flames. Authorities placed the Moria camp under quarantine last week after a Somali migrant tested positive for the coronavirus. There are now 35 confirmed cases linked to the site. It is unclear exactly how the fires started, but Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said the ""incidents in Moria began with the asylum seekers because of the quarantine imposed"". Some of the 35 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 had reportedly refused to move into isolation with their families. Mr Mitarachi did not say, however, that the fires were a deliberate act of arson aimed at destroying the camp. Michalis Fratzeskos, deputy mayor for civil protection, told ERT the blaze was ""premeditated"". Migrant tents had been empty, he said, and arsonists had ""taken advantage of strong winds"". Images show the destruction of the site after the blaze But some migrants told BBC Persian the fire had broken out after scuffles between migrants and Greek forces at the camp. Several blamed ""far-right Greeks"" for the blaze after the announcement of coronavirus cases, andtook photos of what they said were canisters used to ignite the flames,external. Marco Sandrone, Lesbos project co-ordinator for MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF), told the BBC it was difficult to say what had caused the blaze, with several different fires and protests erupting in the camp. ""It's a time bomb that finally exploded,"" he said, adding that people had been kept in ""inhumane conditions"" at the site for years. A state of emergency has been declared following the fire at the camp on the island of Lesbos One migrant from Afghanistan, named only as Yaser, told Reuters news agency that the fire had forced everyone to run. ""We don't know where to go, and all the refugees are outside, and trying to find a place to at least just stay,"" he said. The mayor of Mytilene, Stratis Kytelis, said it was ""a very difficult situation because some of those who are outside will include people who are positive [for coronavirus]"". ""The disaster at Moria is total,"" Greek migration ministry secretary Manos Logothetis told ANA news agency, and said he was heading to the site. About 3,000 people are being temporarily housed in tents on Lesbos until alternative shelter can be found, officials said. This video can not be played Some people were injured from smoke exposure as they evacuated the Moria camp Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called an emergency meeting to discuss the fire on Wednesday morning, and several ministers have been sent to Lesbos to assess the situation. The EU has offered to help with the response. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the main priority was ""the safety of those left without shelter"". The camp has reportedly been completely destroyed by the fire German foreign ministerHeiko Maas described the blaze as a ""humanitarian disaster"",externaland tweeted about ""the distribution of refugees among those willing to accept admission in the EU"". Prime Minister of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, later offered to ""take in 1,000 refugees"". A statement issued by UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said it was aware of ""tensions"" between locals and migrants. ""We urge all to exercise restraint,"" it said, and asked anyone who had been at the camp ""to restrict their movements and stay near [the site], as a temporary solution is being found to shelter them"". Protecting yourself from coronavirus in a migrant camp Lesbos migrant camp children 'say they want to die' In 2018, UNHCR urged the Greek government to move asylum seekers away from Lesbos, describing conditions as at ""boiling point"". At the time, there were 8,000 people living in the Moria camp. Migrants have evacuated the camp but have not been allowed to enter the nearby town The Moria Refugee Camp lies north-east of Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos. It has been overwhelmed by huge numbers of refugees for years. According to InfoMigrants,about 70% of people in the camp are from Afghanistan,externalbut migrants from more than 70 different countries live there. An overflow site - the Kara Tepe Refugee Camp - has since been built but there is still not enough space to accommodate all arrivals. For years, thousands of people who arrived on Lesbos were placed in the camp and could not leave until their asylum application was processed on the mainland - a slow, bureaucratic process. The EU has tried to resettle migrants among different member states but governments across the bloc have rejected different proposals, and migrants have waited in squalid conditions. In April,Human Rights Watch said the Greek authorities had not done enough to tackle ""acute overcrowding"",externalat the site, warning it was not prepared for an outbreak of coronavirus. The Greek government plan to build closed detention sites to house migrants on the Greek islands.Protesters on Lesbos attacked authorities in Februarywho brought construction equipment to the island.

"Linden Cameron was shot by police A 13-year-old boy in Glendale, Utah, was shot several times by police officers after his mother called 911 for help with his mental health crisis. Linden Cameron, who has Asperger's, a form of autism, is now in a serious condition in hospital, his mother said. Golda Barton said she had believed police attending on Friday night would use ""the most minimal force possible"". Salt Lake City Police Sgt Keith Horrocks told reporters that the incident was now being investigated. Speaking to local CBS-affiliate KUTV,Ms Barton said she told the 911 operator that her son needed to be taken to hospital for treatment.,external He was experiencing a crisis because it was her first day back at work in almost a year and ""he has bad separation anxiety"", she said. ""I said, he's unarmed, he doesn't have anything, he just gets mad and he starts yelling and screaming,"" Ms Barton said. ""He's a kid, he's trying to get attention, he doesn't know how to regulate."" Don't shoot, I'm disabled Should police be dealing with mental health crises? At a press conference,Sgt Horrocks said officers were called to a ""violent psych issue"",externaland reports that a boy - who they did not name - had made ""threats to some folks with a weapon"". He added that there was no indication when they attended that the boy was armed. An officer shot the boy when he tried to flee on foot, Sgt Horrocks said.

"Richard Ratcliffe has campaigned for Nazanin's release for several years A new charge against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran, is ""a new stage in an long-running political game"", her husband Richard has claimed. ""She is clearly being held as a bargaining chip,"" Mr Ratcliffe said. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe is nearing the end of her sentence for spying charges, which she denies. But on Tuesday, she was told she would face a new trial. The Foreign Office said British officials will try to attend the trial. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in Tehran in April 2016. She had been visiting her parents with her young British-born daughter, Gabriella, who is now six. The dual national was sentenced to five years in prison over allegations of plotting against the Iranian government - although no official charges have ever been made public. Gabriellahas now returned to the UK. What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Earlier this year,Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was given temporary leave from prisonbecause of the coronavirus outbreak and has been living at her parents' house in Tehran with an ankle tag. But on Tuesday,she was told she will face another trial,which will be held on Sunday. This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffeâs husband describes how his daughter Gabriella is coping without her mother The new charge had not previously been publicly disclosed, but Mr Ratcliffe said it was an allegation of ""spreading propaganda against the regime"". ""Her lawyer got to look at the file,"" he told BBC Radio 4 Today programme. ""It looks like the file is really a rehash of what she got convicted of first time round. ""But, you know, previously the evidence has changed between the lawyer reading it and what happens in the court case so we'll only really know on Sunday what she's going to be accused of."" Mr Ratcliffe told BBC Radio 4 that the news was ""certainly very tough for her"", adding: ""I spoke to her just before she went into court. ""That's probably when she was most terrified and in all honesty she had fears that she was being taken back to prison, not to court at all, it was a big trick."" ""She's been really counting down the days until the end of her sentence and suddenly those goalposts look like they are about to move,"" he added to BBC Breakfast. This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) Mr Ratcliffe said his wife and other dual nationals are being held hostage because Iran wants the UK to pay a decades-old debt over an arms deal that was never fulfilled. The UK owes Iran about Â£400m for some Chieftain tanks it promised the former Shah of Iran but never delivered after the 1979 revolution. The UK has agreed to pay the money but can't until a legal way is found to get round the sanctions that currently make repayment impossible. Iran country profile Nazanin's prison leave extended Be tougher with Iran, Nazanin's husband urges PM ""Behind closed doors I've been warning the government that the closer we got to the end of her sentence without things being sorted, the more there was a risk of something happening, and so it's come to pass,"" said Mr Ratcliffe. ""This is definitely political, and it's definitely a new stage in an long-running political game."" He said: ""The UK needs to take a much firmer line to protecting its citizens. It did invoke diplomatic protection more than a year ago - it hasn't done very much with it."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family and the UK government have always maintained her innocence and she has beengiven diplomatic protection by the Foreign Office- meaning the case is treated as a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran. The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said that British officials will seek to attend any new hearings in Iran against Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe. They said in a statement: ""Iran bringing new charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is indefensible and unacceptable. ""We have been consistently clear that she must not be returned to prison.""

"Emily Bendell asked for membership in March and was turned down, so engaged lawyers to mount a legal challenge under the 2010 Equality Act An entrepreneur is challenging a London private member's club over its ""gentlemen-only"" membership policy. Emily Bendell, founder of lingerie brand Bluebella, claims the Garrick Club's rules allowing women to attend only as guests of men violates the Equality Act 2010. The exclusive West End club counts Sir Laurence Olivier and Charles Dickens among its former members. Ms Bendell was denied membership in March. She is now threatening legal action against the Garrick, demanding that it opens membership to women for the first time since it opened in 1831. Talking to the BBC she said: ""I had no idea that this male-only members club still existed and I was quite shocked and surprised that was the case. ""[It's] deeply troubling on a number of levels and so I thought I could see if there was anything there could be done about it. ""These are clubs that have people who run this country as members - what is that telling us? That we are not allowing women to be part of these networks and gatherings? ""By denying women access to these networks, it is detrimental to our cause, so I think it is important. ""I hope that the members of the Garrick Club can see that the world has moved on and do the right thing."" The Garrick Club which counts Sir Laurence Olivier and Charles Dickens among its former members has continued to be ""open to gentlemen members only"" throughout its 189-year history The Garrick Club was founded by a group of ""literary gentlemen"" with the aim of bringing together actors and supporters of theatre. Although the Garrick does not allow female members it employs female members of staff and a letter has been sent to Ann Robbie, the secretary of the Garrick, with a request for a reply by 5 October. The letter states the Garrick is bound, under section 29 of the Equality Act, not to discriminate against a person requiring or seeking to use its services. The letter goes on to outline claims for direct and indirect sex discrimination in respect of its ""gentlemen-only"" policy. The club, founded in 1831 and one of the oldest in the world, was originally formed as a meeting place for men working in drama Ms Bendell's solicitors at Leigh Day said: ""Ms Bendell has a successful career and affinity to the arts and, just as any man in her position would have the opportunity to, she wishes to become a member of the Garrick Club and access the club's services. ""The Garrick is one of the oldest and best-known members' clubs in the world, but it is holding on to values that are outdated and quite simply not legal in this day and age. It provides services to the public and as such it is bound by the equalities law. ""Both the firm and Ms Bendell look forward to receiving confirmation that the Garrick Club intends to change its policy in relation to admission of female members.""

"This video can not be played The prime minister said the new measures were ""not another national lockdown"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said ""we must act"" to avoid another lockdown as virus cases rise in England. He set out a new ""rule of six"",restricting gatherings to a maximum of six people,external, enforced by police able to issue fines or make arrests. Mr Johnson also outlined a ""moonshot"" plan to control the virus with mass testing, possibly by next spring. It comes as the UK reported another 2,659 coronavirus cases, the fourth day running of over 2,000 reported cases. ""I want to be absolutely clear, these measures are not another national lockdown. The whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown,"" Mr Johnson said in the first Downing Street coronavirus briefing since July. He added ""it breaks my heart to have to insist on these restrictions"". How many cases in your area? What are the new rules? Will unis be exempt? And other questions 'It makes children's parties illegal gatherings' In the last week, cases have risen from 12.5 infections per 100,000 people to 19.7 per 100,000 across the UK. Coronavirus was more prevalent among young people, with 54 cases per 100,000 people in the 19 to 21-year-old age group. Mr Johnson also announced that: Venues such as pubs and restaurants will be legally required to request contact details of everyone visiting, hold it for 21 days and provide it to NHS Test and Trace. They face fines of Â£1,000 if they fail to comply Business opening hours could be restricted across the whole nation if cases continue to rise. But initially the measure will be limited to local lockdown areas such as Bolton, where venues must close between 22:00 and 05:00 ""Covid-secure marshals"" will be introduced to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres The passenger locator form, filled out by travellers arriving in the UK to enforce quarantine rules, will be simplified and Border Force will increase enforcement Plans to try out larger audiences in venues later this month will be revised, and the government isreviewing its plan to allow spectators back into sports stadiums from 1 October Mr Johnson said the rules had ""become quite complicated and confusing"" and the government was ""simplifying and strengthening"" them after feedback from police and the public. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the new rules on gatherings were a reflection that ""poor communications were a large part of the problem"" with the spread of the virus. Sir Keir said the government also needed to improve testing, which was ""all over the place"", following reports that some people have been unable to book tests. The prime minister said the government was ""working hard"" to increase testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, but urged people only to book a test if they had coronavirus symptoms. He said they also want to use new types of test ""in the near future"" to identify people who do not have coronavirus and are not infectious so they can live life ""in a more normal way"". He said these swab or saliva tests could be turned around in 90 or even 20 minutes, with millions processed each day. However, BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said such tests were still at the piloting stage, and so were unlikely to be manufactured or distributed before the end of the year. Discussing the plans, the prime minister evoked the Apollo space programme, describing the ""giant collaborative effort"" of this testing programme as a ""moonshot"", which could restore a more normal way of life even if a vaccine or treatment is not available. A report in the BMJ,externalsaid the UK has drawn up plans to carry out up to 10 million Covid-19 tests a day by early next year, at a cost of more than Â£100bn. But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the BMA, said it was unclear how the ""moonshot"" testing would work given the ""huge problems"" currently seen with lab capacity. The Department of Health declined to comment directly on the report, but said it wanted to boost the number of tests with a rapid turnaround time. For all the talk of vaccines and rapid testing, it was clear - certainly listening to UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - that this winter will be hard. Respiratory viruses tend to do better in the autumn and winter because of the colder weather and the fact people mix indoors more. That is why we see flu cases and, sadly, deaths rise every winter. Many experts believe the same will happen in the coming months, despite the latest measures. That means the government faces some very difficult decisions. It has to balance the impact of further restrictions - which can harm health in other ways, as well as damage education and the economy - against the risk of letting the virus spread. The public has a huge role to play. But on its own that may not be enough. Behind the scenes there is lots of focus on how to protect the vulnerable - that could mean locking down care homes and asking people to shield again. But the UK is in a stronger position than it was at the start of the pandemic. The lockdown bought us time. Better treatments are available and, while many problems remain with testing and tracing, the systems in place are an advance on where we were when the virus first hit the UK. These new tests will be piloted with audiences attending indoor and outdoor venues in Salford from next month. But the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the technology needed to be ""tested carefully"" and it would be ""completely wrong to assume this is a slam dunk"". The measures that needed to be taken against coronavirus were ""damaging"" socially, economically and to people with other health conditions, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty acknowledged. ""We have to do them because the alternative is worse,"" he said. He added that ""the period between now and spring is going to be difficult"" and people shouldn't see the restrictions ""as a very short term thing"" because they were unlikely to be lifted after just two or three weeks. Mr Johnson said it was ""too early to say"" if big parties could be held over Christmas, but added that he was ""still hopeful"" some aspects of life could return to normal by the festive season. He said the restrictions would be in place only ""as long as necessary"". ""I'm sorry about that. I wish we did not have to take this step, but as your prime minister I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and save lives,"" he said. The new ""rule of six"" means: Social gatheringsof more than six peoplein England will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 September The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces Itapplies to all ages The ruledoes not apply to schools and workplaces, to people living together or in the same support bubble, or to weddings, funerals and organised team sports Thefull list of exemptions,externalalso includesprotests and political activitiessubject to ""strict risk assessments"", jury service and providing emergency assistance Peoplewho ignore the policecould be fined Â£100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 The chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, Ken Marsh, said the new rules were "" very flimsy"" and would be difficult to enforce. At present, the guidance says two households of any size are allowed to meet indoors or outdoors, or up to six people from different households outdoors. Until now the police have had no powers to stop gatherings unless they exceeded 30. The number of people allowed to meet inside or outside varies in the UK's four nations. If you are meeting indoors:up to eight people,externalfrom three different households can meet inScotland;up to six people,externalfrom two households inNorthern Ireland;up to four households,externalcan form an ""extended household"" inWales.

"Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are relaxing some of the rules around gatherings and mixing with others which were introduced to tackle the spread of Omicron. However, some restrictions remain. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announceda further easing of Covid rules. From Friday 28 January, the requirement for physical distancing in indoor settings where people don't have to wear a face covering - such as those leading religious services - will reduce to 1m (3ft) from 2m (6 ft). Most of the rules governingindoorandoutdoorevents have already been lifted. Covid passports arerequired for nightclubs and large events. All restrictions at outdoor events have now been lifted. On 28 January, nightclubs will reopen, and the so-called ""rule of six"" - where gatherings in pubs and restaurants are limited to six people - will be scrapped. Some restrictions will remain in place: social distancing of 2m (6ft) in all premises open to the public and workplaces, where reasonable licensed premises must take additional measures to protect customers and staff, including table service and collecting contact details face coverings are required in hospitality settings, apart from when seated vaccine passports continue to berequired for venues including restaurants, bars and cinemas Pubs and other hospitality venues now no longer have to offer table service only, and the ""rule of six"", governing the size of groups in hospitality venues, has been scrapped. From Wednesday 26 January: Proof of Covid status ""encouraged"" but no longer legally required for entry to bars, restaurants or cinemas Nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, with dancing and unseated indoor events allowed again - Covid passports will remain in use for these venues (and for partially seated events with 500 or more people in attendance) Some rules remain in place: a maximum of 30 people from an unlimited number of households can meet indoors in domestic settings shops must take ""reasonable measures to manage risk"" and shoppers are asked to maintain physical distance with each other where possible. face coverings are compulsory in shops, indoor seated venues and visitor attractions, public transport and some other settings Thecurrent restrictions in Englanddon't include any limits on socialising - so friends and family are legally allowed to see each other in private houses, or to meet in public places like pubs and nightclubs.

"The government says there is ""high demand"" for coronavirus tests Officials are alarmed by the latest rise in coronavirus cases. Newly diagnosed cases have topped 2,000 for the past three days. The average rate of new infections is now four times higher than it was in mid-July. The rise is real, but is it quite as sharp as it looks? Here are five things to consider. The confirmed cases chart is one we have all got used to. It shows the number of positive Covid-19 tests a day. In April, there were days when 6,000 new cases a day were recorded, so the level of infections in the past few days appears to be some way towards that peak. But at the start of the pandemic, the UK was only largely able to test hospital patients. There was limited testing capacity. This targeted testing meant infections in the community were completely missed, whereas now we have mass testing in the community. It means that if we compare numbers now to numbers during the peak, we are essentially comparing apples with pears. Estimates from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggest there may have been as many as 100,000 cases a day at the end of March. Mass testing in the community only started in the second half of May. Clearly not all cases are now being picked up, although the surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics suggests a large proportion are, whereas earlier in the pandemic maybe only 5% of cases were being detected. So while cases may be rising, the level of infection being seen is still very low compared with the peak. Even after mass testing was launched, the number of tests carried out on a daily and weekly basis has still been increasing. This is because more testing centres have opened and lab capacity to process the tests has increased. It means we are able to look more closely for virus circulating in the community than we were when mass testing first started. If you look at the trend solely in terms of positive cases, the pattern looks like this: But we have to factor in that big increase in testing - there has been an 80% rise since mid-June. When you adjust for the numbers of tests carried out and calculate the percentage of positive tests, the trend looks more like this: The rise seems to be smaller, slower and to have happened more recently. How do I get a coronavirus test? Cases are rising, what should I do? What is the R number and how is it calculated? The increase in testing capacity means the government now has a flexible army of testing facilities. A network of more than 100 mobile units can be dispatched around the country. And despite the current problems with lab capacity, which have meant some people in some places have struggled to get a test, resources are still being focused on areas with the highest rates. Random testing in neighbourhoods has also started in hotspot areas, with people offered tests even if they don't have symptoms. By looking in areas with highest rates of infection, you are more likely to get positive tests. It is telling that over the past week to Sunday, a quarter of new cases were in the 20 local authority areas with the highest rates. They represent just 5% of total local authorities. Over the past few days hospital admissions have started to slowly tick up - though not as much as cases, and it's too soon to know if this is statistically significant. They are a small fraction of the number of admissions back in March, and they are rising much more gradually than they were around the peak. One theory is that more testing is uncovering a larger number of mild cases which don't need treatment. Another is that more of the cases are among younger people, who are less likely to become very ill. But the rise suggests the virus could be taking hold in the community again, and could quickly escalate. Public Health England data shows people in the 20-39 age bracket are testing positive at higher rates than any other age group, and at higher rates than they were earlier in the pandemic. What's harder to say is why that is. It could be behavioural or demographic - that younger people are more likely to have to go out to work, have public facing jobs, live in shared housing and go out to socialise. But it could also be a function of how eligibility for testing has expanded. Younger age groups are much less likely to get seriously sick with coronavirus, and so earlier this year would not have found themselves in hospital where they would have been tested.

"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

"Linden Cameron was shot by police A 13-year-old boy in Glendale, Utah, was shot several times by police officers after his mother called 911 for help with his mental health crisis. Linden Cameron, who has Asperger's, a form of autism, is now in a serious condition in hospital, his mother said. Golda Barton said she had believed police attending on Friday night would use ""the most minimal force possible"". Salt Lake City Police Sgt Keith Horrocks told reporters that the incident was now being investigated. Speaking to local CBS-affiliate KUTV,Ms Barton said she told the 911 operator that her son needed to be taken to hospital for treatment.,external He was experiencing a crisis because it was her first day back at work in almost a year and ""he has bad separation anxiety"", she said. ""I said, he's unarmed, he doesn't have anything, he just gets mad and he starts yelling and screaming,"" Ms Barton said. ""He's a kid, he's trying to get attention, he doesn't know how to regulate."" Don't shoot, I'm disabled Should police be dealing with mental health crises? At a press conference,Sgt Horrocks said officers were called to a ""violent psych issue"",externaland reports that a boy - who they did not name - had made ""threats to some folks with a weapon"". He added that there was no indication when they attended that the boy was armed. An officer shot the boy when he tried to flee on foot, Sgt Horrocks said.

"Emily Bendell asked for membership in March and was turned down, so engaged lawyers to mount a legal challenge under the 2010 Equality Act An entrepreneur is challenging a London private member's club over its ""gentlemen-only"" membership policy. Emily Bendell, founder of lingerie brand Bluebella, claims the Garrick Club's rules allowing women to attend only as guests of men violates the Equality Act 2010. The exclusive West End club counts Sir Laurence Olivier and Charles Dickens among its former members. Ms Bendell was denied membership in March. She is now threatening legal action against the Garrick, demanding that it opens membership to women for the first time since it opened in 1831. Talking to the BBC she said: ""I had no idea that this male-only members club still existed and I was quite shocked and surprised that was the case. ""[It's] deeply troubling on a number of levels and so I thought I could see if there was anything there could be done about it. ""These are clubs that have people who run this country as members - what is that telling us? That we are not allowing women to be part of these networks and gatherings? ""By denying women access to these networks, it is detrimental to our cause, so I think it is important. ""I hope that the members of the Garrick Club can see that the world has moved on and do the right thing."" The Garrick Club which counts Sir Laurence Olivier and Charles Dickens among its former members has continued to be ""open to gentlemen members only"" throughout its 189-year history The Garrick Club was founded by a group of ""literary gentlemen"" with the aim of bringing together actors and supporters of theatre. Although the Garrick does not allow female members it employs female members of staff and a letter has been sent to Ann Robbie, the secretary of the Garrick, with a request for a reply by 5 October. The letter states the Garrick is bound, under section 29 of the Equality Act, not to discriminate against a person requiring or seeking to use its services. The letter goes on to outline claims for direct and indirect sex discrimination in respect of its ""gentlemen-only"" policy. The club, founded in 1831 and one of the oldest in the world, was originally formed as a meeting place for men working in drama Ms Bendell's solicitors at Leigh Day said: ""Ms Bendell has a successful career and affinity to the arts and, just as any man in her position would have the opportunity to, she wishes to become a member of the Garrick Club and access the club's services. ""The Garrick is one of the oldest and best-known members' clubs in the world, but it is holding on to values that are outdated and quite simply not legal in this day and age. It provides services to the public and as such it is bound by the equalities law. ""Both the firm and Ms Bendell look forward to receiving confirmation that the Garrick Club intends to change its policy in relation to admission of female members.""

"This video can not be played The prime minister said the new measures were ""not another national lockdown"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said ""we must act"" to avoid another lockdown as virus cases rise in England. He set out a new ""rule of six"",restricting gatherings to a maximum of six people,external, enforced by police able to issue fines or make arrests. Mr Johnson also outlined a ""moonshot"" plan to control the virus with mass testing, possibly by next spring. It comes as the UK reported another 2,659 coronavirus cases, the fourth day running of over 2,000 reported cases. ""I want to be absolutely clear, these measures are not another national lockdown. The whole point of them is to avoid a second national lockdown,"" Mr Johnson said in the first Downing Street coronavirus briefing since July. He added ""it breaks my heart to have to insist on these restrictions"". How many cases in your area? What are the new rules? Will unis be exempt? And other questions 'It makes children's parties illegal gatherings' In the last week, cases have risen from 12.5 infections per 100,000 people to 19.7 per 100,000 across the UK. Coronavirus was more prevalent among young people, with 54 cases per 100,000 people in the 19 to 21-year-old age group. Mr Johnson also announced that: Venues such as pubs and restaurants will be legally required to request contact details of everyone visiting, hold it for 21 days and provide it to NHS Test and Trace. They face fines of Â£1,000 if they fail to comply Business opening hours could be restricted across the whole nation if cases continue to rise. But initially the measure will be limited to local lockdown areas such as Bolton, where venues must close between 22:00 and 05:00 ""Covid-secure marshals"" will be introduced to help ensure social distancing in town and city centres The passenger locator form, filled out by travellers arriving in the UK to enforce quarantine rules, will be simplified and Border Force will increase enforcement Plans to try out larger audiences in venues later this month will be revised, and the government isreviewing its plan to allow spectators back into sports stadiums from 1 October Mr Johnson said the rules had ""become quite complicated and confusing"" and the government was ""simplifying and strengthening"" them after feedback from police and the public. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the new rules on gatherings were a reflection that ""poor communications were a large part of the problem"" with the spread of the virus. Sir Keir said the government also needed to improve testing, which was ""all over the place"", following reports that some people have been unable to book tests. The prime minister said the government was ""working hard"" to increase testing capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October, but urged people only to book a test if they had coronavirus symptoms. He said they also want to use new types of test ""in the near future"" to identify people who do not have coronavirus and are not infectious so they can live life ""in a more normal way"". He said these swab or saliva tests could be turned around in 90 or even 20 minutes, with millions processed each day. However, BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said such tests were still at the piloting stage, and so were unlikely to be manufactured or distributed before the end of the year. Discussing the plans, the prime minister evoked the Apollo space programme, describing the ""giant collaborative effort"" of this testing programme as a ""moonshot"", which could restore a more normal way of life even if a vaccine or treatment is not available. A report in the BMJ,externalsaid the UK has drawn up plans to carry out up to 10 million Covid-19 tests a day by early next year, at a cost of more than Â£100bn. But Dr Chaand Nagpaul, council chairman of the BMA, said it was unclear how the ""moonshot"" testing would work given the ""huge problems"" currently seen with lab capacity. The Department of Health declined to comment directly on the report, but said it wanted to boost the number of tests with a rapid turnaround time. For all the talk of vaccines and rapid testing, it was clear - certainly listening to UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty - that this winter will be hard. Respiratory viruses tend to do better in the autumn and winter because of the colder weather and the fact people mix indoors more. That is why we see flu cases and, sadly, deaths rise every winter. Many experts believe the same will happen in the coming months, despite the latest measures. That means the government faces some very difficult decisions. It has to balance the impact of further restrictions - which can harm health in other ways, as well as damage education and the economy - against the risk of letting the virus spread. The public has a huge role to play. But on its own that may not be enough. Behind the scenes there is lots of focus on how to protect the vulnerable - that could mean locking down care homes and asking people to shield again. But the UK is in a stronger position than it was at the start of the pandemic. The lockdown bought us time. Better treatments are available and, while many problems remain with testing and tracing, the systems in place are an advance on where we were when the virus first hit the UK. These new tests will be piloted with audiences attending indoor and outdoor venues in Salford from next month. But the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said the technology needed to be ""tested carefully"" and it would be ""completely wrong to assume this is a slam dunk"". The measures that needed to be taken against coronavirus were ""damaging"" socially, economically and to people with other health conditions, chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty acknowledged. ""We have to do them because the alternative is worse,"" he said. He added that ""the period between now and spring is going to be difficult"" and people shouldn't see the restrictions ""as a very short term thing"" because they were unlikely to be lifted after just two or three weeks. Mr Johnson said it was ""too early to say"" if big parties could be held over Christmas, but added that he was ""still hopeful"" some aspects of life could return to normal by the festive season. He said the restrictions would be in place only ""as long as necessary"". ""I'm sorry about that. I wish we did not have to take this step, but as your prime minister I must do what is necessary to stop the spread of the virus and save lives,"" he said. The new ""rule of six"" means: Social gatheringsof more than six peoplein England will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 September The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces Itapplies to all ages The ruledoes not apply to schools and workplaces, to people living together or in the same support bubble, or to weddings, funerals and organised team sports Thefull list of exemptions,externalalso includesprotests and political activitiessubject to ""strict risk assessments"", jury service and providing emergency assistance Peoplewho ignore the policecould be fined Â£100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 The chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, Ken Marsh, said the new rules were "" very flimsy"" and would be difficult to enforce. At present, the guidance says two households of any size are allowed to meet indoors or outdoors, or up to six people from different households outdoors. Until now the police have had no powers to stop gatherings unless they exceeded 30. The number of people allowed to meet inside or outside varies in the UK's four nations. If you are meeting indoors:up to eight people,externalfrom three different households can meet inScotland;up to six people,externalfrom two households inNorthern Ireland;up to four households,externalcan form an ""extended household"" inWales.

"Nicola Sturgeon is leading the daily coronavirus briefing There have been 159 new positive cases since yesterday There have been no further deaths in the past 24 hours of people who had tested positive for the virus 63 of the news confirmed cases are in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde area The first minister warns that the statistics highlight that Scotland and the UK are in a ""very dangerous"" place BBC Scotland News If you are just joining us, here are the headlines that emerged from today's coronavirus briefing:  That's all from us here on the live page, join us tomorrow for extensive coverage of the first minister's statement on the three weekly review of lockdown. Ms Sturgeon will get to her feet at 12:20. Take care and stay safe. Tom Gordon of The Herald asks whether there will be return to simpler, national messages as we head into winter and whether a national lockdown is likely. Ms Sturgeon says she does not want to say whether one scenario is more likely than the other, but adds it would not be credible to rule anything out. The simple measure at the start of the pandemic meant there was a simple message to stay at home, she adds, but says she does not want to go back to that being the message. The first minister says the government is considering how to simplify the measures and regulations, and therefore the messages that flow from them. But by definition it is not as straightforward as the messaging was at the start of the pandemic because the situation is more nuanced, she says. Nicola Sturgeon has said she may consider changes to the rules about the number of people gathering together, like those announced for England. Social gatherings of more than six people will be illegal south of the border from Monday - with some exemptions - amid a steep rise in coronavirus cases. In Scotland, the SNP government's Phase 3 guidelines over social gatherings remain in place in most areas: They are:  Coronavirus restrictions have been reintroduced in five of Scotland's biggest council areas - meaning residents in Glasgow, East and West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire are unable to make indoor visits to other households.

Conor Matchett from The Scotsman asks about plans on furlough, given there is ""no clear movement"" from the UK government following calls to extend the job retention scheme. Ms Sturgeon replies: ""I don't have an alternative to furlough."" She explains this is because Scotland does not have the borrowing powers which are being used by the UK government to fund the scheme. If the UK government doesn't want to extend furlough, then my appeal would be to give extra borrowing powers to the Scottish government she adds. Ms Sturgeon insists it would be unacceptable to ""leave us with no options"" but believes the UK government will not do nothing to prevent a ""tsunami"" of redundancies. Aberdeen and Ross County have been given government permission to host up to 300 fans this weekend Shona
  Duthie from Original
  106 asks if Aberdeen Football Club should be allowed to host a match with 300 people being allowed into the ground. Spectators will be allowed to watchAberdeen play Kilmarnock and Ross County's clash with Celtic in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday. Ms Duthie also asks that given this test event is only two days before the indicative date for the reopening of stadia, is this a clear signal we won't be seeing the return of fans for some time to come. The first minister declines to pre-empt tomorrow's announcement, but points out she has used terms like ""putting the brakes on"" due to the evidence she has seen. People can draw the direction of travel from that, she says. Alan Smith from Bauer asks how many people are dealing with the long-term effects of Covid-19 and whether information is being gathered in this. He points to 28-year-old Callum O'Dwyer, who became ill near the start of the pandemic and is still suffering long-term impacts today. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Sturgeon says Callum's story highlights young people are not immune from the virus, including the long-term, chronic effects of it which had led him to have to move back in with his parents. ""Don't assume this is an illness you don't have to worry about if you are young,"" she adds. Dr Gregor Smith explains many viruses have an impact on the immune system which can lead to the long-term effects being felt by Callum and others. He adds there is research happening on how to support people who are suffering from this. Peter

  Border highlights the different public health guidance in England and Scotland. He asks if the first minister should not just pick up the phone to Matt Hancock and create the same rules and guidance on either side of the border. Ms Sturgeon replies: ""Look, we'll make the decisions we think are right for Scotland."" The first minister points out the change in England announced last night did not lead to the difference between countries as the guidelines were already different. She explains in England 30 people were allowed to gather in a house, now it's six. In Scotland only eight people can gather in a house from a maximum of three households, she points out. She warns against creating confusion pointing out ""people are no daft"" and most people know which part of the UK they live in. BBC Scotland's Graham Stewart asks about evidence people are abiding by the new restrictions and what would trigger more drastic measures. He also asks whether the data on local authorities cases per 100,000 could be published every day. Ms Sturgeon says the government is happy to publish more data to help people understand the situation, but she adds the case number per 100,000 is not the only piece of data which is considered. Regarding adherence to restrictions, she highlights the difficulty of policing this but surveys suggest people are, in the main, following them. The decision on further restrictions will depend on data and the judgements of scientific advisers, she adds. Any changes to restrictions which might be made off the back of the announcement south of the border will be announced tomorrow, the first minister says. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is holding a press conference at 16:00 today on restrictions in England. Ms Sturgeon tells the briefing the best way to keep the economy open, getting more normality and preventing the virus running out of control is to ensure everyone sticks to the public health guidelines. The first minister asks people to think carefully about things they value in their lives as some could be put in jeopardy if the virus continues to spread. ""Letting our guard down does allow the virus to spread."" Nicola Sturgeon stresses again people must follow the five
pieces of advice in FACTS: They are: Ms Sturgeon explains she cannot rule out changes to the rules about the number of people gathering together, like those that were announced for England last night which restricted groups to no more than six. The first minister says the government is carefully reviewing the guidance and regulations, as well as considering what new steps may be necessary to keep Covid under control. She inists: ""All of us have a part to play in this."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Sturgeon says Scotland is currently at a very dangerous point in tackling the pandemic. The first minister warns that the current level of cases could translate into deaths if we are not very careful. She warns that students coming back may be a welcome step, but it is also a risky development. ""That is why tomorrow's review of the lockdown regulations is likely, based on all of the recent data, to take a very cautious approach to any further changes."" Nicola Sturgeon turns to the economy and says the RBS publication on the jobs market in Scotland revealed recruitment declined last month, even after the steeper falls earlier in the pandemic. Demand for permanent staff continues to decline in every sector of the economy apart from IT. The first minister explains the report again underlines the extent of the economic crisis caused by Covid and the need for exceptional support for businesses. She calls again for the UK job extension scheme to continue, because if it ends in October it will put many jobs at risk. Ms Sturgeon highlights the average daily case number of the last seven days is 155. Three weeks ago, this number was 52 - so there has been roughly a trebling of daily cases in this time. Ms Sturgeon says the provisional data indicates the breakdown of new cases is as follows:  The remaining are spread across the other mainland health boards, meaning there has been a case in every mainland area for the second day in a row. First
Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms a further 159 people have tested positive for
Covid-19, 1.9% of those newly tested yesterday. She highlights this positively rate is now consistently around 2%, compared to 1% a few weeks ago. This
takes the total number of positive cases in Scotland to 21,878. A total of 274 patients
are in hospital with a confirmed case (up seven), with six being
treated in intensive care (no change). No
deaths were registered in the last 24 hours of people who tested positive,
meaning the total remains at 2,499. This is lower than the 4,231 deaths confirmed by NRS earlier as that figure includes all cases where Covid-19 is mentioned on a death certificate, even if the patient had not been tested. Nicola Sturgeon will lead the daily briefing from 12.15pm Nicola Sturgeon will lead the Scottish government daily briefing from 12.15pm. The interim Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith will join the first minister today. The briefing is likely  be dominated by grim statistics, with the revelation that thetotal number of deaths in Scotland rose by a thirdbetween April and June. A total of 4,231 Scots
deaths have been linked to Covid-19, official figures show. The National Records of Scotland (NRS) figures
indicate two people died in the week ending 6 September, a decrease of five from
the previous week. Both of these deaths took place in hospital, meaning for the first time in months no deaths from Covid-19 have been recorded in a care home. These figures include all cases where Covid-19 is
mentioned on a death certificate, even if the patient had not been tested. If you're just joining us here are the headlines from around Scotland: Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.2207915
"US troops have been deployed to Iraq since 2014 to help combat the Islamic State group The US will withdraw more than a third of its troops from Iraq within weeks, its top Middle East commander has said. Gen Kenneth McKenzie told reporters the troop presence would be reduced from about 5,200 to 3,000 during September. Those remaining will continue to advise and assist Iraqi security forces in ""rooting out the final remnants"" of the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). Last month, US President Donald Trump reaffirmed that he planned to pull all troops out of Iraq as soon as possible. Has Trump kept his promises on the military? What is the future of US troops in Iraq? He is expected to hail the reduction of forces as progress towards his 2016 election campaign promise to disentangle the US from ""endless wars"". The presence of US troops has also become a major issue in Iraq since the US killed top Iranian general Qasem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad in January. During a visit to Baghdad, Gen McKenzie said the US military had confidence in the Iraqi Security Forces' increased ability to operate independently and to deal with the continuing threat of IS, which once controlled huge swathes of Iraq. ""In recognition of the great progress the Iraqi forces have made and in consultation and co-ordination with the government of Iraq and our coalition partners, the United States has decided to reduce our troop presence in Iraq from about 5,200 to 3,000 troops during the month of September,"" he told reporters. Iraqi PM Mustafa al-Kadhimi recently discussed the US troop presence with Donald Trump ""This reduced footprint allows us to continue advising and assisting our Iraqi partners in rooting out the final remnants of [IS] in Iraq and ensuring its enduring defeat,"" he added. Gen McKenzie said the US would continue expanding ""partner capacity programmes"", and that its ultimate goal was having local forces who were capable of preventing a resurgence of IS and securing Iraq's sovereignty without help. The decision also follows a backlash over alleged comments Mr Trump made calling American soldiers killed in action ""losers"" and ""suckers"". The president has denied the claims. On Monday, Mr Trump also suggested there was a rift with top military leaders, telling reporters: ""I'm not saying the military's in love with me."" He added that while the soldiers are, Pentagon officials ""probably aren't because they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs and make the planes and make everything else stay happy"". Trump denies claims he mocked American war dead US to withdraw 12,000 troops from Germany Can Nato survive President Donald Trump? The US is also to withdraw troops from Afghanistan and Germany. All American soldiers could be out of Afghanistan by next April per an agreement signed with the Taliban earlier this year. In Germany, close to 12,000 troops will be relocated in a move that has seen pushback from lawmakers who believe it will embolden Russia. In 2003, US-led forces invaded Iraq to overthrow President Saddam Hussein and eliminate weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist. President George W Bush promised a ""free and peaceful Iraq"" but the country was engulfed by a sectarian insurgency that cost tens of thousands of lives. US-led coalition forces left handed over the Camp Taji military base last month US combat troops withdrew from Iraq in 2011 after President Barack Obama's administration failed to negotiate a new agreement governing their status. In 2014, when IS seized control of large parts of Iraq, US forces returned at the invitation of the Iraqi government as part of an international coalition tasked with training and advising the Iraqi security forces. The Baghdad government declared the military defeat of IS at the end of 2017 but about 5,000 US personnel remained to help Iraq prevent a jihadist resurgence. Despite continuing attacks by IS sleeper cells, some Iraqi political groups - many of them linked to Iran - began demanding that US and other foreign troops leave. Those calls attracted widespread support following the drone strike that killed Soleimani, an Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander who Mr Trump alleged was the ""number-one terrorist anywhere in the world"". This video can not be played Qasem Soleimani: Who was Iran's 'rock star' general? The attack was condemned by then caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi as a ""clear breach of the terms of the American forces' presence"". The Iraqi parliament subsequently approved a non-binding bill urging the government to ""cancel the request for help it presented to the international coalition"". However, it was never implemented. Iran meanwhile responded by launching ballistic missiles at two Iraqi military bases hosting US forces. More than 100 US troops suffered traumatic brain injuries. US officials have also accused Iran-aligned Iraqi militias of carrying out a series of rocket attacks targeting foreign military and civilian personnel, including one in March that killed two Americans and one British soldier.

"Racing has been held behind closed doors since 1 June before the pilot event started at Doncaster on Wednesday Doncaster Racecourse has been told by local health officials to stop spectators attending its St Leger meeting after Wednesday's opening day. ""On the grounds of public health and public safety I have instructed the course to hold the St Leger Festival behind closed doors from tomorrow,"" said Dr Rupert Suckling, director of Public Health for Doncaster. More than 2,500 spectators bought tickets for Doncaster on Wednesday as the Leger meeting started amid uncertainty over new government rules. It was the first crowd at a British horse racing fixture in six months - since the coronavirus pandemic lockdown - as part of a government pilot scheme for sporting events. Arena Racing Company (Arc), which runs Doncaster Racecourse, confirmed the remainder of the four-day meeting will be held without spectators. It says the decision will cost the company about Â£250,000. ""It's cost a lot trying to get this right. The team have done an amazing job and I feel so sorry for them - some have only been back off furlough for two weeks,"" said Mark Spincer, the managing director of Arena's racing division. ""This isn't just a blow for racing, it's sport. It's going to make it slower and harder for everyone to get back, but we have to follow the advice."" The next racing pilots scheduled at Warwick and Newmarket this month are still set to go ahead, but with a reduced capacity of 1,000. Spectators were allowed at Doncaster on the first day of the St Leger meeting The government said on Tuesday night that social gatherings in England would reduce from a maximum of 30 to six people from Monday in response to rising numbers of coronavirus cases. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said more details will be announced on Wednesday. The rate of infection in Doncaster has been among the lowest in the country - and was at 10.6 per 100,000 on Wednesday. But Doncaster mayor Ros Jones said the risk of holding the fixture with crowds was ""too great"" and welcomed the reversal. ""I believe holding the St Leger Festival behind closed doors is the right thing to do for the safety of the borough, given the latest change in Government's advice overnight and the increase in infection rates both in Doncaster and nationally,"" said the mayor. ""I welcome this decision and as I have said consistently that the risks were too great for Doncaster."" Racing has been held behind closed doors since resuming on 1 June after a 10-week suspension because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Up to 3,640 people were permitted entry on Wednesday, and the racecourse says more than 2,500 tickets have been sold. A limit of 6,202 was planned on the other days, including Saturday, when the Leger - the world's oldest Classic race - is staged. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played The BBC's Jean Mackenzie spoke to people at the Moria camp months before it was destroyed and reflects on her experiences there Fires have destroyed Greece's largest migrant camp, an overcrowded facility on the island of Lesbos, leaving nearly 13,000 people without shelter. Some 20 firefighters battled the blaze at the Moria camp - designed for fewer than 3,000 people - as migrants, many suffering from smoke exposure, fled. Greece's migration minister said the fires ""began with the asylum seekers"", but did not elaborate. Police blocked roads from the camp to prevent migrants entering nearby towns. Many attempted to carry their belongings to the port town of Mytilene but access was cordoned off. Reports suggest many slept in fields after the fire. EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson has said she has agreed to finance the transfer of 400 unaccompanied teenagers and children to accommodation on the mainland. Fires broke out in more than three places in a short space of time, local fire chief Konstantinos Theofilopoulos told state television channel ERT. Some protesting migrants hindered firefighters who tried to tackle the flames, he said. The main blaze, which was initially fanned by high winds, was put out by Wednesday morning, although Mr Theofilopoulos said there were still some small fires burning inside some containers at the site. Accommodation is urgently required for some 400 unaccompanied minors One local resident told the BBC almost the whole camp was burning. ""Now with the first light I can see that there is a few tents that make it, they are okay, but the rest of the camp, as I can see from this distance, is burnt out,"" Thanasis Voulgarakis said. How the migrant crisis changed Europe Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts Some locals reportedly attacked and prevented migrants from passing through a nearby village after they fled the flames. Authorities placed the Moria camp under quarantine last week after a Somali migrant tested positive for the coronavirus. There are now 35 confirmed cases linked to the site. It is unclear exactly how the fires started, but Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said the ""incidents in Moria began with the asylum seekers because of the quarantine imposed"". Some of the 35 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 had reportedly refused to move into isolation with their families. Mr Mitarachi did not say, however, that the fires were a deliberate act of arson aimed at destroying the camp. Michalis Fratzeskos, deputy mayor for civil protection, told ERT the blaze was ""premeditated"". Migrant tents had been empty, he said, and arsonists had ""taken advantage of strong winds"". Images show the destruction of the site after the blaze But some migrants told BBC Persian the fire had broken out after scuffles between migrants and Greek forces at the camp. Several blamed ""far-right Greeks"" for the blaze after the announcement of coronavirus cases, andtook photos of what they said were canisters used to ignite the flames,external. Marco Sandrone, Lesbos project co-ordinator for MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF), told the BBC it was difficult to say what had caused the blaze, with several different fires and protests erupting in the camp. ""It's a time bomb that finally exploded,"" he said, adding that people had been kept in ""inhumane conditions"" at the site for years. A state of emergency has been declared following the fire at the camp on the island of Lesbos One migrant from Afghanistan, named only as Yaser, told Reuters news agency that the fire had forced everyone to run. ""We don't know where to go, and all the refugees are outside, and trying to find a place to at least just stay,"" he said. The mayor of Mytilene, Stratis Kytelis, said it was ""a very difficult situation because some of those who are outside will include people who are positive [for coronavirus]"". ""The disaster at Moria is total,"" Greek migration ministry secretary Manos Logothetis told ANA news agency, and said he was heading to the site. About 3,000 people are being temporarily housed in tents on Lesbos until alternative shelter can be found, officials said. This video can not be played Some people were injured from smoke exposure as they evacuated the Moria camp Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis called an emergency meeting to discuss the fire on Wednesday morning, and several ministers have been sent to Lesbos to assess the situation. The EU has offered to help with the response. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the main priority was ""the safety of those left without shelter"". The camp has reportedly been completely destroyed by the fire German foreign ministerHeiko Maas described the blaze as a ""humanitarian disaster"",externaland tweeted about ""the distribution of refugees among those willing to accept admission in the EU"". Prime Minister of the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, later offered to ""take in 1,000 refugees"". A statement issued by UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, said it was aware of ""tensions"" between locals and migrants. ""We urge all to exercise restraint,"" it said, and asked anyone who had been at the camp ""to restrict their movements and stay near [the site], as a temporary solution is being found to shelter them"". Protecting yourself from coronavirus in a migrant camp Lesbos migrant camp children 'say they want to die' In 2018, UNHCR urged the Greek government to move asylum seekers away from Lesbos, describing conditions as at ""boiling point"". At the time, there were 8,000 people living in the Moria camp. Migrants have evacuated the camp but have not been allowed to enter the nearby town The Moria Refugee Camp lies north-east of Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos. It has been overwhelmed by huge numbers of refugees for years. According to InfoMigrants,about 70% of people in the camp are from Afghanistan,externalbut migrants from more than 70 different countries live there. An overflow site - the Kara Tepe Refugee Camp - has since been built but there is still not enough space to accommodate all arrivals. For years, thousands of people who arrived on Lesbos were placed in the camp and could not leave until their asylum application was processed on the mainland - a slow, bureaucratic process. The EU has tried to resettle migrants among different member states but governments across the bloc have rejected different proposals, and migrants have waited in squalid conditions. In April,Human Rights Watch said the Greek authorities had not done enough to tackle ""acute overcrowding"",externalat the site, warning it was not prepared for an outbreak of coronavirus. The Greek government plan to build closed detention sites to house migrants on the Greek islands.Protesters on Lesbos attacked authorities in Februarywho brought construction equipment to the island.

"An e-sports company in which David Beckham owns a significant stake is seeking to raise Â£20m by listing its shares on the London Stock Exchange. Guild Esports will be the first in the UK to offer fans the chance to put money into backing its teams of gamers. E-sports, where spectators watch players video gaming, has seen its popularity rise during lockdown. The company plans to field teams in the global online games Fortnite, CS:GO, Rocket League and Fifa. It wants to build up its teams' skills using systems similar to the Premier League's talent academics. Prize and sponsorship money for e-sports run in the millions and audiences run to more than 100 million for some events, outstripping those for major sporting events such as Wimbledon and the Tour de France. Figures from from Newzoo, a games market insights company, show that 2019, e-sports had a total of 443 million viewers in 2020. Newzoo predicts the market will grow to 646 million viewers by 2023. The shares will initially be offered to large investors next month, but afterwards will trade freely on the stock market where anyone can buy them. Money raised from the initial share placing will be used to expand the business, including recruiting new players. The investment further extends David Beckham's wide-ranging business interests, which include fashion, fragrances, whisky and a football club in Florida that he co-owns. Guild Esports said he would use his ""global influence and following to support the development of the company's brand and business"". Beckham is one of the founding shareholders in the business, holding what is described as a ""significant minority stake"", although the exact investment is undisclosed. He is not the first footballer to spot the potential opportunities in e-sports. Wales and Real Madrid playerGareth Bale launched his e-sports organisation, Ellevens Esports, earlier this year. Carleton Curtis, the executive chairman of Guild Esports, said: ""Guild will be the first e-sports franchise to join the London stock market. ""It will provide us with the cache, credibility and capital to fulfil our ambition to become one of the world's top 10 e-sports franchises within three years."" Can you make a living from esports?

"Beaches were closed along the Gold Coast following the attack An Australian man has been killed in a shark attack off Queensland's Gold Coast, marking the first fatal attack at the tourist city's beaches in over 60 years. Nick Slater, 46, was at Greenmount Beach at Coolangatta - a well-known surf spot - when a shark mauled his leg on Tuesday. Nearby surfers found him floating in shallow water next to his board. He was rushed to shore and given first aid but died at the scene. Authorities closed an 18km (11-mile) section of beaches on Wednesday to conduct helicopter and jetski searches for the shark - reported to be a 3m great white. ""Once we know that the shark is not in the vicinity or we have tracked it, then the beach will be reopened,"" said the city's mayor Tom Tate. Teenage surfer killed by shark in Australia Australia surfer saves wife by punching shark He said it was the first shark death at a Gold Coast beach since 1958, adding authorities were investigating the event. Mr Slater, a local real estate agent, had been surfing next to Snapper Rocks point, which hosted a World Surf League competition in March. Nick Slater had been surfing at a popular beach One witness told the Courier Mail newspaper Mr Slater had been bitten across the upper leg, and ""it was pretty much all taken"". A surfer who provided help, Jade Parker, said there was a large bite mark on Mr Slater's board. ""It was probably about the same circumference as a basketballâ¦ and there was a tooth still lodged in the fibreglass which I had to remove,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The Gold Coast is one of Australia's most famous tourist destinations, popular for its long white-sand beaches, surfing breaks and inland waterways. Its beaches have been protected by shark nets and drumlines - baited hooks suspended underwater - since the 1960s, and shark attacks have been rare. How do you stop sharks attacking? Officials said it was too early to say whether additional shark protection measures would be needed. The Gold Coast saw a fatal shark attack in 2003, but that incident occurred inland in sprawling canals connected to the sea. Mr Slater's death is the sixth fatal attack by a shark in Australia this year, with most occurring along the country's east coast. In June, two surfers were fatally attacked in separate incidents off nearby northern New South Wales.

"This video can not be played Footage shows the EasyJet pilot refusing to accept Nick's medical exemption card A man with serious breathing issues says he was ""ambushed"" into wearing a face covering on a plane. EasyJet has apologised after one of its pilots was filmed threatening to remove the passenger from the flight. The man was carrying an exemption card - but it was rejected by the crew on his journey from Jersey to Gatwick. Face coverings on UK public transport are mandatory but some people are allowed not to wear them, due to age, health or disability reasons. Wearing a face covering is ""strongly recommended"" on the Island of Jersey, but certain groups are allowed not to wear them, including those with breathing difficulties. The BBC has also been told of cases where people with lung conditions have been turned away from shops and other types of public transport because they were unable to wear a mask. Charities say exemptions must be respected by companies and understood by the public. With masks now a part of daily life, the challenge for many is striking a balance between safety procedures and protecting vulnerable people. Coronavirus: Hancock concern over 'sharp rise' in cases Coronavirus: New figures show UK faces 'impossible balancing act' Nick says he can't wear anything around his face or neck because he has chronic asthma. ""Whether it's a polo neck or a scarf round your face, the sensation is stifling. I just find it increasingly difficult to breathe,"" he says. ""It's like a steel belt round my chest."" Research suggests face coverings can help reduce the spread of coronavirus, particularly indoors where physical distancing is difficult. The Department for Transport for England says those who are exempt can choose to carry a card, badge or a homemade sign. However, providing documentation is a personal choice and not necessary in law. Nick showed his exemption card to the pilot Nick had printed off an official exemption card from the government's website before flying to the island of Jersey to see his family in August. The card was accepted on the flight out, but on the return journey the crew said it was not valid and he would have to wear a mask. Nick refused. He says: ""The staff came to speak to me around six times. The 30-minute delay was seen as my fault and each visit whipped up more hostility among the passengers. ""I was insulted, shouted at, laughed at. It felt like everybody was against me."" Nick says he became so desperate he started filming on his phone. Footage shows the pilot refusing to accept his exemption card and saying if Nick didn't put on a mask, he ""was off"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering Nick eventually agreed, but says it caused him to hyperventilate during the hour-long flight. ""I would do anything to avoid wearing anything that restricts my breathing. That's more terrifying than being insulted by 100 passengers, but eventually I felt like I had no choice."" Shaken by the ""storm of abuse"" he says he received from other passengers, Nick requested partial anonymity when speaking to the BBC. EasyJet says all customers are required to wear a face covering but acknowledges some passengers may not be able to. A statement from the airline said: ""We have recently updated our policies in line with recent UK government guidance so that as well as a medical certificate, customers can alternatively provide a relevant document from a government website or lanyard. ""We are sorry that this new policy was not recognised by the crew on this occasion."" The airline described Nick's behaviour as ""disruptive"", but a passenger, who did not want to be named, said he behaved ""calmly"" in a ""stressful situation"". ""No-one seemed to care about his condition. The staff should have taken him away from the other passengers to have the conversation in private,"" he tells the BBC. Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation called Nick's story a distressing case, but says there are others like him. ""The government is really clear there are exemptions from wearing a mask,"" explains Head of Policy, Sarah MacFadyen. ""The vast majority of people with lung conditions are fine wearing a mask, but for a small number it is impossible for them to breathe. That's why these exemptions are in place, so they can still go out and live their lives."" THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TESTING:What tests are available?

"Gordon and Margaret Minto were shocked to learn that British Airways will not return the Â£4,748 they paid for their flights. British Airways passengers have told the BBC that they have been refused cash refunds for cancelled flights. Gordon and Margaret Minto accepted vouchers instead after their flights to the United States were cancelled, the airline says. ""We were stunned... we looked at each other and said, 'we haven't asked for a voucher'. We haven't received one either"", says Margaret. BA said it will ""always provide a refund if a customer is eligible"". But the Mintos from South Shields are among many holidaymakers who have found themselves in a stand-off with the airline after their flights were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The airline maintains they accepted vouchers, while they all say they never wanted vouchers at all. Under EU law, when a flight is cancelled passengers are entitled to their money back within seven days. Airlines are still free to offer them the chance to rebook or to take vouchers, which can be used on different flights in future, if that is what a customer prefers. The Mintos had spent Â£4,748 on five tickets for them and family members to fly from Newcastle via London to Dallas and Las Vegas. They say they always wanted a cash refund but communicating that wish to British Airways was difficult. The airline used to offer an online facility where people could request money back for cancelled flights. It called it ""the quickest way"" to get a refund. But when Covid-19 struck and thousands of flights were being cancelled, that option was removed from the company's website. BA says it was because its system was not set up to deal with that volume of traffic, so passengers who wanted refunds were asked to ring the company instead. The problem was many passengers then struggled to get through on the phone lines too. The Mintos gave up and emailed BA asking for their money back. They got a reply saying, as far as the airline was concerned, they had accepted vouchers already and could not exchange them for cash. All the more puzzling, according to Margaret, was the response they got from a BA staff member when they did manage to get through on the telephone. ""They said, 'I'm sorry I cannot find anything on the system which shows that you've accepted a voucher and I am going to go to a superior and ring you back in three days'. That was the last we heard from them and that was two and a half weeks ago,"" she says. When the BBC contacted British Airways, the airline insisted Mr and Mrs Minto had filled out a voucher request form as there is ""no way"" in which its system would issue vouchers without one. Yet other British Airways customers who were after cash refunds for cancelled flights are also claiming vouchers were automatically issued to them. ""I didn't complete a form asking for a voucher and, to the best of my knowledge, I didn't click anything asking for a voucher,"" says Terry Lloyd from Barnet in North London. ""In the end it seemed to me the only sensible option was to say to the customer services, 'well show me the form which you alleged I completed'. Despite repeated requests, they will not send it to me. I can only assume it's because it doesn't exist. I'm totally disenchanted with them. It is a pathetic piece of obfuscation on their part."" Other customers say they filled out voucher application forms by mistake after logging into their accounts looking for ways to get their money back. David Hunter accepts that he made a mistake but feels that he was ""misled"" by British Airways' website. At one stage the BA website displayed two buttons, one labelled ""change booking"" and the other labelled ""cancel booking"" with a message underneath which said: ""There's no extra cost for any changes and we offer a refund if you cancel your booking"". People who clicked ""cancel booking"" hoping for a refund were actually taken to an application form for vouchers. It had ""Future Travel Voucher Application Form"" written in large letters at the top and a box to tick at the bottom acknowledging acceptance of vouchers, but several people seem to have missed that. David Hunter from Sutton in Surrey says he got ""suckered in"" by the previous page which promised a refund and filled out the form thinking that was what he was getting. He only realised his error after pressing submit and, within the hour, managed to get through to British Airways on the telephone. ""British Airways said 'no, that's it, that is what you selected that's what you're getting,"" he says, meaning he's stuck with a voucher for his Â£768 return flights to Seychelles. David Travers QC, a barrister specialising in trading standards and consumer protection law, believes the fact that a number of people have been misled does ""rather suggest"" that the British Airways website was misleading. ""There is something unattractive, people might think, about a large commercial concern playing 'gotcha' with a customer - if you read that more carefully you would have realised what we were doing. ""That is something the courts and the legislation have taken some trouble to treat with a degree of caution because of the inequality of the position between the consumer and the business,"" he says. BA says the voucher process is clearly worded but has failed to explain why part of its website appeared to offer a refund but took people to a voucher application form instead. The regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, says if consumers feel misled then they should open a complaint about their experience, first with the airline and then, if they are not satisfied with the response, they can seek redress via the approved alternative dispute resolution service, which in the case of British Airways is the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR). ""We will always provide a refund if a customer is eligible and we're offering flexibility if any of our customers need to change their flights,"" British Airways said in a statement. ""Since March we have provided more than 1.67 million customers with cash refunds and more than 1.3 million with vouchers to fly with us that they can use right up until April 2022"".

BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly says the bill will ""protect the internal market of the United Kingdom."" Speaking on Politics Live on BBC Two, he added: ""The Prime Minister, and the whole government has made it absolutely clear that we want to make sure that Northern Ireland has unfettered access to the United Kingdom, as an integral part of the United Kingdom. ""We are working to make sure the whole of the United Kingdom has got good access to the European market.  These are the two things that we're negotiating towards. And actually, if the EU shows the pragmatism and flexibility that I think and we think they should, then we can achieve both."" The deputy first minister of Northern Ireland has called on the Irish government to insist the UK adheres to international law. Michelle O'Neill - vice president of Sinn Fein - said: ""We have fought very hard for the last three-and-a-half years, since the Brexit debate started, to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to make sure there is no hard border on this island and to protect our all-island economy. ""That was achieved in the protocol, that's what must be delivered upon and any attempt by the British Government to circumvent that, to try to override that is not acceptable to the EU side and certainly shouldn't be acceptable to the Irish Government."" Sir Keir Starmer has 'serious concerns' about the new bill There was already a lot of fury from the opposition parties over the controversial UK Internal Markets Bill. Now it's been published, Labour says it has ""serious concerns"", and it is already looking at ""potential amendments"" for the legislation. Sir Keir Starmer's official spokesman also said they were concerned about potential breaches in the ministerial code if civil servants have been directed by ministers to break the law over the withdrawal agreement -remember what Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said about the new bill yesterday. The spokesman said: ""Yes, there are concerns and there's an urgent question in the Commons tomorrow on this matter."" BBC Politics As you would expect, there's a huge amount of detail in the legislation that has just been published, running to 50 pages. But here are the main points of the Internal Markets Bill, which sets out how the internal market between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will operate after the Brexit
transition period ends.     Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Politics The Internal Markets Bill may have only just been published but the European Commission has already made its concerns clear, saying they are ""very urgent and very pressing"". While the bloc says it has yet to study the legislation in detail, it is seeking an urgent meeting of the Joint EU-UK Committee responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement as the ""most appropriate venue"" for discussing the repercussions. MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, the Commission's vice president, says he is seeking assurances the UK will ""fully and
timely comply"" with the Agreement including the protocol on Northern Ireland. ""The Withdrawal Agreement is not open for
renegotiation and we expect the letter and the spirit of the withdrawal agreement will be fully respected.
I think on that we have to be very, very clear.""     Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor After all of the enormous palaver and concern over the last few days, the bill has now been published. In black and white, it confirms the government wants ministers to have powers over state aid - government financial support for businesses - in Northern Ireland. And it wants ministers to have powers to make regulations and rules about goods in Northern Ireland. Why does that matter? Remember in the withdrawal agreement with the EU, Northern Ireland is still in the UK, but it has to follow elements of the EU's customs code. It will be seen by the EU as a pretty brazen attempt to override the deal that has been done. For legal eagles out there, the bill contains the word ""notwithstanding"". That basically means this law sets aside a law we have already agreed. That was described to me earlier in the week as being a completely nuclear option. And they have pressed it.

Reality Check The prime minister also said that coronavirus
testing had increased from 2,000 in March to 320,000 now. As of 2 September, labs had the capacity
to process 369,000 tests a day, according to government figures. However, just under 250,000 of this
capacity is reserved for Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 tests, or the tests used by those
with coronavirus symptoms and should be self-isolating. On September 2, just over 170,000 tests
were processed within this capacity. The rest of the capacity is reserved for
antibody or other tests, which can see if youâve had the virus in the
past. Since 23 March, when the UK went into
lockdown, capacity has increased from 10,000 tests. BBC parliamentary correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

PMQs may be over but there is one more bit of drama in the chamber. Sir Desmond Swayne - a Tory MP known for criticising lockdown restrictions - complains that the latest measure to reduce the number who can gather was not announced in the Commons, meaning MPs couldn't question the minister. He asks the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle: ""What remedy is there for those who enthusiastically support the prime minister but nevertheless want to restrain the government's ability to govern by order without debate?"" Sir Lindsay says he is ""very sympathetic"" with the point, and that decisions made by government are having to be made fast. But, he says, it is ""really not good enough"", revealing he has sent a letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock on the matter. Raising his voice, the Speaker adds: ""I think the total disregard for this chamber is not acceptable."" And he calls on the PM to ensure it doesn't happen again - and to get his colleague to apologise to MPs. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent PMQs was interesting for what was not raised as well as
what was. A range of former Conservative ministers and chairs of
cross party committees have said on social media and in some cases privately
that they were worried about the government breaching international law but not
one raised concerns publicly with the PM. Labour maintained a laser-like focus on testing with Keir
Starmer's theme taken up from backbenchers too. Boris Johnson will hope his tactic -that Labour is
attacking an ""heroic"" NHS service not the government - will resonate with those
worried about the testing regime. The press and public will get their opportunity to ask
the PM questions on his handling of the crisis at the media conference at 16:00. The last question of the session is from Lib Dem former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael, returning to the subject of Brexit. He says he would never support a ""wildcat"" independence referendum for Scotland, because it would be a breach of international law. He asks the PM how he could counter future attempts to hold an unauthorised vote in Scotland when his government has threatened to breach international law itself over the Withdrawal Agreement. In response, the PM seeks at greater length to explain his position, saying he is seeking to give the UK and NI a ""legal safety net"" should a future relationship deal with the EU not be agreed, He says the government has an obligation to protect Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement from an ""excessive and irrational"" interpretation of the Withdrawal Agreement which would create a border down the Irish Sea.   Reality Check During PMQs, the prime minister said âmost
people get an in-person test result within 24 hoursâ. The latest testing statistics run up to 26 August.,external In pillar 1 testing - thatâs tests
carried out by Public Health England labs and NHS hospitals - 89% of tests were
completed within 24 hours of receipt at the lab. For pillar 2 testing - which is
most other testing - the median turnaround time for regional test sites was 24
hours, which means half of tests took more than a day and half took less. For mobile testing units the
figure was 22 hours, satellite testing centres took 76 hours and home testing
kits took 86 hours. Tory MP Mark Eastwood asks the prime minister to reassure the people of Dewsbury that that they will be taken out of local lockdown measures ""sooner rather than later"" if the infection rates drop. Johnson thanks the people of the town for their ""fortitude and local action"" while restrictions have been in place. He adds: ""As soon as we see results in local lockdowns, we do take them out of local lockdown, and I have no doubt that will happen in Dewsbury and elsewhere."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson has urged MPs to support a bill which modifies the Brexit deal he signed with the EU in January. The PM said theInternal Markets Bill,externalwould ""ensure the integrity of the UK internal market"" and hand power to Scotland and Wales. He also claimed it would protect the Northern Ireland peace process. Critics say the move will damage the UK's international standing after a minister admitted the plans break international law. The Scottish government has not ruled out legal action to prevent it becoming law. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""The Tories' proposed bill for a so-called UK internal market is an abomination. It is a naked power grab which would cripple devolution."" The Taoiseach (Ireland's prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin has spoken to Mr Johnson ""in forthright terms"" about ""the breach of an international treaty, the absence of bilateral engagement and the serious implications for Northern Ireland"", the Irish government said. Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove will hold emergency talks in London on Thursday with EU Commissioner Maros Sefcovic to discuss the contents of the bill. The European Commission had requested a meeting as soon as possible to clarify what the legislation means for the Brexit deal. Meanwhile, the latest scheduled round of negotiations on securing a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU are also due to wrap up on Thursday. As it happened: PM questions How could the Northern Ireland Brexit deal change? Senior government lawyer quits over Brexit plans UK firms 'under-prepared' for new EU trade rules Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted,external: ""Very concerned about announcements from the British government on its intentions to breach the Withdrawal Agreement. This would break international law and undermines trust."" Downing Street said the EU Withdrawal Agreement - repeatedly described as ""oven ready"" by Mr Johnson during last year's general election - contained ""ambiguities"" and lacked clarity in ""key areas"". EU negotiator Michel Barnier arrives in London for talks The PM's spokesman said it had been agreed ""at pace in the most challenging possible political circumstances"" to ""deliver on a decision by the British people"". It had been signed ""on the assumption that subsequent agreements to clarify these aspects could be reached"", the spokesman added. The new bill sets out rules for the operation of the UK internal market - trade between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - after the end of the Brexit transition period in January. It proposes: No new checks on goods moving from Northern Ireland to the rest of Great Britain Giving UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods that will come into force from 1 January if the UK and EU are unable to reach an alternative agreement through a trade deal Powers to override previously agreed obligations on state aid - government support for businesses The bill explicitly states that these powers should apply even if they are incompatible with international law. Ministers say the legislation is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. But senior Conservatives have warned it risks undermining the UK's reputation as an upholder of international law. Former PM Sir John Major fears the UK will lose its reputation for keeping its word Former Prime Minister Sir John Major said: ""For generations, Britain's word - solemnly given - has been accepted by friend and foe. Our signature on any treaty or agreement has been sacrosanct."" He added: ""If we lose our reputation for honouring the promises we make, we will have lost something beyond price that may never be regained."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to consider ""the reputational risk that it's taking in the proposed way forward"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the UK government should consider the âreputational riskâ in its approach. But Sir Keir - who campaigned for a second Brexit referendum - added that the ""way forward"" now was to get a trade deal, adding ""if you fail to get a deal, prime minister, you own that failure"". ""The outstanding issues are not difficult. They can be resolved. So what I say to the prime minister is, you promised a good deal, get on, negotiate it,"" he added. ""That's what's in the national interest and focus then on the issue in hand which is tackling this pandemic."" In the withdrawal agreement with the EU, Northern Ireland is still in the UK, but it has to follow elements of the EU's customs code. This bill will be seen by the EU as a pretty brazen attempt to override the deal that has been done. The bill contains the words ""notwithstanding"" - that basically means this law sets aside a law we have already agreed. That was described to me earlier in the week as being a completely nuclear option. And they have pressed it. This row isn't going to go away. The Democratic Unionist Party, which has been pressing for changes to the Withdrawal Agreement, said the bill was a ""step forward"" but the government must ensure Northern Ireland is not ""restrained in a state aid straight jacket unlike the rest of the UK"". But the deputy first minister of Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein's Michelle O' Neill, said the Withdrawal Agreement protected the Good Friday Agreement and it was ""astounding"" the UK government ""thinks its fine"" to wreck an international treaty they had signed up to. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said: ""My job is to uphold the integrity of the UK but also to protect the Northern Ireland peace process and the Good Friday Agreement. ""And to do that, we need a legal safety net to protect our country against extreme or irrational interpretations of the Protocol, which could lead to a border down the Irish Sea, in a way that I believe would be prejudicial to the interests of the Good Friday Agreement and prejudicial to the interests of peace in our country. And that has to be our priority."" Commenting on a similar argument by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, a former minister told the BBC: ""I cannot allow anyone to get away with saying the government is doing this to protect the peace process. This does the precise opposite."" The legislation will see Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland handed powers in areas such as air quality and building efficiency currently regulated at EU level. It will also set up a new body - the Office for the Internal Market - to make sure standards adopted in different parts of the UK do not undermine cross-border trade. The Scottish government fears the UK single market will cut across areas that are usually devolved. For example, if the UK government decides some food imports are acceptable in England then they would also be allowed in Scotland, even though agriculture is devolved. The new body will be able to issue non-binding recommendations to the UK Parliament and devolved administrations when clashes emerge.

The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, described the Internal Markets Bill as ""nothing short of an attack on Scotland's parliament and an affront to people of Scotland"". Mr Johnson said the bill would protect jobs and growth - and was a ""massive devolutionary act"" that would represent a ""very substantial transfer of power and sovereignty"" to Scotland and Wales. But his words did not preventthe resignation of a senior Conservative in Wales, where the party is in opposition. David Melding, shadow Counsel General, said in his resignation letter that the PM's actions in the past few days had ""gravely aggravated"" the dangers facing ""our 313-year-old Union"".

""It is with heavy hearts that we've made the difficult decision as a family to say goodbye to Keeping Up With The Kardashians,"" she said in a statement posted on Twitter. The show has run for 14 years, and made global mega-stars of Kim, her siblings, their parents, partners and children. The final season, its 21st, will air in early 2021.

Most of the family were unknown when the show started in 2007. Kim had appeared in some episodes of her friend Paris Hilton's reality show and her attorney father, Robert, was known for defending OJ Simpson at his infamous murder trial. Robert Kardashian died in 2003. Early shows focused on the lives of Kim and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe and their partners, including Kourtney's ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, Kim's ex-husband Kris Humphries and Khloe's ex-husband Lamar Odom. It eventually brought in ""momager"" Kris Jenner, her now ex-husband Caitlyn Jenner - then the only famous figure in the show, as an Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete - and half sisters Kylie and Kendall Jenner. Despite being heavily-panned by critics and accused of making people famous for being famous, the show has enjoyed huge ratings, won awards and been one of E! channel's most successful shows. Kim, 39, has since become one of the world's most celebrated women, with hundreds of millions of social media followers and a thriving beauty business. She married rapper Kanye West in 2014, with whom she has four children and a reputed joint net worth of more than a billion dollars.She recently spoke about her husband's mental health issuesfollowing a series of erratic statements from him as he began a run for the US presidency. Kendall and Kylie Jenner were children when the show first began in 2007, but became stars in their own right, and are now - at the ages of 24 and 23 - among the world's most important influencers. In 2019, the latterwas named by Forbes magazine as the youngest self-made billionaire of all timethanks to her hugely popular cosmetics business. But in May, the magazine accused her family of inflating the value of her the business, andstruck her from its list of billionaires.

"The National Records of Scotland figures cover the period when the pandemic was at its peak in Scotland The number of people who died in Scotland at the height of the coronavirus outbreak was a third higher than usual, according to official figures. National Records of Scotland (NRS) said 18,201 deaths had been registered between April and June. This was 4,515 higher than the five-year average. Covid-19 was the underlying cause in 3,739 deaths, accounting for 83% of the excess deaths. Deaths from diabetes, dementia and Alzheimer's Disease were about a quarter higher than the five-year average, the NRS said. And deaths from diseases of the genitourinary system increased by 22.5%. However, deaths from respiratory diseases decreased by 20.6% and deaths from transport accidents were down by 69.1%. Chief Medical Officer Gregor Smith said the reasons for the higher than usual number of deaths would be better understood ""in the fullness of time"", and urged people to seek treatment for any medical concerns they may have. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland The three-month period covers the height of the coronavirus lockdown in Scotland when schools and businesses were closed, and traffic on all roads was significantly reduced. Regular health care had been disrupted after NHS Scotland was placedon an emergency footingin mid-March to deal with the outbreak. Accident and Emergency attendances dropped tobelow half their normal levelsduring April, Public Health Scotland data shows. It is also possible that some deaths attributed to other causes at the start of the outbreak were undiagnosed Covid-19 cases. Dr Smith said there were ""signals"" from the latest data that ""shows excess deaths go beyond what we would expect directly from Covid"", highlighting those linked to Alzheimers and dementia in particular. He said: ""We need to understand why that is the case - are these deaths being contributed to by Covid, or are they for some other reasons? ""Over the fullness of time we will be able to much better understand why these deaths are apparent in the system."" Earlier in the pandemic there was a concern that an increase in deaths linked to cardiovascular conditions may have been down to ""people not presenting for treatment"" when they needed it. Dr Smith said: ""The message we've had all along is that for these urgent conditions, the NHS remains open. ""If you have symptoms we urge you to seek help and don't just sit on it - there is capacity in the NHS for you to get the care you need."" Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland was at a ""dangerous point"" in the fight against coronavirus, with cases on the rise Age Scotland said the steep rise in excess deaths from dementia, diabetes and other causes during the lockdown was ""extremely concerning"" and needed further investigation. The charity's chief executive, Brian Sloan, said older people had ""borne the brunt"" of the pandemic and had been at greater risk of dying from other causes. ""While it's hard to speculate on the reasons, it's likely there is a link to the pandemic,"" he said. ""We know that health and social services were under a huge strain during these months, and many people were reluctant or unable to seek medical assistance."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said every death linked to the virus ""represents the loss of an irreplaceable individual"". The latest NRS report said only two deaths had been recorded in the week to Sunday where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, with none of them in care homes for the first time in the pandemic. However, Ms Sturgeon warned that people must be vigilant about increasing numbers of cases. And she did not rule out Scotland following England in reducing the number of people who can meet at the same time. She said the number of new cases of coronavirus reported each day in Scotland had ""roughly trebled"" over the past three weeks. The rolling seven day average of new daily cases over the past week was 152 - compared to 52 three weeks earlier. The percentage of people tested who return a positive result has also gone up from being ""around 1%"" to consistently being around 2%. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I hope you can see why the situation just now is a matter of concern to us, and why we need to continue to work as hard as we can to keep the virus under control.""

"Gordon and Margaret Minto were shocked to learn that British Airways will not return the Â£4,748 they paid for their flights. British Airways passengers have told the BBC that they have been refused cash refunds for cancelled flights. Gordon and Margaret Minto accepted vouchers instead after their flights to the United States were cancelled, the airline says. ""We were stunned... we looked at each other and said, 'we haven't asked for a voucher'. We haven't received one either"", says Margaret. BA said it will ""always provide a refund if a customer is eligible"". But the Mintos from South Shields are among many holidaymakers who have found themselves in a stand-off with the airline after their flights were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. The airline maintains they accepted vouchers, while they all say they never wanted vouchers at all. Under EU law, when a flight is cancelled passengers are entitled to their money back within seven days. Airlines are still free to offer them the chance to rebook or to take vouchers, which can be used on different flights in future, if that is what a customer prefers. The Mintos had spent Â£4,748 on five tickets for them and family members to fly from Newcastle via London to Dallas and Las Vegas. They say they always wanted a cash refund but communicating that wish to British Airways was difficult. The airline used to offer an online facility where people could request money back for cancelled flights. It called it ""the quickest way"" to get a refund. But when Covid-19 struck and thousands of flights were being cancelled, that option was removed from the company's website. BA says it was because its system was not set up to deal with that volume of traffic, so passengers who wanted refunds were asked to ring the company instead. The problem was many passengers then struggled to get through on the phone lines too. The Mintos gave up and emailed BA asking for their money back. They got a reply saying, as far as the airline was concerned, they had accepted vouchers already and could not exchange them for cash. All the more puzzling, according to Margaret, was the response they got from a BA staff member when they did manage to get through on the telephone. ""They said, 'I'm sorry I cannot find anything on the system which shows that you've accepted a voucher and I am going to go to a superior and ring you back in three days'. That was the last we heard from them and that was two and a half weeks ago,"" she says. When the BBC contacted British Airways, the airline insisted Mr and Mrs Minto had filled out a voucher request form as there is ""no way"" in which its system would issue vouchers without one. Yet other British Airways customers who were after cash refunds for cancelled flights are also claiming vouchers were automatically issued to them. ""I didn't complete a form asking for a voucher and, to the best of my knowledge, I didn't click anything asking for a voucher,"" says Terry Lloyd from Barnet in North London. ""In the end it seemed to me the only sensible option was to say to the customer services, 'well show me the form which you alleged I completed'. Despite repeated requests, they will not send it to me. I can only assume it's because it doesn't exist. I'm totally disenchanted with them. It is a pathetic piece of obfuscation on their part."" Other customers say they filled out voucher application forms by mistake after logging into their accounts looking for ways to get their money back. David Hunter accepts that he made a mistake but feels that he was ""misled"" by British Airways' website. At one stage the BA website displayed two buttons, one labelled ""change booking"" and the other labelled ""cancel booking"" with a message underneath which said: ""There's no extra cost for any changes and we offer a refund if you cancel your booking"". People who clicked ""cancel booking"" hoping for a refund were actually taken to an application form for vouchers. It had ""Future Travel Voucher Application Form"" written in large letters at the top and a box to tick at the bottom acknowledging acceptance of vouchers, but several people seem to have missed that. David Hunter from Sutton in Surrey says he got ""suckered in"" by the previous page which promised a refund and filled out the form thinking that was what he was getting. He only realised his error after pressing submit and, within the hour, managed to get through to British Airways on the telephone. ""British Airways said 'no, that's it, that is what you selected that's what you're getting,"" he says, meaning he's stuck with a voucher for his Â£768 return flights to Seychelles. David Travers QC, a barrister specialising in trading standards and consumer protection law, believes the fact that a number of people have been misled does ""rather suggest"" that the British Airways website was misleading. ""There is something unattractive, people might think, about a large commercial concern playing 'gotcha' with a customer - if you read that more carefully you would have realised what we were doing. ""That is something the courts and the legislation have taken some trouble to treat with a degree of caution because of the inequality of the position between the consumer and the business,"" he says. BA says the voucher process is clearly worded but has failed to explain why part of its website appeared to offer a refund but took people to a voucher application form instead. The regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, says if consumers feel misled then they should open a complaint about their experience, first with the airline and then, if they are not satisfied with the response, they can seek redress via the approved alternative dispute resolution service, which in the case of British Airways is the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution (CEDR). ""We will always provide a refund if a customer is eligible and we're offering flexibility if any of our customers need to change their flights,"" British Airways said in a statement. ""Since March we have provided more than 1.67 million customers with cash refunds and more than 1.3 million with vouchers to fly with us that they can use right up until April 2022"".

"Final clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, have been put on hold after a participant had a suspected adverse reaction in the UK. AstraZeneca described it as a ""routine"" pause in the case of ""an unexplained illness"". The outcome of vaccine trials is being closely watched around the world. The AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine is seen as a strong contender among dozens being developed globally. Oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response How close to developing a vaccine are we? What drugs can help treat coronavirus? Hopes have been high that the vaccine might be one of the first to come on the market, followingsuccessful phase 1 and 2 testing,external. Its move to Phase 3 testing in recent weeks has involved some 30,000 participants in the US as well as in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. Phase 3 trials in vaccines often involve thousands of participants and can last several years. The New York Times is reporting a volunteer in the UK trial has been diagnosed with transverse myelitis,external, an inflammatory syndrome that affects the spinal cord and can be caused by viral infections. However, the cause of the illness has not been confirmed and an independent investigation will now work out if there was any link to the vaccine. At first glance this may seem alarming.  A vaccine trial - and not just any vaccine, but one receiving massive global attention - is put on hold due to a suspected serious adverse reaction.  But such events are not unheard of.  Indeed the Oxford team describe it as ""routine"".  Any time a volunteer is admitted to hospital and the cause of their illness is not immediately apparent it triggers a study to be put on hold. This is actually the second time it has happened with the Oxford University/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial since the first volunteers were immunised in April.  An Oxford University spokesperson said: ""In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully."" A final decision on restarting the trial will be taken by the medical regulator the MHRA, which could take only days.  But until then all international vaccination sites, in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and the USA are on hold. The Oxford University team believe this process illustrates that they are committed to the safety of their volunteers and the highest standards of conduct in their studies. Wellcome Trust director Sir Jeremy Farrar, an expert in infectious disease control, said there were often pauses in vaccine trials and it was important any adverse reactions were taken seriously. ""It is crucial that all that data is shared openly and transparently because the public must have absolute trust that these vaccines are safe and effective and, in the end, will hopefully bring the pandemic to a close,"" Sir Jeremy added. UK experts have said a temporary pause could be seen as a good thing because it showed the researchers are prioritising the safety of vaccine above everything else. People can develop side-effects from taking any drug but they can also fall ill naturally. US President Donald Trump has said he wants a vaccine available in the US before 3 November's election, but his comments have raised fears that politics may be prioritised over safety in the rush for a vaccine. On Tuesday, a group of nine Covid-19 vaccine developers sought to reassure the public by announcing a ""historic pledge"" to uphold scientific and ethical standards in the search for a vaccine. AstraZeneca is among the nine firms who signed up to the pledge to only apply for regulatory approval after vaccines have gone through three phases of clinical study. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Industry giants Johnson & Johnson, BioNTech, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Merck, Moderna, Sanofi and Novavax are the other signatories. They pledged to ""always make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority"". Short cuts and 'dirty tricks' in the scramble for a vaccine How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? The World Health Organization (WHO) says nearly 180 vaccine candidates are being tested around the world but none has yet completed clinical trials. The organisation has said it does not expect a vaccine to meet its efficacy and safety guidelines in order to be approved this year because of the time it takes to test them safely. Similar sentiments have been shared by Thomas Cueni, director-general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers. The industry body represents the companies that signed the pledge. Despite this, China and Russia have begun inoculating some key workers with domestically developed vaccines. All of them are still listed by the WHO as being in clinical trials. Meanwhile, the US national regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has suggested that coronavirus vaccines may be approved before completing a third phase of clinical trials. Last week it also emerged that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had urged states to consider waiving certain requirements in order to be ready to distribute a potential vaccine by 1 November - two days before the 3 November presidential election. Although President Trump has hinted that a vaccine might be available before the election, his Democratic rival Joe Biden has expressed scepticism that Mr Trump will listen to scientists and implement a transparent process.

The simple measure at the start of the pandemic meant there was a simple message to stay at home, she adds, but says she does not want to go back to that being the message. The first minister says the government is considering how to simplify the measures and regulations, and therefore the messages that flow from them. But by definition it is not as straightforward as the messaging was at the start of the pandemic because the situation is more nuanced, she says. Nicola Sturgeon has said she may consider changes to the rules about the number of people gathering together, like those announced for England. Social gatherings of more than six people will be illegal south of the border from Monday - with some exemptions - amid a steep rise in coronavirus cases. In Scotland, the SNP government's Phase 3 guidelines over social gatherings remain in place in most areas: They are:  Coronavirus restrictions have been reintroduced in five of Scotland's biggest council areas - meaning residents in Glasgow, East and West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire are unable to make indoor visits to other households.

Conor Matchett from The Scotsman asks about plans on furlough, given there is ""no clear movement"" from the UK government following calls to extend the job retention scheme. Ms Sturgeon replies: ""I don't have an alternative to furlough."" She explains this is because Scotland does not have the borrowing powers which are being used by the UK government to fund the scheme. If the UK government doesn't want to extend furlough, then my appeal would be to give extra borrowing powers to the Scottish government she adds. Ms Sturgeon insists it would be unacceptable to ""leave us with no options"" but believes the UK government will not do nothing to prevent a ""tsunami"" of redundancies. Aberdeen and Ross County have been given government permission to host up to 300 fans this weekend Shona
  Duthie from Original
  106 asks if Aberdeen Football Club should be allowed to host a match with 300 people being allowed into the ground. Spectators will be allowed to watchAberdeen play Kilmarnock and Ross County's clash with Celtic in the Scottish Premiership on Saturday. Ms Duthie also asks that given this test event is only two days before the indicative date for the reopening of stadia, is this a clear signal we won't be seeing the return of fans for some time to come. The first minister declines to pre-empt tomorrow's announcement, but points out she has used terms like ""putting the brakes on"" due to the evidence she has seen. People can draw the direction of travel from that, she says. Alan Smith from Bauer asks how many people are dealing with the long-term effects of Covid-19 and whether information is being gathered in this. He points to 28-year-old Callum O'Dwyer, who became ill near the start of the pandemic and is still suffering long-term impacts today. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Sturgeon says Callum's story highlights young people are not immune from the virus, including the long-term, chronic effects of it which had led him to have to move back in with his parents. ""Don't assume this is an illness you don't have to worry about if you are young,"" she adds. Dr Gregor Smith explains many viruses have an impact on the immune system which can lead to the long-term effects being felt by Callum and others. He adds there is research happening on how to support people who are suffering from this. Peter

  Border highlights the different public health guidance in England and Scotland. He asks if the first minister should not just pick up the phone to Matt Hancock and create the same rules and guidance on either side of the border. Ms Sturgeon replies: ""Look, we'll make the decisions we think are right for Scotland."" The first minister points out the change in England announced last night did not lead to the difference between countries as the guidelines were already different. She explains in England 30 people were allowed to gather in a house, now it's six. In Scotland only eight people can gather in a house from a maximum of three households, she points out. She warns against creating confusion pointing out ""people are no daft"" and most people know which part of the UK they live in. BBC Scotland's Graham Stewart asks about evidence people are abiding by the new restrictions and what would trigger more drastic measures. He also asks whether the data on local authorities cases per 100,000 could be published every day. Ms Sturgeon says the government is happy to publish more data to help people understand the situation, but she adds the case number per 100,000 is not the only piece of data which is considered. Regarding adherence to restrictions, she highlights the difficulty of policing this but surveys suggest people are, in the main, following them. The decision on further restrictions will depend on data and the judgements of scientific advisers, she adds. Any changes to restrictions which might be made off the back of the announcement south of the border will be announced tomorrow, the first minister says. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is holding a press conference at 16:00 today on restrictions in England. Ms Sturgeon tells the briefing the best way to keep the economy open, getting more normality and preventing the virus running out of control is to ensure everyone sticks to the public health guidelines. The first minister asks people to think carefully about things they value in their lives as some could be put in jeopardy if the virus continues to spread. ""Letting our guard down does allow the virus to spread."" Nicola Sturgeon stresses again people must follow the five
pieces of advice in FACTS: They are: Ms Sturgeon explains she cannot rule out changes to the rules about the number of people gathering together, like those that were announced for England last night which restricted groups to no more than six. The first minister says the government is carefully reviewing the guidance and regulations, as well as considering what new steps may be necessary to keep Covid under control. She inists: ""All of us have a part to play in this."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Sturgeon says Scotland is currently at a very dangerous point in tackling the pandemic. The first minister warns that the current level of cases could translate into deaths if we are not very careful. She warns that students coming back may be a welcome step, but it is also a risky development. ""That is why tomorrow's review of the lockdown regulations is likely, based on all of the recent data, to take a very cautious approach to any further changes."" Nicola Sturgeon turns to the economy and says the RBS publication on the jobs market in Scotland revealed recruitment declined last month, even after the steeper falls earlier in the pandemic. Demand for permanent staff continues to decline in every sector of the economy apart from IT. The first minister explains the report again underlines the extent of the economic crisis caused by Covid and the need for exceptional support for businesses. She calls again for the UK job extension scheme to continue, because if it ends in October it will put many jobs at risk. Ms Sturgeon highlights the average daily case number of the last seven days is 155. Three weeks ago, this number was 52 - so there has been roughly a trebling of daily cases in this time. Ms Sturgeon says the provisional data indicates the breakdown of new cases is as follows:  The remaining are spread across the other mainland health boards, meaning there has been a case in every mainland area for the second day in a row. First
Minister Nicola Sturgeon confirms a further 159 people have tested positive for
Covid-19, 1.9% of those newly tested yesterday. She highlights this positively rate is now consistently around 2%, compared to 1% a few weeks ago. This
takes the total number of positive cases in Scotland to 21,878. A total of 274 patients
are in hospital with a confirmed case (up seven), with six being
treated in intensive care (no change). No
deaths were registered in the last 24 hours of people who tested positive,
meaning the total remains at 2,499. This is lower than the 4,231 deaths confirmed by NRS earlier as that figure includes all cases where Covid-19 is mentioned on a death certificate, even if the patient had not been tested. Nicola Sturgeon will lead the daily briefing from 12.15pm Nicola Sturgeon will lead the Scottish government daily briefing from 12.15pm. The interim Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith will join the first minister today. The briefing is likely  be dominated by grim statistics, with the revelation that thetotal number of deaths in Scotland rose by a thirdbetween April and June. A total of 4,231 Scots
deaths have been linked to Covid-19, official figures show. The National Records of Scotland (NRS) figures
indicate two people died in the week ending 6 September, a decrease of five from
the previous week. Both of these deaths took place in hospital, meaning for the first time in months no deaths from Covid-19 have been recorded in a care home. These figures include all cases where Covid-19 is
mentioned on a death certificate, even if the patient had not been tested. If you're just joining us here are the headlines from around Scotland: Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0

BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme Foreign Office Minister James Cleverly says the bill will ""protect the internal market of the United Kingdom."" Speaking on Politics Live on BBC Two, he added: ""The Prime Minister, and the whole government has made it absolutely clear that we want to make sure that Northern Ireland has unfettered access to the United Kingdom, as an integral part of the United Kingdom. ""We are working to make sure the whole of the United Kingdom has got good access to the European market.  These are the two things that we're negotiating towards. And actually, if the EU shows the pragmatism and flexibility that I think and we think they should, then we can achieve both."" The deputy first minister of Northern Ireland has called on the Irish government to insist the UK adheres to international law. Michelle O'Neill - vice president of Sinn Fein - said: ""We have fought very hard for the last three-and-a-half years, since the Brexit debate started, to protect the Good Friday Agreement, to make sure there is no hard border on this island and to protect our all-island economy.

Sir Keir Starmer has 'serious concerns' about the new bill There was already a lot of fury from the opposition parties over the controversial UK Internal Markets Bill. Now it's been published, Labour says it has ""serious concerns"", and it is already looking at ""potential amendments"" for the legislation. Sir Keir Starmer's official spokesman also said they were concerned about potential breaches in the ministerial code if civil servants have been directed by ministers to break the law over the withdrawal agreement -remember what Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said about the new bill yesterday. The spokesman said: ""Yes, there are concerns and there's an urgent question in the Commons tomorrow on this matter.""

testing had increased from 2,000 in March to 320,000 now. As of 2 September, labs had the capacity

capacity is reserved for Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 tests, or the tests used by those
with coronavirus symptoms and should be self-isolating. On September 2, just over 170,000 tests
were processed within this capacity. The rest of the capacity is reserved for

past. Since 23 March, when the UK went into
lockdown, capacity has increased from 10,000 tests. BBC parliamentary correspondent tweets... Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

PMQs may be over but there is one more bit of drama in the chamber. Sir Desmond Swayne - a Tory MP known for criticising lockdown restrictions - complains that the latest measure to reduce the number who can gather was not announced in the Commons, meaning MPs couldn't question the minister. He asks the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle: ""What remedy is there for those who enthusiastically support the prime minister but nevertheless want to restrain the government's ability to govern by order without debate?"" Sir Lindsay says he is ""very sympathetic"" with the point, and that decisions made by government are having to be made fast. But, he says, it is ""really not good enough"", revealing he has sent a letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock on the matter. Raising his voice, the Speaker adds: ""I think the total disregard for this chamber is not acceptable."" And he calls on the PM to ensure it doesn't happen again - and to get his colleague to apologise to MPs. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent PMQs was interesting for what was not raised as well as
what was. A range of former Conservative ministers and chairs of
cross party committees have said on social media and in some cases privately
that they were worried about the government breaching international law but not
one raised concerns publicly with the PM. Labour maintained a laser-like focus on testing with Keir
Starmer's theme taken up from backbenchers too. Boris Johnson will hope his tactic -that Labour is
attacking an ""heroic"" NHS service not the government - will resonate with those
worried about the testing regime. The press and public will get their opportunity to ask
the PM questions on his handling of the crisis at the media conference at 16:00. The last question of the session is from Lib Dem former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael, returning to the subject of Brexit. He says he would never support a ""wildcat"" independence referendum for Scotland, because it would be a breach of international law. He asks the PM how he could counter future attempts to hold an unauthorised vote in Scotland when his government has threatened to breach international law itself over the Withdrawal Agreement. In response, the PM seeks at greater length to explain his position, saying he is seeking to give the UK and NI a ""legal safety net"" should a future relationship deal with the EU not be agreed, He says the government has an obligation to protect Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement from an ""excessive and irrational"" interpretation of the Withdrawal Agreement which would create a border down the Irish Sea.

people get an in-person test result within 24 hoursâ. The latest testing statistics run up to 26 August.,external In pillar 1 testing - thatâs tests
carried out by Public Health England labs and NHS hospitals - 89% of tests were
completed within 24 hours of receipt at the lab. For pillar 2 testing - which is
most other testing - the median turnaround time for regional test sites was 24
hours, which means half of tests took more than a day and half took less. For mobile testing units the
figure was 22 hours, satellite testing centres took 76 hours and home testing
kits took 86 hours.

"EU negotiator Michel Barnier arrives in London for talks The government will later publish plans which could override key elements of its Brexit deal with Brussels, in breach of international law. The Internal Market Bill will set out how powers currently held by the EU will be shared out after the post-Brexit transition period ends. But it has faced a backlash from senior Tories and prompted the resignation of a top civil servant. It comes as the talks over a trade deal with the EU continue in London. The Internal Market Bill could override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement that secured the UK's exit from the EU in January. Minister: New bill will 'break international law' Ministers unveil post-Brexit powers for UK nations Fresh row over devolved powers after Brexit What do I need to know about Brexit now? Ministers say it is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. But senior Conservatives have warned it risks undermining the UK's reputation as an upholder of international law. Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, said the UK would ""lose the moral high ground"" if the government went through with the changes. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said: ""Our entire economy is based on the perception that people have of the UK's adherence to the rule of law."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted the changes were necessary to protect the Northern Ireland peace process if the UK failed to get a free trade deal with the EU. ""The decision we've made is to put the peace process first, first and foremost as our absolute top international obligation,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. A former Cabinet minister, involved in putting together the Withdrawal Agreement, reacted furiously to Mr Hancock's claim. The former minister, who did not want to be named, told the BBC: ""I cannot allow anyone to get away with saying the government is doing this to protect the peace process. This does the precise opposite. ""It is about the internal market in the UK and is more likely to lead to a hard border [between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland] which will imperil the peace process."" The permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department, Sir Jonathan Jones, hasresigned from his roleover concerns about the government breaching its obligations under international law. This video can not be played Brandon Lewis has said the bill contains powers that would break international law. In the Commons on Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis admitted the bill would break international law in a ""very specific and limited way"". It would allow the UK government to ""dis-apply"" the EU legal concept of ""direct effect"" - which gives EU law supremacy over UK law in areas covered by the Withdrawal Agreement - in ""certain, very tightly defined circumstances,"" he told MPs. The Scottish government, meanwhile, has said it will not consent to a change in the law along these lines, arguing that it would undermines devolution. The bill has also been attacked by the Welsh Brexit minister, Labour's Jeremy Miles, who accused the government of ""stealing powers from devolved administrations"". ""This bill is an attack on democracy and an affront to the people of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland,"" he added. The legislation will see Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland handed powers in areas such as air quality and building efficiency currently regulated at EU level. It will also set up a new body - the Office for the Internal Market - to make sure standards adopted in different parts of the UK do not undermine cross-border trade. The new body will be able to issue non-binding recommendations to the UK Parliament and devolved administrations when clashes emerge. However, plans to hand UK ministers extra powers to ensure the application of customs and trade rules in Northern Ireland have prompted a row over the UK's legal obligations in its exit deal. Under the UK's withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland is due to stay part of the EU's single market for goods in a bid to avoid creating a hard border with the Irish Republic. In parallel with talks over a post-Brexit trade deal, the UK and EU are negotiating the precise nature of new customs checks that will be required. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has accused Downing Street of ""reopening old arguments that had been settled"" and said the government should instead focus on securing a deal with the EU. Former Conservative PM Theresa May warned the legislation could damage ""trust"" in the UK over future trade deals with other states. Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Coveney, called Mr Lewis's comments ""gravely concerning"".

"Final clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, have been put on hold after a participant had a suspected adverse reaction in the UK. AstraZeneca described it as a ""routine"" pause in the case of ""an unexplained illness"". The outcome of vaccine trials is being closely watched around the world. The AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine is seen as a strong contender among dozens being developed globally. Oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response How close to developing a vaccine are we? What drugs can help treat coronavirus? Hopes have been high that the vaccine might be one of the first to come on the market, followingsuccessful phase 1 and 2 testing,external. Its move to Phase 3 testing in recent weeks has involved some 30,000 participants in the US as well as in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. Phase 3 trials in vaccines often involve thousands of participants and can last several years. The New York Times is reporting a volunteer in the UK trial has been diagnosed with transverse myelitis,external, an inflammatory syndrome that affects the spinal cord and can be caused by viral infections. However, the cause of the illness has not been confirmed and an independent investigation will now work out if there was any link to the vaccine. At first glance this may seem alarming.  A vaccine trial - and not just any vaccine, but one receiving massive global attention - is put on hold due to a suspected serious adverse reaction.  But such events are not unheard of.  Indeed the Oxford team describe it as ""routine"".  Any time a volunteer is admitted to hospital and the cause of their illness is not immediately apparent it triggers a study to be put on hold. This is actually the second time it has happened with the Oxford University/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial since the first volunteers were immunised in April.  An Oxford University spokesperson said: ""In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully."" A final decision on restarting the trial will be taken by the medical regulator the MHRA, which could take only days.  But until then all international vaccination sites, in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and the USA are on hold. The Oxford University team believe this process illustrates that they are committed to the safety of their volunteers and the highest standards of conduct in their studies. Wellcome Trust director Sir Jeremy Farrar, an expert in infectious disease control, said there were often pauses in vaccine trials and it was important any adverse reactions were taken seriously. ""It is crucial that all that data is shared openly and transparently because the public must have absolute trust that these vaccines are safe and effective and, in the end, will hopefully bring the pandemic to a close,"" Sir Jeremy added. UK experts have said a temporary pause could be seen as a good thing because it showed the researchers are prioritising the safety of vaccine above everything else. People can develop side-effects from taking any drug but they can also fall ill naturally. US President Donald Trump has said he wants a vaccine available in the US before 3 November's election, but his comments have raised fears that politics may be prioritised over safety in the rush for a vaccine. On Tuesday, a group of nine Covid-19 vaccine developers sought to reassure the public by announcing a ""historic pledge"" to uphold scientific and ethical standards in the search for a vaccine. AstraZeneca is among the nine firms who signed up to the pledge to only apply for regulatory approval after vaccines have gone through three phases of clinical study. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Industry giants Johnson & Johnson, BioNTech, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Merck, Moderna, Sanofi and Novavax are the other signatories. They pledged to ""always make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority"". Short cuts and 'dirty tricks' in the scramble for a vaccine How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? The World Health Organization (WHO) says nearly 180 vaccine candidates are being tested around the world but none has yet completed clinical trials. The organisation has said it does not expect a vaccine to meet its efficacy and safety guidelines in order to be approved this year because of the time it takes to test them safely. Similar sentiments have been shared by Thomas Cueni, director-general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers. The industry body represents the companies that signed the pledge. Despite this, China and Russia have begun inoculating some key workers with domestically developed vaccines. All of them are still listed by the WHO as being in clinical trials. Meanwhile, the US national regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has suggested that coronavirus vaccines may be approved before completing a third phase of clinical trials. Last week it also emerged that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had urged states to consider waiving certain requirements in order to be ready to distribute a potential vaccine by 1 November - two days before the 3 November presidential election. Although President Trump has hinted that a vaccine might be available before the election, his Democratic rival Joe Biden has expressed scepticism that Mr Trump will listen to scientists and implement a transparent process.

"EU negotiator Michel Barnier arrives in London for talks The government will later publish plans which could override key elements of its Brexit deal with Brussels, in breach of international law. The Internal Market Bill will set out how powers currently held by the EU will be shared out after the post-Brexit transition period ends. But it has faced a backlash from senior Tories and prompted the resignation of a top civil servant. It comes as the talks over a trade deal with the EU continue in London. The Internal Market Bill could override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement that secured the UK's exit from the EU in January.

"The National Records of Scotland figures cover the period when the pandemic was at its peak in Scotland The number of people who died in Scotland at the height of the coronavirus outbreak was a third higher than usual, according to official figures. National Records of Scotland (NRS) said 18,201 deaths had been registered between April and June. This was 4,515 higher than the five-year average. Covid-19 was the underlying cause in 3,739 deaths, accounting for 83% of the excess deaths. Deaths from diabetes, dementia and Alzheimer's Disease were about a quarter higher than the five-year average, the NRS said. And deaths from diseases of the genitourinary system increased by 22.5%. However, deaths from respiratory diseases decreased by 20.6% and deaths from transport accidents were down by 69.1%. Chief Medical Officer Gregor Smith said the reasons for the higher than usual number of deaths would be better understood ""in the fullness of time"", and urged people to seek treatment for any medical concerns they may have. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland The three-month period covers the height of the coronavirus lockdown in Scotland when schools and businesses were closed, and traffic on all roads was significantly reduced. Regular health care had been disrupted after NHS Scotland was placedon an emergency footingin mid-March to deal with the outbreak. Accident and Emergency attendances dropped tobelow half their normal levelsduring April, Public Health Scotland data shows. It is also possible that some deaths attributed to other causes at the start of the outbreak were undiagnosed Covid-19 cases. Dr Smith said there were ""signals"" from the latest data that ""shows excess deaths go beyond what we would expect directly from Covid"", highlighting those linked to Alzheimers and dementia in particular. He said: ""We need to understand why that is the case - are these deaths being contributed to by Covid, or are they for some other reasons? ""Over the fullness of time we will be able to much better understand why these deaths are apparent in the system."" Earlier in the pandemic there was a concern that an increase in deaths linked to cardiovascular conditions may have been down to ""people not presenting for treatment"" when they needed it. Dr Smith said: ""The message we've had all along is that for these urgent conditions, the NHS remains open. ""If you have symptoms we urge you to seek help and don't just sit on it - there is capacity in the NHS for you to get the care you need."" Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland was at a ""dangerous point"" in the fight against coronavirus, with cases on the rise Age Scotland said the steep rise in excess deaths from dementia, diabetes and other causes during the lockdown was ""extremely concerning"" and needed further investigation. The charity's chief executive, Brian Sloan, said older people had ""borne the brunt"" of the pandemic and had been at greater risk of dying from other causes. ""While it's hard to speculate on the reasons, it's likely there is a link to the pandemic,"" he said. ""We know that health and social services were under a huge strain during these months, and many people were reluctant or unable to seek medical assistance."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said every death linked to the virus ""represents the loss of an irreplaceable individual"". The latest NRS report said only two deaths had been recorded in the week to Sunday where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, with none of them in care homes for the first time in the pandemic. However, Ms Sturgeon warned that people must be vigilant about increasing numbers of cases. And she did not rule out Scotland following England in reducing the number of people who can meet at the same time. She said the number of new cases of coronavirus reported each day in Scotland had ""roughly trebled"" over the past three weeks. The rolling seven day average of new daily cases over the past week was 152 - compared to 52 three weeks earlier. The percentage of people tested who return a positive result has also gone up from being ""around 1%"" to consistently being around 2%. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I hope you can see why the situation just now is a matter of concern to us, and why we need to continue to work as hard as we can to keep the virus under control.""

"This video can not be played What restrictions are now in place in Caerphilly county? Pubs and restaurants in a local lockdown area should check if customers come from a single household, according to the health minister. The hospitality sector has been allowed to remain open in Caerphilly despitenew ruleswhich mean people living apart are unable to meet indoors. Vaughan Gething said a big cause for a spike in Covid-19 cases was by people mixing in each other's homes. He also said residents booked on holidays could not travel. Caerphilly county became the first area of Wales to go into a local lockdown at 18:00 BST on Tuesday, with 151 people testing positive for coronavirus in the past week. Latest BBC analysis places Caerphilly as the second hardest-hit place in the UK - after Bolton - for Covid-19 case rates in the last week. It said the case rate in the English town was 128 cases per 100,000 of the population, while Caerphilly had 80 per 100,000. According to the latest data, published on Wednesday by Public Health Wales, the newest figure for Caerphilly is 83.4 cases per 100,000 people. That covers the past seven days. Public Health England said it did not publish equivalent rolling figures. Police say people need a legitimate reason to travel around Caerphilly As part of the lockdown in Caerphilly, people are unable to enter or leave the county without good reason as part of the lockdown measures which are expected to be in place until October at least. ""All pubs and restaurants need to look at their customers coming in and ask themselves, well [is that] really a group of people from a single household,"" said Mr Gething. ""If people are taking bookings from a dozen people sitting at the same table, I think people really need to be asking themselves whether those are people following the rules."" He said transmission of the virus has not been seen in pubs. But Caerphilly council would be looking to make sure the new rules were followed, Mr Gething said, and he did not rule out closing the sector locally if necessary. The Smiths Arms has tried to keep to social distancing rules, landlord Glyn Davies says Glyn Davies runs the Smith Arms in Pengam, which he said had mostly an older clientele. He said there was a ""very mixed attitude"" between customers, with the older ones not wanting to come to the bar so much because of the virus. ""Testing should have been brought in a lot earlier,"" he said. ""People were probably walking around with the virus without knowing."" He felt that pubs were being made scapegoats but added: ""Some pubs do flout the rules. We try and keep a distancing thing going in the pub but it's very hard to police everything when you're working."" Asked whether pubs should make sure customers in groups were from the same household he said: ""How can you do that? You can't call people liars. You'd have to get people to bring birth certificates in."" Business has been ""crushed overnight"" says Mikaela Rees-Swindon (left) at The George in Aberbargoed In Aberbargoed, former naval officer Mikaela Rees-Swindon became the landlord of The George in March - just a few weeks before lockdown. The pub started serving outside again in July, then inside as restrictions eased. ""They aren't making us shut - but they are making it impossible for us to run the place as a business,"" she said. ""We are being told we have to check tables are being booked for single household groups - well that's my Saturday cancelled."" She said environmental health officials had made it clear the onus was on her and her staff to enforce social distancing and check track and trace information is correct. ""We've been doing everything right - it was going fabulously. But now they have crushed us overnight."" ""Enough is enough,"" said Chief Constable Pam Kelly More than 60 vehicles were stopped in less than three hours of the first evening of the lockdown on Tuesday, though no enforcement action was taken. However Gwent Police's Chief Constable Pam Kelly said she did not want her officers to become ""the Covid police"" and said the force will not be using road blocks across the area. ""Our preferred option is to always work with communities,"" she said. ""We will not be having road blocks where police officers are stopping people and stopping cars. ""But we will be out there engaging with our communities, and if people flout the law, there comes a time where we have to stop engaging and explaining - and if they are not prepared to adhere to the law, policing has to step in."" During a wide-ranging Facebook live question and answer session on Tuesday evening, Mr Gething also said people in Caerphilly county could not go on holiday. What can I do in Caerphilly's lockdown? Coronavirus cases rise by 150 in Wales He said if residents had booked holidays they should speak to their providers, explain it would be a breach of the law for them to travel, and seek a refund. Officials would be in touch with package holiday providers and insurers to explain the ""seriousness of the position and the risk to them and their business"" if people from Caerphilly went on holiday,"" he said. After months of shielding, Yvonne Davies is feeling ""pretty angry"" at the situation in her home town of Caerphilly. ""You could actually see what was going to happen from day one,"" she said. ""I only went to the precinct once and not a person had a mask on. They weren't observing any social distancing and from then on it just got worse and worse."" She said one supermarket had dropped distancing measures, with staff saying it was ""back to normal"". She feels people have become too relaxed about coronavirus: ""They don't realise how serious it is for a start."" What can I do during local lockdowns? How many have died with coronavirus in Wales?

"There are fears about the rising number of coronavirus cases in some valleys areas Merthyr Tydfil could be the next area in Wales to see a local lockdown, according to a health data expert. The former head of health analysis at the Office for National Statistics highlighted the rising proportion of positive coronavirus tests in the area. In the past seven days, 6% of tests in and around Merthyr were positive. That is more than the 5.1% in Caerphilly,which has gone into lockdown, and almost double the 3.2% in Rhondda Cynon Taff. Valleys towns braced for 'nerve-wracking lockdown' In Caerphilly, the opening dates of testing centres at the town's leisure centre and Penallta House council offices have been extended until 15 September. At Porth, in Rhondda Cynon Taff, a temporary testing centre will open at Oldway House from 09:30 BST on Thursday. Rhondda MP Chris Bryant has warned a local lockdown could be enforced in the area ""by the weekend"" if cases continued to rise. But data expert Jamie Jenkins said: ""If you look at the data across the whole of Wales, Merthyr Tydfil would be the one you would be more concerned about rather than Rhondda Cynon Taff."" Mr Jenkins said fewer people were talking about Merthyr rather than Rhondda Cynon Taff ""because the numbers are smaller but the local authority of Merthyr is much smaller."" Warning over lockdown pub get-togethers Rhondda Cynon Taff could be in lockdown 'in days' Coronavirus cases rise by 150 in Wales He added: ""But if we're looking at where the next risk of a local lockdown is going to be, it's probably Merthyr above [RCT], if they apply the same principle of looking at the stats."" Merthyr Tydfil council has been asked to comment. The number of positive tests across Wales was also ""a concern"", said Mr Jenkins, with the proportion more than doubling, from 1% to 2.5% in the space of the past four weeks. The case rate - the proportion of cases for the size of its population - is now 51.4 per 100,000 - which is 31 cases in the past seven days. It has the highest case rate total after Caerphilly, which is 83.4 per 100,000. The rate in Rhondda Cynon Taff is 41.4, in Powys 21.9 and in Wrexham it is 20.6. Public Health Wales is investigating a small number of cases at a factory in Merthyr. More than 250 people work at the General Dynamics plant, which assembles armoured vehicles for the Army. The Welsh Government felt it had little option but to introduce a local lockdown in Caerphilly county, because of a dramatic rise in the coronavirus case rate - the proportion of cases to the population. Not quite as startling, but still significant, has been the case rate rises in Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil. But public health experts won't just be looking at those figures, they are also looking at how many tests are coming back positive. The average in Wales over the last week has been 2.5%, but in Caerphilly it's more than double that - 5.1% In RCT currently, about three tests in every 100 come back positive. That's actually that's lower than Newport. But if we look at Merthyr Tydfil, 6% of tests are coming back positive, so no wonder alarm bells are ringing.

"There are fears about the rising number of coronavirus cases in some valleys areas Merthyr Tydfil could be the next area in Wales to see a local lockdown, according to a health data expert. The former head of health analysis at the Office for National Statistics highlighted the rising proportion of positive coronavirus tests in the area. In the past seven days, 6% of tests in and around Merthyr were positive. That is more than the 5.1% in Caerphilly,which has gone into lockdown, and almost double the 3.2% in Rhondda Cynon Taff. Valleys towns braced for 'nerve-wracking lockdown' In Caerphilly, the opening dates of testing centres at the town's leisure centre and Penallta House council offices have been extended until 15 September. At Porth, in Rhondda Cynon Taff, a temporary testing centre will open at Oldway House from 09:30 BST on Thursday. Rhondda MP Chris Bryant has warned a local lockdown could be enforced in the area ""by the weekend"" if cases continued to rise. But data expert Jamie Jenkins said: ""If you look at the data across the whole of Wales, Merthyr Tydfil would be the one you would be more concerned about rather than Rhondda Cynon Taff."" Mr Jenkins said fewer people were talking about Merthyr rather than Rhondda Cynon Taff ""because the numbers are smaller but the local authority of Merthyr is much smaller."" Warning over lockdown pub get-togethers Rhondda Cynon Taff could be in lockdown 'in days' Coronavirus cases rise by 150 in Wales He added: ""But if we're looking at where the next risk of a local lockdown is going to be, it's probably Merthyr above [RCT], if they apply the same principle of looking at the stats."" Merthyr Tydfil council has been asked to comment. The number of positive tests across Wales was also ""a concern"", said Mr Jenkins, with the proportion more than doubling, from 1% to 2.5% in the space of the past four weeks. The case rate - the proportion of cases for the size of its population - is now 51.4 per 100,000 - which is 31 cases in the past seven days. It has the highest case rate total after Caerphilly, which is 83.4 per 100,000. The rate in Rhondda Cynon Taff is 41.4, in Powys 21.9 and in Wrexham it is 20.6. Public Health Wales is investigating a small number of cases at a factory in Merthyr. More than 250 people work at the General Dynamics plant, which assembles armoured vehicles for the Army. The Welsh Government felt it had little option but to introduce a local lockdown in Caerphilly county, because of a dramatic rise in the coronavirus case rate - the proportion of cases to the population. Not quite as startling, but still significant, has been the case rate rises in Rhondda Cynon Taff and Merthyr Tydfil. But public health experts won't just be looking at those figures, they are also looking at how many tests are coming back positive. The average in Wales over the last week has been 2.5%, but in Caerphilly it's more than double that - 5.1% In RCT currently, about three tests in every 100 come back positive. That's actually that's lower than Newport. But if we look at Merthyr Tydfil, 6% of tests are coming back positive, so no wonder alarm bells are ringing. I believe if that was replicated across Wales, we might be back to a blanket lockdown. As it stands, it seems almost inevitable there will be more restrictions as time goes on. But they might be different, depending on local circumstances. The message health officials are trying to stress at the moment is, wherever you live, is if you want to avoid a form of local lockdown, be careful, observe social distancing and take the coronavirus risk seriously.

"Conwy is one of the counties in north Wales under local lockdown restrictions People living in 17 areas around Wales are now facing local lockdown restrictions. The city of Bangor in Gwynedd becomes the second place in Wales to face hyper-local restrictions to deal with a massive spike in Covid cases. It is the only part of Gwynedd being told to enforce stricter coronavirus measures. It joins four other areas in north Wales, while 12 areas in south and south-west Wales are in local lockdown. That includes Llanelli in Carmarthenshire, where the hyper-local restrictions were imposed on the town on 25 September. It means more than two million people will be subject to tighter local restrictions. Here's a guide to what you can and can't do. The city of Bangor in Gwynedd has been placed under a local lockdown Under the rules, nobody is able to enter or leave a total of 15 entire council areas, the town of Llanelli, and from 18:00 on Saturday, 10 October, the city of Bangor, without a ""reasonable excuse"". There are a number of excuses listed in the law used to enforce the regulations. These include travelling to school, to give care or to work if you are unable to work from home. You can only go to your place of work and then back home again, although you are allowed to use cafes and shops there if needed, such as to buy lunch. You can travel to buy food and medical supplies, seek medical assistance or go to the vets, and move home. If you are buying essential items and there is no reasonable alternative to using shops within these counties, you can do so. However, in most cases there are expected to be alternative options, even if this involves travelling a bit further than you would normally. Other reasons include: Obtaining supplies for the essential upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household, or the household of a vulnerable person Children travelling in order to play sport Elite athletic training and competitions To provide or receive emergency assistance To meet a legal obligation, and to access or receive public services To avoid injury or illness or escape a risk of harm Otherwise, the borders are effectively closed. BBC Wales has been told the Welsh Government considers compassionate visits to a loved one as a reasonable excuse, although it is not listed in the legislation. Swansea has been added to the list of local lockdown areas Rules for meeting indoors have changed. Friends and family can no longer meet indoors, while overnight stays are also banned. Soextended householdsare unable to meet, essentially meaning you cannot enter anyone else's home in the affected counties. Meeting people from outside your extended household indoors remains banned in the rest of Wales. All licensed premises across Walesmust stop selling all alcohol at 22:00every day. That includes pubs, cafes, restaurants and supermarkets. You can still go for a drink or a meal indoors, but only with members of your immediate household. You can eat and drink with people from other households outdoors as long as you maintain social distancing. Rules against meeting other people from outside your household indoors still apply in pubs and restaurants. Pubs must stop serving alcohol at 22:00 with 20 minutes to drink-up In shops, yes you have to. People in Walesmust wear face masks in shops, other indoor public spacesand public transport as coronavirus cases rise. UK virus increase 'concerning', says minister Highest reported cases in Wales since June Five bars warned over social distancing measures Yes. Schools, which have only just returned from the summer holidays, will stay open. However,a number of schools across Wales have told pupils to isolateafter positive tests, so any changes will be done on a case-by-case basis. Students can still attend school and colleges No. In a Facebook question and answer video about local lockdown in Caerphilly, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said if residents had booked holidays already they should speak to their providers, explain it would be a breach of the law for them to attend, and seek a refund. Officials would be in touch with package holiday providers and insurers ""to explain to them the seriousness of the position and the risk to them and their business if people from Caerphilly were nevertheless to go on holiday"", he added. Yes, but with restrictions. Marriages and civil partnerships can take still take place under the local lockdowns with small receptions, but guests from outside the area cannot attend the reception. It is the same for funerals and wakes. Those living in the boroughs can attend a wedding ceremony or funeral outside the area, but not a reception or a funeral wake. People can leave if they cannot work from home, to give care, go to school or for essential shopping We don't know exactly. The lockdown measures in each area will be reviewed two weeks after they began, Wales' health minister has said. Vaughan Gething said there were ""cautious reasons"" for optimism, based on how lockdown measures were working in Caerphilly county borough, the first area to be targeted for new restrictions. The county has seen a ""levelling off and a slight reduction in new cases"" thoughlockdown will last at least another week, the Welsh Government announced on Thursday. By the end of that period, Caerphilly would have been in local lockdown for three weeks. Children whose parents do not live in the same home can continue to move between homes, whether inside or outside the affected area, the Welsh Government said. It said parents can continue to rely on wider family for childcare while they are in work, but only when""no other methods are available"",external. Yes. People who breach new laws could face fixed penalty notices of Â£60 for a first offence. Penalties will double with every subsequent offence, to a maximum of Â£1,920. Fixed penalty notices are used as an alternative to prosecution - if a case reached the courts, fines could be unlimited. The rules will be enforced by local authorities as well as the police. A senior officer said Gwent Police was not planning to introduce roadblocks or cordons during lockdown. Ch Supt Mark Hobrough said neighbourhood officers would talk to motorists and visit shops and businesses to ensure everyone was aware of the new rules, with enforcement the ""last objective"". ""We really do want the community to work with us in relation to this to be able to combat this infection and fight it off as soon as possible,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Our chief environment correspondent Justin Rowlatt visited Thwaites in January Scientists may just have identified Thwaites Glacier's Achilles heel. This Antarctic colossus is melting at a rapid rate, dumping billions of tonnes of ice in the ocean every year and pushing up global sea-levels. Now, a UK-US team has surveyed the deep seafloor channels in front of the glacier that almost certainly provide the access for warm water to infiltrate and attack Thwaites' underside. It's information that will be used to try to predict the ice stream's future. ""These channels had not been mapped before in this kind of detail, and what we've discovered is that they're actually much bigger than anyone thought - up to 600m deep. Think of six football pitches back to back,"" said Dr Kelly Hogan from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). ""And because they are so deep, and so wide - this allows a lot more water to get at, and melt, Thwaites' floating front as well as its ice that rests on the seabed,"" she told BBC News. Thwaites: Journey to the 'doomsday glacier' Greenland and Antarctica ice loss accelerating Deepest point on land found in Antarctica Flowing off the west of the Antarctic continent, Thwaites is almost as big as Great Britain. It's a majestic sight, with its buoyant front, or ""ice shelf"", pushing far out to sea and kicking off huge icebergs. But satellite monitoring indicates this glacier is melting at an accelerating rate. In the 1990s it was losing just over 10 billion tonnes of ice a year. Today, it's more like 80 billion tonnes. The cause of the melting is thought to be the influx of relatively warm bottom-water drawn in from the wider ocean. Currently, Thwaites' ice loss contributes approximately 4% to the annual rise in global sea-levels, with the potential to add 65cm in total should the whole glacier collapse. No-one thinks this will happen in the short-to-medium term, but Thwaites is considered particularly vulnerable in a warming world, and scientists would like to know precisely how fast any changes might occur. This video can not be played Dr Kelly Hogan explains the significance of the new research The UK and the US joined forces in 2019 to investigate Thwaites. Their scientists sailed a ship equipped with an echo-sounder right up to the glacier's ice cliffs, to trace the shape of the seabed below. A plane was also flown back and forth across the shelf to measure small variations in the pull of gravity. These deviations reflected the seafloor's undulations beneath the shelf. The two datasets taken together now provide the best view yet of Thwaites' underlying topography. They trace the path of a network of deep channels that cut through a ridge before joining up to form a major cavity under the ice shelf. ""The connected channels that we've mapped in detail for the first time are the potential pathways for deep-ocean warm water to get in and do damage at that point where the glacier is still grounded on the seabed, where it begins to lift up and float,"" explained BAS colleague Dr Tom Jordan, ""but also to melt the base of the ice shelf, which if you weaken will make the ice further upstream in the glacier flow faster."" Scientists need real-world data to corral their models so that when they run simulations of possible future behaviour, they get realistic outcomes. The new information refines the volumes for ingressing warm water that can be considered possible under different scenarios. In conducting their survey, scientists also now have a better idea of the general roughness of the seafloor. This tells them about the sorts of speeds ice further back in the glacier can achieve as it slides across rock and sediment. What the researchers have produced, if you like, is a kind of ""stickiness index"" to additionally constrain the computer models. Satellites record history of Antarctic melting Coronavirus severely restricts Antarctic science 'Stunning' seafloor ridges record Antarctic retreat Thwaites' size and melt rate have led to it being dubbed the ""Doomsday Glacier"" At the moment, the eastern side of the ice shelf is hooked on to a large ridge, which gives it stability. But the current melting trend would suggest this situation won't last much longer, says BAS's Dr Robert Larter. ""When the Eastern Ice Shelf becomes unpinned, the ice will spread out and thin, eventually breaking up, as we can see is happening right now on the (central) glacier tongue,"" he told BBC News. ""Even before ice shelf break-up, the unpinning and thinning will reduce the buttressing effect of the ice shelf on the glacier upstream of it, resulting in increased ice flow velocity. This in turn will further accelerate thinning of the glacier and grounding line retreat."" British and American scientists have had to temporarily suspend their investigations at Thwaites because of the Covid-19 crisis. Teams were due to head back to the glacier this austral summer, but the location's remoteness means the risks are too great should anyone fall ill. Once the coronavirus outbreak has been properly contained, the scientists will return, however. ""It's amazing to go to a place like Thwaites to see the changes taking place right before your eyes,"" said Dr Hogan. ""When we were there in 2019, we were able to get right up to the ice shelf cliffs, and the reason we could do that and make our observations was because the icebergs and sea-ice that have always been there historically are starting to disappear.""

"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 BST. Social gatherings of more than six people are to be banned in Englandin an effort to curb a steep rise in coronavirus cases. The ban will come in from Monday and be backed by law. There are exceptions - schools, workplaces, organised sports among them. We'll get more detail later, buthere's what we know so far.Ministers and health advisers believe the country is at a critical moment and the average rate of new infections is now four times higher than it was in mid-July. However,here are five important reasons why it's not quite as simple as that. Case numbers are rising, but there hasn't - yet at least - been a corresponding rise in hospital admissions The outcome of coronavirus vaccine trials is being closely watched around the world and hopes for the one being conducted by Oxford University and AstraZeneca are high. However,it's been temporarily halted worldwideafter a volunteer taking part in the UK fell ill. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh says such events are routine and it's thought the trial could resume within days.How close are we to having a vaccine?And when we do have one,how will we deliver it to seven billion people? This is the second time the Oxford trial has been put on hold A man with chronic asthma says he was ""ambushed"" into wearing a face coveringon an EasyJet flight, despite carrying an exemption card. One of its pilots was filmed threatening to remove the passenger. EasyJet has apologised, but charities say there are other stories of people with respiratory conditions being turned away from shops and public transport. Elsewhere this morning,find out why British Airways is in a stand-off with some of its customersover refunds. This video can not be played Footage shows the EasyJet pilot refusing to accept Nick's medical exemption card Young people at university rely heavily on part-time work - commonly in hospitality or retail - to make ends meet while studying. Butconcerns are being raised about how many will manage this yeargiven the struggles those sectors are facing and the job cuts they're experiencing. Website Save the Student is encouraging those affected to investigate other options such as scholarships, grants and bursaries. Solent University student Ellen Walsh says she's finding it hard to pay her bills To help maintain his wellbeing during the coronavirus lockdown, photographer Tim Boddy turned to a natural process to create beautiful prints of flowers and leaves.

"The National Records of Scotland figures cover the period when the pandemic was at its peak in Scotland The number of people who died in Scotland at the height of the coronavirus outbreak was a third higher than usual, according to official figures. National Records of Scotland (NRS) said 18,201 deaths had been registered between April and June. This was 4,515 higher than the five-year average. Covid-19 was the underlying cause in 3,739 deaths, accounting for 83% of the excess deaths. Deaths from diabetes, dementia and Alzheimer's Disease were about a quarter higher than the five-year average, the NRS said. And deaths from diseases of the genitourinary system increased by 22.5%. However, deaths from respiratory diseases decreased by 20.6% and deaths from transport accidents were down by 69.1%. Chief Medical Officer Gregor Smith said the reasons for the higher than usual number of deaths would be better understood ""in the fullness of time"", and urged people to seek treatment for any medical concerns they may have. Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland The three-month period covers the height of the coronavirus lockdown in Scotland when schools and businesses were closed, and traffic on all roads was significantly reduced. Regular health care had been disrupted after NHS Scotland was placedon an emergency footingin mid-March to deal with the outbreak. Accident and Emergency attendances dropped tobelow half their normal levelsduring April, Public Health Scotland data shows. It is also possible that some deaths attributed to other causes at the start of the outbreak were undiagnosed Covid-19 cases. Dr Smith said there were ""signals"" from the latest data that ""shows excess deaths go beyond what we would expect directly from Covid"", highlighting those linked to Alzheimers and dementia in particular. He said: ""We need to understand why that is the case - are these deaths being contributed to by Covid, or are they for some other reasons? ""Over the fullness of time we will be able to much better understand why these deaths are apparent in the system."" Earlier in the pandemic there was a concern that an increase in deaths linked to cardiovascular conditions may have been down to ""people not presenting for treatment"" when they needed it. Dr Smith said: ""The message we've had all along is that for these urgent conditions, the NHS remains open. ""If you have symptoms we urge you to seek help and don't just sit on it - there is capacity in the NHS for you to get the care you need."" Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland was at a ""dangerous point"" in the fight against coronavirus, with cases on the rise Age Scotland said the steep rise in excess deaths from dementia, diabetes and other causes during the lockdown was ""extremely concerning"" and needed further investigation. The charity's chief executive, Brian Sloan, said older people had ""borne the brunt"" of the pandemic and had been at greater risk of dying from other causes. ""While it's hard to speculate on the reasons, it's likely there is a link to the pandemic,"" he said. ""We know that health and social services were under a huge strain during these months, and many people were reluctant or unable to seek medical assistance."" First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said every death linked to the virus ""represents the loss of an irreplaceable individual"". The latest NRS report said only two deaths had been recorded in the week to Sunday where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, with none of them in care homes for the first time in the pandemic. However, Ms Sturgeon warned that people must be vigilant about increasing numbers of cases. And she did not rule out Scotland following England in reducing the number of people who can meet at the same time. She said the number of new cases of coronavirus reported each day in Scotland had ""roughly trebled"" over the past three weeks. The rolling seven day average of new daily cases over the past week was 152 - compared to 52 three weeks earlier. The percentage of people tested who return a positive result has also gone up from being ""around 1%"" to consistently being around 2%. Ms Sturgeon said: ""I hope you can see why the situation just now is a matter of concern to us, and why we need to continue to work as hard as we can to keep the virus under control.""

"The 27-year-old was arrested at a property in Selly Oak in the early hours of Monday A man has been charged with murder and seven counts of attempted murder, after a series of stabbings across Birmingham city centre. Zephaniah McLeod, aged 27, of Nately Grove, Selly Oak, is due in court on Wednesday, West Midlands Police said. Jacob Billington, 23, was killed and seven others injured at four locations over a period of 90 minutes on Sunday. Mr Billington, from Crosby, Merseyside, was stabbed in Irving Street while enjoying a night out with friends. A post-mortem examination concluded he died of a stab wound to the neck. Mr Billington had been working as a library intern at Sheffield Hallam University and was also a drummer in a band. A university spokesman said: ""Jacob was a Sheffield Hallam graduate and had joined the library as a graduate intern, where his warmth and enthusiasm made him a greatly valued member of our team. ""Our thoughts and condolences are with his family, friends and colleagues."" His friend, Michael Callaghan, also 23 and a fellow band-mate, was seriously injured in the attack in Irving Street and remains in hospital in a critical condition. Both men had previously attended Sacred Heart Catholic College in Crosby, where prayers were said on Monday evening for their families. In a statement, the school said: ""We are saddened at the events in Birmingham which took Jacob's life and left Michael critically injured. ""We are praying for Michael's recovery and will never forget Jacob, his life touched so many in our school."" Jacob Billington, who was out with friends, was stabbed to death in Birmingham A 22-year-old woman, attacked in Hurst Street, remains critical but stable in hospital.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Jean Mackenzie spoke to people at the Moria camp months before it was destroyed and reflects on her experiences there Fires have destroyed Greece's largest migrant camp, an overcrowded facility on the island of Lesbos, leaving nearly 13,000 people without shelter. Some 20 firefighters battled the blaze at the Moria camp - designed for fewer than 3,000 people - as migrants, many suffering from smoke exposure, fled. Greece's migration minister said the fires ""began with the asylum seekers"", but did not elaborate. Police blocked roads from the camp to prevent migrants entering nearby towns. Many attempted to carry their belongings to the port town of Mytilene but access was cordoned off. Reports suggest many slept in fields after the fire. EU home affairs commissioner Ylva Johansson has said she has agreed to finance the transfer of 400 unaccompanied teenagers and children to accommodation on the mainland. Fires broke out in more than three places in a short space of time, local fire chief Konstantinos Theofilopoulos told state television channel ERT. Some protesting migrants hindered firefighters who tried to tackle the flames, he said. The main blaze, which was initially fanned by high winds, was put out by Wednesday morning, although Mr Theofilopoulos said there were still some small fires burning inside some containers at the site. Accommodation is urgently required for some 400 unaccompanied minors One local resident told the BBC almost the whole camp was burning. ""Now with the first light I can see that there is a few tents that make it, they are okay, but the rest of the camp, as I can see from this distance, is burnt out,"" Thanasis Voulgarakis said. How the migrant crisis changed Europe Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts Some locals reportedly attacked and prevented migrants from passing through a nearby village after they fled the flames. Authorities placed the Moria camp under quarantine last week after a Somali migrant tested positive for the coronavirus. There are now 35 confirmed cases linked to the site. It is unclear exactly how the fires started, but Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said the ""incidents in Moria began with the asylum seekers because of the quarantine imposed"". Some of the 35 people who had tested positive for Covid-19 had reportedly refused to move into isolation with their families. Mr Mitarachi did not say, however, that the fires were a deliberate act of arson aimed at destroying the camp. Michalis Fratzeskos, deputy mayor for civil protection, told ERT the blaze was ""premeditated"". Migrant tents had been empty, he said, and arsonists had ""taken advantage of strong winds"". Images show the destruction of the site after the blaze But some migrants told BBC Persian the fire had broken out after scuffles between migrants and Greek forces at the camp.

A state of emergency has been declared following the fire at the camp on the island of Lesbos One migrant from Afghanistan, named only as Yaser, told Reuters news agency that the fire had forced everyone to run. ""We don't know where to go, and all the refugees are outside, and trying to find a place to at least just stay,"" he said. The mayor of Mytilene, Stratis Kytelis, said it was ""a very difficult situation because some of those who are outside will include people who are positive [for coronavirus]"". ""The disaster at Moria is total,"" Greek migration ministry secretary Manos Logothetis told ANA news agency, and said he was heading to the site. About 3,000 people are being temporarily housed in tents on Lesbos until alternative shelter can be found, officials said.

Protecting yourself from coronavirus in a migrant camp Lesbos migrant camp children 'say they want to die' In 2018, UNHCR urged the Greek government to move asylum seekers away from Lesbos, describing conditions as at ""boiling point"". At the time, there were 8,000 people living in the Moria camp. Migrants have evacuated the camp but have not been allowed to enter the nearby town The Moria Refugee Camp lies north-east of Mytilene, the capital of Lesbos.

"Sir Ronald Harwood, pictured picking up a Bafta in 2008 Sir Ronald Harwood, the playwright and Oscar-winning screenwriter, has died. His agent Judy Daish said he died of natural causes on Tuesday. In a statement, she added: ""His wife Natasha died in 2013 and Sir Ronald is survived by their children Antony, Deborah and Alexandra."" South African-born Sir Ronald was regarded as one of Britain's great post-war dramatists. His plays include The Dresser and Quartet, both of which were adapted for the screen. He won the Academy Award for best adapted screenplay for the 2002 Roman Polanski film, The Pianist. Sir Ronald, who passed away aged 85, received a knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in 2010, two years after picking up a Bafta for best adapted screenplay for The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (Le Scaphandre et le Papillon). In a 2018 interview with The Boar,,externalthe University of Warwick's student newspaper, Sir Ronald was asked about what he hoped his artistic legacy might be. He said: ""I don't think of my legacy - I think it's a rather pompous thing to think of! All I think of is, 'Are the plays going to live at all after my death?'

"This video can not be played What restrictions are now in place in Caerphilly county? Pubs and restaurants in a local lockdown area should check if customers come from a single household, according to the health minister. The hospitality sector has been allowed to remain open in Caerphilly despitenew ruleswhich mean people living apart are unable to meet indoors. Vaughan Gething said a big cause for a spike in Covid-19 cases was by people mixing in each other's homes. He also said residents booked on holidays could not travel. Caerphilly county became the first area of Wales to go into a local lockdown at 18:00 BST on Tuesday, with 151 people testing positive for coronavirus in the past week. Latest BBC analysis places Caerphilly as the second hardest-hit place in the UK - after Bolton - for Covid-19 case rates in the last week. It said the case rate in the English town was 128 cases per 100,000 of the population, while Caerphilly had 80 per 100,000. According to the latest data, published on Wednesday by Public Health Wales, the newest figure for Caerphilly is 83.4 cases per 100,000 people. That covers the past seven days. Public Health England said it did not publish equivalent rolling figures. Police say people need a legitimate reason to travel around Caerphilly As part of the lockdown in Caerphilly, people are unable to enter or leave the county without good reason as part of the lockdown measures which are expected to be in place until October at least. ""All pubs and restaurants need to look at their customers coming in and ask themselves, well [is that] really a group of people from a single household,"" said Mr Gething. ""If people are taking bookings from a dozen people sitting at the same table, I think people really need to be asking themselves whether those are people following the rules."" He said transmission of the virus has not been seen in pubs. But Caerphilly council would be looking to make sure the new rules were followed, Mr Gething said, and he did not rule out closing the sector locally if necessary. The Smiths Arms has tried to keep to social distancing rules, landlord Glyn Davies says Glyn Davies runs the Smith Arms in Pengam, which he said had mostly an older clientele. He said there was a ""very mixed attitude"" between customers, with the older ones not wanting to come to the bar so much because of the virus. ""Testing should have been brought in a lot earlier,"" he said. ""People were probably walking around with the virus without knowing."" He felt that pubs were being made scapegoats but added: ""Some pubs do flout the rules. We try and keep a distancing thing going in the pub but it's very hard to police everything when you're working."" Asked whether pubs should make sure customers in groups were from the same household he said: ""How can you do that? You can't call people liars. You'd have to get people to bring birth certificates in."" Business has been ""crushed overnight"" says Mikaela Rees-Swindon (left) at The George in Aberbargoed In Aberbargoed, former naval officer Mikaela Rees-Swindon became the landlord of The George in March - just a few weeks before lockdown. The pub started serving outside again in July, then inside as restrictions eased. ""They aren't making us shut - but they are making it impossible for us to run the place as a business,"" she said. ""We are being told we have to check tables are being booked for single household groups - well that's my Saturday cancelled."" She said environmental health officials had made it clear the onus was on her and her staff to enforce social distancing and check track and trace information is correct. ""We've been doing everything right - it was going fabulously. But now they have crushed us overnight."" ""Enough is enough,"" said Chief Constable Pam Kelly More than 60 vehicles were stopped in less than three hours of the first evening of the lockdown on Tuesday, though no enforcement action was taken. However Gwent Police's Chief Constable Pam Kelly said she did not want her officers to become ""the Covid police"" and said the force will not be using road blocks across the area. ""Our preferred option is to always work with communities,"" she said. ""We will not be having road blocks where police officers are stopping people and stopping cars. ""But we will be out there engaging with our communities, and if people flout the law, there comes a time where we have to stop engaging and explaining - and if they are not prepared to adhere to the law, policing has to step in."" During a wide-ranging Facebook live question and answer session on Tuesday evening, Mr Gething also said people in Caerphilly county could not go on holiday. What can I do in Caerphilly's lockdown? Coronavirus cases rise by 150 in Wales He said if residents had booked holidays they should speak to their providers, explain it would be a breach of the law for them to travel, and seek a refund. Officials would be in touch with package holiday providers and insurers to explain the ""seriousness of the position and the risk to them and their business"" if people from Caerphilly went on holiday,"" he said. After months of shielding, Yvonne Davies is feeling ""pretty angry"" at the situation in her home town of Caerphilly. ""You could actually see what was going to happen from day one,"" she said. ""I only went to the precinct once and not a person had a mask on. They weren't observing any social distancing and from then on it just got worse and worse."" She said one supermarket had dropped distancing measures, with staff saying it was ""back to normal"". She feels people have become too relaxed about coronavirus: ""They don't realise how serious it is for a start."" What can I do during local lockdowns? How many have died with coronavirus in Wales?

"Rochester police chief La'Ron Singletary has retired, denying claims he tried to keep Daniel Prude's death from public scrutiny The leadership of a New York state police force has stepped down following the death of a black man who was hooded and restrained during an arrest. Announcing his retirement, Rochester police chief La'Ron Singletary said he could not stand by as his handling of the case was being distorted. A grand jury will help determine whether charges should be brought over Daniel Prude's death in March. Seven police officers involved in his arresthave been suspended. Mr Prude, 41, was said to be suffering from acute mental health problems when police were called. Officers found him running naked in the street in light snowfall and restrained him with a ""spit hood"", which is designed to protect police from detainees' saliva. They filmed police brutality - then faced a backlash Can viral videos stop police brutality? Don't shoot, I'm disabled Footage of the incident emerged only recently, igniting fresh protests three months after anti-racism demonstrations rocked the US following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. Daniel Prude died a week after he was restrained by police Chief Singletary said in his statement on Tuesday: ""As a man of integrity, I will not sit idly by while outside entities attempt to destroy my character."" ""The mischaracterisation and the politicisation of the actions that I took after being informed of Mr Prude's death is not based on facts, and is not what I stand for,"" he added. Deputy Chief Joseph Morabito also said he would retire, adding that he had worked on the police force for 34 years. The police chief has denied his department tried to keep details of Mr Prude's death out of public view. The police union saidofficers had followed their training ""step by step"". The spit hood is standard equipment for officers, said Michael Mazzaeo, president of the Rochester Police Locust Club, a union. He added that the officers were in a difficult position trying to help someone who appeared to have a mental illness. Protests in Rochester have taken place nightly following the release of the footage President Donald Trump, a Republican who is accusing Democrats of being anti-police ahead of November's election, tweeted about the resignations. ""The Democrat Mayor and, of courses [sic], Governor Cuomo, have no idea what to do. New York State is a mess,"" he posted. Other senior commanders may also retire, Mayor Warren saidaccording to AP news agency.,external The city leader has already said systemic racism led to Mr Prude's death. Rochester Mayor Lovely Warren also said she had not asked for Mr Singletary's resignation. ""He did not in any way try to cover this up,"" she added. Later on Tuesday, Mayor Warren said that Mr Singletary would remain in charge of the police department until the end of September. ""While the timing and tenor of these resignations is difficult, we have faced tough times before. We will get through this together,"" she said in a statement. This video can not be played The USA's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality The mayor said she would be meeting with city council ""to chart a path forward"", adding that she is ""committed to instituting the reforms necessary in our police department"". Last week, when details of Mr Prude's death became public following a public records request, the mayor expressed frustration with the police chief for not informing her sooner of the case. She said Mr Singletary had initially characterised Mr Prude's death to her as a drug overdose. Police body camera video obtained by the family shows Mr Prude lying on the ground as officers restrain him. Mr Prude, who was not carrying a weapon, can be seen complying with officers immediately. While sitting on the road, he becomes agitated, alternately asking for money or a gun and spitting on the ground. An officer says Mr Prude told them he has Covid-19, and they place the spit hood on him. This video can not be played George Floyd death: Whatâs changed, 100 days later? One officer can be seen pressing down on Mr Prude's head with both hands, saying ""stop spitting"". Mr Prude stops moving and goes quiet, and officers note he feels cold. Mr Prude was taken to hospital in an ambulance. His family agreed to him being taken off life support a week later on 30 March. The Monroe County medical examiner ruled Mr Prude's death a homicide caused by ""complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint"", according to a post-mortem examination. The autopsy report also cited ""excited delirium"" and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or the drug PCP, as contributing factors.

"E. Jean Carroll at an event in 2015 The US Department of Justice has taken legal action to defend President Donald Trump in a defamation case from a woman who accuses him of raping her. Under a court filing, the department is moving to replace the president's private lawyers and take over the case. Columnist E Jean Carroll accuses Mr Trump of assaulting her in a Manhattan department store in the 1990s. In a lawsuit, she argues the president defamed her when he denied her claim by saying she ""wasn't his type"". Mr Trump's critics say that during his presidency he has compromised the US justice department, which is meant to operate independently of the White House. The president has until now been represented in the case, which was filed in New York state court in November 2019, by his personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz. The sexual allegations against Donald Trump Ms Carroll's lawyer, Roberta A Kaplan, said in a statement on Tuesday evening that the justice department intervention was ""shocking"". Its lawyers argue in Tuesday's court filing that Mr Trump can be defended by government attorneys because he was serving in his capacity as president when he denied Ms Carroll's allegation. ""President Trump was acting within the scope of his office as President of the United States at the time of the incidents out of which the Plaintiff's defamation claim arose,"" says the filing. It seeks to elevate the case to a federal court from a state court. This video can not be played Life after #MeToo The government lawyers cite the Federal Tort Claims Act, which offers US government employees a degree of immunity from being sued. University of Texas law school professor Steve Vladeck told CNN that such an intervention by the justice department was highly unusual. The legal analyst said the court filing could effectively kill the case because the federal government cannot be sued for defamation. The move comes a month after a state court judge said Mr Trump could not use a legal immunity defence in the case. The president is currently in the midst of a campaign for re-election against Democratic challenger Joe Biden in November. Biden denies ex-aide's sexual assault allegation Ms Carroll - who is an advice columnist for Elle magazine - said in a statement: ""Today's actions demonstrate that Trump will do everything possible, including using the full powers of the federal government, to block discovery from going forward in my case before the upcoming election to try to prevent a jury from ever deciding which one of us is lying."" Her legal team is asking the president to provide a DNA sample so they can determine whether his genetic material is on a black Donna Karan dress that she says she was wearing at the time of the alleged assault. Lawyer Ms Kaplan said in a statement that ""Trump's effort to wield the power of the US government to evade responsibility for his private misconduct is without precedent and shows even more starkly how far he is willing to go to prevent the truth from coming out"". She says the attack happened at a Bergdorf Goodman store in Midtown Manhattan in late 1995 or early 1996, when the pair bumped into each other while shopping. The former Apprentice star and real estate magnate allegedly asked her for advice when buying lingerie for another woman and jokingly asked her to model it for him. In the changing rooms, she said Mr Trump lunged at her, pinned her against a wall and forced himself on her. Trump dismisses rape allegation as 'fiction' Trump says sexual assault accuser 'not my type' Biden denies ex-aide's sexual assault allegation Ms Carroll claims she managed to push him off after a ""colossal struggle"". Both Mr Trump and Ms Carroll were aged around 50 at the time, and he was married to Marla Maples. Mr Trump has publicly denied the allegation several times, including saying that Ms Carroll was ""totally lying"" and her claim was ""fiction"".

"Government efforts to fight child obesity risk getting lost in reorganisations and delays, a report warns. The National Audit office says 20 years of targets and policies have had limited success and new initiatives may fall short too. It points to a lack of urgency and coordination, while the child obesity problem worsens in parts of the UK. Britain has one of the highest child obesity rates in Western Europe. A fifth of 10- to 11-year-olds are obese, according to latest figures for England. Obese children are much more likely to become obese adults, causing significant health risks. Children from deprived areas or ethnic minorities are far more likely to be obese - and the problem is escalating. But few interventions in the child obesity programme specifically address this, the NAO report says. Although the Department of Health and Social Care is responsible for setting and overseeing obesity policy in England, the cross-government nature of the child obesity programme means many projects are outside of its control. Child obesity: Will we see radical action? Children exceed recommended sugar limit by age 10 In 2016, the government published the first chapter ofits plan,externalaimed at slashing the child obesity rate over the next decade, through measures such as a sugar tax on fizzy drinks. Asecond chapter,externalwas published in 2018, promising to reduce the gap in obesity between children from the most and least deprived areas by 2030. In July 2020 - amid growing evidence of a link between obesity and an increased risk from coronavirus -  the prime minister set out thenext steps, which include: a ban unhealthy ""buy one, get one free"" deals restrictions on junk-food advertising calorie labelling on restaurant menus But a ban on energy-drink sales to under-16s, mooted in 2018, has not gone ahead. And other policies, including the sugar tax on fizzy drinks, have not been fully evaluated to see what impact they have actually had, the NAO says. Without assessing the success or failure of past strategies, the government will struggle to prioritise actions or apply lessons to its new approach with confidence of success, the report warns. Although there has been some progress in reducing sugar levels in popular foods, government will not meet its ambition to have industry reduce sugar by 20% in certain products by 2020, the report says. There is also limited awareness and co-ordination across departments of wider factors and activities that may affect childhood obesity rates, such as sponsorship of sporting events by the food industry. NAO head Gareth Davies said while the new strategy announced in July signalled ""a greater intention"" to tackle obesity, the government must now act with urgency. A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""We are determined to tackle obesity across all ages and we have already taken significant action - cutting sugar from half of drinks on sale, funding exercise programmes in schools and working with councils to tackle child obesity locally. ""We are also taking bold action through our new and ambitious obesity strategy... to help families make healthy choices."" But Dr Layla McCay, from the NHS Confederation, said it appeared the government had not learned from the failures of past efforts. ""This is such an important moment for effective action but it risks becoming lost amidst reorganisation and delays,"" she said. ""At a time when obesity is in the spotlight for putting people with Covid-19 at greater risk of needing hospital admission or intensive care, it has never been clearer that an effective approach is needed."" The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said money must follow commitments. ""As ever, the communities that need these services most are those that have faced the most severe funding cuts,"" it added. Child obesity: Will we see radical action?

"Cartoonist Corinne Rey said there was a ""silence of death"" after the shooting rampage in 2015 A survivor of the Charlie Hebdo killings has told a French court of the trauma she has suffered since she was forced at gunpoint to let two attackers into the magazine's offices. Cartoonist Corinne Rey gave emotional testimony at the trial of 14 people accused of helping the two attackers. The militant Islamists shot dead 12 people in and around Charlie Hebdo's Paris office in January 2015. Five more were killed by a third gunman in related attacks. The 17 victims were killed over a period of three days. All three attackers were killed by police. The killings marked the beginning of a wave of jihadist attacks across France that left more than 250 people dead. France marks five years since Paris massacre Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror How Europe deals with freed terror offenders Paris attacks: 'I am not Charlie' In the days following the 2015 attacks, millions of people took part in solidarity marches across France and around the world under the slogan ""Je suis Charlie"" (I am Charlie). The magazine marked the start of the trial by reprinting controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad that had sparked protests in several Muslim countries. Ms Rey, 38, had tears in her eyes on Tuesday as she recalled the moment she was confronted by the attackers, Cherif and Said Kouachi, at Charlie Hebdo's offices on 7 January 2015. The cartoonist had left the magazine's weekly editorial meeting early to go downstairs for a smoke when she encountered the gunmen at the door. Brandishing assault rifles, the gunmen called her by her pen name, ""Coco"", and said ""we want Charlie Hebdo"", Ms Rey told the court. Threatening to kill her, the gunmen forced her to escort them to the magazine's second-floor offices, telling her: ""You have insulted the prophet, we are al-Qaida Yemen."" The attackers targeted Charlie Hebdo because they believed the magazine had blasphemed against Islam by publishing caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. The issue of depicting the Prophet Muhammad At the top of the stairs, the attackers ordered Ms Rey to tap in the entry code for the office as they pointed their weapons at her. ""I had a sense of dread,"" Ms Rey said in court, appearing visibly emotional. ""I was in distress, I could not think anymore."" ""I was devastated, as if dispossessed of myself, I could no longer do anything. I moved towards the code keypad and I typed it in,"" she recalled. ""I felt that the terrorists were approaching their goal, I felt them growing excited next to me."" Inside the office, Said and Cherif Kouachi opened fire on the magazine's staff. Simon Fieschi, the administrator of the weekly's website, was the first to be shot. Meanwhile, Ms Rey said she ran to hide under a desk. ""After the shots, there was silence, a silence of death... I thought they were going to finish off the job with all the ones they hadn't killed,"" Ms Rey said. In less than two minutes, the shooting spree was over. The attackers left, leaving behind a vision of ""horror"", Ms Rey said. The magazine's editor at the time,StÃ©phane Charbonnier, better known as Charb,was among four celebrated cartoonists killed. ""This is something I will live with the rest of my life. I felt so powerless, felt so guilty,"" Ms Rey said. The gunmen were eventually killed by security forces after a lengthy manhunt. Their victims were eight journalists, two police officers, a caretaker and a visitor. In a related attack just days later, jihadist gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed three customers and an employee in a hostage siege at the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket in Porte de Vincennes in the east of Paris. This video can not be played Footage taken from a rooftop in Paris shows two gunmen firing shots He had earlier shot dead a policewoman in the city. Security forces eventually stormed the supermarket before killing him and freeing the remaining hostages. They include 35-year-oldAli Reza Polat, who is seen as the main link between the two attacks and is believed to have had a key role in obtaining the weapons used. He subsequently attempted to flee to Dubai, Lebanon and Syria but without success. MickaÃ«l Pastor Alwatik'sDNA was found on two guns discovered at Coulibaly's home and a glove at the scene.Mohamed Fareshas told investigators he was a middleman involved in the sale of the assault rifle used in the supermarket attack, whileAmir Ramdani, Samir Makhlouf,Willy PrevostandChristophe Raumelare accused of having provided support. Hayat Boumedienne was reportedly seen in Syria last year Two people in Belgium - garage ownerMetin Karasularand his associateMichel Catino,an unemployed Italian in his 60s - and two more in north-eastern France - garage ownerMiguel Martinezand his associateAbdelaziz Abbad- are accused of supplying ""assault rifles, automatic pistols, rocket launchers, chargers and ammunition, bulletproof vests"" to the three gunmen. On trial in absentia isHayat Boumedienne, Coulibaly's partner. She fled France for Syria a week before the attack. Previously believed killed in a US air strike last year, French media reports now suggest she may still be alive. A female French jihadist questioned by security services as she tried to re-enter France told them that she had seen Hayat Boumedienne in the al-Hol camp for IS detainees last October and that Hayat Boumedienne had then escaped from the camp. Mohamed and Mehdi Belhoucineare accused of helping Hayat Boumedienne get to Syria. Both are believed to have been killed in Syria or Iraq.

"The UK's ambassador to the US quit after private comments about the Trump administration were leaked The UK's former ambassador to the US has told BBC Newsnight he does not regret criticising Donald Trump in briefings later leaked to the media. Kim Darroch quit last year after it emerged he described the US President's government as ""dysfunctional"", ""inept"" and ""divided"" in private letters. The use of ""clear and direct"" language was not unusual for diplomats when reporting to ministers, he insisted. But its disclosure to the media was a ""vindictive"" breach of trust, he said. Lord Darroch left his post in July 2019 amid a huge diplomatic rowover the leaking of a series of private cables, in which he had questioned the competence of the Trump administration and its handling of major foreign policy issues, such as relations with Iran. In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC's Newsnight, to be broadcast at 22:45 BST on BBC Two, he said he accepted his position had become untenable after his observations became public, leading Mr Trump to describe him as a ""stupid guy"" and ""pompous fool"". UK ambassador to US resigns in Trump leaks row Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? But he defended his conduct during his three years in Washington, saying it was the job of diplomats to report in unvarnished terms about the workings of foreign governments and how they could affect the UK national interest. ""I never regret the terms in which I'd reported,"" he said. ""I spent 40 years in the Foreign Office writing in these terms and people hitherto had thought it a strength and an asset. ""There is nothing unusual in reporting in clear and direct terms. Wikileaks shows American diplomats reporting in direct terms and the US embassy was reporting directly about how the UK government was handling Brexit."" He said he knew he was ""in trouble"" when a confidential letter sent in 2017 to a small group of colleagues, which described the early weeks of the Trump era as ""uniquely dysfunctional"", appeared in the Mail on Sunday. He said he did not blame the newspaper for publishing the material but believed whoever had passed it onto them had acted in an ""irresponsible and vindictive"" way. In 2019 confidential emails emerged in which the former UK ambassador to the UScalled the Trump administration ""clumsy and inept"" In an angry response President Trump called the ambassador, then Sir Kim Darroch, a ""a very stupid guy"" Sir Kim stepped down saying it was ""impossible"" for him to continue, although he had the backing of many senior figures Boris Johnson - a Tory leadership candidate at the time - faced strong criticism for failing to fully support him The row ended a diplomatic career spanning 40 years, including time as the UK's permanent representative to the EU and national security adviser Ex-US ambassador 'showed little fury' in person If their aim had been to get him replaced by a Brexit-supporting politician, such as the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, rather than another career diplomat, they clearly failed, he said. ""I blame the leaker taking highly classified information of the most damaging kind to me and to US-UK relations. This video can not be played Lord Darroch on UK's government stance on EU trade deal ""If you're in the position of having to write in code because you can't trust your colleagues that way madness lies. You have to trust them and on this occasion that trust was misplaced."" The Metropolitan Police launched a criminal probe into the leaking of the material in August 2019, with Commissioner Cressida Dick describing it as a ""very serious crime"". Boris Johnson, who at the time of Lord Darroch's exit was vying to be the next Conservative leader and prime minister, was criticised for not coming out in support of the UK diplomat and insisting he must stay in post. Lord Darroch said it would have been ""nice"" if Mr Johnson had done so but understood why he wanted to keep his ""options open"" given the ambassador had been left ""dangling"" by the row. Reflecting on his time in Washington and the current state of US-UK relations, he said the US President was ""not a politician"" in the conventional sense and it was not a surprise that Mr Johnson was ""fascinated"" by him. Asked if some of Mr Trump's approach to politics had rubbed off on Mr Johnson, he said it may be influencing his current ""negotiating style"" over a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. The PM has been criticised forthreatening to change the terms of the legally-binding Withdrawal Agreement with the EU in the eventthe UK does not negotiate a trade deal. ""Trump famously said Theresa May should start Brexit negotiations by suing the EU, a mad dog negotiating style,"" Lord Darroch said. ""If you go back to the PM in 2018, he said if Trump was negotiating Brexit he would create chaos at the start and people would be outraged at what he was saying and there'd be huge rows and there might be a good outcome. ""We should think about that. That's when he was becoming dissatisfied with Brexit and now I watch the government conduct its future relationship I wonder if there's an element of Trump."" Lord Darroch, who became a member of the House of Lords in January, said he believed the so-called ""special relationship"" between the US and UK would remain strong whoever won November's presidential election. While Mr Johnson got on better with Mr Trump than his predecessor, this did not mean there would not be ""ups and downs"" if he were re-elected and that negotiations on a transatlantic trade deal would not be ""difficult"". And while Mr Trump's Democratic rival for the Presidency, Joe Biden, was an ""Anglophile"", he was vice-president in the Obama administration which famously said the UK would be at the ""back of the queue"" for a trade deal if it voted to leave the EU, added Lord Darroch. ""Biden said he'd have voted Remain so I have more questions about the relationship with a Democrat,"" he added.

"Denmark had chances to win the game in Copenhagen England played out a dreary deadlock with Denmark in Copenhagen as the Nations League meeting turned into a drab non-event. Harry Kane almost won it for England in the dying seconds when he went round Denmark keeper Kasper Schmeichel, only to see his shot cleared off the line by Mathias Jorgensen - but such a poor quality encounter barely deserved a dramatic finale. Manager Gareth Southgate will have hoped for some talking points on the pitch after the off-field distraction that saw young duo Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood sent home for breaking Covid-19 protocols in Iceland. Wolverhampton Wanderers captain Conor Coady made a measured England debut while Leeds United's Kalvin Phillips had a quiet introduction - and Aston Villa midfield man Jack Grealish finally got his long-awaited bow with 14 minutes left. Denmark had the better chances until Kane's late effort, with England keeper Jordan Pickford saving well from Kasper Dolberg in the first half and Christian Eriksen shooting over when well placed late on. England were sterile and conservative, creating very little apart from a Kane header off target and a low shot from Raheem Sterling that brought a smart save from Schmeichel before that late chance. Arsenal youngster Ainsley Maitland-Niles became England's fourth debutant in the final minutes on a night of very little excitement. 'Southgate must address lack of productivity, positivity and ambition' Trust needs to be rebuilt with Foden and Greenwood - Southgate Football Daily podcast: England are dull and drab in Denmark England's ploy of playing a three-man central defence and effectively two holding midfielders in Phillips and Declan Rice afforded Denmark the sort of respect that might be better reserved for more elite sides. It set the tone for a disappointing England performance, lacking in ambition and threat and one which would not have have deserved the late victory Kane almost gave them. There is the usual context that this is effectively a pre-season game in an international guise for England's players but there was no excuse for such a lifeless display lacking in energy. England's attacking trio of Kane, Sterling and the anonymous Jadon Sancho were nowhere near their best but they could point to the fact that they were cut off from any sort of supply line by the manner of Southgate's set-up. The team itself had an experimental air but there was no escaping England should have done much better than this. Wolves captain Conor Coady was no shrinking violet as he made his England debut, making his presence felt and heard even before kick-off. As silence fell on the largely deserted Parken Stadion in the seconds before the start, Coady's voice was heard bellowing instructions to his new England colleagues. The 27-year-old looked at home with England, urging team-mates on throughout and shouting tactical instructions. He also played well and can be very satisfied with his first taste of senior international football, playing his part in the clean sheet. It was a more subdued night for 24-year-old Leeds midfielder Phillips but it is worth remembering this is a player entering international football before even making his debut in the Premier League. England's system was not ideal for him and there were times in the first half when the game passed him by but he showed composure on the ball and did not waste possession, improving in the second half. Grealish can finally got the opportunity that will delight his many supporters but he had little time to influence affairs, apart from a couple of trademark jinking runs that came to nothing. This was England's sixth goalless draw in 43 matches under Gareth Southgate - as many as Roy Hodgson played out in 56 games in charge. The last England manager to oversee more 0-0s was Bobby Robson (17). England managed just two shots on target, their fewest since their behind-closed-doors match against Croatia in October 2018 (also two). England have kept a clean sheet in five successive competitive matches for the first time since another run of five ending in March 2017. Denmark have kept a clean sheet in six of their past eight matches in all competitions, conceding just three goals in this time. England's first shot on target in this game came in the 70th minute courtesy of Raheem Sterling - it was the longest they had to wait since a World Cup match against Costa Rica in 2014 (80th minute). This was the first time the England men's team has named four debutants in a non-friendly match since October 1962 in a European Championship qualifier against Poland (Ray Charnley, Chris Crowe, Mike Hellawell, Alan Hinton). Phillips was the first Leeds United player to start for England since Danny Mills in 2003, while Coady was the first Wolves player to start for England since Steve Bull in 1990.

"This video can not be played Footage shows the EasyJet pilot refusing to accept Nick's medical exemption card A man with serious breathing issues says he was ""ambushed"" into wearing a face covering on a plane. EasyJet has apologised after one of its pilots was filmed threatening to remove the passenger from the flight. The man was carrying an exemption card - but it was rejected by the crew on his journey from Jersey to Gatwick. Face coverings on UK public transport are mandatory but some people are allowed not to wear them, due to age, health or disability reasons. Wearing a face covering is ""strongly recommended"" on the Island of Jersey, but certain groups are allowed not to wear them, including those with breathing difficulties. The BBC has also been told of cases where people with lung conditions have been turned away from shops and other types of public transport because they were unable to wear a mask. Charities say exemptions must be respected by companies and understood by the public. With masks now a part of daily life, the challenge for many is striking a balance between safety procedures and protecting vulnerable people. Coronavirus: Hancock concern over 'sharp rise' in cases Coronavirus: New figures show UK faces 'impossible balancing act' Nick says he can't wear anything around his face or neck because he has chronic asthma. ""Whether it's a polo neck or a scarf round your face, the sensation is stifling. I just find it increasingly difficult to breathe,"" he says. ""It's like a steel belt round my chest."" Research suggests face coverings can help reduce the spread of coronavirus, particularly indoors where physical distancing is difficult. The Department for Transport for England says those who are exempt can choose to carry a card, badge or a homemade sign. However, providing documentation is a personal choice and not necessary in law. Nick showed his exemption card to the pilot Nick had printed off an official exemption card from the government's website before flying to the island of Jersey to see his family in August. The card was accepted on the flight out, but on the return journey the crew said it was not valid and he would have to wear a mask. Nick refused. He says: ""The staff came to speak to me around six times. The 30-minute delay was seen as my fault and each visit whipped up more hostility among the passengers. ""I was insulted, shouted at, laughed at. It felt like everybody was against me."" Nick says he became so desperate he started filming on his phone. Footage shows the pilot refusing to accept his exemption card and saying if Nick didn't put on a mask, he ""was off"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to wear a face covering Nick eventually agreed, but says it caused him to hyperventilate during the hour-long flight. ""I would do anything to avoid wearing anything that restricts my breathing. That's more terrifying than being insulted by 100 passengers, but eventually I felt like I had no choice."" Shaken by the ""storm of abuse"" he says he received from other passengers, Nick requested partial anonymity when speaking to the BBC. EasyJet says all customers are required to wear a face covering but acknowledges some passengers may not be able to. A statement from the airline said: ""We have recently updated our policies in line with recent UK government guidance so that as well as a medical certificate, customers can alternatively provide a relevant document from a government website or lanyard. ""We are sorry that this new policy was not recognised by the crew on this occasion."" The airline described Nick's behaviour as ""disruptive"", but a passenger, who did not want to be named, said he behaved ""calmly"" in a ""stressful situation"". ""No-one seemed to care about his condition. The staff should have taken him away from the other passengers to have the conversation in private,"" he tells the BBC. Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation called Nick's story a distressing case, but says there are others like him. ""The government is really clear there are exemptions from wearing a mask,"" explains Head of Policy, Sarah MacFadyen. ""The vast majority of people with lung conditions are fine wearing a mask, but for a small number it is impossible for them to breathe. That's why these exemptions are in place, so they can still go out and live their lives."" THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TESTING:What tests are available?

British Geological has released the seismograms for the Leighton Buzzard 3.3 magnitude event John Yorke, a computer programmer in Woburn Sands, Bedfordshire, said: ""It felt like one subtle jolt to the house which made the windows vibrate. ""My initial thought was to look out of the window expecting to see a car had crashed into our property. I haven't felt anything like it before."" Ms Smith of Dunstable told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""I was in my room and I thought my stepdad was doing something in the garage because the whole room just went from side to side, really strongly. ""It was like the foundation beneath me had kind of jolted.""

Christine Sawyer, who lives in a mobile home in Caddington, said it had left her ""really scared"" as she feared her property had broken off its mooring.

He said: ""It felt like a car had crashed into my house, but then the rumbling and shaking continued.
