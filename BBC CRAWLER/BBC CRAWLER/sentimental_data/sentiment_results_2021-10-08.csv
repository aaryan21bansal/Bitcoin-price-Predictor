"With the news dominated by other issues, it has gone almost unnoticed that the UK now has one of the highest rates of Covid infection in Europe. But, as winter fast approaches, how worried should we be? The rates certainly look troubling. Only a handful of countries, including Romania and Serbia, have higher infection levels than the UK. And compared with the big nations in western Europe, the numbers are significantly higher. There is a variety of reasons for this. The UK - or rather England - was the first nation in Europe to fully unlock when it ended most Covid restrictions on 19 July. It was not until late August that an EU country - Denmark - followed suit. Others, such as Norway, have only taken this step in recent weeks, while many have retained a significant number of measures, such as limits on large gatherings, Covid passports to enter bars and restaurants, social distancing and mandatory mask-wearing. For example, in Germany and Italy there are still restrictions on large crowds at events like football matches. And in a number of nations, such as Spain, social distancing remains in schools as does wearing masks from the age of six. So it is hardly surprising a virus that thrives on human contact has taken off in the UK compared with the rest of Europe. Another factor is vaccination. At the start of the year and into the spring, the UK was leading the way on vaccination. But not any more, with the likes of Spain, Portugal and France all having administered more doses per head of population. A big reason for this is that many nations have started vaccinating under-16s, whereas this is only just getting going in the UK. But when it comes to protecting people from serious illness - older people and those with health conditions - the UK has similar high levels of vaccine uptake. And that protection means the gap in the numbers dying is much smaller. There are currently just over 100 deaths a day on average linked to Covid. That may sound a lot, but it is similar to what happens in a bad flu season for months on end. Of course, death should not be the only measure. Every day there are about 700 people being admitted into hospital with Covid. For some, the road to recovery will be long and arduous. There is also then the risk of ""long Covid"" among those who have not become severely ill. The idea of persistent symptoms after a viral infection is not unique to Covid - it also happens with flu. But given we are still learning about Covid and it appears to happen more often, there are some who argue this warrants more action to contain spread. Prof Christina Pagel and Prof Martin McKee, both of whom are members of Independent Sage, a self-appointed group of experts which has been critical of the approach taken by the government,wrote in the Guardian,externalthis week about the benefits of the ""vaccine-plus"" approaches taken on mainland Europe. But extra measures do come with a cost, so for others it comes back to trade-offs. Prof Mike Tildesley, an expert in infectious disease modelling at the University of Warwick, believes there needs to be a debate about what is an ""acceptable"" level of Covid or we could find ourselves relying on extra measures long-term. ""Covid is here to stay - we need to discuss what we are willing to live with."" But it is not just where we are at, it's where we are heading that matters. There has always been variation in rates across Europe as a result of different approaches and being at different stages of the pandemic. The UK was hit by the more infectious variants Alpha and then Delta before other parts of Europe. Back in early spring, for example, the UK had one of the lowest rates in Europe because our Alpha wave had passed and Europe's was in full swing. With Covid the situation can change quickly. And as the chart on deaths above illustrates, this may already be happening. The UK death rate is falling - an achievement in itself given how open society is and a sign that the virus has been brought under some control. If nothing else really rapid surges in infection should be a thing of the past because of the amount of immunity in the population most experts agree. The epidemic here is largely being fuelled by high rates in teenagers - and, in particular, those under the age of 16 who have not had a chance to get vaccinated over the summer, unlike many of their peers elsewhere in Europe. Children are, of course, at very low risk of serious illness. So the concern has always been that infections in the young could spread into older age groups. But the early signs are that that is not happening - and the rise in children may have peaked. Prof Tildesley says he is ""cautiously optimistic"" about the data although he says it is quite possible rates in teenagers will remain high for a little while. When this wave in teenagers ends, through a combination of natural immunity and the vaccination programme that is clicking into gear, we could actually start to see a sustained fall in infections as winter approaches. That, after all, was always the argument the government and its senior scientists - Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance - made when they decided to unlock on 19 July - that is was better to have our ""exit wave"" before winter really hit. Prof Neil Ferguson, one of the senior scientists advising ministers, said this week there was a lot of uncertainty about what would happen next, but a sustained decline from this point on was possible. ""It's not guaranteed we will see a winter wave,"" he told MPs on the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Coronavirus. But the problem, he said, was there was ""limited headroom"" in the NHS to cope with even a little surge. And that is one of the big risks with the government's approach. The NHS has, compared with other nations, much less capacity to absorb extra demand. And this winter that will not just come from Covid. Lockdowns and social distancing meant the traditional winter viruses were largely absent last year. That will have led to less immunity across the population, prompting fears they could rebound back in a big way. A virus called RSV, which can cause 30,000 admissions every winter among the under-fives - six times what we have seen so far in that age group from Covid - is already circulating at very high levels. The flu season is just beginning. It will not take much for the situation to unravel.

"The Amazon rainforest is home to one in 10 known species on Earth Facebook says it will begin clamping down on the illegal sale of protected areas of the Amazon rainforest on its site. The social media giant changed its policy following a BBC investigation into the practice. The new measures will apply only to conservation areas and not to publicly owned forest. And the move will be limited to the Amazon, not other rainforests and wildlife habitats across the world. According to a recent study from the think tank Ipam (Instituto de Pesquisa Ambental da Amazonia), a third of all deforestation happens in publicly-owned forests in the Amazon. Facebook said it would not reveal how it planned to find the illegal ads but said it would ""seek to identify and block new listings"" in protected areas of the Amazon rainforest. In February, the BBC Our World documentarySelling the Amazonrevealed that plots of rainforest as large as 1,000 football pitches were being listed on Facebook's classified ads service. Alvim Souza Alves was trying to sell land for about Â£16,400 Many of the plots were inside protected areas, including national forests and land reserved for indigenous peoples. In order to prove the ads were real, the BBC arranged meetings between four sellers and an undercover operative posing as a lawyer claiming to represent wealthy investors. One land-grabber, Alvim Souza Alves, was trying to sell a plot inside the Uru Eu Wau Wau indigenous reserve for about Â£16,400 in local currency. In response to the BBC's investigation, Brazil's Supreme Federal Court ordered an inquiry into the sale of protected areas of the Amazon via Facebook. Despite calls from indigenous leaders to do more, at the time Facebook said it was ""ready to work with local authorities"", but would not take independent action to halt the trade. Now the company says it has consulted the UN Environment Programme (Unep) and other organisations to take its ""first steps"" in trying to address the issue. ""We will now review listings on Facebook Marketplace against an international organisation's authoritative database of protected areas to identify listings that may violate this new policy,"" the Californian tech firm clarified. Much of the land being sold is in indigenous reserves The announcement comes at a time when the social media giant is under increasing pressure from US lawmakers, following a series of bombshell leaks by whistle-blower and former Facebook employee, Frances Haugen. Facebook also faced criticism this week when a failure brought down the entire platform for five hours worldwide. Instagram and Whatsapp, both owned by Facebook, were also offline during the period. To try to catch criminal sellers, Facebook is using a database managed by the Unep World Conservation Monitoring Centre. Unep says it is the most ""comprehensive"" database of its kind and is updated monthly using reports from ""a range of government and other institutions"". But Brazilian lawyer and scientist Brenda Brito questions the effectiveness of Facebook's proposals, saying: ""If they don't make it mandatory for sellers to provide the location of the area on sale, any attempt at blocking them will be flawed. ""They may have the best database in the world, but if they don't have some geo-location reference, it won't work,"" she added. In its investigation, the BBC found some ads featured satellite images and GPS co-ordinates but not all shared that level of information. Facebook told the BBC it did not intend to require sellers to post the precise location of advertised land. ""We know there are no 'silver bullets' in this topic and we will continue to work to prevent people from circumventing our inspection,"" a company spokesperson said. The Amazon rainforest occupies 7.5 million sq km and spans more than seven countries, including Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. The tech firm would not confirm whether it was also working with each region's respective government to strengthen enforcement. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet it's climate targets? About 60% of the Amazon rainforest is in Brazil where deforestation rates are at a 12-year high. The Brazilian government's public forest database, which would be a key tool for any attempt to control the majority of illegal sales online, isn't being used. ""This data has been available since 2016. It is information they could use to improve this effort,"" says Brenda Brito. However, environmental activists in Brazil are calling the Facebook announcement a small victory against a backdrop of massive deforestation in the Amazon and several congressional attempts to weaken protection laws. Ivaneide Bandeira, whose NGO Kandide was among those calling for Facebook to do more when the BBC's investigation came out in February, says she is pleased. ""I think this announcement is a good thing. Although it's coming late, because they should never have allowed those ads. ""But the fact that they are now taking this position is good because it will help to protect the territory, as it will help not to publicise the sale of land inside a protected area or an indigenous land.""

It would look at cases in which somebody made an allegation of sexual misconduct or domestic abuse, against a police officer or member of staff, who was still employed by the force. She said: ""We'll be going back to look at some of those investigations just to make sure that the processes that should have taken place have, and that we are taking the right management action after the case is closed, for example in vetting."" The Mayor of London Sadiq Khan welcomed Baroness Casey's appointment and said public trust in the police ""requires urgent rebuilding"".

"Fellow politicians have paid tribute to Tory MP James Brokenshire, who has died aged 53, having been diagnosed with lung cancer more than three years ago. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the father of three, a former Northern Ireland secretary, as the ""nicest, kindest"" colleague. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called him ""a thoroughly decent man"". Mr Brokenshire, a lifelong non-smoker, stood down as a Home Office minister earlier this year. He died in hospital on Thursday night, having been admitted after his condition deteriorated. An MP since 2005, Mr Brokenshire served in government under three prime ministers - David Cameron, Theresa May and Mr Johnson. House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has ordered that flags in Parliament's New Palace Yard be flown at half-mast to mark ""a profound loss to us all"". Minister steps back from role for cancer surgery Brokenshire in lung cancer awareness call Mrs May tweeted: ""Truly saddened by the death of James Brokenshire. He was an outstanding public servant, a talented minister and a loyal friend."" And Mr Johnson tweeted that it was ""desperately sad"", adding: ""James was the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians but also extraordinarily effective."" Mr Brokenshire, who was MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup in Kent, resigned as Northern Ireland secretary in January 2018 following his lung cancer diagnosis, but made a comeback to the cabinet a few months later as housing secretary. He lost that job in July 2019, after Mr Johnson took over from Mrs May in 10 Downing Street. Mr Brokenshire re-entered government as a Home Office minister in February last year, but stood down in July this year, due to poor health. This video can not be played Former adviser Peter Cardwell: ""James was the best of politics and he was the best of humanity."" Following his death, Mr Brokenshire's family expressed ""deep sadness"", adding: ""James was not only a brilliant government minister... but a dedicated constituency MP. ""But most importantly, he was a loving father to his three children, a devoted husband to Cathy and a faithful friend to so many."" The family also thanked NHS staff, including those at Guy's & St Thomas' hospital in London, for treating Mr Brokenshire ""with such warmth, diligence and professionalism over the past three-and-a-half years"". They also shared a memorial page on his Twitter feed, which encouraged people to share memories and photos of Mr Brokenshire and to donate to the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation in lieu of flowers. ""In the last few years of his life James's passion was to help others with lung cancer, preventing others going through what he did,"" the memorial page said, describing him as an ""indefatigable campaigner for better lung cancer screening"". After his lung cancer diagnosis, Mr Brokenshire, a former lawyer, worked to promote greater awareness of the disease, urging people who showed symptoms to get tested. Fellow Conservative MP Karen Bradley told the BBC News Channel the news of her ""understated"" friend's death was ""heartbreaking"", adding: ""I can't believe I'm not going to be able to sit down with James again and have a laugh about life, and chat about the issues that we both cared about. ""My thoughts are with Cathy and the family, who are just the most wonderful family. I'm devastated."" James Brokenshire (right) served under Theresa May, as well as David Cameron and Boris Johnson Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""James Brokenshire was a thoroughly decent man, dedicated and effective in all briefs he held. ""He fought his illness with dignity and bravery. I'm incredibly sad to learn of his death and send my condolences to his wife and children."" The UK's most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, said: ""I had the personal privilege of working with him closely over a number of years and admired greatly his unwavering commitment to public service and compassion."" The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, tweeted: ""So sorry to hear of the death of James Brokenshire, whose courage and faith were an inspiration to so many, myself included."" Before becoming the Old Bexley & Sidcup MP in 2010, Mr Brokenshire represented the seat of Hornchurch and Rainham, north-east London, for five years. His death will prompt a Parliamentary by-election in Old Bexley and Sidcup, where he had a majority of 18,952 at the last general election.

"Former US President Donald Trump ""grossly exaggerated"" the profitability of his Washington DC hotel, a probe by a congressional committee has found. It also said he appeared to hide ""potential conflicts of interest"". The Trump International Hotel lost over $70m (Â£51.3m) during his term, though Mr Trump had previously claimed it earned at least $150m during that time. The Trump Organization has denied wrongdoing and called the report ""misleading"". In a statement, the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Reform said that documents provided by the General Services Administration (GSA) - which oversees federal spending - showed that Mr Trump had ""grossly exaggerated the financial health"" of the hotel. Losses forced Mr Trump's holding company to inject at least $24m to help the struggling hotel, located just a few blocks from the White House, the committee said. The report also found Mr Trump seemed to have ""concealed potential conflicts of interest"" related to his ownership of the hotel and his roles as its lender and the guarantor of third-party loans. Newly obtained documents show that the hotel received $3.7m in payments from foreign governments - enough to cover 7,400 nights at the hotel on an average daily rate, according to the committee. The lawmakers said that the amount raised concerns about potential violations of constitutional regulations aimed at preventing foreign influence on federal officials. The oversight report found that during the four years of his administration, Mr Trump also received ""significant financial benefit"" from Deutsche Bank. The Democrat-led committee said this allowed Mr Trump to delay making payments on a $170m loan for six years, and that he did not publicly disclose this benefit from a foreign bank while president. Lawmakers have asked for additional documents from the GSA on the hotel, including on foreign payments and loans. In a statement sent to the media, the Trump Organization called the report ""intentionally misleading, irresponsible and unequivocally false"" and described it as ""political harassment"". The hotel was opened to the public in September 2016, several weeks after Mr Trump accepted the Republican Party's nomination for president. In 2017, Mr Trump resigned from his companies, andplaced them in a trust to be run by his sons. But the Office of Government Ethics said at the time that Mr Trump's plan didn't ""meet the standards"" of former presidents. In 2019, an internal GSA watchdog said the agency had chosen to ""ignore"" the Constitution when allowing the Trump Hotel to keep its lease after Mr Trump's election. The Trump Organization has been looking for buyers for the 263-room hotel since 2019, but has so far been unable to sell the property.

"This video can not be played Glasgow students film footage of 'unfinished halls' A luxury student accommodation complex in Glasgow has been branded a ""filthy and unfinished building site"". The Cathedral Street property, named Bridle Works, is billed as having a ""range of top-class amenities"" including a gym and rooftop terrace. But students have complained to provider Novel Student as they felt they were ""misled"" over conditions. The firm said the pandemic had affected construction and it was ""disappointed"" to hear the students' experiences. Students have shared photos of the building interior with BBC Scotland, showing unfinished work One image shows toilet doors that had still to be hung In a letter seen by the BBC, 38 international students detail a list of complaints including: Rooms covered in dust from ongoing construction work Holes in ceilings and floors, and exposed wiring Unfinished communal areas Flooding and leaks And upfront rent costs paid for rooms that aren't complete One post-graduate student - who asked to remain anonymous - told BBC Scotland she arrived in the country from abroad last month. The 22-year-old said she found the accommodation via the University of Strathclyde website. BBC Scotland found links to the property from the university's student association site. She paid more than Â£10,000 up front for a year's stay at Bridle Works. Students complained of dust from construction covering rooms Four days after she made the payment, however, the company informed her that her room was still under construction - a fortnight before she was due to move in mid-September. She said: ""I was told by a couple of other international students it would be difficult to secure a place in the city this year due to an ongoing housing shortage and the UN conference. However, I managed to be linked to Bridle Works. ""There was never any mention online, on the phone calls or in any correspondence with Novel Student that it was still under construction until after I paid my rent. ""I felt it was incredibly misleading as my parents and I were under the impression it was finished."" The website for the complex describes ""excellent facilities"" How the luxury student accommodation in Glasgow city centre is advertised Novel Student offered to reimburse rent costs for days missed at the property and accommodate students in hotels in Glasgow. However, the student said she was told she could live on a lower floor until her room was ready. Scotland's students face accommodation 'nightmare' Students return with cautious hope for normality University outbreaks were 'accident waiting to happen' She added: ""I arrived in Scotland and then moved into what was evidently a construction site. ""My room just gets coated with dirt. I can only open my window at night, and have to vacuum three times a day to manage the dust from internal construction. Not how I want to spend my time. ""What was advertised was a space that has amenities, where you can peacefully study in your room. But what we got was a place full of hazards and noise. It was the opposite of peaceful. ""I have counted 40 fire alarms since I moved in last month, sometimes in the middle of the night. And those are just the ones I am home for."" The firm said the pandemic had slowed construction An artist's impression shows a planned rooftop terrace for the property The 20-floor development advertises 422 rooms starting at Â£238 per week. On its website, Novel Student said: ""You won't have to splash on extra gym memberships, or laundry fees, making it much more affordable for student life. ""All bills are also included in your rent, so you can set your budget for the month without having to worry about any unpleasant surprises."" BBC Scotland understands issues have been shared in a WhatsApp group comprising 81 students. In written statements also included in the letter of complaint, one student said: ""When I moved in [my room] was extremely dirty with dirty water hand marks on my banisters and door frames. ""When I wiped down the inside of my cupboards, the cloth I used turned black. I have only gotten hot water after a week of staying here and when I first moved in, my radiator fell off the wall. ""Not to mention, my sprinkler cover fell off my ceiling the other day with no warning. My friend's room has literal holes in the flooring."" Another student wrote that none of the amenities advertised by Novel Student had been provided apart from the gym, where they said ""half the machines"" were not working. They also said one out of four lifts in the building can be used by tenants as the rest are being used by construction crew. The complaint detailed holes in the floors and ceilings Novel Student - which runs other sites in Edinburgh, Belfast and Sheffield - said it is ""committed to delivering exceptional student experiences"". In a statement, it said: ""We are naturally disappointed to hear of any resident experiences that fall short of that. ""The Covid-19 pandemic has undoubtedly presented significant challenges to our operations given the three-month construction shutdown - a universal obstacle experienced by companies working in different capacities across the real estate industry. ""It is our goal to always ensure the on-time delivery of products to residents, and given the significant challenges we have faced, we have had to accelerate this process to the best of our ability."" It added: ""We greatly appreciate the patience of our residents as we navigate these challenges and sympathize with the disruptions they have endured over the last several weeks. ""Out of respect for the privacy of the entire community, residents and staff alike, we cannot comment publicly on more specific matters concerning our residents."" The University of Strathclyde said it had no agreement with Novel and had not referred any students there. ""Our website links to a housing guide created by Strath Union which lists all of the major private student accommodation providers in Glasgow but does not make any recommendations or endorse any provider, as stated on the guide,"" a spokesman said.

"Chancellor Rishi Sunak and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen both welcomed the deal Most of the world's nations have signed up to a historic deal to ensure big companies pay a fairer share of tax. A hundred and thirty six countries agreed to enforce a corporate tax rate of at least 15% and a fairer system of taxing profits where they are earned. It follows concern that multinational companies are re-routing their profits through low tax jurisdictions. Countries including Ireland had opposed the deal but have now agreed to the policy. UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the deal would ""upgrade the global tax system for the modern age"". ""We now have a clear path to a fairer tax system, where large global players pay their fair share wherever they do business,"" he said. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an intergovernmental organisation, has led talks on a minimum rate for a decade. It said the deal could bring in an extra $150bn (Â£108bn) of tax a year, bolstering economies as they recover from Covid. Ireland to increase corporation tax rate to 15% US delays tariffs in 'tech tax' row Ireland to increase corporation tax rate to 15% Yet it also said it did not seek to ""eliminate"" tax competition between countries, only to limit it. The floor under corporate tax will come in from 2023. Countries will also have more scope to tax multinational companies operating within their borders, even if they don't have a physical presence there. Many big global companies, such as Google, have bases in Ireland which has a corporate tax rate of just 12.5% The move - which is expected to hit digital giants like Amazon and Facebook - will affect firms with global sales above 20 billion euros (Â£17bn) and profit margins above 10%. A quarter of any profits they make above the 10% threshold will be reallocated to the countries where they were earned and taxed there. ""[This] is a far-reaching agreement which ensures our international tax system is fit for purpose in a digitalised and globalised world economy,"" said OECD Secretary-General Mathias Cormann. ""We must now work swiftly and diligently to ensure the effective implementation of this major reform."" This deal marks a sweeping change in approach when it comes to taxing big global companies. In the past, countries would frequently compete with one another to offer an attractive deal to multinationals. It made sense when those companies might come in, set up a factory and create jobs. They were, you could say, giving something back. But the new digital era giants have become adept at simply moving profits around, from the regions where they do business to those where they will pay the lowest taxes. Good news for tax havens, bad news for everyone else. The new system is meant to minimise opportunities for profit shifting, and ensure that the largest businesses pay at least some of their taxes where they do business, rather than where they choose to have their headquarters. Some 136 countries have signed up - an achievement in itself. But inevitably there will be losers as well as winners. Ireland, Hungary and Estonia - all of which have corporate tax rates below 15% - at first resisted the plan but are now on board. Ireland currently has a rate of 12.5%, which has helped it attract large amounts of foreign investment and become a base for big US firms such as Apple. But after securing a compromise on the wording of the agreement, Finance Minister Pascal Donohoe said he was ""absolutely certain"" Ireland's interests were served by being part of the deal. However, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have not yet signed up to the plan. The pact resolves a spat between the US and countries such as the UK and France, which had threatened a digital tax on big mainly American tech firms. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said: ""As of this morning, virtually the entire global economy has decided to end the race to the bottom on corporate taxation. ""Rather than competing on our ability to offer low corporate rates, America will now compete on the skills of our workers and our capacity to innovate, which is a race we can win."" Facebook welcomed the deal, saying it has long called for reform of global tax rules. ""We recognise this could mean paying more tax, and in different places,"" said Nick Clegg, its vice president for global affairs. ""The tax system needs to command public confidence, while giving certainty and stability to businesses. We are pleased to see an emerging international consensus."" But Argentine economy minister Martin Guzman said the proposals would do little to help developing countries. Despite agreeing to the pact, he had argued for a tax rate of at least 21%. Oxfam also said the 15% rate was too low and would ""let big offenders... off the hook"". The corporate tax rate in industrialised countries averages at 23.5%, well above the agreed 15% floor. Oxfam's tax policy lead Susana Ruiz said: ""The world is experiencing the largest increase in poverty in decades and a massive explosion in inequality but this deal will do little or nothing to halt either. Instead, it is already being seen by some wealthy nations as an excuse to cut domestic corporate tax rates, risking a new race to the bottom.""

"Facebook has apologised after again reporting problems with its services, days after a major outage hit WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook for hours. The company said that a ""configuration change"" had impacted users globally. It added that the incident was not related to the outage that saw its products taken offline for over six hours earlier this week. Its Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Workplace products had been affected, it said. ""We're so sorry if you weren't able to access our products during the last couple of hours,"" the company said it a statement on Friday evening. ""We know how much you depend on us to communicate with one another. We fixed the issue - thanks again for your patience this week."" Earlier, web monitoring group Downdetector said that for a relatively short period of time on Friday there was an avalanche of messages from users reporting problems with Instagram. Some of them immediately took to Twitter and other social media platforms to complain about the second Instagram disruption and share memes on the issue. On Monday, Facebook - which owns WhatsApp and Instagram - blamed an internal technical issue for the major outage which not only affected the firm's services, but also employees' work passes and email.

"The jury was told Arthur Labinjo-Hughes's father threatened to take the boy's 'jaw straight off' A man charged with murdering his six-year-old son sent a message to his co-accused threatening to take the boy's ""jaw straight off"", jurors heard. Thomas Hughes and girlfriend Emma Tustin are standing trial for the murder of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes who died in Solihull in June 2020. A jury was played dozens of mobile phone audio recordings of Arthur crying, and shown pictures of bruising. The couple are also accused of multiple counts of child cruelty. Prosecutors allege Arthur was killed by his father Mr Hughes, 29, of Stroud Road, and Ms Tustin, 32, of Cranmore Road,after being poisoned with salt and exposed to months of abuse. On the second day of a trial at Coventry Crown Court, Jonas Hankin QC read excerpts to jurors from WhatsApp messages between the pair, as well as audio clips Ms Tustin had recorded. In one exchange, the court heard, Mr Hughes reacted to an audio clip by writing: ""I will deal with him when I'm home and it won't be pretty."" Jurors were told that a suggestion was then made on WhatsApp to put Arthur ""out with the rubbish"" - before Ms Tustin described the boy as being ""on one"". Mr Hughes, the court heard, then replied: ""Won't be when I take his [expletive] jaw straight off his shoulders."" Another message, sent by Ms Tustin on 23 May 2020, read: ""I don't think I can do this any more. He shuts up as soon as you come through the door. He is malicious, cruel and just generally awful."" Latest updates from the West Midlands It is alleged Ms Tustin carried out a fatal assault while in sole care of Arthur at her home and immediately took a photo afterwards on her mobile phone as he lay dying in the hallway. Prosecutors said despite having her phone, she took 12 minutes to call 999, telling medics Arthur ""fell and banged his head and while on the floor banged his head another five times"". His head injuries were said to be not survivable, the court heard, and Arthur died shortly before 01:00 BST on 17 June last year. The pair deny murder. Ms Tustin admits child cruelty by ill-treating, a charge which Mr Hughes denies. They both deny allegations of child cruelty by administering salt to Arthur between 1 and 17 June last year. Both also deny two counts of child cruelty by assault on multiple occasions and also by withholding food and/or drink. The trial continues.

"This video can not be played Care home visits will be easier, says first minister Christmas this year is likely to be more normal than in 2020, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. He said if nothing unexpected happens Wales can look forward to a holiday season ""much more like the ones we are used to"". The Welsh government said that all businesses are likely to be able to stay open this winter. But it has drawn up a""Covid Urgent"" plan,externalif a new variant risks overwhelming the NHS. In a statement setting out Wales'autumn and winter plan,external, the government said such a scenario could be the emergence of a new, fast-spreading variant or if vaccine immunity levels fall, causing a rise in pandemic pressures. But it is more likely the country will slowly move out of the pandemic, where coronavirus becomes a seasonal illness, and that businesses can stay open. Mr Drakeford said Wales remains at alert level zero, with no changes likely in the next three weeks beyond those already announced. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Q&A: What Covid rules will stay in Wales? Fines for faking Covid passes and tests in Wales At a briefing on Friday he also said it would now be easier to visit a loved one in a care home. It comes as Wales' case rates dip below 500 per 100,000 for the first time since mid-September. Mr Drakeford said in the most probable scenario ""we ought to be able to get through the autumn and the winter with restrictions at the sort of level we have at the moment. ""That would be very different to last Christmas, far more like the sort of Christmasses we were used to."" ""If nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to."" Wales went into lockdown days before Christmas last year, curtailing plans to allow more mixing over the period. Business owner Neil Collier said the news was ""reassuring"" Businesses said the news they would probably not be facing another winter lockdown was ""reassuring"". Neil Collier, owner of Colliers Photo Imaging in Uplands, Swansea, said he faced ""quite a hit"" last Christmas with ""panicked customers wondering if they were going to get their orders"". ""I think it's more security for business trade going into the winter months which is potentially our busiest period,"" he added. Last winter, Nicki Collier, who manages Bluebell Coffee and Kitchen in Tycoch, also Swansea, faced having to cancel bookings and process refunds. ""It's really reassuring to hear some good news finally. Shutting overnight last year was a really big shock,"" she said. ""Fingers crossed now this is good news for this Christmas."" Nikki Collier is optimistic about the months ahead Dr Richard Stanton, a virologist at Cardiff University, said the Welsh government should stick with current restrictions to ""keep a lid on transmission rates"" ahead of the winter. He said Covid-19 was now not the only concern, with other respiratory viruses such as flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - a common winter bug that can cause lung problems - likely to spread too. ""All those things will put pressure on the NHS and could result in further hospitalisations,"" he added.p What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Clubbers and businesses torn over Wales Covid pass Should my child have a Covid vaccine? Mr Drakeford confirmed there would be no changes to the current regulations for the next three weeks, beyond those already announced. Rules around care home visits will be reduced, however. Mr Drakeford said providers can now allow visitors to take lateral flow tests at home and will no longer have to socially distance in a resident's room or in a designated visiting room. Restrictions around gifts, including food and drink, will also be eased. The first minister set outtwo planning scenarios for the pandemic over the winter.,external In the first, calledCovid Stable,external, Wales remains at alert level zero through the autumn and winter, with all businesses able to open. The second,Covid Urgent,external, is designed to deal with any sudden changes to the situation. If that happens previously drawn up ""alert levels"" - including lockdown at level four - could be used as an option of last resort. ""While we do not think measures under a Covid Urgent scenario will be necessary this autumn or winter, we cannot completely rule them out,"" the plan added. All businesses are likely to be able to stay open this winter, according to the Welsh government Mr Drakeford told journalists that, should demand for PCR tests outstrip the ability to provide them during the winter, then some less-vulnerable groups would be offered lateral flow strips in the first instance. He told journalists there was no plan to charge for PCR tests, but said after the winter Wales will begin to move into an era where ""mass testing will play a less important part in the way we manage the virus"". ""We will be reserving the tests for the purposes for which they are most important"", he added. Prior to the press conference the first minister said Wales was ""facing a challenging winter ahead - coronavirus hasn't gone away and flu is forecast to return this winter."" ""Vaccination is the best defence we have against coronavirus - the more people who are fully vaccinated, the better our chances of controlling the spread of this awful virus."" He encouraged everyone who was eligible ""to have their flu jab this year"". He said he believed Wales was now past the peak of the third wave, following a decline in cases over the last few days. Mr Drakeford asked everyone to continue to wash hands and meet outdoors to reduce the transmission of coronavirus In other measures to keep Wales safe,Covid passes in nightclubs and large events will be introducedfrom Monday, following a narrow victory for the Welsh government in a knife-edge Senedd vote this week. The public will be expected to show evidence of being fully vaccinated or having a recent negative Covid test. Mr Drakeford told the BBC's Dros Frecwast programme event organisers were responsible for checking people were carrying the correct Covid passes through a spot check system,as fines were being introduced for fake ones from Monday. ""When there are lots and lots of people trying to go in, for example, there will be no need to check each one,"" he said. At the briefing, he said he expected the introduction of Covid passes would be ""relatively smooth,"" but admitted it would not be without ""teething trouble"". ""I think that the system is easy to use,"" he added. Professor of epidemiology and biostatistics Mike Gravenor, of Swansea University Medical School, has been part of the team looking at the modelling of Covid-19 in Wales. He toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast:""We're still under a situation of uncertainty. A new variant is one factor and our understanding of how long immunity lasts for, in natural immunity and in vaccinated individuals."" All the indicators are pointing to an improving position with regards to Covid - case rates have been falling for the last nine days. The spike we saw in recent weeks was driven by high numbers of under-19s, especially secondary school-age children, testing positive, ahead of vaccinations being available for this age group. The character of this third wave spike was also influenced by record numbers of lateral flow tests coming back positive, so young people were being found to have Covid, even if not displaying symptoms. Because so many infections have involved young people, while many older and vulnerable people have been double-vaccinated, we have not seen anything like the Covid cases in hospital beds. Admissions have been higher in recent weeks than some early modelling predicted as likely, but numbers of patients with Covid are coming down. On Wednesday, there were 14% fewer Covid patients in hospital beds on average than two weeks ago. We have been seeing similar numbers in critical care for more than a month and those in ICU with non-Covid conditions outnumber Covid patients by more than two to one. But hospital managers will still be concerned that there are more than 420 Covid patients in beds across Wales and bed occupancy is at 90% in acute hospitals, with the winter to come. Sadly, there are still people dying of Covid and figures from the ONS this week showed 88 deaths in Wales in the latest week. But numbers are down considerably on earlier waves - and after a spike in September, they are back within the range expected by scientists.

"The government has failed to find solutions to halt soaring energy prices, UK Steel boss Gareth Stace has said. He was speaking after leaders of energy-intensive industries met with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. ""We can't wait until Christmas and beyond. Or even a few weeks. We need action now, it needs to be swift, decisive action,"" Mr Stace said. The government said it was exploring ways to manage high energy costs. Gas prices have risen 250% since January, pushing up costs dramatically. Mr Stace told the BBC that Mr Kwarteng had listened but had provided ""no immediate solutions or guarantees"". The UK Steel director general said he was ""baffled"" because governments in the rest of Europe had stepped in to support industry, although they faced lower energy costs than in the UK. Representatives from energy-intensive sectors including paper, glass, cement, lime, ceramics, chemicals and steel were at Friday's talks with the business secretary. The Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) said it hoped the government would find ways to support those sectors. Mr Kwarteng told the business representatives he would continue to work with them to tackle the problem. His department said the government would assess the options put forward by the industry, with his spokesperson saying: ""We recognise the recent increase in global gas prices will be a cause of concern for businesses in the UK. ""We are in regular contact with Ofgem and business groups to explore ways to manage the impact of rising global prices."" Mr Kwarteng also stressed government confidence in the security of gas supplies this winter. After the meeting, EIUG chair Richard Leese said the government had made ""positive first steps to develop practical solutions"". ""EIUG will work with government to avoid threats both to the production of essential domestic and industrial products, as well an enormous range of supply chains critical to our economy,"" he said. Regulator warns of significant energy price hikes Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Andrew Large, director-general at the Confederation of Paper Industries, said there were ""serious"" risks factories could stop operating as a result of the gas prices being too high. There have already been stoppages at fertiliser and steel plants due to high energy costs. However, he said the business secretary appeared to share industry's desire to avoid any potential supply chain disruption. On Thursday Mr Kwarteng said the government's strategy to shift to ""clean"" power sources by 2035, including wind, solar and nuclear, would reduce reliance on fossil fuels. ""The volatility of the gas price has shown we do need to plan strategically and net zero helps us do that,"" he said. Speaking before the meeting, Mr Stace had said if the government failed to act it could ""strangle steel production"" in the UK. A crisis in steel production as a result of high energy prices would affect the wider economy, he added, saying the government should consider taking additional action in the short term. ""We're pausing production already in terms of some steel producers in the UK.... and it's going to happen more often unless something is done, or the energy market corrects itself and I don't think that will happen any time soon."" He said the government should address the disparity in energy costs for UK steel makers who he said were paying 50-80% more for electricity than German producers. Other countries, such as Italy and Portugal, had ""committed billions of euros"" to address the rising cost of gas, he added. ""If the government does nothing then tomorrow, there'll be a steel crisis, and given in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel is, but for the UK economy as a whole,"" he said. The price of wholesale gas has soared since the start of the year. And the UK has lower levels of gas stored than other European countries, which could help cushion price volatility. Domestic customers' bills are partly protected from these sharp rises by a price cap, managed by the regulator Ofgem, which limits how far and how fast bills can rise. Nevertheless, UK households have felt the impact after the price cap was raised at the start of October. Customers will see further ""significant rises"" in the spring, regulator Ofgem has warned. The cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April. It applies to households in England, Scotland and Wales this month. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain.

"Brains ran into financial difficulty during the pandemic Brains has put 99 of its pubs across Wales up for sale, with offers over Â£87.3 million sought for the portfolio. The Cardiff-based brewerysigned a deal with chain Marston's last yearfor it to manage its estate on a 25-year lease. At the time, it said restrictions during the pandemic put the business under ""significant financial pressure"" and the move would save 1,300 jobs. Real estate advisors said it expected ""significant levels of demand"". The 138-year-old Cardiff-based brewery said the firebreak lockdown last year had cost it Â£1.6m. As a result, Marston's took over the running of 156 of its pubs. Brains beer 'may be brewed outside of Wales' Brains 'is the taste of Cardiff, it's in our DNA' Itinitially made plans to sell 40of these, but has now put a further 99 on the market - with 93 of these freehold and six leasehold properties. They include The City Arms in the heart of Cardiff, The Harbour Inn, Solva, Pembrokeshire and Llanelli's Half Moon. The old Brains brewery once dominated the Cardiff skyline - the site is now being cleared for the Central Quay development of offices, homes and a hotel ""This is a rare opportunity to acquire a large, high-quality package of public houses located in strong trading positions across Wales,"" said Avison Young's Peter Constantine, who is marketing them. ""They benefit from a secure income stream let to an excellent covenant. We anticipate significant levels of demand as packages of this quality rarely come to the market."" Brains has been brewed in Wales since 1882, when it was made in the old brewery on Cardiff's St Mary Street, before moving to the former Hancock's site near Cardiff Central Station in 1999. In March 2019, it moved to its new central brewery in East Moors, Cardiff. However, former chief executive Alistair Darby said earlier this year thecoronavirus pandemic had been ""absolutely brutal""and this could close.

"Facebook has apologised after again reporting problems with its services, days after a major outage hit WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook for hours. The company said that a ""configuration change"" had impacted users globally. It added that the incident was not related to the outage that saw its products taken offline for over six hours earlier this week. Its Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and Workplace products had been affected, it said. ""We're so sorry if you weren't able to access our products during the last couple of hours,"" the company said it a statement on Friday evening. ""We know how much you depend on us to communicate with one another. We fixed the issue - thanks again for your patience this week.""

Some of them immediately took to Twitter and other social media platforms to complain about the second Instagram disruption and share memes on the issue. On Monday, Facebook - which owns WhatsApp and Instagram - blamed an internal technical issue for the major outage which not only affected the firm's services, but also employees' work passes and email.

"Engineering and construction are among the sectors with the highest rate of vacancies Job vacancies are nearing an all-time high and Scotland has seen a surge in employment, despite warnings that the number of candidates has ""plummeted"". The Royal Bank of Scotland's report on jobs recorded the third-sharpest growth of new appointments on record. But the survey of businesses in September found the second-fastest decline of applicants for permanent jobs since records began in 2008. Firms cited Brexit and pandemic uncertainty as the key factors. Candidates for temporary jobs decreased for the seventh consecutive month, although the decline slowed from the substantial drop in August, according to the bank's report. Scottish payroll numbers climb by 17,000 Recruitment of staff 'still rising sharply' Starting salaries for people in new jobs and the hourly rate for temporary workers both rose once again, although so did the rate of inflation. The industries with the highest rate of vacancies were the IT and computing sectors, followed by engineering and construction, and then the accountancy and financial sectors. Meanwhile, the hotel and catering industries had the fastest rise in demand for temporary staff, followed by IT and computing. Companies blamed Brexit and Covid for the decline in applicants for permanent jobs Scottish government External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson toldBBC Good Morning Scotlandthat Brexit was to blame for much of the challenges in the labour market. He said: ""It's part of the more general population challenge that we have in Scotland, it's that Brexit has turned off the tap, seen a significant number of people return to the European continent, and there are simply not enough people living here to fill important roles in our economy. ""The UK government is pretending that this is not a serious problem and is certainly denying that Brexit has a significant role in it."" Mr Robertson met immigration minister Kevin Foster this week, but said he refused to agree to any of the ""top level"" requests from the Scottish government, including a 24-month worker visa programme. Boris Johnson has previously said he is ""not worried"" about the current jobs gap and rising prices in the UK, sayingsupply chains will sort themselves out ""rapidly"". The prime minister has said the economy was facing the ""stresses and strains"" of a post-Covid recovery. Food businesses have faced challenges trying to recruit workers The Royal Bank of Scotland said labour shortages were likely to become more pronounced over the coming months, possibly posing ""significant challenges"" for companies hoping to fill roles and expand their operations. The bank's chief economist Sebastian Burnside, said: ""Scotland saw a further rapid uplift in hiring activity during September, with the rates of increase in both permanent placements and temp billings easing only slightly from the all-time records seen in August. ""This rounded off a third quarter of unprecedented hiring activity as the Scottish labour market continues to rebound. ""Meanwhile, vacancies for both short-term and permanent staff rose at near-record rates during September, but recruiters widely reported skills shortages as the supply of candidates continued to plummet.""

"Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov jointly won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov have won the Nobel Peace Prize for their fights to defend freedom of expression in the Philippines and Russia. The Nobel committee called the pair ""representatives of all journalists who stand up for this ideal"". They are known for investigations that have angered their countries' rulers, and have faced significant threats. Both spoke in defence of freedom of the press following their win. Ms Ressa, who co-founded the news site Rappler, was commended for using freedom of expression to ""expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in her native country, the Philippines"". The Nobel committee said Mr Muratov, the co-founder and editor of independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, had for decades defended freedom of speech in Russia under increasingly challenging conditions. ""Free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda,""the committee said in a statement.,external ""Without freedom of expression and freedom of the press, it will be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations, disarmament and a better world order to succeed in our time,"" it added. Award-winning journalist Ms Ressa wasconvicted last year of libelin a case seen as a test of Philippine press freedom. In a live broadcast by Rappler, she said she was ""in shock"". ""This shows that the Nobel Peace Prize committee realised that a world without facts means a world without truth and trust,"" she said. BBC journalists on Nobel Peace Prize winners Why do the Nobel prizes matter? Who is Philippine news boss Maria Ressa? Mr Muratov dedicated his prize to reporters at Novaya Gazeta who had been killed because of their work. The award came a day after the 15th anniversary ofthe killing of Anna Politkovskaya,external- one of the paper's top investigative reporters and a vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, who was shot in a lift in her block of flats. ""I can't take all the credit. This is thanks to Novaya Gazeta and those who died while defending people's right to freedom of speech,"" he told Russian news agency Tass. The winners of the prestigious prize, worth 10m Swedish krona (Â£836,000; $1.1m), were chosen out of 329 candidates. Maria Ressa, 58, co-founded Rappler in 2012. The site now has 4.5 million followers on Facebook, and has become known for its intelligent analysis and hard-hitting investigations. It is one of the few Philippine media organisations to be openly critical of President Rodrigo Duterte and his policies. Rappler has published extensively on the populist president's deadly war on drugs, as well as taking a critical look at issues of misogyny, human rights violations and corruption. Ms Ressa has personally reported on the spread of government propaganda on social media. Ms Ressa has faced numerous legal cases, which she says are politically motivated. The government has maintained their legitimacy. In a statement, Rappler said it was ""honoured and astounded"" that its chief executive had been given the prize. ""It could not have come at a better time - a time when journalists and the truth are being attacked and undermined,"" it said. This video can not be played Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa: ""Journalism has never been as important as it is today"" Dmitry Muratov, 59, co-founded Novaya Gazeta in 1993 and has since worked as its editor. Novaya Gazeta is one of the few remaining newspapers in Russia to be highly critical of the ruling elite, particularly President Vladimir Putin. Published three times a week, it regularly runs investigations into alleged corruption and other malpractice in ruling circles, and highlights the plight of people it considers victims of official abuse. The newspaper has been subjected to threats and harassment, including over its reporting of human rights abuses in Chechnya. Ms Politkovskaya is one of six Novaya Gazeta journalists and contributors to have been killed in connection with their work since 2000. The Kremlin, which has frequently opposed the paper, congratulated Mr Muratov. ""He persistently works in accordance with his own ideals, he is devoted to them, he is talented, he is brave,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. However, allies ofjailed opposition figure Alexei NavalnyÂ criticised the Nobel committee's choice. ""Instead of pretentious and hypocritical speeches about 'freedom', they could protect a person who survived an assassination attempt and has been taken hostage by the murderers,"" Ruslan Shaveddinov tweeted. Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring Both Nobel laureates have been a thorn in the side of their respective governments for years. Maria Ressa and Rappler have faced concerted attacks from Rodrigo Duterte's government, and her conviction last year for ""cyber-libel"" was one of a string of cases ranging from defamation to tax avoidance. If Mr Duterte is trying to silence her, it hasn't worked. Rappler continues reporting on his administration, and this award will be a huge embarrassment. In her own words, Ms Ressa says: ""I've committed no crime but to speak truth to power."" And congratulations from the Russian government to Dmitry Muratov surely came through gritted teeth. He fully understands the risks that come with standing up to the state but he remains optimistic, saying of state crackdowns on opposition groups: ""It's impossible to kill dissent"". Ms Ressa and Mr Muratov are the 102nd winners of the prize. Last year's winner was the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP),which was awarded for its efforts to combat hunger and improve conditions for peace. Then US President Barack Obama took the prize in 2009 and other notable winners include child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014); the United Nations and its secretary-general at the time, Kofi Annan (shared 2001); and Mother Teresa (1979).

"Fellow politicians have paid tribute to Tory MP James Brokenshire, who has died aged 53, having been diagnosed with lung cancer more than three years ago. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the father of three, a former Northern Ireland secretary, as the ""nicest, kindest"" colleague. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called him ""a thoroughly decent man"". Mr Brokenshire, a lifelong non-smoker, stood down as a Home Office minister earlier this year. He died in hospital on Thursday night, having been admitted after his condition deteriorated. An MP since 2005, Mr Brokenshire served in government under three prime ministers - David Cameron, Theresa May and Mr Johnson. House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has ordered that flags in Parliament's New Palace Yard be flown at half-mast to mark ""a profound loss to us all"". Minister steps back from role for cancer surgery Brokenshire in lung cancer awareness call Mrs May tweeted: ""Truly saddened by the death of James Brokenshire. He was an outstanding public servant, a talented minister and a loyal friend."" And Mr Johnson tweeted that it was ""desperately sad"", adding: ""James was the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians but also extraordinarily effective."" Mr Brokenshire, who was MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup in Kent, resigned as Northern Ireland secretary in January 2018 following his lung cancer diagnosis, but made a comeback to the cabinet a few months later as housing secretary. He lost that job in July 2019, after Mr Johnson took over from Mrs May in 10 Downing Street. Mr Brokenshire re-entered government as a Home Office minister in February last year, but stood down in July this year, due to poor health. This video can not be played Former adviser Peter Cardwell: ""James was the best of politics and he was the best of humanity."" Following his death, Mr Brokenshire's family expressed ""deep sadness"", adding: ""James was not only a brilliant government minister... but a dedicated constituency MP. ""But most importantly, he was a loving father to his three children, a devoted husband to Cathy and a faithful friend to so many."" The family also thanked NHS staff, including those at Guy's & St Thomas' hospital in London, for treating Mr Brokenshire ""with such warmth, diligence and professionalism over the past three-and-a-half years"". They also shared a memorial page on his Twitter feed, which encouraged people to share memories and photos of Mr Brokenshire and to donate to the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation in lieu of flowers. ""In the last few years of his life James's passion was to help others with lung cancer, preventing others going through what he did,"" the memorial page said, describing him as an ""indefatigable campaigner for better lung cancer screening"". After his lung cancer diagnosis, Mr Brokenshire, a former lawyer, worked to promote greater awareness of the disease, urging people who showed symptoms to get tested. Fellow Conservative MP Karen Bradley told the BBC News Channel the news of her ""understated"" friend's death was ""heartbreaking"", adding: ""I can't believe I'm not going to be able to sit down with James again and have a laugh about life, and chat about the issues that we both cared about. ""My thoughts are with Cathy and the family, who are just the most wonderful family. I'm devastated."" James Brokenshire (right) served under Theresa May, as well as David Cameron and Boris Johnson Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""James Brokenshire was a thoroughly decent man, dedicated and effective in all briefs he held. ""He fought his illness with dignity and bravery. I'm incredibly sad to learn of his death and send my condolences to his wife and children."" The UK's most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, said: ""I had the personal privilege of working with him closely over a number of years and admired greatly his unwavering commitment to public service and compassion."" The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, tweeted: ""So sorry to hear of the death of James Brokenshire, whose courage and faith were an inspiration to so many, myself included."" Before becoming the Old Bexley & Sidcup MP in 2010, Mr Brokenshire represented the seat of Hornchurch and Rainham, north-east London, for five years. His death will prompt a Parliamentary by-election in Old Bexley and Sidcup, where he had a majority of 18,952 at the last general election.

"First Minister Paul Givan and Deputy First Minister Michelle joined Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin at the climate event Tackling climate change will need joined-up policies on the island of Ireland, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin has said. The Irish prime minister was speaking at an event in Belfast, where he is due to meet political leaders later. Mr Martin's visit comes as the EU and the UK prepare for intensive talks on the Northern Ireland Protocol. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic has saidthe EU will bring forward new proposals. Mr Sefcovic told an event in Dublin that he hoped talks would begin before the end of October. He said his proposals would be ""very far reaching"" and that he hoped they would be seen as such. The taoiseach paid a visit to Women'sTec, which provides training for women in what are traditionally seen as men's jobs He also dropped into the creche at Women'sTec in north Belfast Mr Martin has visited Northern Ireland several times since he became taoiseach in the summer of 2020. During Friday's visit, he was joined by Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers at an event hosted by the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Chambers Ireland exploring climate change. He told business leaders, just weeks ahead of theCOP26 climate conferencein Glasgow, that offshore wind would be an area of big expansion in the years ahead. ""There is no more significant and common concern for us on this island, and across these islands, than meeting the generational challenge of climate change,"" he said. ""So, to be fully effective on climate action, we need joined-up policy approaches and co-ordinated investment on a cross-border basis."" Climate bill would devastate rural economy - Poots A really simple guide to climate change Speaking ahead of their separate meeting, Ms O'Neill said she wanted to talk to Mr Martin about the EU and the British government bringing forward solutions to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Mr Martin will also visit Queen's University in Belfast. The Northern Ireland Protocol is a post-Brexit trade arrangement, which was agreed by the UK and the EU in order to avoid the reintroduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland. Why are there tensions over the NI Brexit deal? PM says NI Protocol could work if it was 'fixed' It ensures there is no need for checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and was agreed as a way to protect the Good Friday Agreement by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. Unionists have said the protocol diminishes their Britishness and damages trade with other parts of the UK by creating a border in the Irish Sea. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson saidhe believed the Northern Ireland Protocol could ""in principle work"" if it was ""fixed"". But he also did not rule out triggering Article 16 if the EU failed to come up with plans to deal with current issues. Article 16 can be triggered by either the UK or EU to suspend elements of the Brexit deal on the condition that the protocol is causing ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade"". Brexit Minister Lord Frost has threatened to suspend parts of its deal with the EU if changes are not made. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has warned that his party may quit Stormont if its demands over the protocol are not met. Sir Jeffrey said he was ""pleased"" that the EU was to table new proposals, adding that he believed pressure from unionists had ""opened up the protocol"". It is understood the EU will offer a bespoke agri-food arrangement for Northern Ireland to try andend the so-called ""sausage wars"". It would mean chilled meats could continue to go from GB to NI beyond the current grace period. Brussels is expected to produce itsproposals on the Northern Ireland protocol on Wednesday.

"Kathleen Stock The University of Sussex's vice chancellor has defended a professor after protesters tried to have her sacked for her views on gender identity. Staff ""have an untrammelled right to say and believe what they think,"" Adam Tickell told BBC News. An anonymous campaign included posters accusing Professor Kathleen Stock of transphobia, a claim she rejects. Prof Stock tweeted that students shouldn't ""just expect to hear their own thoughts reflected back at them"". Posters put up near the University of Sussex campus and an accompanying social media campaign claimed the philosophy professor ""makes trans students unsafe"". Photos also show a masked protester standing on the university's sign with a banner that reads ""Stock out"". Professor Stock, who recently published a book questioning the idea that gender identity is more ""socially significant"" than biological sex, completely rejects the claim that she or her work is transphobic. The Vice Chancellor backed university staff's right to say what they think An Instagram account apparently linked to the campaign posted a ""mission statement"" calling for Professor Stock to be fired, alongside photos of the protest. The statement claimed to be from ""an anonymous, unaffiliated group of queer, trans and non-binary students who will not allow our community to be slandered and harmed by someone who's [sic] salary comes from our pockets"". Universities face fines over free speech breaches The university is investigating the incidents, and will take disciplinary action if necessary, Vice Chancellor Prof Adam Tickell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday. ""It's absolutely clear that all of our staff have an untrammelled right to say and believe what they think, so we take it very seriously if people try to prevent that right from being exercised,"" he said. ""I'm really concerned that we have masked protesters putting up posters calling for the sacking of somebody for exercising her right to articulate her views."" Allow Twitter content?

Prof Stock thanked the vice chancellor and her supporters on Twitter and said students should not just expect to hear their own thoughts reflected back at them. She called on her colleagues to speak up, adding: ""What kind of future does a University have where intimidation determines what is said or taught?"" A University of Sussex spokesperson said: ""We were extremely concerned to see the harassment towards our staff member and took immediate action in response to this, which we continue to do. ""We are deeply committed to being a safe and inclusive university, which values and advances equality and diversity, seeks to resolve conflicts, advances good relations and upholds lawful free speech."" Universities have long had to deal with highly contentious debates on campus, but few have matched the ferocity around gender identity issues. Privately, many vice chancellors say this is the most difficult issue on campus they have had to manage. One of the core principles they use to navigate it is protecting freedom of speech for staff, students and visiting speakers. This is already a legal duty contained in the Education Act 1986. But now a new draft law is making its way through parliament which will require universities in England to more actively promote freedom of speech. This will be overseen by the regulator, the Office for Students. Individuals who feel an institution has failed to protect their ability to speak freely will be able to take legal action. So in future, disputes could in theory escalate to fines for universities, and court cases. .....

"The government has failed to find solutions to halt soaring energy prices, UK Steel boss Gareth Stace has said. He was speaking after leaders of energy-intensive industries met with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. ""We can't wait until Christmas and beyond. Or even a few weeks. We need action now, it needs to be swift, decisive action,"" Mr Stace said. The government said it was exploring ways to manage high energy costs. Gas prices have risen 250% since January, pushing up costs dramatically. Mr Stace told the BBC that Mr Kwarteng had listened but had provided ""no immediate solutions or guarantees"". The UK Steel director general said he was ""baffled"" because governments in the rest of Europe had stepped in to support industry, although they faced lower energy costs than in the UK. Representatives from energy-intensive sectors including paper, glass, cement, lime, ceramics, chemicals and steel were at Friday's talks with the business secretary. The Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) said it hoped the government would find ways to support those sectors. Mr Kwarteng told the business representatives he would continue to work with them to tackle the problem. His department said the government would assess the options put forward by the industry, with his spokesperson saying: ""We recognise the recent increase in global gas prices will be a cause of concern for businesses in the UK. ""We are in regular contact with Ofgem and business groups to explore ways to manage the impact of rising global prices."" Mr Kwarteng also stressed government confidence in the security of gas supplies this winter. After the meeting, EIUG chair Richard Leese said the government had made ""positive first steps to develop practical solutions"". ""EIUG will work with government to avoid threats both to the production of essential domestic and industrial products, as well an enormous range of supply chains critical to our economy,"" he said. Regulator warns of significant energy price hikes Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Andrew Large, director-general at the Confederation of Paper Industries, said there were ""serious"" risks factories could stop operating as a result of the gas prices being too high. There have already been stoppages at fertiliser and steel plants due to high energy costs. However, he said the business secretary appeared to share industry's desire to avoid any potential supply chain disruption. On Thursday Mr Kwarteng said the government's strategy to shift to ""clean"" power sources by 2035, including wind, solar and nuclear, would reduce reliance on fossil fuels. ""The volatility of the gas price has shown we do need to plan strategically and net zero helps us do that,"" he said. Speaking before the meeting, Mr Stace had said if the government failed to act it could ""strangle steel production"" in the UK. A crisis in steel production as a result of high energy prices would affect the wider economy, he added, saying the government should consider taking additional action in the short term. ""We're pausing production already in terms of some steel producers in the UK.... and it's going to happen more often unless something is done, or the energy market corrects itself and I don't think that will happen any time soon."" He said the government should address the disparity in energy costs for UK steel makers who he said were paying 50-80% more for electricity than German producers. Other countries, such as Italy and Portugal, had ""committed billions of euros"" to address the rising cost of gas, he added. ""If the government does nothing then tomorrow, there'll be a steel crisis, and given in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel is, but for the UK economy as a whole,"" he said. The price of wholesale gas has soared since the start of the year. And the UK has lower levels of gas stored than other European countries, which could help cushion price volatility. Domestic customers' bills are partly protected from these sharp rises by a price cap, managed by the regulator Ofgem, which limits how far and how fast bills can rise. Nevertheless, UK households have felt the impact after the price cap was raised at the start of October. Customers will see further ""significant rises"" in the spring, regulator Ofgem has warned. The cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April. It applies to households in England, Scotland and Wales this month. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain.

"BBC journalists who have worked with Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov (pictured here, centre) share their experiences Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their fights to defend freedom of expression in the Philippines and Russia. Both are known for investigations that have angered their countries' rulers and both have faced threats as a result of this. Here, BBC journalists who have worked with the pair share their experiences. By Olga Prosvirova, BBC Russian Dmitry Muratov is a complex and at times contradictory personality. Over the years of working together, I have seen him bitterly argue with his best correspondents one day, and the next rescue them from an extremely dangerous situation while they were covering a story. Dmitry's contribution to the development of journalism in Russia cannot be underestimated. He created a unique team of journalists at an organisation that has been considered the main independent media in Russia for some time. Novaya Gazeta participated in the Panama Papers investigation, found evidence of the presence of the Russian military in Donbas, and investigated extrajudicial executions in Chechnya. Journalists were persecuted, kidnapped, and sometimes killed. I have heard journalists from other media organisations ask Dmitry: ""Why haven't you been shut down yet?"" To this he has replied: ""It's not me you have to ask."" Dmitry Muratov is known for generating bright and radical ideas Dmitry is an editor who knows how to strike a balance for his newspaper - between telling hard-hitting stories and not crossing the line of aggravating Russian President Vladimir Putin's administration. This balance is delicate and hard to maintain, but this skill has allowed his journalists to make a big impact over the years. Novaya Gazeta was never a place to earn the big bucks - salaries there have been lower than in many other media outlets on the market. Yet many journalists have remained there for years, and in some cases decades. Their dedication is due to Dmitry's ability to turn the team into a family. I recall people staying late at the office and when we would see each other the following morning we wouldn't say hello, because it felt like we hadn't parted and were sharing a home. Dmitry was always generating bright and radical ideas. I remember we'd be in the office, each working on a story, and he would dash into the room and say: ""Let's start gathering signatures against the Dima Yakovlev Law (a law that limited the rights of those in the West to adopt children in Russia)!"" We would drop everything and start gathering signatures and testimonies and in the space of a day collect a box of documents to take to the presidential administration to challenge this law. He would always help with any personal problems or issues. If anyone's family member got sick, he'd help find the best doctors or a place at a good hospital. Anyone leaving the paper was a painful moment for him. He would treat it as a family member abandoning a home and would struggle to accept it. This video can not be played How do you choose a Nobel Prize winner? By Jonathan Head, BBC South East Asia correspondent Maria Ressa has been subjected to a distressing and almost certainly co-ordinated campaign of online abuse, to a pile-on of criminal lawsuits that human rights groups believe amount to state-backed harassment, and the open hostility of the Philippines' Duterte administration. The president's followers have demonised her, as they have other journalists critical of him, as ""presstitutes"". Her Nobel Peace Prize puts President Duterte and his officials in a quandary; how do they respond to this, the first Filipino to win the prestigious award? Maria Ressa founded the Rappler news site in 2012 When Aung San Suu Kyi won the prize in 1991, a similar question might have been asked of the generals who ruled Myanmar. But they were so isolated from the world no-one really expected any response. The Philippines, on the other hand, is a global nation, with large parts of the population living overseas. Its people do care how they are perceived, and will not easily dismiss a Nobel Peace Prize, even if they are not sympathetic to Ms Ressa. Recall the awkward spot the government found itself in as recently as July when the country's first ever Olympic gold medal was won by weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz, who had also been attacked by Duterte's supporters. Maria and I were both based as reporters in Jakarta in 1996 when the Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize to Jose Ramos Horta and Bishop Ximenes Belo for their campaign against human rights abuses by the Indonesian security forces in East Timor. Bishop Belo was, in the eyes of the Jakarta government, a citizen of Indonesia, and so, like Maria, the first Nobel prize-winner in his country. On a visit to the occupied territory shortly after the award, President Suharto chose to pretend it had never happened - he shook hands with Bishop Belo but did not mention the prize. But it had a galvanizing effect. Within less than three years Indonesia abandoned East Timor, which became an independent nation, something few thought possible in 1996. Both of us covered the fall of the authoritarian Suharto regime in 1998, Maria for CNN, me for the BBC. The internet was in its infancy then, and the role the media played in publicising the yearning for change felt by many Indonesians could be challenged by the authorities only with the crudest methods - usually simply barring us access to places where events embarrassing to the government had taken place. Those were innocent days indeed, before the advent of organised disinformation on social media. Who is Philippine news boss Maria Ressa? Maria's decision to found online news-site Rappler in 2012, when she was already a senior journalist in what was then the top Philippines television station ABS-CBN, was driven by her understanding of the way technology would transform the news business in South East Asia, where changes in the media were lagging behind those seen in Europe and the US. Rappler did not set out to confront the Duterte administration; its reporting of his election victory in 2016 was strikingly even-handed. But it was Maria's recognition - and reporting - of the extraordinarily successful social media manipulation by the Duterte campaign that set her on a collision course with the president. Rappler's bold coverage of the brutal anti-drugs campaign then seemed to put the new media group firmly in the camp of the president's enemies. The Nobel Committee has made some questionable decisions. But it is hard to quibble with the award to Maria Ressa, however uncomfortable it may be for President Duterte. No journalist is perfect, and news reporting can and should be assessed critically, but Maria has stood by the essential principles of good journalism, against an intimidating campaign of abuse. The prize she has just won just might make her life a little easier.

"Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov have jointly won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize Journalists Maria Ressa, from the Philippines, and Dmitry Muratov, from Russia, have won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for their ""efforts to safeguard freedom of expression"". Why are the organisation's prizes so prestigious, and who are some of the previous winners? Barack Obama (right) with his Nobel Peace Prize alongside Thorbjoern Jagland, of Norway's Nobel Committee Former US PresidentBarack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009,,externalfor ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"". President Obama said he was ""surprised and deeply humbled"" and would use it as a ""call to action"". However,there was criticism of his award, especially as he had only been in office for 12 days before the nomination deadline. Other notable winners include former US PresidentJimmy Carter (2002),external; child education activistMalala Yousafzai (shared 2014); theEuropean Union (2012); theUnited Nations and its then-general-secretary, Kofi Annan, (shared 2001),external; andSaint Teresa of Calcutta (1979).,external Albert Einstein (physics 1921),,externalMarie Curie (physics 1903 and chemistry 1911),,externalandHarold Pinter (literature 2005),externalhave also received Nobel prizes. Two people - author and philosopherJean-Paul Sartre in 1964,externaland Vietnamese politicianLe Duc Tho in 1973,external- rejected the prize, and four others were forced to decline by their countries. In 2016, there was uncertainty over whether singer Bob Dylan would accept the literature award before hefinally delivered his lecture for the prize in June 2017. Statistics from 1901 to 2019 947Nobel Laureates (920 people, 27 organisations) 17Age of youngest winner - education activist Malala Yousafzai 97Age of oldest winner - scientist John B Goodenough 53Prizes won by women 6People who declined an award The Nobel prizes are a series of annual awards given in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace. They are awarded to people ""who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind"" in the previous 12 months. The quote is from the will of Swedish businessman - and inventor of dynamite - Alfred Nobel. He left most of his fortune in a fund to launch the awards, which were first presented in 1901. In 1968, an economic sciences prize was added by Sweden's central bank, although it does not count as a Nobel prize. Different organisations award the prize in each category every year. Five of the six are chosen in Sweden, while the Nobel Peace Prize is selected in Norway. Academics, university professors, scientists, previous winners and others all submit nominations. Under the Nobel Foundation's rules, the shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years. Prize winners are called laureates, to signify the laurel wreath given to victors of contests in ancient Greece. More than one, but no more than three, people can win each prize. This video can not be played How do you choose a Nobel Prize winner? There have been some years when the prize has not been awarded - mostly during the two world wars. And Nobel Foundation rules state if nobody deserves the prize in a particular category, it is not awarded and its prize money is kept for the following year. The recipient of each prize receives three things: a Nobel diploma, each of which is a unique work of art a Nobel medal, which have some differing designs a cash prize of 10m Swedish krona (Â£836,000; $1.1m) - which is split between winners when there is more than one. They have to deliver a lecture to receive the money The prizes are presented at ceremonies on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, in Stockholm and Oslo. Marie and Pierre Curie used their physics prize money in 1903 for further scientific research, and 2006 physics winner John Mather donated his cash to his foundation. In 1993, British biochemist Richard Roberts spent his medicine winnings on a croquet lawn, while fellow 1993 laureate Phillip Sharp bought a 100-year-old Federal-style house. The 2001 medicine winner, Sir Paul Nurse, bought himself a high-end motorbike. Meanwhile, 2006 literature laureate Orhan Pamuk established a museum in Istanbul.

"Maria Ressa did not always plan to become a journalist She is the award-winning journalist who has been at the centre of high-profile legal battles in the Philippines and is now the recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize. To many, Maria Ressa has become a symbol of the fight for press freedom in a country where journalists are under threat. But Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte and his supporters have accused her of peddling fake news through her website Rappler. This is what you need to know about the news boss who enraged the president. Ms Ressa was born in the Philippines, but moved to the US as a child after martial law was declared by Ferdinand Marcos in the early 1970s. ""I landed in New Jersey, where I could barely speak English, and I had to figure out what a short brown kid was going to do in this big white world,"" she told the BBC's Lyse Doucet. This video can not be played Maria Ressa: ""The battle for this generation will be the battle for truth"" (2019) She focused on education and after studying at the prestigious Princeton University, Ms Ressa returned to the Philippines to ""find roots"". ""I always felt that I wasn't as American as Americans and then I realised when I got back to the Philippines that I was not Filipino."" Ms Ressa's return to the Philippines coincided with the 1986 People Power Revolution - when Filipinos took to the streets to overthrow Marcos. Ms Ressa grew up in the US Her move into journalism was initially a way of learning about the country she had grown distant from, but it soon became something more. ""I realised 'oh my God, somebody will pay me to write a story',"" she said. Her new career would also lead to her first meeting with Mr Duterte in the 1980s, when he was mayor of Davao city. Why Rappler is raising Philippine press freedom fears Duterte: The 'strongman' of the Philippines The state of Philippine media She went on to work in a number of senior media positions - including bureau chief for US network CNN in the Philippines and Indonesia, and head of the news division of Philippine TV channel ABS-CBN. In 2012, Ms Ressa co-founded the online news site Rappler, merging ""rap"" meaning to talk and ""ripples"", to make waves. She had ambitions of making Rappler the biggest news site in the Philippines, so ""hired the smartest 20-somethings we could find"" and ""embraced social media"". Rappler now has more than 4.5m followers on Facebook and has become known for its intelligent analysis and hard-hitting investigations. The site gained a lot of attention in 2015, whenMr Duterte - then Davao mayor - told Ms Ressa he had killed three people.,external Observers say Ms Ressa has been central to Rappler's success. ""First, she has not backed down; she has continued to fight for what she believes in. She also has credibility. She has been in the industry for decades... and has done her job well. ""Then, she has access to international media and international connections,"" Joi Barrios-LeBlanc, a lecturer with the University of California at Berkeley's Southeast Asian Studies Department, said. The BBC's Howard Johnson in Manila describes her as an engaging speaker, with a sharp analytical mind. She is skilled at explaining complex social developments to her audience, particularly on the issue of social media and its influence, he adds. Rappler is one of the few Philippine media organisations to be openly critical of Mr Duterte and his policies. It haspublished extensively on the populist president's war on drugs,external, which has claimed thousands of lives. Philippines drugs war: UN report criticises 'permission to kill' Philippines drug war: Do we know how many have died? Ms Ressa has personally reported on the spread ofgovernment propaganda on social media,,externalwhile other Rappler stories have taken a critical look at issues of misogyny, human rights violations and corruption. It has not gone unnoticed by Mr Duterte. Speaking to a Rappler reporter in 2018, the president said: ""If you are trying to throw garbage at us, then the least that we can do is explain - how about you? Are you also clean?"" That same year, the president announced that he had banned Rappler's reporters from covering his official activities, andthe government even revoked the site's operating licence. Ms Ressa was named a Time magazine Person of the Year in 2018 Ms Ressa has faced numerous legal cases. In 2020,she was found guilty of ""cyber-libel""in a case seen as a test of the country's media freedom. Rappler and Ms Ressa have also been targeted in other court cases, ranging from tax evasion to foreign ownership violations. Ms Ressa has described all the cases against her as ""political tools"" - an assertion supported by activists and press freedom groups around the world. The government maintains their legitimacy. Ms Barrios-LeBlanc said Ms Ressa had come to represent the plight of journalists in the Philippines, and said ""because she gained the attention of the international press, that is very significant"". Ms Ressa was named a Time Person of the Year in 2018 for steering Rappler ""through a superstorm of the two most formidable forces in the information universe: social media and a populist President with authoritarian inclinations"". Upon receiving the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize, she was commended for using freedom of expression to ""expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in her native country"". Rachael Jolley, editor of the Index on Censorship magazine, recalled meeting Ms Ressa at a journalism festival before her name was widely known. Even then, she says she quickly came to view her as an ""extraordinarily strong individual to be able to stand up to the government pressure"". This video can not be played Duterte drug war: Manila's brutal nightshift Local journalist Ellen Tordesillas told the BBC Ms Ressa is ""admired as one of those who stood up to Duterte"". But these views are not shared by everyone and Ms Ressa has said she is well used to receiving hate mail. Our correspondent says Ms Ressa's reputation is tied to Mr Duterte's popularity, with his supporters directing much of the narrative about her on social media. ""With support for Duterte still at a significant high, and his mocking of her in the past, Ressa has been put in a sort of 'elite' category,"" an academic focused on South-East Asian studies, who asked not to be named, told the BBC last year. ""Her work is brilliant and much needed in keeping Duterte in check, but the populist - and outside of Manila - perception of her in the Philippines is she is 'out of touch'.""

"There have been big changes to the Covid-19 restrictions in Northern Ireland over recent months The past few months have seen many Covid restrictions eased in Northern Ireland, after a long period of lockdown. But Stormont ministers, who decide what to relax and when, have kept some measures in place. BBC News NI explains what rules remain and how Northern Ireland compares to other parts of the UK and the Republic of Ireland. As one of the first measures introduced when the pandemic took hold last March, businesses and people have had to rapidly adjust to keeping their distance. Now, the legal requirement for social distancing outdoors no longer exists in Northern Ireland. It has been removed for shops, cinemas, theatres and many other indoor settings while social distancing will no longer be required in bars, restaurants and cafes from 31 October. Some hospitality businesses say the social distancing requirement is affecting their trade The executive has asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test. But this will be advice and not legally enforceable. In the Republic of Ireland, physical distancing rules remain in place across many sectors but that is due to end by 22 October, under the government's plan to lift almost all remaining restrictions. Although face coverings are no longer mandatory in many places in England, those rules do not apply in Northern Ireland. Instead, people must still wear them on public transport, in shops and a number of other settings - unless they are exempt. ScotlandandWaleshave also maintained the rules on face coverings. Health officials are thought to be in favour of keeping the restrictions on face coverings in place Since July, people going to places of worship in Northern Ireland no longer have to wear a face covering during the service, but it's still the law to wear them when entering and exiting the building. Health officials in Northern Ireland are thought to be in favour of keeping the restrictions on face coverings in place. Any decision on their continued use will have to be agreed by the five parties in the Stormont executive, who may take different views. Northern Ireland still has the lowest rate of first dose vaccination in the UK - a factor the executive will have to take into consideration when deciding whether to ease any further restrictions. On Monday 16 August, therules on self-isolation in Northern Irelandchanged. Close contacts of those who test positive for Covid no longer have to automatically self-isolate - as long as two weeks have passed since they received their second dose of the vaccine. They are still advised to take an additional PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) Covid test on day two and eight of the process. If the result is positive, they need to self-isolate just like anyone else. Rules on self-isolation for close contacts will change on Monday Hospitality had faced some of the toughest restrictions during the pandemic but in recent months those rules have been cut back. For instance, there are no longer limits on the amount of people allowed to sit at a table and table service is no longer mandatory. Nightclubs will be allowed to reopen from 31 October, a move that has already happened in Great Britain. Wedding and civil partnership receptions no longer have to operate with limited numbers and dancing and live music is allowed. Concerts can take place indoors and, from 14 October, people attending performances at indoor venues will no longer have stay seated. Nightclubs remain off-limits in Northern Ireland Rules on the number of people allowed to meet at home still remain in place in Northern Ireland,unlike in England, Scotland or Wales, although they have been eased significantly. From 14 October, the limit will move from 15 people from four households to 30 from an unlimited number of households. In the Republic of Ireland, people who are fully vaccinated can meet together indoorswith no limit on numbers,external. Pupils in Northern Ireland returned to the classroom in August. Schools in Northern Ireland were issued with new guidance from the Public Health Agency (PHA), based on Department of Health (DoH) policy guidance. The new guidance advised that pupils and staff who are identified as close contacts of a positive case, but have no symptoms themselves, do not have to self-isolate if they have recently tested positive for the virus. Other close contacts, who have not received a positive test within the previous 90 days, do have to self-isolate, but they can reduce their 10-day period of self-isolation if they have a negative PCR test result. However, there have beenconcerns over the number of children missing class, with more than half of pupils at one school being sent home as close contacts. Previously, ministers had agreed that the system of ""bubbles"", where children only mix within a fixed year or class group will be removed. Face coverings in classrooms will be back for the new school year for some pupils However they decided to retain face coverings for post-primary students in classrooms for the first six weeks of term, subject to a review. In Scotland, pupils and teachers in secondary schools will continue to wear face coverings and the 1m social distancing rule will remain for at least the first six weeks of term. People in England are no longer being asked to work from home, but in Northern Ireland advice remains to work from home where possible. Similar advice remains in place in Scotland, Wales and the Republic of Ireland. Stormont ministers discussed the issue in August but it is understood health officials advised keeping the guidance in place. In recent months, Stormont ministers have continued to urge employers to be flexible, and adhere to public health advice as much as possible. After ministers agreed to remove social distancing in indoor venues such as theatres and shops, ministers asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test. But this will be advice and not legally enforceable. However, it is understood that Department of Health Department of Health will now progress work to develop a digital vaccine passport scheme, but ministers will have to decide whether to deploy it. It is thought the scheme could be ready by November. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she did not to have to enact a mandatory scheme, and hoped businesses would voluntarily comply with executive advice. In the Republic of Ireland, proof of vaccination is now required in order to enter pubs and restaurants. In Northern Ireland, a number of music and sporting events have already said people must prove they have had both vaccines, or provide evidence of a negative Covid-19 test up to 48 hours before the event, in order to gain entry. When it comes to travelling abroad, at present people in Northern Ireland can also applyfor vaccine certification from the Department of Health,external.

"The service is due to be held in St Patrick's Church of Ireland cathedral in Armagh on 21 October Two Irish government ministers are to attend a centenary church service in Armagh later this month organised by Irish church leaders. The service is timed to coincide with the centenary of the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. Irish president Michael D Higginshas previously turned down an invitation, saying the event had become politicised. The SDLP has said it will be attending, while Sinn FÃ©in confirmed it would not. Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and government chief whip Jack Chambers will be present at the event. In a statement on Thursday evening, the Irish government said in considering the invitation ""its role in this matter is clearly distinct from that of the president"". It said it reiterated its ""full support and understanding"" of President Higgins' decision not to attend, which it said was ""properly made"" and based on concerns he had consistently expressed. But it added: ""Cognisant of that important distinction, and in recognition also of the spirit and intentions of the church leaders in organising the event, the government has decided that it will be represented at the event."" Mr Coveney is a member of the Fine Gael party while Mr Chambers is a member of Fianna FÃ¡il. The service will be held at St Patrick's Church of Ireland cathedral on 21 October. It is being described as a service of reflection and hope, to mark the centenary of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland. Last month, Catholic and Protestant church leaderssaid they had been saddened by ""the polarised political commentary""around the service they organised. Simon Coveney is Ireland's foreign minister Senator Gerard Craughwell, a signatory to a letter from six independent Irish senators who wrote to President Higgins asking him to reconsider his decision not to go to the service, said he did not agree with the decision to send two government ministers. ""The president of the country made his decision, I didn't agree with it at the time and I would still hold the same position,"" he told Good Morning Ulster on Friday. ""You're now having one of the most senior ministers of the cabinet countermanding the decision, for want of a better description, of the supreme leader, the president. ""So it's a really strange one, it's been really messed up from beginning to end as far as I can see. ""When the president made his decision that should have been it, if we wanted to have a representative at this event we should have found someone lower down the food chain in the Irish political system."" A decision has yet to be taken by the SDLP as to who will attend the service. Its leader Colum Eastwood said: ""Given the choice between remaining in the trenches of the last 100 years or reaching out to build a new future, I know which side I want to be on."" President Michael D Higgins declined an invitation to the event The British and Irish heads of state, the Queen and President Higgins, were both invited. The president's decision provoked criticism in Northern Ireland, with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson saying it was a ""disappointing and retrograde step"". In September,President Higgins defended his decision to decline his invitation. On Thursday, Church of Ireland primate Archbishop John McDowell said the church leaders ""absolutely respect"" the decision of anyone who declines an invitation. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking on RTÃ radio, he insisted the organisers had chosen their words carefully in describing the service as ""marking"" the centenary. ""Not commemorate, not celebrate but to mark - which is a neutral phase - which allows for a very wide interpretation,"" he said. ""And it will include, and always has been planned to include, those who will want to say very clearly that partition, and the legacy of partition, have been a bitter experience for them."" Irish president defends turning down centenary event Church leaders hope for 'healing' centenary events DUP asks Higgins to rethink centenary invite BBC News NI has seen a copy of the letter sent by the church leaders on 4 October to people invited to service. It says: ""The service will provide the opportunity for honest reflection on the past 100 years, including an acknowledgement of different perceptions, with the recognition of failures and hurts. ""It will, however, also have a clear affirmation of our shared commitment to building a future marked by peace, reconciliation and a commitment to the common good.""

"Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford outlines his Covid winter plan, saying he expects businesses to stay open He says he hopes this Christmas will be more like we're used to but warns coronavirus is not over Travel firms have welcomed the latest relaxation of quarantine rules, as 47 countries are taken off the UK's ""red list"" The government is planning to replace expensive day two PCR tests with lateral flow tests for travel to the UK This change will be in place ""hopefully in time"" for those returning from half-term trips, the transport secretary says Grant Shapps adds it will ""certainly"" be in place by the end of this month but Drakeford says he's very concerned by the change People are being urged to get their flu jab amid concerns it will be the first winter that Covid and flu circulate fully The UK has eased travel restrictions for fully vaccinated Indians who have received a UK-approved jab Edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke That's all from our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. This live page has been written by Doug Faulkner and Jo Couzens, and edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke. Thank you for joining us. ...here are some of the headlines from around the world before we bring our coverage to an end for the day. There have been protests and tributes to the dead in Brazil, where the number of pandemic-related deaths has reached 600,000 We've been bringing you the news today that the number of countries on the UK's red list will be cut to seven on Monday, with 47 destinations - including South Africa, Mexico, Thailand, Brazil and Costa Rica - removed. The amber and green lists have already been scrapped and rules for testing relaxed. As we've been reporting, anyone coming from a non-red list country won't need to self-isolate if they can show a full vaccination certificate, recognised by the UK. But all arrivals will still need to take a test on day two. However, the government says it will change the requirement so travellers could use the cheaper lateral flow test rather than the more expensive PCR before the end of October. As we've been reporting, Welsh First minister Mark Drakeford has said he is very concerned about the planned changes to testing - but adds it will be difficult for Wales not to follow suit as many Welsh travellers use English airports when arriving back from trips abroad. Read more Health officials are urging people in the UK to get a flu vaccination before winter. More than 40 million people will be offered the jab, amid fears the months ahead could see a surge in flu alongside a rise in Covid cases. For most people in England, the flu vaccine will be be offered via GPs, midwives and schools. Eligible patients can also book an appointment at a pharmacy. But who will be eligible to get a free flu jab - and what about the rest of the UK? Reality Check President Joe Biden says the tough regulations he put in place
for federal government workers and those in larger private companies to be
vaccinated are paying off. In a speech yesterday in Chicago, Biden said the
imposition of ""vaccination requirements results in more people getting
vaccinated"". From the end of July, all US federal workers have been
required either to be vaccinated or undergo regular testing.  And in
September this was extended to cover companies with more than 100 employees. However, US vaccination data presents a more complicated picture than Biden suggests. When the new rules were imposed on federal workers in July, vaccinations were already on an upward trend which continued largely unchanged following the introduction of the policy. When the policy was widened to include large private companies in September, there was a brief uptick mid-month but the prevailing falling trend then continued following this spike. So there is little to suggest from the US governmentâs own data that the introduction of tougher government requirements has had a significant impact on the overall rate of vaccination across the US. Vaccinations have begun to pick up in recent weeks and currently about 850,000 doses a day are being administered. England football manager Gareth Southgate has suggested medical confidentiality is the
reason for his players not publicly sharing whether they have had the Covid vaccine. ""There's a thing called medical confidentiality which seems to be being totally overlooked in a lot of areas at the moment,"" Southgate says, on the eve of England's World Cup qualifier against Andorra. ""These aren't our players. I don't think the clubs would thank us for sharing that sort of information and frankly, it is personal to the players."" Last week Southgate said he did not know how many of the team had received both doses. Fewer than half of players at most Premier League and English Football League clubs are vaccinated. Earlier this monthit was announcedPremier League players are only allowed to travel to UK-designated ""red-list"" nations to represent their countries in this month's World Cup qualifiers if they are fully vaccinated. The government has since announced the red list will be cut to just seven countries from Monday. However - and contrary to some media reports - BBC Sport understands Fifa does not want any player to be prevented from playing in the Qatar 2022 World Cup because of their vaccination status, and is looking into alternatives to being fully vaccinated, including proof of recovery from Covid-19 or negative tests. Read more:Why are some footballers vaccine hesitant and what happens next? There have been 36,060 confirmed Covid cases reported across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to the latest figures. This is a slight fall from Thursday's UK-wide figure of 40,701 but a rise on last Friday's 35,577. A further 127 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported - taking the total by that measure to 137,541. Both the cases and deaths figures from Wales have not been included in today's data due to a network issue, according to the government. A further 33,029 people received a first Covid jab on Thursday while 28,656 received their second dose. We've just brought you the news that the UK government is lifting its travel advisories for a further 51 countries. It says the change will make it easier for people to buy travel insurance for a wider range of destinations. Theupdate means the Foreign Office is no longer advising against travelto non-red list countries on Covid-19 grounds - except in
exceptional circumstances, such as if the local healthcare system is
overwhelmed. Travellers should still check its advice on entry requirements for their destination, including any proof of
vaccination they may need, as well as testing and quarantine rules, it adds. The US added a disappointing 194,000 jobs in September, as the Delta variant of coronavirus continued to drag on the economy, official figures show. The unemployment rate meanwhile fell from 5.2% in August to 4.8%. There were notable job gains in hospitality, retail and transportation, while employment in education declined,the US Bureau of Labor Statistics says,external. Yet the unemployment rate is still considerably higher than it was before the pandemic began. Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: ""Investors will be disappointed by today's data, particularly as there has been much more positive economic data issued recently."" Read more in our story. The UK's government announces it will lift its advice against all but essential travel to a further 51 countries and territories. They include the Bahamas, Jamaica, Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Indonesia, Mexico, the Seychelles, South Africa and Thailand. This follows the removal of travel advisories to 32 countries on Wednesday. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the updates will make travel abroad easier - ""boosting trade, tourism and reuniting friends and families"". She says: ""I am delighted that the safe reopening of travel allows people to exercise personal responsibility and visit more destinations across the globe."" A director of public health is advising people to isolate if they have Covid-19 symptoms, even if they subsequently receive a negative PCR test result. GPs in the West say they are seeing ""a stream of patients"" who receive a positive lateral flow test and go on to receive negative PCR results. The UK Health Security Agency says it is investigating the cause. While it is understood lateral flow tests can sometimes produce a false negative, false positives are much rarer. The UK Health Security Agency says it has been made aware of ""some areas across the country"" anecdotally reporting positive lateral flow results with subsequent negative PCR tests. It adds there is currently no evidence of there being any technical issues with lateral flow tests or PCR test kits in relation to those reports. Read more here Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Just under 7% of children in
school years 7 to 11 in England had coronavirus in the week up to 2 October,
according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Thatâs
the highest rate recorded for this age group and, while most age groups are
falling, their parentsâ age group (the 35 to 49-year-olds) are seeing slight
rises too in these figures. The ONS data only covers up to last Saturday and thereâs reason to hope from the more up-to-date data from daily testing. That data suggests thatboth have seen rates flattenand maybe even fall. Overall, about 940,000 people in
the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus, or one in 70 people. Thatâs
up on the previous week and driven by rises in England. Scotland and Northern
Ireland are both seeing falls, according to the ONS. Novavax trial volunteers Darren Green and his wife, Linda, are ""delighted"" they will be offered two doses of an approved vaccine Darren Green, 51, and his wife Linda, 59, who live in south Wales, werevolunteers in the Novavax trial. Linda was given a placebo rather than the vaccine and has since received two doses of an MHRA-approved Covid jab, meaning she is now free to travel. Darren, however, is not, because he received Novavax in the trial. He says it is a relief to know he can now get an approved vaccine. ""I felt a bit emotional when I heard the news. It's a big weight off my mind,"" he says. ""I'll be able to go out and do what other vaccinated people can. We have a trip planned with friends. I thought I was going to have to cancel."" On the prospect of needing more doses, he said: ""Apart from feeling a bit like a pin cushion, I'm absolutely delighted."" People who took part in trials of coronavirus vaccines that have not yet been approved will be offered two doses of another vaccine from next week, health officials say. This means more than 15,000 volunteers who received Novavax or other jabs will finally be able to travel abroad. People who signed up to Covid vaccine trials are recognised as fully-vaccinated in the UK - even if the vaccine has not been approved. But many other countries are not allowing them to enter. The NHS Covid app will be altered to permit the volunteers to travel after they've had their extra two doses. The move, announced by the Department of Health in England, has been developed with the help of the UK's vaccine committee and investigators who worked on the clinical trials. Read more England's R rate -the speed at which coronavirus spreads,external- has risen slightly and is estimated to be between 0.9 to 1.1. A value below one means the number of cases are falling, while a value over one means infections are increasing. It means that on average, every 10 people who are infected will pass the virus on to between nine and 11 other people in England. The growth rate of infections is estimated to be between -1% to +2% per day. Last week the R rate was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.1, with a growth rate of -3% to +1% per day. Prof Peter Johnson spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital A professor who recovered from Covid is to sing a new piece of choral music based on the diaries of the hospital nurses who treated him when he was in intensive care. Prof Peter Johnstone, 72, spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge last year. Vision Of A Garden will be performed at the Royal Festival Hall on 24 October - and Prof Johnstone will be one of the singers at the premiere. Clinical nurse Jill Hyde says the piece of music was ""a huge boost to staff morale"". Prof Johnstone, a professor of maths at St John's College, Cambridge, was the first Covid patient admitted to the hospital's Neurosciences and Trauma Critical Care Unit. Often unconscious, he was cared for round the clock for 75 days by hundreds of health care workers, Addenbrooke's said.

""The most likely scenario in our control plan says that we ought to be able to get through the autumn and the winter with restrictions at the sort of level, we have at the moment,"" Mark Drakeford says. ""That would be very different to last Christmas, far more like the sort of Christmases we were used to. ""All that does depend on us all doing the things that keep us safe, coming forward for vaccination and the simple things that we've learned to do together. ""Then, if nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to."" Across Scotland, hospitals are dealing with thousands more pre-school patients than before the pandemic, figures reveal. Although the cause is unclear, it coincides with an unseasonal surge in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). According to aPublic Health Scotland report,external, a ""high"" level of RSV detections have been reported - and most were among children under five. Typically case numbers peak in winter but week-on-week rises have been recorded since the summer. RSV is a very common virus and almost all children are infected with it by the time they are two years old. Read more. As well as talking about winter plans Mark Drakeford says he's ""very concerned"" about the UK government's plans to change the testing rules for people returning from overseas. By the end of October, fully vaccinated people travelling to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival. Instead, they'll be able to take a lateral flow test. Wales' First Minister says the PCR tests allow variants to be traced and he ""wasnât clear"" how lateral flow tests could be used in the same way. He says there is ""a risk that we are lowering protections"". Drakeford adds it is ""very difficult"" for Wales not to follow the UK governmentâs plans as many travellers use airports in England to travel abroad.

Dr Caroline Whitworth, of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI), says bed occupancy in the hospital is now consistently 100% - with ""thousands"" in pain while on hold for procedures. A&E waiting times have been at record levels since mid-August. Most health boards have cancelled routine operations to make space for Covid patients and the seriously ill. Bed blocking has also been an issue for the ERI, with more than 100 elderly patients waiting to be discharged in recent days. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"The government has failed to find solutions to halt soaring energy prices, UK Steel boss Gareth Stace has said. He was speaking after leaders of energy-intensive industries met with Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. ""We can't wait until Christmas and beyond. Or even a few weeks. We need action now, it needs to be swift, decisive action,"" Mr Stace said. The government said it was exploring ways to manage high energy costs. Gas prices have risen 250% since January, pushing up costs dramatically. Mr Stace told the BBC that Mr Kwarteng had listened but had provided ""no immediate solutions or guarantees"". The UK Steel director general said he was ""baffled"" because governments in the rest of Europe had stepped in to support industry, although they faced lower energy costs than in the UK. Representatives from energy-intensive sectors including paper, glass, cement, lime, ceramics, chemicals and steel were at Friday's talks with the business secretary. The Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) said it hoped the government would find ways to support those sectors. Mr Kwarteng told the business representatives he would continue to work with them to tackle the problem. His department said the government would assess the options put forward by the industry, with his spokesperson saying: ""We recognise the recent increase in global gas prices will be a cause of concern for businesses in the UK. ""We are in regular contact with Ofgem and business groups to explore ways to manage the impact of rising global prices."" Mr Kwarteng also stressed government confidence in the security of gas supplies this winter. After the meeting, EIUG chair Richard Leese said the government had made ""positive first steps to develop practical solutions"". ""EIUG will work with government to avoid threats both to the production of essential domestic and industrial products, as well an enormous range of supply chains critical to our economy,"" he said. Regulator warns of significant energy price hikes Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Andrew Large, director-general at the Confederation of Paper Industries, said there were ""serious"" risks factories could stop operating as a result of the gas prices being too high. There have already been stoppages at fertiliser and steel plants due to high energy costs. However, he said the business secretary appeared to share industry's desire to avoid any potential supply chain disruption. On Thursday Mr Kwarteng said the government's strategy to shift to ""clean"" power sources by 2035, including wind, solar and nuclear, would reduce reliance on fossil fuels. ""The volatility of the gas price has shown we do need to plan strategically and net zero helps us do that,"" he said. Speaking before the meeting, Mr Stace had said if the government failed to act it could ""strangle steel production"" in the UK. A crisis in steel production as a result of high energy prices would affect the wider economy, he added, saying the government should consider taking additional action in the short term. ""We're pausing production already in terms of some steel producers in the UK.... and it's going to happen more often unless something is done, or the energy market corrects itself and I don't think that will happen any time soon."" He said the government should address the disparity in energy costs for UK steel makers who he said were paying 50-80% more for electricity than German producers. Other countries, such as Italy and Portugal, had ""committed billions of euros"" to address the rising cost of gas, he added. ""If the government does nothing then tomorrow, there'll be a steel crisis, and given in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel is, but for the UK economy as a whole,"" he said. The price of wholesale gas has soared since the start of the year. And the UK has lower levels of gas stored than other European countries, which could help cushion price volatility. Domestic customers' bills are partly protected from these sharp rises by a price cap, managed by the regulator Ofgem, which limits how far and how fast bills can rise. Nevertheless, UK households have felt the impact after the price cap was raised at the start of October. Customers will see further ""significant rises"" in the spring, regulator Ofgem has warned. The cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April. It applies to households in England, Scotland and Wales this month. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain.

"Fellow politicians have paid tribute to Tory MP James Brokenshire, who has died aged 53, having been diagnosed with lung cancer more than three years ago. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the father of three, a former Northern Ireland secretary, as the ""nicest, kindest"" colleague. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called him ""a thoroughly decent man"". Mr Brokenshire, a lifelong non-smoker, stood down as a Home Office minister earlier this year. He died in hospital on Thursday night, having been admitted after his condition deteriorated. An MP since 2005, Mr Brokenshire served in government under three prime ministers - David Cameron, Theresa May and Mr Johnson. House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has ordered that flags in Parliament's New Palace Yard be flown at half-mast to mark ""a profound loss to us all"". Minister steps back from role for cancer surgery Brokenshire in lung cancer awareness call Mrs May tweeted: ""Truly saddened by the death of James Brokenshire. He was an outstanding public servant, a talented minister and a loyal friend."" And Mr Johnson tweeted that it was ""desperately sad"", adding: ""James was the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians but also extraordinarily effective."" Mr Brokenshire, who was MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup in Kent, resigned as Northern Ireland secretary in January 2018 following his lung cancer diagnosis, but made a comeback to the cabinet a few months later as housing secretary. He lost that job in July 2019, after Mr Johnson took over from Mrs May in 10 Downing Street. Mr Brokenshire re-entered government as a Home Office minister in February last year, but stood down in July this year, due to poor health. This video can not be played Former adviser Peter Cardwell: ""James was the best of politics and he was the best of humanity."" Following his death, Mr Brokenshire's family expressed ""deep sadness"", adding: ""James was not only a brilliant government minister... but a dedicated constituency MP. ""But most importantly, he was a loving father to his three children, a devoted husband to Cathy and a faithful friend to so many."" The family also thanked NHS staff, including those at Guy's & St Thomas' hospital in London, for treating Mr Brokenshire ""with such warmth, diligence and professionalism over the past three-and-a-half years"". They also shared a memorial page on his Twitter feed, which encouraged people to share memories and photos of Mr Brokenshire and to donate to the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation in lieu of flowers. ""In the last few years of his life James's passion was to help others with lung cancer, preventing others going through what he did,"" the memorial page said, describing him as an ""indefatigable campaigner for better lung cancer screening"". After his lung cancer diagnosis, Mr Brokenshire, a former lawyer, worked to promote greater awareness of the disease, urging people who showed symptoms to get tested. Fellow Conservative MP Karen Bradley told the BBC News Channel the news of her ""understated"" friend's death was ""heartbreaking"", adding: ""I can't believe I'm not going to be able to sit down with James again and have a laugh about life, and chat about the issues that we both cared about. ""My thoughts are with Cathy and the family, who are just the most wonderful family. I'm devastated."" James Brokenshire (right) served under Theresa May, as well as David Cameron and Boris Johnson Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""James Brokenshire was a thoroughly decent man, dedicated and effective in all briefs he held. ""He fought his illness with dignity and bravery. I'm incredibly sad to learn of his death and send my condolences to his wife and children."" The UK's most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, said: ""I had the personal privilege of working with him closely over a number of years and admired greatly his unwavering commitment to public service and compassion."" The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, tweeted: ""So sorry to hear of the death of James Brokenshire, whose courage and faith were an inspiration to so many, myself included."" Before becoming the Old Bexley & Sidcup MP in 2010, Mr Brokenshire represented the seat of Hornchurch and Rainham, north-east London, for five years. His death will prompt a Parliamentary by-election in Old Bexley and Sidcup, where he had a majority of 18,952 at the last general election.

"Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford outlines his Covid winter plan, saying he expects businesses to stay open He says he hopes this Christmas will be more like we're used to but warns coronavirus is not over Travel firms have welcomed the latest relaxation of quarantine rules, as 47 countries are taken off the UK's ""red list"" The government is planning to replace expensive day two PCR tests with lateral flow tests for travel to the UK This change will be in place ""hopefully in time"" for those returning from half-term trips, the transport secretary says Grant Shapps adds it will ""certainly"" be in place by the end of this month but Drakeford says he's very concerned by the change People are being urged to get their flu jab amid concerns it will be the first winter that Covid and flu circulate fully The UK has eased travel restrictions for fully vaccinated Indians who have received a UK-approved jab Edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke That's all from our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. This live page has been written by Doug Faulkner and Jo Couzens, and edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke. Thank you for joining us. ...here are some of the headlines from around the world before we bring our coverage to an end for the day. There have been protests and tributes to the dead in Brazil, where the number of pandemic-related deaths has reached 600,000 We've been bringing you the news today that the number of countries on the UK's red list will be cut to seven on Monday, with 47 destinations - including South Africa, Mexico, Thailand, Brazil and Costa Rica - removed. The amber and green lists have already been scrapped and rules for testing relaxed. As we've been reporting, anyone coming from a non-red list country won't need to self-isolate if they can show a full vaccination certificate, recognised by the UK. But all arrivals will still need to take a test on day two. However, the government says it will change the requirement so travellers could use the cheaper lateral flow test rather than the more expensive PCR before the end of October. As we've been reporting, Welsh First minister Mark Drakeford has said he is very concerned about the planned changes to testing - but adds it will be difficult for Wales not to follow suit as many Welsh travellers use English airports when arriving back from trips abroad. Read more Health officials are urging people in the UK to get a flu vaccination before winter. More than 40 million people will be offered the jab, amid fears the months ahead could see a surge in flu alongside a rise in Covid cases. For most people in England, the flu vaccine will be be offered via GPs, midwives and schools. Eligible patients can also book an appointment at a pharmacy. But who will be eligible to get a free flu jab - and what about the rest of the UK? Reality Check President Joe Biden says the tough regulations he put in place
for federal government workers and those in larger private companies to be
vaccinated are paying off. In a speech yesterday in Chicago, Biden said the
imposition of ""vaccination requirements results in more people getting
vaccinated"". From the end of July, all US federal workers have been
required either to be vaccinated or undergo regular testing.  And in
September this was extended to cover companies with more than 100 employees. However, US vaccination data presents a more complicated picture than Biden suggests. When the new rules were imposed on federal workers in July, vaccinations were already on an upward trend which continued largely unchanged following the introduction of the policy. When the policy was widened to include large private companies in September, there was a brief uptick mid-month but the prevailing falling trend then continued following this spike. So there is little to suggest from the US governmentâs own data that the introduction of tougher government requirements has had a significant impact on the overall rate of vaccination across the US. Vaccinations have begun to pick up in recent weeks and currently about 850,000 doses a day are being administered. England football manager Gareth Southgate has suggested medical confidentiality is the
reason for his players not publicly sharing whether they have had the Covid vaccine. ""There's a thing called medical confidentiality which seems to be being totally overlooked in a lot of areas at the moment,"" Southgate says, on the eve of England's World Cup qualifier against Andorra. ""These aren't our players. I don't think the clubs would thank us for sharing that sort of information and frankly, it is personal to the players."" Last week Southgate said he did not know how many of the team had received both doses. Fewer than half of players at most Premier League and English Football League clubs are vaccinated. Earlier this monthit was announcedPremier League players are only allowed to travel to UK-designated ""red-list"" nations to represent their countries in this month's World Cup qualifiers if they are fully vaccinated. The government has since announced the red list will be cut to just seven countries from Monday. However - and contrary to some media reports - BBC Sport understands Fifa does not want any player to be prevented from playing in the Qatar 2022 World Cup because of their vaccination status, and is looking into alternatives to being fully vaccinated, including proof of recovery from Covid-19 or negative tests. Read more:Why are some footballers vaccine hesitant and what happens next? There have been 36,060 confirmed Covid cases reported across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to the latest figures. This is a slight fall from Thursday's UK-wide figure of 40,701 but a rise on last Friday's 35,577. A further 127 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported - taking the total by that measure to 137,541. Both the cases and deaths figures from Wales have not been included in today's data due to a network issue, according to the government. A further 33,029 people received a first Covid jab on Thursday while 28,656 received their second dose. We've just brought you the news that the UK government is lifting its travel advisories for a further 51 countries. It says the change will make it easier for people to buy travel insurance for a wider range of destinations. Theupdate means the Foreign Office is no longer advising against travelto non-red list countries on Covid-19 grounds - except in
exceptional circumstances, such as if the local healthcare system is
overwhelmed. Travellers should still check its advice on entry requirements for their destination, including any proof of
vaccination they may need, as well as testing and quarantine rules, it adds. The US added a disappointing 194,000 jobs in September, as the Delta variant of coronavirus continued to drag on the economy, official figures show. The unemployment rate meanwhile fell from 5.2% in August to 4.8%. There were notable job gains in hospitality, retail and transportation, while employment in education declined,the US Bureau of Labor Statistics says,external. Yet the unemployment rate is still considerably higher than it was before the pandemic began. Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: ""Investors will be disappointed by today's data, particularly as there has been much more positive economic data issued recently."" Read more in our story. The UK's government announces it will lift its advice against all but essential travel to a further 51 countries and territories. They include the Bahamas, Jamaica, Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Indonesia, Mexico, the Seychelles, South Africa and Thailand. This follows the removal of travel advisories to 32 countries on Wednesday. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the updates will make travel abroad easier - ""boosting trade, tourism and reuniting friends and families"". She says: ""I am delighted that the safe reopening of travel allows people to exercise personal responsibility and visit more destinations across the globe."" A director of public health is advising people to isolate if they have Covid-19 symptoms, even if they subsequently receive a negative PCR test result. GPs in the West say they are seeing ""a stream of patients"" who receive a positive lateral flow test and go on to receive negative PCR results. The UK Health Security Agency says it is investigating the cause. While it is understood lateral flow tests can sometimes produce a false negative, false positives are much rarer. The UK Health Security Agency says it has been made aware of ""some areas across the country"" anecdotally reporting positive lateral flow results with subsequent negative PCR tests. It adds there is currently no evidence of there being any technical issues with lateral flow tests or PCR test kits in relation to those reports. Read more here Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Just under 7% of children in
school years 7 to 11 in England had coronavirus in the week up to 2 October,
according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Thatâs
the highest rate recorded for this age group and, while most age groups are
falling, their parentsâ age group (the 35 to 49-year-olds) are seeing slight
rises too in these figures. The ONS data only covers up to last Saturday and thereâs reason to hope from the more up-to-date data from daily testing. That data suggests thatboth have seen rates flattenand maybe even fall. Overall, about 940,000 people in
the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus, or one in 70 people. Thatâs
up on the previous week and driven by rises in England. Scotland and Northern
Ireland are both seeing falls, according to the ONS. Novavax trial volunteers Darren Green and his wife, Linda, are ""delighted"" they will be offered two doses of an approved vaccine Darren Green, 51, and his wife Linda, 59, who live in south Wales, werevolunteers in the Novavax trial. Linda was given a placebo rather than the vaccine and has since received two doses of an MHRA-approved Covid jab, meaning she is now free to travel. Darren, however, is not, because he received Novavax in the trial. He says it is a relief to know he can now get an approved vaccine. ""I felt a bit emotional when I heard the news. It's a big weight off my mind,"" he says. ""I'll be able to go out and do what other vaccinated people can. We have a trip planned with friends. I thought I was going to have to cancel."" On the prospect of needing more doses, he said: ""Apart from feeling a bit like a pin cushion, I'm absolutely delighted."" People who took part in trials of coronavirus vaccines that have not yet been approved will be offered two doses of another vaccine from next week, health officials say. This means more than 15,000 volunteers who received Novavax or other jabs will finally be able to travel abroad. People who signed up to Covid vaccine trials are recognised as fully-vaccinated in the UK - even if the vaccine has not been approved. But many other countries are not allowing them to enter. The NHS Covid app will be altered to permit the volunteers to travel after they've had their extra two doses. The move, announced by the Department of Health in England, has been developed with the help of the UK's vaccine committee and investigators who worked on the clinical trials. Read more England's R rate -the speed at which coronavirus spreads,external- has risen slightly and is estimated to be between 0.9 to 1.1. A value below one means the number of cases are falling, while a value over one means infections are increasing. It means that on average, every 10 people who are infected will pass the virus on to between nine and 11 other people in England. The growth rate of infections is estimated to be between -1% to +2% per day. Last week the R rate was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.1, with a growth rate of -3% to +1% per day. Prof Peter Johnson spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital A professor who recovered from Covid is to sing a new piece of choral music based on the diaries of the hospital nurses who treated him when he was in intensive care. Prof Peter Johnstone, 72, spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge last year. Vision Of A Garden will be performed at the Royal Festival Hall on 24 October - and Prof Johnstone will be one of the singers at the premiere. Clinical nurse Jill Hyde says the piece of music was ""a huge boost to staff morale"". Prof Johnstone, a professor of maths at St John's College, Cambridge, was the first Covid patient admitted to the hospital's Neurosciences and Trauma Critical Care Unit. Often unconscious, he was cared for round the clock for 75 days by hundreds of health care workers, Addenbrooke's said. Read more Christmas 2021 will be more like ""the ones that we're used to"" if nothing unexpected happens, the Welsh First Minister says. ""The most likely scenario in our control plan says that we ought to be able to get through the autumn and the winter with restrictions at the sort of level, we have at the moment,"" Mark Drakeford says. ""That would be very different to last Christmas, far more like the sort of Christmases we were used to. ""All that does depend on us all doing the things that keep us safe, coming forward for vaccination and the simple things that we've learned to do together. ""Then, if nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to."" Across Scotland, hospitals are dealing with thousands more pre-school patients than before the pandemic, figures reveal. Although the cause is unclear, it coincides with an unseasonal surge in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). According to aPublic Health Scotland report,external, a ""high"" level of RSV detections have been reported - and most were among children under five. Typically case numbers peak in winter but week-on-week rises have been recorded since the summer. RSV is a very common virus and almost all children are infected with it by the time they are two years old. Read more. As well as talking about winter plans Mark Drakeford says he's ""very concerned"" about the UK government's plans to change the testing rules for people returning from overseas. By the end of October, fully vaccinated people travelling to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival. Instead, they'll be able to take a lateral flow test. Wales' First Minister says the PCR tests allow variants to be traced and he ""wasnât clear"" how lateral flow tests could be used in the same way.

Dr Caroline Whitworth, of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI), says bed occupancy in the hospital is now consistently 100% - with ""thousands"" in pain while on hold for procedures. A&E waiting times have been at record levels since mid-August. Most health boards have cancelled routine operations to make space for Covid patients and the seriously ill. Bed blocking has also been an issue for the ERI, with more than 100 elderly patients waiting to be discharged in recent days. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"Newcastle fans hold a Saudi flag outside St James' Park The UK government is refusing to reveal what it told the Premier League about the Saudi-backed takeover of Newcastle United because it could ""harm"" relations with Saudi Arabia. The government says it did not get involved in the deal, which has been criticised by human rights activists. But the Foreign Office is known to have held meetings with the Premier League to discuss it. The BBC asked for details of these meetings under Freedom of Information. The Foreign Office responded with a redacted copy of the agenda for one meeting, which took place on 14 May 2020, and a redacted copy of the minutes of another meeting on 10 June 2020. Newcastle takeover 'heartbreaking' Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle completed Key Newcastle takeover questions answered However, it declined to provide further details requested by the BBC, including a list of attendees and the full minutes. Labour MP for Newcastle-Upon-Tyne Central, Chi Onwurah, who has been critical of the way the Premier League handles takeovers, said: ""The lack of transparency and accountability by the Premier League and government is a sign of broken football governance. ""This is the first time we've heard it's an issue of diplomacy. There will be many fans who have concerns about Saudi Arabia's human rights record - if the government raised concerns, we deserve to know about it."" This video can not be played Newcastle United: Amanda Staveley arrives at St James' Park for the first time as co-owner In its letter to the BBC in March this year, the Foreign Office said: ""We acknowledge that releasing information on this issue would increase public knowledge about our relations with Saudi Arabia."" But officials added: ""The disclosure of information detailing our relationship with the Saudi government could potentially damage the bilateral relationship between the UK and Saudi Arabia. ""This would reduce the UK government's ability to protect and promote UK interests through its relations with Saudi Arabia which would not be in the public interest."" The government confirmed that the meeting on 14 May was attended by representatives from the Foreign Office, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for International Trade and the Premier League. The 10 June meeting was between the Foreign Office and the Premier League. The redacted minutes of that meeting say there was uncertainty about the ""exact timeline for a PL [Premier League] decision"" but it was ""becoming closer"". It added that the Premier League was ""committed"" to keeping the government ""informed both at a working-level [redacted]"". On Thursday, the Premier League approved the takeover of Newcastle United after receiving ""legally binding"" assurances that Saudi Arabia would not control the club. Eighty per cent of the funding for the deal will come from the Public Investment Fund (PIF) which is seen as separate from the state, despite the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammed bin Salman acting as chair for the body. Many Newcastle fans celebrated the deal which could see increased investment in the club, following Mike Ashley's 14-year reign as owner. Amnesty International UK described the takeover as ""an extremely bitter blow for human rights defenders"". Hatice Cengiz, the fiancee of Jamal Khashoggi, has described the Newcastle United takeover as ""heartbreaking"" The Saudi Arabian authorities have jailed women's rights activists and Western intelligence agencies believe the country's crown prince ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi - something he denies. Homosexuality is outlawed in the country and campaigners say same-sex acts are punishable by death. Saudi Arabia is an important trade partner for the UK, who after the US is the second largest exporter of arms to Saudi Arabia. This relationship has been an important one for the UK's defence industry, dating back to 1985 when then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher signed the Al-Yamamah arms deal with the country. Financier Amanda Staveley who will take a seat on the board of Newcastle said the new owners would make a ""long-term investment"" in the club The UK government has made a concerted effort not to get involved with the takeover of Newcastle United, a senior source has told the BBC. Officials from both the Department for Media, Culture and Sport and the Foreign Office have been in regular contact with the Premier League for updates. An insider said the involvement of the Saudis made it ""quite a difficult one"" but the government wanted to ""let the deal play out."" Sports minister Nigel Huddleston has said that he is ""keeping an eye on"" the takeover but that acquisitions of any team is ""an issue for football"". He said he expected a fit and proper test to be applied but added: ""At the end of the day we've got to trust football to do its job and look after itself"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told the BBC he was ""very concerned"" by the takeover of the football club, adding that all such deals should go to an independent regulator. He added that it was not for him as a politician to say who should own football clubs. Former sports minister Tracey Crouch - who is currently undertaking a review into English football -has said she is in favourof an independent regulator to address corporate governance.

"Sir Dave ran Tesco until late last year Boris Johnson has appointed former Tesco chief executive Sir David Lewis to advise it on how to fix the supply chain crisis that has led to petrol and other shortages. It comes as the Office for National Statistics found one in six UK adults said they had been unable to buy essential foods in the last fortnight. The recent fuel crisis was caused in part by a shortage of lorry drivers. Brexit and the pandemic have both contributed to labour shortages. The ONS found that 17% of adults said they had not been able to buy essential food items because they were not available, and almost a quarter (23%) said the same for non-essential food items. What's in short supply and why? Why is there an HGV driver shortage? 'Customers will go elsewhere and won't come back' The government said businesses had faced a range of challenges over recent months as they recovered from the coronavirus pandemic which has affected supply chains across Europe and around the world. Mr Johnson said: ""There are currently global supply issues which we are working with industry to mitigate, and Dave brings a wealth of experience which will help us continue to protect our businesses and supply chains."" A statement said this would include ""both identifying the causes of current blockages and pre-empting potential future ones, and advising on resolutions either through direct government action or through industry with government support"". Shoppers have been unable to buy some of their usual items Sir Dave left the supermarket giant in September last year after helping mend its fortunes following a major accounting scandal. He has been appointed until the end of the year and will start work in his new role on Monday. Many businesses in the UK have been reporting supply chain issues. A shortage of HGV drivers and specialised workers has led to gaps on supermarket shelves and problems with fuel supplies failing to reach petrol forecourts. The body representing the road haulage industry has estimatedthere is currently a shortfall of about 100,000drivers, although it said there was already a significant shortage of drivers before the pandemic and Brexit. Changes to the way drivers are taxed has also put some off. On Thursday, a trade body representing thousands of fuel retailers called for an independent inquiry into the continuing supply problems for petrol and diesel, which have led to panic-buying and lengthy queues. Alongside the driver shortage issues, some manufacturers have also said a global shortage of computer chips and rising shipping costs for products from China is adding to the bottleneck and extra costs. Hundreds ofcontainer ships are still queuing for access,externalto overloaded ports, mostly in the US and China.Port closures caused by Covid-19 outbreakshave further exacerbated the problem. Meanwhile, shortages of workers in food processing, hospitality and the care sector have been reported after some overseas workers returned home due to Brexit and the pandemic and chose not to return to the UK. Retailers have also said they face a struggle to ensure supplies are in place for the crucial Christmas trading period. Earlier this week, Tesco's current chief executive Ken Murphy said there would ""be bumps in the road in the run-up to Christmas"". ""We're seeing our share of challenges,"" he said. Nestle, the producer of Quality Street and Lion bars. has also said it is experiencing some supply chain problems ahead of the Christmas period. Nestle chief executive Mark Schneider said: ""Like other businesses, we are seeing some labour shortages and some transportation issues but it's our UK team's top priority to work constructively with retailers to supply them"". When asked whether he could guarantee Quality Street would be in the shops this Christmas he replied: ""We are working hard."" Farmers are warning of aChristmas turkey shortagebecause visa changes to allow labour recruitment from abroad have come too late. Some 600 pigs have already been shot and a mass cull is ""the next stage"", according to the National Pig Association (NPA), which said the sector was also experiencing staff shortages due to Brexit and Covid. The NPA said mature pigs have continued to ""back up"" on farms. The Toy Retailers Association has said shoppers may struggle to find what they want, while John Lewis says it is chartering a fleet of extra ships to make sure it has Christmas stock on time.

"Households will again see ""significant rises"" in energy prices next spring, regulator Ofgem has warned. Its chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said the price cap, which limits how much energy providers can charge per unit, would go up again because of the ""unprecedented"" rise in gas prices. The cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April. Natural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. As a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it. Last month, nine of those companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers. Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Ofgem's Mr Brearley told the BBC that the price cap was there to stop firms making unfair profits, but ""legitimate costs have to be passed through"". He said it was too early to say how much the rise in April would be or whether Ofgem would have to review the price cap more frequently in future. However, he added that the regulator might have to look at the formula according to which the cap was set. His warning comes as domestic customers are still reeling from the latest price cap increase, which took effect for households in England, Scotland and Wales this month. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain. The energy crisis falls into three broad stages for UK consumers and businesses. Firstly, the here and now. Domestic customers have seen a rise in direct debit demands and bills from suppliers. They are, however, protected from the extreme cost of gas on the wholesale markets by the price cap. Businesses are not. Many are seeing instant and large increases in their energy bills. Secondly, as Ofgem confirms, significantly higher energy prices in the spring are inevitable, potentially adding hundreds of pounds to an annual household bill. That is something which customers can do nothing to stop. Thirdly, a review by the regulator will consider the extent to which the price cap protects customers versus the extra burden it places on all bill payers picking up the cost if the cap causes suppliers to fold. At any point in this process, the government can step in. Thus far, it has shown little appetite to do so. When the price cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills. That was the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a Â£153 increase. The next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February, but will come into force in April. Even if wholesale gas prices were to drop significantly from now, the extra costs that suppliers have had to shoulder in the last couple of months means a steep rise in household bills in April is inevitable. Analysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by Â£400, meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay about Â£1,660 a year. On Thursday, National Energy Action, a charity, said that between 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households could be hit by fuel poverty next year. Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is to hold talks later on Friday with representatives of industries which have the heaviest energy consumption, such as steel, cement and chemicals. While the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices. They have called for government help to control costs and keep plants open. The UK has lower levels of gas stored than many other European countries, making it more exposed to global price volatility. Mr Kwarteng said on Twitter protecting consumers from rising global gas prices was ""his top priority"". His meeting with the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) will include representative bodies UK Steel, the Chemical Industries Association, the Confederation of Paper Industries, the Mineral Products Association, the British Glass Manufacturers Federation, the British Ceramic Confederation, BOC, Air Products and the Major Energy Users Council. Ahead of the meeting, the director of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, told the BBC that the government needed to step in to help industries cope with the rising cost of energy. ""If the government does nothing, then tomorrow there'll be a steel crisis, and in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel, is but for the UK economy as a whole,"" he added. Last month, high gas prices forced two fertiliser factories to close, cutting supplies of carbon dioxide which is widely used in food production.

"Old Street roundabout was blocked by protesters Police have arrested 35 Insulate Britain protesters who blocked a major road in central London and a junction on the M25 during rush hour. The Old Street roundabout and junction 25 of the motorway, at Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, have reopened after long tailbacks. The Met Police said 16 arrests had been made on the M25 for obstructing the highway, with another 19 at Old Street. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps branded activists ""glued fools"". He toldLBC,external: ""It's dangerous, it's really outrageous, and actually, ironically, it probably adds to pollution as cars idle, waiting... for them to be unglued from the road."" Activists again glued themselves to roads... ... and specialist police teams removed them Mr Shapps added that he had applied for more than 100 court injunctions covering the national highway network around London and the South East, which could lead to jail terms. Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? The action marks the 12th day in the past four weeks that Insulate Britain has carried out road protests.

"Michelle and Steven Potter said they were benefiting from lower bills Using new methods to heat just six homes can have the same impact as taking 60,000 cars off the road, a housing association has said. Coastal Housing, which manages 5,000 homes in south Wales, said this demonstrated the current scale of carbon emissions from heating homes. But chief executive Debbie Green said it also showed change was possible. The heating of buildings is currently responsible for up to 10% of all Welsh emissions. But Ms Green said that over a period of 60 years there would be a reduction of 180,000kg (28,345 stone) of carbon emissions if six of their new homes were compared with traditional homes. Steven Potter, who lives in one of the homes with his wife Michelle and their son, said: ""It's totally different from where we lived before. You haven't got gas central heating here, you've got solar panels."" Wales set to build 20,000 low-carbon social homes Consumer 'confusion' threatens net zero homes plan Homes set to be heated by sewage plants in future He said it had helped the family's finances ""100%"" as their monthly bills were now about Â£43 a month - less than half of what energy regulator Ofgem calculates as the average dual fuel bill (Â£95). Mrs Potter said: ""We couldn't be happier."" She said their son suffered with asthma, which had been ""really bad"" in their previous home because it was damp. ""Since we've lived here I'm hardly giving him any asthma pumps which is really beneficial for his health. It's really good,"" she said. The Welsh government has set a target for 20,000 low-carbon houses to be built for social rent before the next Senedd elections. It has said it wants thepublic sector to be carbon neutral by 2030,external. Policy makers are encouraging the installation of better insulation so less energy is lost into the atmosphere. They are also looking at new ways to build homes so the materials used and the way homes are built has less of an impact on the environment. Most homes in Wales are older, traditionally built and dependent on fossil fuels like oil and gas for heating. Under floor insulation made from recycled glass bottles Ifan Glyn, Wales director at the Federation Of Master Builders, said: ""The task of improving the energy efficiency of 1.4 million Welsh homes could provide local builders with a once-in-a-generation opportunity as they are ideally placed to carry out the work. ""To be in a position to make the most of this opportunity, builders will need to see a clear and enticing pipeline of work. ""They will also need information and guidance on the skills required and be able to acquire these skills cost-effectively and within their own communities."" Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet it's climate targets? He added that retrofit works needed to become mainstream among consumers by providing homeowners with better guidance and financial incentives. Coastal Housing Association's homes in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, were built using Welsh larch wood, used recycled paper as insulation, and were fitted with solar panels to produce electricity to run the house. ""These six homes save, over 60 years, 180,000 kilograms of carbon - which is the equivalent of planting two million trees or taking 60,000 cars off the road,"" said Ms Green. ""It's not just about housing people. There will be new jobs required for the people fitting these productsâ¦ This is going to create jobs that lots of people will be able to do or their children will be able to train in and do when they leave school."" Nigel Jarvis's company has been using sheep wool in insulation Ty-Mawr Lime, near Brecon in Powys, has been developing a range of natural products to insulate or improve older houses. Established more than 25 years ago by Joyce and Nigel Gervis, the company now employs 26 people. They are the only company in the UK using Welsh wool to make insulation. The wool is washed and made into insulation that reduces noise, keeps in heat and allows a building to ""breathe"". ""I'm a sheep farmer's daughter so wanted to do something with wool insulation and started to discover then, 30 years ago, that in New Zealand they were actually making insulation from sheep's wool and we thought, 'that's fantastic',"" said Joyce Gervis. By using Welsh wool they believed they could increase farmers' incomes and be more environmentally friendly. ""A lot of what we are looking at now are earth mortars, stuff that's coming out of the ground, what can we use that's actually there,"" added Nigel Gervis.

"Sir Dave ran Tesco until late last year Boris Johnson has appointed former Tesco chief executive Sir David Lewis to advise it on how to fix the supply chain crisis that has led to petrol and other shortages. It comes as the Office for National Statistics found one in six UK adults said they had been unable to buy essential foods in the last fortnight. The recent fuel crisis was caused in part by a shortage of lorry drivers. Brexit and the pandemic have both contributed to labour shortages. The ONS found that 17% of adults said they had not been able to buy essential food items because they were not available, and almost a quarter (23%) said the same for non-essential food items. What's in short supply and why? Why is there an HGV driver shortage? 'Customers will go elsewhere and won't come back' The government said businesses had faced a range of challenges over recent months as they recovered from the coronavirus pandemic which has affected supply chains across Europe and around the world. Mr Johnson said: ""There are currently global supply issues which we are working with industry to mitigate, and Dave brings a wealth of experience which will help us continue to protect our businesses and supply chains."" A statement said this would include ""both identifying the causes of current blockages and pre-empting potential future ones, and advising on resolutions either through direct government action or through industry with government support"". Shoppers have been unable to buy some of their usual items Sir Dave left the supermarket giant in September last year after helping mend its fortunes following a major accounting scandal. He has been appointed until the end of the year and will start work in his new role on Monday. Many businesses in the UK have been reporting supply chain issues. A shortage of HGV drivers and specialised workers has led to gaps on supermarket shelves and problems with fuel supplies failing to reach petrol forecourts. The body representing the road haulage industry has estimatedthere is currently a shortfall of about 100,000drivers, although it said there was already a significant shortage of drivers before the pandemic and Brexit. Changes to the way drivers are taxed has also put some off. On Thursday, a trade body representing thousands of fuel retailers called for an independent inquiry into the continuing supply problems for petrol and diesel, which have led to panic-buying and lengthy queues. Alongside the driver shortage issues, some manufacturers have also said a global shortage of computer chips and rising shipping costs for products from China is adding to the bottleneck and extra costs. Hundreds ofcontainer ships are still queuing for access,externalto overloaded ports, mostly in the US and China.Port closures caused by Covid-19 outbreakshave further exacerbated the problem. Meanwhile, shortages of workers in food processing, hospitality and the care sector have been reported after some overseas workers returned home due to Brexit and the pandemic and chose not to return to the UK. Retailers have also said they face a struggle to ensure supplies are in place for the crucial Christmas trading period. Earlier this week, Tesco's current chief executive Ken Murphy said there would ""be bumps in the road in the run-up to Christmas"". ""We're seeing our share of challenges,"" he said. Nestle, the producer of Quality Street and Lion bars. has also said it is experiencing some supply chain problems ahead of the Christmas period. Nestle chief executive Mark Schneider said: ""Like other businesses, we are seeing some labour shortages and some transportation issues but it's our UK team's top priority to work constructively with retailers to supply them"". When asked whether he could guarantee Quality Street would be in the shops this Christmas he replied: ""We are working hard."" Farmers are warning of aChristmas turkey shortagebecause visa changes to allow labour recruitment from abroad have come too late. Some 600 pigs have already been shot and a mass cull is ""the next stage"", according to the National Pig Association (NPA), which said the sector was also experiencing staff shortages due to Brexit and Covid. The NPA said mature pigs have continued to ""back up"" on farms. The Toy Retailers Association has said shoppers may struggle to find what they want, while John Lewis says it is chartering a fleet of extra ships to make sure it has Christmas stock on time.

"Adele told Vogue her new album is about the year ""my entire life fell apart"" Adele says her new album was recorded to help her eight-year-old son understand why she and his father got divorced. ""I wanted to explain to him through this record, when he's in his twenties or thirties, who I am and why I voluntarily chose to dismantle his entire life in the pursuit of my own happiness,"" the star told Vogue. ""It made him really unhappy sometimes. And that's a real wound for me that I don't know if I'll ever be able to heal,"" she added. Adele is on the cover of both the British and American editions of Vogue The 33-year-old pop superstar has given separate interviews to Vogue'sBritish,externalandAmerican,externaleditions - her first for five years - as she prepares to release her highly anticipated fourth album. It will be titled 30 - which is the age at which she married her long-term partner Simon Konecki, and then left him. ""My entire life fell apart and I had no warning of it,"" said the singer, acknowledging that she had ""bit off a grenade"" and threw it into her marriage. On Tuesday,she released a short snippet of her forthcoming single, titled Easy On Me, which will be released in full on Friday, 15 October. Explaining the lyrics, in which she sings ""Go easy on me..."", Adele said: ""It's not like anyone's having a go at me, but it's like, I left the marriage. Be kind to me as well. ""It was the first song I wrote for the album and then I didn't write anything else for six months after because I was like, 'OK, well, I've said it all."" As she worked on the rest of the album, the music became a method of explaining things to their son Angelo when he's older, she said. One song, described by Vogue as ""an absolute belter of a relationship takedown"", is ""obviously about stuff that happened,"" Adele said, ""but I wanted to put it on the album to show Angelo what I expect him to treat his partner like, whether it be a woman or a man or whatever. ""After going through a divorce, my requirements are sky-high. There's a very big pair of shoes to fill."" Despite previous reports that the often-secretive singer had married Konecki in 2016, she told the magazine they did not tie the knot until 2018. ""The timeline the press have of my relationship, my marriage, is actually completely wrong,"" she said. ""We got married when I was 30â¦ and then I left."" She didn't reveal how long it was until they separated, but said: ""It wasn't very long.""She filed for divorce in 2019. Adele and Simon Konecki were together for several years before they married in 2018 ""It just wasn't right for me any more,"" she explained. ""I didn't want to end up like a lot of other people I knew. I wasn'tmiserablemiserable, but I would have been miserable had I not put myself first. But, yeah, nothing bad happened or anything like that."" Konecki now lives across the road from his ex-wife, and the pair share custody of Angelo. The singer told the US magazine: ""If I can reach the reason why I left, which was the pursuit of my own happiness, even though it made Angelo really unhappy - if I can find that happiness and he sees me in that happiness, then maybe I'll be able to forgive myself for it."" In the interviews, the pop superstar also addressed her weight loss, after Instagram photos of her slim figure became a talking point. ""My body's been objectified my entire career. It's not just now,"" she said. ""I understand why it's a shock. I understand why some women especially were hurt. Visually I represented a lot of women. But I'm still the same person."" She added: ""The most brutal conversations were being had by other women about my body. I was very... disappointed with that. That hurt my feelings."" The star also addressed the occasion where she was accused of cultural appropriation, by sharing a photo of her wearing a traditional African hairstyle to mark what would have been the Notting Hill Carnival in 2020. ""I could see comments being like, 'The nerve to not take it down,' which I totally get,"" she said. ""But if I take it down, it's me acting like it never happened. And it did. I totally get why people felt like it was appropriating. She said her thought process at the time had been: ""If you don't go dressed to celebrate the Jamaican culture - and in so many ways we're so entwined in that part of London - then it's a little bit like, 'What you coming for, then?'"" But with hindsight she admitted: ""I didn't read the... room.""

"Fellow politicians have paid tribute to Tory MP James Brokenshire, who has died aged 53, having been diagnosed with lung cancer more than three years ago. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the father of three, a former Northern Ireland secretary, as the ""nicest, kindest"" colleague. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called him ""a thoroughly decent man"". Mr Brokenshire, a lifelong non-smoker, stood down as a Home Office minister earlier this year. He died in hospital on Thursday night, having been admitted after his condition deteriorated. An MP since 2005, Mr Brokenshire served in government under three prime ministers - David Cameron, Theresa May and Mr Johnson. House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has ordered that flags in Parliament's New Palace Yard be flown at half-mast to mark ""a profound loss to us all"". Minister steps back from role for cancer surgery Brokenshire in lung cancer awareness call Mrs May tweeted: ""Truly saddened by the death of James Brokenshire. He was an outstanding public servant, a talented minister and a loyal friend."" And Mr Johnson tweeted that it was ""desperately sad"", adding: ""James was the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians but also extraordinarily effective."" Mr Brokenshire, who was MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup in Kent, resigned as Northern Ireland secretary in January 2018 following his lung cancer diagnosis, but made a comeback to the cabinet a few months later as housing secretary. He lost that job in July 2019, after Mr Johnson took over from Mrs May in 10 Downing Street.

The family also thanked NHS staff, including those at Guy's & St Thomas' hospital in London, for treating Mr Brokenshire ""with such warmth, diligence and professionalism over the past three-and-a-half years"". They also shared a memorial page on his Twitter feed, which encouraged people to share memories and photos of Mr Brokenshire and to donate to the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation in lieu of flowers. ""In the last few years of his life James's passion was to help others with lung cancer, preventing others going through what he did,"" the memorial page said, describing him as an ""indefatigable campaigner for better lung cancer screening"".

Fellow Conservative MP Karen Bradley told the BBC News Channel the news of her ""understated"" friend's death was ""heartbreaking"", adding: ""I can't believe I'm not going to be able to sit down with James again and have a laugh about life, and chat about the issues that we both cared about.

"Old Street roundabout was blocked by protesters Police have arrested 35 Insulate Britain protesters who blocked a major road in central London and a junction on the M25 during rush hour. The Old Street roundabout and junction 25 of the motorway, at Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, have reopened after long tailbacks. The Met Police said 16 arrests had been made on the M25 for obstructing the highway, with another 19 at Old Street. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps branded activists ""glued fools"". He toldLBC,external: ""It's dangerous, it's really outrageous, and actually, ironically, it probably adds to pollution as cars idle, waiting... for them to be unglued from the road."" Activists again glued themselves to roads... ... and specialist police teams removed them Mr Shapps added that he had applied for more than 100 court injunctions covering the national highway network around London and the South East, which could lead to jail terms. Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? The action marks the 12th day in the past four weeks that Insulate Britain has carried out road protests.

"Newcastle fans gathered outside St James' Park on Thursday to celebrate the takeover The fiancee of murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi has said the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover of Newcastle United is ""heartbreaking"" for her. Khashoggi, a critic of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was killed while visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Western intelligence agencies believe the crown prince ordered the murder - which he denies. ""I am very disappointed,"" said Hatice Cengiz, who was set to marry Khashoggi. ""What I've been doing since his murder is seeking justice for Jamal every day, every chance that I found or every place I can go and ask more. ""Then suddenly, I saw the news and people were talking about the takeover and I said 'please, do not do that, please be respectful to yourself'."" Watch: Hatice Cengiz speaks to 5 Live Breakfast The Premier Leagueapproved the Â£305m takeoverof Newcastle after receiving ""legally binding assurances"" that the Saudi state would not control the club. The Public Investment Fund (PIF), of which Mohammed bin Salman is the chair, will provide 80% of funds for the deal and is seen as separate to the state. The Saudi Arabian state has been accused of human rights abuses, but with the majority owner PIF deemed a separate entity, that, and any piracy issues, were no longer an impediment to the takeover, in the Premier League's view.

""It seems like they [Newcastle fans] don't care about what happened to Jamal, they just care about the financial future,"" added Cengiz,speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live Breakfast. ""I want to remind them that there is something more important than money, that there is something more important than the financial situation of this club. ""There are really more expensive values that we have and we need in our life always. ""You should send the message to them that they cannot buy any English team because of this crime - it is the clear message that every English person should send them."" She added: ""We have to remind them of what they did to Jamal, because no-one was held accountable, so in other ways we should punish them.

"Engineering and construction are among the sectors with the highest rate of vacancies Job vacancies are nearing an all-time high and Scotland has seen a surge in employment, despite warnings that the number of candidates has ""plummeted"". The Royal Bank of Scotland's report on jobs recorded the third-sharpest growth of new appointments on record. But the survey of businesses in September found the second-fastest decline of applicants for permanent jobs since records began in 2008. Firms cited Brexit and pandemic uncertainty as the key factors. Candidates for temporary jobs decreased for the seventh consecutive month, although the decline slowed from the substantial drop in August, according to the bank's report. Scottish payroll numbers climb by 17,000 Recruitment of staff 'still rising sharply' Starting salaries for people in new jobs and the hourly rate for temporary workers both rose once again, although so did the rate of inflation. The industries with the highest rate of vacancies were the IT and computing sectors, followed by engineering and construction, and then the accountancy and financial sectors. Meanwhile, the hotel and catering industries had the fastest rise in demand for temporary staff, followed by IT and computing. Companies blamed Brexit and Covid for the decline in applicants for permanent jobs Scottish government External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson toldBBC Good Morning Scotlandthat Brexit was to blame for much of the challenges in the labour market. He said: ""It's part of the more general population challenge that we have in Scotland, it's that Brexit has turned off the tap, seen a significant number of people return to the European continent, and there are simply not enough people living here to fill important roles in our economy. ""The UK government is pretending that this is not a serious problem and is certainly denying that Brexit has a significant role in it."" Mr Robertson met immigration minister Kevin Foster this week, but said he refused to agree to any of the ""top level"" requests from the Scottish government, including a 24-month worker visa programme. Boris Johnson has previously said he is ""not worried"" about the current jobs gap and rising prices in the UK, sayingsupply chains will sort themselves out ""rapidly"". The prime minister has said the economy was facing the ""stresses and strains"" of a post-Covid recovery. Food businesses have faced challenges trying to recruit workers The Royal Bank of Scotland said labour shortages were likely to become more pronounced over the coming months, possibly posing ""significant challenges"" for companies hoping to fill roles and expand their operations. The bank's chief economist Sebastian Burnside, said: ""Scotland saw a further rapid uplift in hiring activity during September, with the rates of increase in both permanent placements and temp billings easing only slightly from the all-time records seen in August. ""This rounded off a third quarter of unprecedented hiring activity as the Scottish labour market continues to rebound. ""Meanwhile, vacancies for both short-term and permanent staff rose at near-record rates during September, but recruiters widely reported skills shortages as the supply of candidates continued to plummet.""

"Households will again see ""significant rises"" in energy prices next spring, regulator Ofgem has warned. Its chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said the price cap, which limits how much energy providers can charge per unit, would go up again because of the ""unprecedented"" rise in gas prices. The cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April. Natural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. As a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it. Last month, nine of those companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers. Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Ofgem's Mr Brearley told the BBC that the price cap was there to stop firms making unfair profits, but ""legitimate costs have to be passed through"". He said it was too early to say how much the rise in April would be or whether Ofgem would have to review the price cap more frequently in future. However, he added that the regulator might have to look at the formula according to which the cap was set. His warning comes as domestic customers are still reeling from the latest price cap increase, which took effect for households in England, Scotland and Wales this month. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain. The energy crisis falls into three broad stages for UK consumers and businesses. Firstly, the here and now. Domestic customers have seen a rise in direct debit demands and bills from suppliers. They are, however, protected from the extreme cost of gas on the wholesale markets by the price cap. Businesses are not. Many are seeing instant and large increases in their energy bills. Secondly, as Ofgem confirms, significantly higher energy prices in the spring are inevitable, potentially adding hundreds of pounds to an annual household bill. That is something which customers can do nothing to stop. Thirdly, a review by the regulator will consider the extent to which the price cap protects customers versus the extra burden it places on all bill payers picking up the cost if the cap causes suppliers to fold. At any point in this process, the government can step in. Thus far, it has shown little appetite to do so. When the price cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills. That was the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a Â£153 increase. The next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February, but will come into force in April. Even if wholesale gas prices were to drop significantly from now, the extra costs that suppliers have had to shoulder in the last couple of months means a steep rise in household bills in April is inevitable. Analysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by Â£400, meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay about Â£1,660 a year. On Thursday, National Energy Action, a charity, said that between 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households could be hit by fuel poverty next year. Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is to hold talks later on Friday with representatives of industries which have the heaviest energy consumption, such as steel, cement and chemicals. While the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices. They have called for government help to control costs and keep plants open. The UK has lower levels of gas stored than many other European countries, making it more exposed to global price volatility. Mr Kwarteng said on Twitter protecting consumers from rising global gas prices was ""his top priority"". His meeting with the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) will include representative bodies UK Steel, the Chemical Industries Association, the Confederation of Paper Industries, the Mineral Products Association, the British Glass Manufacturers Federation, the British Ceramic Confederation, BOC, Air Products and the Major Energy Users Council. Ahead of the meeting, the director of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, told the BBC that the government needed to step in to help industries cope with the rising cost of energy. ""If the government does nothing, then tomorrow there'll be a steel crisis, and in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel, is but for the UK economy as a whole,"" he added.

"Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford outlines his Covid winter plan, saying he expects businesses to stay open He says he hopes this Christmas will be more like we're used to but warns coronavirus is not over Travel firms have welcomed the latest relaxation of quarantine rules, as 47 countries are taken off the UK's ""red list"" The government is planning to replace expensive day two PCR tests with lateral flow tests for travel to the UK This change will be in place ""hopefully in time"" for those returning from half-term trips, the transport secretary says Grant Shapps adds it will ""certainly"" be in place by the end of this month but Drakeford says he's very concerned by the change People are being urged to get their flu jab amid concerns it will be the first winter that Covid and flu circulate fully The UK has eased travel restrictions for fully vaccinated Indians who have received a UK-approved jab Edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke That's all from our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. This live page has been written by Doug Faulkner and Jo Couzens, and edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke. Thank you for joining us. ...here are some of the headlines from around the world before we bring our coverage to an end for the day. There have been protests and tributes to the dead in Brazil, where the number of pandemic-related deaths has reached 600,000 We've been bringing you the news today that the number of countries on the UK's red list will be cut to seven on Monday, with 47 destinations - including South Africa, Mexico, Thailand, Brazil and Costa Rica - removed. The amber and green lists have already been scrapped and rules for testing relaxed. As we've been reporting, anyone coming from a non-red list country won't need to self-isolate if they can show a full vaccination certificate, recognised by the UK. But all arrivals will still need to take a test on day two. However, the government says it will change the requirement so travellers could use the cheaper lateral flow test rather than the more expensive PCR before the end of October. As we've been reporting, Welsh First minister Mark Drakeford has said he is very concerned about the planned changes to testing - but adds it will be difficult for Wales not to follow suit as many Welsh travellers use English airports when arriving back from trips abroad. Read more Health officials are urging people in the UK to get a flu vaccination before winter. More than 40 million people will be offered the jab, amid fears the months ahead could see a surge in flu alongside a rise in Covid cases. For most people in England, the flu vaccine will be be offered via GPs, midwives and schools. Eligible patients can also book an appointment at a pharmacy. But who will be eligible to get a free flu jab - and what about the rest of the UK? Reality Check President Joe Biden says the tough regulations he put in place
for federal government workers and those in larger private companies to be
vaccinated are paying off. In a speech yesterday in Chicago, Biden said the
imposition of ""vaccination requirements results in more people getting
vaccinated"". From the end of July, all US federal workers have been
required either to be vaccinated or undergo regular testing.  And in
September this was extended to cover companies with more than 100 employees. However, US vaccination data presents a more complicated picture than Biden suggests. When the new rules were imposed on federal workers in July, vaccinations were already on an upward trend which continued largely unchanged following the introduction of the policy. When the policy was widened to include large private companies in September, there was a brief uptick mid-month but the prevailing falling trend then continued following this spike. So there is little to suggest from the US governmentâs own data that the introduction of tougher government requirements has had a significant impact on the overall rate of vaccination across the US. Vaccinations have begun to pick up in recent weeks and currently about 850,000 doses a day are being administered. England football manager Gareth Southgate has suggested medical confidentiality is the
reason for his players not publicly sharing whether they have had the Covid vaccine. ""There's a thing called medical confidentiality which seems to be being totally overlooked in a lot of areas at the moment,"" Southgate says, on the eve of England's World Cup qualifier against Andorra. ""These aren't our players. I don't think the clubs would thank us for sharing that sort of information and frankly, it is personal to the players."" Last week Southgate said he did not know how many of the team had received both doses. Fewer than half of players at most Premier League and English Football League clubs are vaccinated. Earlier this monthit was announcedPremier League players are only allowed to travel to UK-designated ""red-list"" nations to represent their countries in this month's World Cup qualifiers if they are fully vaccinated. The government has since announced the red list will be cut to just seven countries from Monday. However - and contrary to some media reports - BBC Sport understands Fifa does not want any player to be prevented from playing in the Qatar 2022 World Cup because of their vaccination status, and is looking into alternatives to being fully vaccinated, including proof of recovery from Covid-19 or negative tests. Read more:Why are some footballers vaccine hesitant and what happens next? There have been 36,060 confirmed Covid cases reported across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to the latest figures. This is a slight fall from Thursday's UK-wide figure of 40,701 but a rise on last Friday's 35,577. A further 127 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported - taking the total by that measure to 137,541. Both the cases and deaths figures from Wales have not been included in today's data due to a network issue, according to the government. A further 33,029 people received a first Covid jab on Thursday while 28,656 received their second dose. We've just brought you the news that the UK government is lifting its travel advisories for a further 51 countries. It says the change will make it easier for people to buy travel insurance for a wider range of destinations. Theupdate means the Foreign Office is no longer advising against travelto non-red list countries on Covid-19 grounds - except in
exceptional circumstances, such as if the local healthcare system is
overwhelmed. Travellers should still check its advice on entry requirements for their destination, including any proof of
vaccination they may need, as well as testing and quarantine rules, it adds. The US added a disappointing 194,000 jobs in September, as the Delta variant of coronavirus continued to drag on the economy, official figures show. The unemployment rate meanwhile fell from 5.2% in August to 4.8%. There were notable job gains in hospitality, retail and transportation, while employment in education declined,the US Bureau of Labor Statistics says,external. Yet the unemployment rate is still considerably higher than it was before the pandemic began. Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: ""Investors will be disappointed by today's data, particularly as there has been much more positive economic data issued recently."" Read more in our story. The UK's government announces it will lift its advice against all but essential travel to a further 51 countries and territories. They include the Bahamas, Jamaica, Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Indonesia, Mexico, the Seychelles, South Africa and Thailand. This follows the removal of travel advisories to 32 countries on Wednesday. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the updates will make travel abroad easier - ""boosting trade, tourism and reuniting friends and families"". She says: ""I am delighted that the safe reopening of travel allows people to exercise personal responsibility and visit more destinations across the globe."" A director of public health is advising people to isolate if they have Covid-19 symptoms, even if they subsequently receive a negative PCR test result. GPs in the West say they are seeing ""a stream of patients"" who receive a positive lateral flow test and go on to receive negative PCR results. The UK Health Security Agency says it is investigating the cause. While it is understood lateral flow tests can sometimes produce a false negative, false positives are much rarer. The UK Health Security Agency says it has been made aware of ""some areas across the country"" anecdotally reporting positive lateral flow results with subsequent negative PCR tests. It adds there is currently no evidence of there being any technical issues with lateral flow tests or PCR test kits in relation to those reports. Read more here Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Just under 7% of children in
school years 7 to 11 in England had coronavirus in the week up to 2 October,
according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Thatâs
the highest rate recorded for this age group and, while most age groups are
falling, their parentsâ age group (the 35 to 49-year-olds) are seeing slight
rises too in these figures. The ONS data only covers up to last Saturday and thereâs reason to hope from the more up-to-date data from daily testing. That data suggests thatboth have seen rates flattenand maybe even fall. Overall, about 940,000 people in
the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus, or one in 70 people. Thatâs
up on the previous week and driven by rises in England. Scotland and Northern
Ireland are both seeing falls, according to the ONS. Novavax trial volunteers Darren Green and his wife, Linda, are ""delighted"" they will be offered two doses of an approved vaccine Darren Green, 51, and his wife Linda, 59, who live in south Wales, werevolunteers in the Novavax trial. Linda was given a placebo rather than the vaccine and has since received two doses of an MHRA-approved Covid jab, meaning she is now free to travel. Darren, however, is not, because he received Novavax in the trial. He says it is a relief to know he can now get an approved vaccine. ""I felt a bit emotional when I heard the news. It's a big weight off my mind,"" he says. ""I'll be able to go out and do what other vaccinated people can. We have a trip planned with friends. I thought I was going to have to cancel."" On the prospect of needing more doses, he said: ""Apart from feeling a bit like a pin cushion, I'm absolutely delighted."" People who took part in trials of coronavirus vaccines that have not yet been approved will be offered two doses of another vaccine from next week, health officials say. This means more than 15,000 volunteers who received Novavax or other jabs will finally be able to travel abroad. People who signed up to Covid vaccine trials are recognised as fully-vaccinated in the UK - even if the vaccine has not been approved. But many other countries are not allowing them to enter. The NHS Covid app will be altered to permit the volunteers to travel after they've had their extra two doses. The move, announced by the Department of Health in England, has been developed with the help of the UK's vaccine committee and investigators who worked on the clinical trials. Read more England's R rate -the speed at which coronavirus spreads,external- has risen slightly and is estimated to be between 0.9 to 1.1. A value below one means the number of cases are falling, while a value over one means infections are increasing. It means that on average, every 10 people who are infected will pass the virus on to between nine and 11 other people in England. The growth rate of infections is estimated to be between -1% to +2% per day. Last week the R rate was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.1, with a growth rate of -3% to +1% per day. Prof Peter Johnson spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital A professor who recovered from Covid is to sing a new piece of choral music based on the diaries of the hospital nurses who treated him when he was in intensive care. Prof Peter Johnstone, 72, spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge last year. Vision Of A Garden will be performed at the Royal Festival Hall on 24 October - and Prof Johnstone will be one of the singers at the premiere. Clinical nurse Jill Hyde says the piece of music was ""a huge boost to staff morale"". Prof Johnstone, a professor of maths at St John's College, Cambridge, was the first Covid patient admitted to the hospital's Neurosciences and Trauma Critical Care Unit. Often unconscious, he was cared for round the clock for 75 days by hundreds of health care workers, Addenbrooke's said. Read more Christmas 2021 will be more like ""the ones that we're used to"" if nothing unexpected happens, the Welsh First Minister says. ""The most likely scenario in our control plan says that we ought to be able to get through the autumn and the winter with restrictions at the sort of level, we have at the moment,"" Mark Drakeford says. ""That would be very different to last Christmas, far more like the sort of Christmases we were used to. ""All that does depend on us all doing the things that keep us safe, coming forward for vaccination and the simple things that we've learned to do together. ""Then, if nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to."" Across Scotland, hospitals are dealing with thousands more pre-school patients than before the pandemic, figures reveal. Although the cause is unclear, it coincides with an unseasonal surge in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). According to aPublic Health Scotland report,external, a ""high"" level of RSV detections have been reported - and most were among children under five. Typically case numbers peak in winter but week-on-week rises have been recorded since the summer. RSV is a very common virus and almost all children are infected with it by the time they are two years old. Read more. As well as talking about winter plans Mark Drakeford says he's ""very concerned"" about the UK government's plans to change the testing rules for people returning from overseas. By the end of October, fully vaccinated people travelling to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival. Instead, they'll be able to take a lateral flow test. Wales' First Minister says the PCR tests allow variants to be traced and he ""wasnât clear"" how lateral flow tests could be used in the same way. He says there is ""a risk that we are lowering protections"". Drakeford adds it is ""very difficult"" for Wales not to follow the UK governmentâs plans as many travellers use airports in England to travel abroad.

A&E waiting times have been at record levels since mid-August. Most health boards have cancelled routine operations to make space for Covid patients and the seriously ill. Bed blocking has also been an issue for the ERI, with more than 100 elderly patients waiting to be discharged in recent days. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"Households will again see ""significant rises"" in energy prices next spring, regulator Ofgem has warned. Its chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said the price cap, which limits how much energy providers can charge per unit, would go up again because of the ""unprecedented"" rise in gas prices. The cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April. Natural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. As a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it. Last month, nine of those companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers. Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Ofgem's Mr Brearley told the BBC that the price cap was there to stop firms making unfair profits, but ""legitimate costs have to be passed through"". He said it was too early to say how much the rise in April would be or whether Ofgem would have to review the price cap more frequently in future. However, he added that the regulator might have to look at the formula according to which the cap was set. His warning comes as domestic customers are still reeling from the latest price cap increase, which took effect for households in England, Scotland and Wales this month. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain. The energy crisis falls into three broad stages for UK consumers and businesses. Firstly, the here and now. Domestic customers have seen a rise in direct debit demands and bills from suppliers.

Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a Â£153 increase. The next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February, but will come into force in April. Even if wholesale gas prices were to drop significantly from now, the extra costs that suppliers have had to shoulder in the last couple of months means a steep rise in household bills in April is inevitable. Analysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by Â£400, meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay about Â£1,660 a year. On Thursday, National Energy Action, a charity, said that between 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households could be hit by fuel poverty next year. Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is to hold talks later on Friday with representatives of industries which have the heaviest energy consumption, such as steel, cement and chemicals. While the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices. They have called for government help to control costs and keep plants open. The UK has lower levels of gas stored than many other European countries, making it more exposed to global price volatility. Mr Kwarteng said on Twitter protecting consumers from rising global gas prices was ""his top priority"". His meeting with the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) will include representative bodies UK Steel, the Chemical Industries Association, the Confederation of Paper Industries, the Mineral Products Association, the British Glass Manufacturers Federation, the British Ceramic Confederation, BOC, Air Products and the Major Energy Users Council. Ahead of the meeting, the director of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, told the BBC that the government needed to step in to help industries cope with the rising cost of energy. ""If the government does nothing, then tomorrow there'll be a steel crisis, and in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel, is but for the UK economy as a whole,"" he added. Last month, high gas prices forced two fertiliser factories to close, cutting supplies of carbon dioxide which is widely used in food production.

"Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford outlines his Covid winter plan, saying he expects businesses to stay open He says he hopes this Christmas will be more like we're used to but warns coronavirus is not over Travel firms have welcomed the latest relaxation of quarantine rules, as 47 countries are taken off the UK's ""red list"" The government is planning to replace expensive day two PCR tests with lateral flow tests for travel to the UK This change will be in place ""hopefully in time"" for those returning from half-term trips, the transport secretary says Grant Shapps adds it will ""certainly"" be in place by the end of this month but Drakeford says he's very concerned by the change People are being urged to get their flu jab amid concerns it will be the first winter that Covid and flu circulate fully The UK has eased travel restrictions for fully vaccinated Indians who have received a UK-approved jab Edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke That's all from our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. This live page has been written by Doug Faulkner and Jo Couzens, and edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke. Thank you for joining us. ...here are some of the headlines from around the world before we bring our coverage to an end for the day. There have been protests and tributes to the dead in Brazil, where the number of pandemic-related deaths has reached 600,000 We've been bringing you the news today that the number of countries on the UK's red list will be cut to seven on Monday, with 47 destinations - including South Africa, Mexico, Thailand, Brazil and Costa Rica - removed. The amber and green lists have already been scrapped and rules for testing relaxed. As we've been reporting, anyone coming from a non-red list country won't need to self-isolate if they can show a full vaccination certificate, recognised by the UK. But all arrivals will still need to take a test on day two. However, the government says it will change the requirement so travellers could use the cheaper lateral flow test rather than the more expensive PCR before the end of October. As we've been reporting, Welsh First minister Mark Drakeford has said he is very concerned about the planned changes to testing - but adds it will be difficult for Wales not to follow suit as many Welsh travellers use English airports when arriving back from trips abroad. Read more Health officials are urging people in the UK to get a flu vaccination before winter. More than 40 million people will be offered the jab, amid fears the months ahead could see a surge in flu alongside a rise in Covid cases. For most people in England, the flu vaccine will be be offered via GPs, midwives and schools. Eligible patients can also book an appointment at a pharmacy. But who will be eligible to get a free flu jab - and what about the rest of the UK? Reality Check President Joe Biden says the tough regulations he put in place
for federal government workers and those in larger private companies to be
vaccinated are paying off. In a speech yesterday in Chicago, Biden said the
imposition of ""vaccination requirements results in more people getting
vaccinated"". From the end of July, all US federal workers have been
required either to be vaccinated or undergo regular testing.  And in
September this was extended to cover companies with more than 100 employees. However, US vaccination data presents a more complicated picture than Biden suggests. When the new rules were imposed on federal workers in July, vaccinations were already on an upward trend which continued largely unchanged following the introduction of the policy. When the policy was widened to include large private companies in September, there was a brief uptick mid-month but the prevailing falling trend then continued following this spike. So there is little to suggest from the US governmentâs own data that the introduction of tougher government requirements has had a significant impact on the overall rate of vaccination across the US. Vaccinations have begun to pick up in recent weeks and currently about 850,000 doses a day are being administered. England football manager Gareth Southgate has suggested medical confidentiality is the
reason for his players not publicly sharing whether they have had the Covid vaccine. ""There's a thing called medical confidentiality which seems to be being totally overlooked in a lot of areas at the moment,"" Southgate says, on the eve of England's World Cup qualifier against Andorra. ""These aren't our players. I don't think the clubs would thank us for sharing that sort of information and frankly, it is personal to the players."" Last week Southgate said he did not know how many of the team had received both doses. Fewer than half of players at most Premier League and English Football League clubs are vaccinated. Earlier this monthit was announcedPremier League players are only allowed to travel to UK-designated ""red-list"" nations to represent their countries in this month's World Cup qualifiers if they are fully vaccinated. The government has since announced the red list will be cut to just seven countries from Monday. However - and contrary to some media reports - BBC Sport understands Fifa does not want any player to be prevented from playing in the Qatar 2022 World Cup because of their vaccination status, and is looking into alternatives to being fully vaccinated, including proof of recovery from Covid-19 or negative tests. Read more:Why are some footballers vaccine hesitant and what happens next? There have been 36,060 confirmed Covid cases reported across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to the latest figures. This is a slight fall from Thursday's UK-wide figure of 40,701 but a rise on last Friday's 35,577. A further 127 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported - taking the total by that measure to 137,541. Both the cases and deaths figures from Wales have not been included in today's data due to a network issue, according to the government. A further 33,029 people received a first Covid jab on Thursday while 28,656 received their second dose. We've just brought you the news that the UK government is lifting its travel advisories for a further 51 countries. It says the change will make it easier for people to buy travel insurance for a wider range of destinations. Theupdate means the Foreign Office is no longer advising against travelto non-red list countries on Covid-19 grounds - except in
exceptional circumstances, such as if the local healthcare system is
overwhelmed. Travellers should still check its advice on entry requirements for their destination, including any proof of
vaccination they may need, as well as testing and quarantine rules, it adds. The US added a disappointing 194,000 jobs in September, as the Delta variant of coronavirus continued to drag on the economy, official figures show. The unemployment rate meanwhile fell from 5.2% in August to 4.8%. There were notable job gains in hospitality, retail and transportation, while employment in education declined,the US Bureau of Labor Statistics says,external. Yet the unemployment rate is still considerably higher than it was before the pandemic began. Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: ""Investors will be disappointed by today's data, particularly as there has been much more positive economic data issued recently."" Read more in our story. The UK's government announces it will lift its advice against all but essential travel to a further 51 countries and territories. They include the Bahamas, Jamaica, Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Indonesia, Mexico, the Seychelles, South Africa and Thailand. This follows the removal of travel advisories to 32 countries on Wednesday. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the updates will make travel abroad easier - ""boosting trade, tourism and reuniting friends and families"". She says: ""I am delighted that the safe reopening of travel allows people to exercise personal responsibility and visit more destinations across the globe."" A director of public health is advising people to isolate if they have Covid-19 symptoms, even if they subsequently receive a negative PCR test result. GPs in the West say they are seeing ""a stream of patients"" who receive a positive lateral flow test and go on to receive negative PCR results. The UK Health Security Agency says it is investigating the cause. While it is understood lateral flow tests can sometimes produce a false negative, false positives are much rarer. The UK Health Security Agency says it has been made aware of ""some areas across the country"" anecdotally reporting positive lateral flow results with subsequent negative PCR tests. It adds there is currently no evidence of there being any technical issues with lateral flow tests or PCR test kits in relation to those reports. Read more here Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Just under 7% of children in
school years 7 to 11 in England had coronavirus in the week up to 2 October,
according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Thatâs
the highest rate recorded for this age group and, while most age groups are
falling, their parentsâ age group (the 35 to 49-year-olds) are seeing slight
rises too in these figures. The ONS data only covers up to last Saturday and thereâs reason to hope from the more up-to-date data from daily testing. That data suggests thatboth have seen rates flattenand maybe even fall. Overall, about 940,000 people in
the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus, or one in 70 people. Thatâs
up on the previous week and driven by rises in England. Scotland and Northern
Ireland are both seeing falls, according to the ONS. Novavax trial volunteers Darren Green and his wife, Linda, are ""delighted"" they will be offered two doses of an approved vaccine Darren Green, 51, and his wife Linda, 59, who live in south Wales, werevolunteers in the Novavax trial. Linda was given a placebo rather than the vaccine and has since received two doses of an MHRA-approved Covid jab, meaning she is now free to travel. Darren, however, is not, because he received Novavax in the trial. He says it is a relief to know he can now get an approved vaccine. ""I felt a bit emotional when I heard the news. It's a big weight off my mind,"" he says. ""I'll be able to go out and do what other vaccinated people can. We have a trip planned with friends. I thought I was going to have to cancel."" On the prospect of needing more doses, he said: ""Apart from feeling a bit like a pin cushion, I'm absolutely delighted."" People who took part in trials of coronavirus vaccines that have not yet been approved will be offered two doses of another vaccine from next week, health officials say. This means more than 15,000 volunteers who received Novavax or other jabs will finally be able to travel abroad. People who signed up to Covid vaccine trials are recognised as fully-vaccinated in the UK - even if the vaccine has not been approved. But many other countries are not allowing them to enter. The NHS Covid app will be altered to permit the volunteers to travel after they've had their extra two doses. The move, announced by the Department of Health in England, has been developed with the help of the UK's vaccine committee and investigators who worked on the clinical trials. Read more England's R rate -the speed at which coronavirus spreads,external- has risen slightly and is estimated to be between 0.9 to 1.1. A value below one means the number of cases are falling, while a value over one means infections are increasing. It means that on average, every 10 people who are infected will pass the virus on to between nine and 11 other people in England. The growth rate of infections is estimated to be between -1% to +2% per day. Last week the R rate was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.1, with a growth rate of -3% to +1% per day. Prof Peter Johnson spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital A professor who recovered from Covid is to sing a new piece of choral music based on the diaries of the hospital nurses who treated him when he was in intensive care. Prof Peter Johnstone, 72, spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge last year. Vision Of A Garden will be performed at the Royal Festival Hall on 24 October - and Prof Johnstone will be one of the singers at the premiere. Clinical nurse Jill Hyde says the piece of music was ""a huge boost to staff morale"". Prof Johnstone, a professor of maths at St John's College, Cambridge, was the first Covid patient admitted to the hospital's Neurosciences and Trauma Critical Care Unit. Often unconscious, he was cared for round the clock for 75 days by hundreds of health care workers, Addenbrooke's said. Read more Christmas 2021 will be more like ""the ones that we're used to"" if nothing unexpected happens, the Welsh First Minister says. ""The most likely scenario in our control plan says that we ought to be able to get through the autumn and the winter with restrictions at the sort of level, we have at the moment,"" Mark Drakeford says. ""That would be very different to last Christmas, far more like the sort of Christmases we were used to. ""All that does depend on us all doing the things that keep us safe, coming forward for vaccination and the simple things that we've learned to do together. ""Then, if nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to."" Across Scotland, hospitals are dealing with thousands more pre-school patients than before the pandemic, figures reveal. Although the cause is unclear, it coincides with an unseasonal surge in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). According to aPublic Health Scotland report,external, a ""high"" level of RSV detections have been reported - and most were among children under five. Typically case numbers peak in winter but week-on-week rises have been recorded since the summer. RSV is a very common virus and almost all children are infected with it by the time they are two years old. Read more. As well as talking about winter plans Mark Drakeford says he's ""very concerned"" about the UK government's plans to change the testing rules for people returning from overseas. By the end of October, fully vaccinated people travelling to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival. Instead, they'll be able to take a lateral flow test. Wales' First Minister says the PCR tests allow variants to be traced and he ""wasnât clear"" how lateral flow tests could be used in the same way. He says there is ""a risk that we are lowering protections"". Drakeford adds it is ""very difficult"" for Wales not to follow the UK governmentâs plans as many travellers use airports in England to travel abroad. This video can not be played Backlog in hospital cases 'will not be cleared up soon', says consultant The number of patients waiting indefinitely for NHS surgery is becoming a ""human tragedy"", a senior doctor tells BBC Scotland. Dr Caroline Whitworth, of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI), says bed occupancy in the hospital is now consistently 100% - with ""thousands"" in pain while on hold for procedures. A&E waiting times have been at record levels since mid-August. Most health boards have cancelled routine operations to make space for Covid patients and the seriously ill. Bed blocking has also been an issue for the ERI, with more than 100 elderly patients waiting to be discharged in recent days. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford outlines his Covid winter plan, saying he expects businesses to stay open He says he hopes this Christmas will be more like we're used to but warns coronavirus is not over Travel firms have welcomed the latest relaxation of quarantine rules, as 47 countries are taken off the UK's ""red list"" The government is planning to replace expensive day two PCR tests with lateral flow tests for travel to the UK This change will be in place ""hopefully in time"" for those returning from half-term trips, the transport secretary says Grant Shapps adds it will ""certainly"" be in place by the end of this month but Drakeford says he's very concerned by the change People are being urged to get their flu jab amid concerns it will be the first winter that Covid and flu circulate fully The UK has eased travel restrictions for fully vaccinated Indians who have received a UK-approved jab Edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke That's all from our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. This live page has been written by Doug Faulkner and Jo Couzens, and edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke. Thank you for joining us. ...here are some of the headlines from around the world before we bring our coverage to an end for the day. There have been protests and tributes to the dead in Brazil, where the number of pandemic-related deaths has reached 600,000 We've been bringing you the news today that the number of countries on the UK's red list will be cut to seven on Monday, with 47 destinations - including South Africa, Mexico, Thailand, Brazil and Costa Rica - removed. The amber and green lists have already been scrapped and rules for testing relaxed. As we've been reporting, anyone coming from a non-red list country won't need to self-isolate if they can show a full vaccination certificate, recognised by the UK. But all arrivals will still need to take a test on day two. However, the government says it will change the requirement so travellers could use the cheaper lateral flow test rather than the more expensive PCR before the end of October. As we've been reporting, Welsh First minister Mark Drakeford has said he is very concerned about the planned changes to testing - but adds it will be difficult for Wales not to follow suit as many Welsh travellers use English airports when arriving back from trips abroad. Read more Health officials are urging people in the UK to get a flu vaccination before winter. More than 40 million people will be offered the jab, amid fears the months ahead could see a surge in flu alongside a rise in Covid cases. For most people in England, the flu vaccine will be be offered via GPs, midwives and schools. Eligible patients can also book an appointment at a pharmacy. But who will be eligible to get a free flu jab - and what about the rest of the UK? Reality Check President Joe Biden says the tough regulations he put in place
for federal government workers and those in larger private companies to be
vaccinated are paying off. In a speech yesterday in Chicago, Biden said the
imposition of ""vaccination requirements results in more people getting
vaccinated"". From the end of July, all US federal workers have been
required either to be vaccinated or undergo regular testing.  And in
September this was extended to cover companies with more than 100 employees. However, US vaccination data presents a more complicated picture than Biden suggests. When the new rules were imposed on federal workers in July, vaccinations were already on an upward trend which continued largely unchanged following the introduction of the policy. When the policy was widened to include large private companies in September, there was a brief uptick mid-month but the prevailing falling trend then continued following this spike. So there is little to suggest from the US governmentâs own data that the introduction of tougher government requirements has had a significant impact on the overall rate of vaccination across the US. Vaccinations have begun to pick up in recent weeks and currently about 850,000 doses a day are being administered. England football manager Gareth Southgate has suggested medical confidentiality is the
reason for his players not publicly sharing whether they have had the Covid vaccine. ""There's a thing called medical confidentiality which seems to be being totally overlooked in a lot of areas at the moment,"" Southgate says, on the eve of England's World Cup qualifier against Andorra. ""These aren't our players. I don't think the clubs would thank us for sharing that sort of information and frankly, it is personal to the players."" Last week Southgate said he did not know how many of the team had received both doses. Fewer than half of players at most Premier League and English Football League clubs are vaccinated. Earlier this monthit was announcedPremier League players are only allowed to travel to UK-designated ""red-list"" nations to represent their countries in this month's World Cup qualifiers if they are fully vaccinated. The government has since announced the red list will be cut to just seven countries from Monday. However - and contrary to some media reports - BBC Sport understands Fifa does not want any player to be prevented from playing in the Qatar 2022 World Cup because of their vaccination status, and is looking into alternatives to being fully vaccinated, including proof of recovery from Covid-19 or negative tests. Read more:Why are some footballers vaccine hesitant and what happens next? There have been 36,060 confirmed Covid cases reported across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to the latest figures. This is a slight fall from Thursday's UK-wide figure of 40,701 but a rise on last Friday's 35,577. A further 127 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported - taking the total by that measure to 137,541. Both the cases and deaths figures from Wales have not been included in today's data due to a network issue, according to the government. A further 33,029 people received a first Covid jab on Thursday while 28,656 received their second dose. We've just brought you the news that the UK government is lifting its travel advisories for a further 51 countries. It says the change will make it easier for people to buy travel insurance for a wider range of destinations. Theupdate means the Foreign Office is no longer advising against travelto non-red list countries on Covid-19 grounds - except in
exceptional circumstances, such as if the local healthcare system is
overwhelmed. Travellers should still check its advice on entry requirements for their destination, including any proof of
vaccination they may need, as well as testing and quarantine rules, it adds. The US added a disappointing 194,000 jobs in September, as the Delta variant of coronavirus continued to drag on the economy, official figures show. The unemployment rate meanwhile fell from 5.2% in August to 4.8%. There were notable job gains in hospitality, retail and transportation, while employment in education declined,the US Bureau of Labor Statistics says,external. Yet the unemployment rate is still considerably higher than it was before the pandemic began. Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: ""Investors will be disappointed by today's data, particularly as there has been much more positive economic data issued recently."" Read more in our story. The UK's government announces it will lift its advice against all but essential travel to a further 51 countries and territories. They include the Bahamas, Jamaica, Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Indonesia, Mexico, the Seychelles, South Africa and Thailand. This follows the removal of travel advisories to 32 countries on Wednesday. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the updates will make travel abroad easier - ""boosting trade, tourism and reuniting friends and families"". She says: ""I am delighted that the safe reopening of travel allows people to exercise personal responsibility and visit more destinations across the globe."" A director of public health is advising people to isolate if they have Covid-19 symptoms, even if they subsequently receive a negative PCR test result. GPs in the West say they are seeing ""a stream of patients"" who receive a positive lateral flow test and go on to receive negative PCR results. The UK Health Security Agency says it is investigating the cause. While it is understood lateral flow tests can sometimes produce a false negative, false positives are much rarer. The UK Health Security Agency says it has been made aware of ""some areas across the country"" anecdotally reporting positive lateral flow results with subsequent negative PCR tests. It adds there is currently no evidence of there being any technical issues with lateral flow tests or PCR test kits in relation to those reports. Read more here Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Just under 7% of children in
school years 7 to 11 in England had coronavirus in the week up to 2 October,
according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Thatâs
the highest rate recorded for this age group and, while most age groups are
falling, their parentsâ age group (the 35 to 49-year-olds) are seeing slight
rises too in these figures. The ONS data only covers up to last Saturday and thereâs reason to hope from the more up-to-date data from daily testing. That data suggests thatboth have seen rates flattenand maybe even fall. Overall, about 940,000 people in
the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus, or one in 70 people. Thatâs
up on the previous week and driven by rises in England. Scotland and Northern
Ireland are both seeing falls, according to the ONS. Novavax trial volunteers Darren Green and his wife, Linda, are ""delighted"" they will be offered two doses of an approved vaccine Darren Green, 51, and his wife Linda, 59, who live in south Wales, werevolunteers in the Novavax trial. Linda was given a placebo rather than the vaccine and has since received two doses of an MHRA-approved Covid jab, meaning she is now free to travel. Darren, however, is not, because he received Novavax in the trial. He says it is a relief to know he can now get an approved vaccine. ""I felt a bit emotional when I heard the news. It's a big weight off my mind,"" he says. ""I'll be able to go out and do what other vaccinated people can. We have a trip planned with friends. I thought I was going to have to cancel."" On the prospect of needing more doses, he said: ""Apart from feeling a bit like a pin cushion, I'm absolutely delighted."" People who took part in trials of coronavirus vaccines that have not yet been approved will be offered two doses of another vaccine from next week, health officials say. This means more than 15,000 volunteers who received Novavax or other jabs will finally be able to travel abroad. People who signed up to Covid vaccine trials are recognised as fully-vaccinated in the UK - even if the vaccine has not been approved. But many other countries are not allowing them to enter. The NHS Covid app will be altered to permit the volunteers to travel after they've had their extra two doses. The move, announced by the Department of Health in England, has been developed with the help of the UK's vaccine committee and investigators who worked on the clinical trials. Read more England's R rate -the speed at which coronavirus spreads,external- has risen slightly and is estimated to be between 0.9 to 1.1. A value below one means the number of cases are falling, while a value over one means infections are increasing. It means that on average, every 10 people who are infected will pass the virus on to between nine and 11 other people in England. The growth rate of infections is estimated to be between -1% to +2% per day. Last week the R rate was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.1, with a growth rate of -3% to +1% per day. Prof Peter Johnson spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital A professor who recovered from Covid is to sing a new piece of choral music based on the diaries of the hospital nurses who treated him when he was in intensive care. Prof Peter Johnstone, 72, spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge last year. Vision Of A Garden will be performed at the Royal Festival Hall on 24 October - and Prof Johnstone will be one of the singers at the premiere. Clinical nurse Jill Hyde says the piece of music was ""a huge boost to staff morale"". Prof Johnstone, a professor of maths at St John's College, Cambridge, was the first Covid patient admitted to the hospital's Neurosciences and Trauma Critical Care Unit. Often unconscious, he was cared for round the clock for 75 days by hundreds of health care workers, Addenbrooke's said. Read more Christmas 2021 will be more like ""the ones that we're used to"" if nothing unexpected happens, the Welsh First Minister says. ""The most likely scenario in our control plan says that we ought to be able to get through the autumn and the winter with restrictions at the sort of level, we have at the moment,"" Mark Drakeford says. ""That would be very different to last Christmas, far more like the sort of Christmases we were used to. ""All that does depend on us all doing the things that keep us safe, coming forward for vaccination and the simple things that we've learned to do together. ""Then, if nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to."" Across Scotland, hospitals are dealing with thousands more pre-school patients than before the pandemic, figures reveal. Although the cause is unclear, it coincides with an unseasonal surge in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). According to aPublic Health Scotland report,external, a ""high"" level of RSV detections have been reported - and most were among children under five. Typically case numbers peak in winter but week-on-week rises have been recorded since the summer. RSV is a very common virus and almost all children are infected with it by the time they are two years old. Read more. As well as talking about winter plans Mark Drakeford says he's ""very concerned"" about the UK government's plans to change the testing rules for people returning from overseas. By the end of October, fully vaccinated people travelling to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival. Instead, they'll be able to take a lateral flow test. Wales' First Minister says the PCR tests allow variants to be traced and he ""wasnât clear"" how lateral flow tests could be used in the same way. He says there is ""a risk that we are lowering protections"". Drakeford adds it is ""very difficult"" for Wales not to follow the UK governmentâs plans as many travellers use airports in England to travel abroad.

Dr Caroline Whitworth, of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI), says bed occupancy in the hospital is now consistently 100% - with ""thousands"" in pain while on hold for procedures. A&E waiting times have been at record levels since mid-August. Most health boards have cancelled routine operations to make space for Covid patients and the seriously ill. Bed blocking has also been an issue for the ERI, with more than 100 elderly patients waiting to be discharged in recent days. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"Old Street roundabout was blocked by protesters Police have arrested 35 Insulate Britain protesters who blocked a major road in central London and a junction on the M25 during rush hour. The Old Street roundabout and junction 25 of the motorway, at Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, have reopened after long tailbacks. The Met Police said 16 arrests had been made on the M25 for obstructing the highway, with another 19 at Old Street. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps branded activists ""glued fools"". He toldLBC,external: ""It's dangerous, it's really outrageous, and actually, ironically, it probably adds to pollution as cars idle, waiting... for them to be unglued from the road."" Activists again glued themselves to roads... ... and specialist police teams removed them Mr Shapps added that he had applied for more than 100 court injunctions covering the national highway network around London and the South East, which could lead to jail terms. Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? The action marks the 12th day in the past four weeks that Insulate Britain has carried out road protests.

""If nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to.""

Neil Collier, owner of Colliers Photo Imaging in Uplands, Swansea, said he faced ""quite a hit"" last Christmas with ""panicked customers wondering if they were going to get their orders"".

""It's really reassuring to hear some good news finally. Shutting overnight last year was a really big shock,"" she said. ""Fingers crossed now this is good news for this Christmas."" Nikki Collier is optimistic about the months ahead Dr Richard Stanton, a virologist at Cardiff University, said the Welsh government should stick with current restrictions to ""keep a lid on transmission rates"" ahead of the winter. He said Covid-19 was now not the only concern, with other respiratory viruses such as flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - a common winter bug that can cause lung problems - likely to spread too. ""All those things will put pressure on the NHS and could result in further hospitalisations,"" he added.p What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Clubbers and businesses torn over Wales Covid pass Should my child have a Covid vaccine? Mr Drakeford confirmed there would be no changes to the current regulations for the next three weeks, beyond those already announced. Rules around care home visits will be reduced, however. Mr Drakeford said providers can now allow visitors to take lateral flow tests at home and will no longer have to socially distance in a resident's room or in a designated visiting room. Restrictions around gifts, including food and drink, will also be eased. The first minister set outtwo planning scenarios for the pandemic over the winter.,external In the first, calledCovid Stable,external, Wales remains at alert level zero through the autumn and winter, with all businesses able to open. The second,Covid Urgent,external, is designed to deal with any sudden changes to the situation. If that happens previously drawn up ""alert levels"" - including lockdown at level four - could be used as an option of last resort. ""While we do not think measures under a Covid Urgent scenario will be necessary this autumn or winter, we cannot completely rule them out,"" the plan added. All businesses are likely to be able to stay open this winter, according to the Welsh government Mr Drakeford told journalists that, should demand for PCR tests outstrip the ability to provide them during the winter, then some less-vulnerable groups would be offered lateral flow strips in the first instance. He told journalists there was no plan to charge for PCR tests, but said after the winter Wales will begin to move into an era where ""mass testing will play a less important part in the way we manage the virus"". ""We will be reserving the tests for the purposes for which they are most important"", he added. Prior to the press conference the first minister said Wales was ""facing a challenging winter ahead - coronavirus hasn't gone away and flu is forecast to return this winter."" ""Vaccination is the best defence we have against coronavirus - the more people who are fully vaccinated, the better our chances of controlling the spread of this awful virus."" He encouraged everyone who was eligible ""to have their flu jab this year"". He said he believed Wales was now past the peak of the third wave, following a decline in cases over the last few days. Mr Drakeford asked everyone to continue to wash hands and meet outdoors to reduce the transmission of coronavirus In other measures to keep Wales safe,Covid passes in nightclubs and large events will be introducedfrom Monday, following a narrow victory for the Welsh government in a knife-edge Senedd vote this week. The public will be expected to show evidence of being fully vaccinated or having a recent negative Covid test. Mr Drakeford told the BBC's Dros Frecwast programme event organisers were responsible for checking people were carrying the correct Covid passes through a spot check system,as fines were being introduced for fake ones from Monday. ""When there are lots and lots of people trying to go in, for example, there will be no need to check each one,"" he said. At the briefing, he said he expected the introduction of Covid passes would be ""relatively smooth,"" but admitted it would not be without ""teething trouble"". ""I think that the system is easy to use,"" he added. Professor of epidemiology and biostatistics Mike Gravenor, of Swansea University Medical School, has been part of the team looking at the modelling of Covid-19 in Wales. He toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast:""We're still under a situation of uncertainty. A new variant is one factor and our understanding of how long immunity lasts for, in natural immunity and in vaccinated individuals."" All the indicators are pointing to an improving position with regards to Covid - case rates have been falling for the last nine days. The spike we saw in recent weeks was driven by high numbers of under-19s, especially secondary school-age children, testing positive, ahead of vaccinations being available for this age group. The character of this third wave spike was also influenced by record numbers of lateral flow tests coming back positive, so young people were being found to have Covid, even if not displaying symptoms. Because so many infections have involved young people, while many older and vulnerable people have been double-vaccinated, we have not seen anything like the Covid cases in hospital beds. Admissions have been higher in recent weeks than some early modelling predicted as likely, but numbers of patients with Covid are coming down. On Wednesday, there were 14% fewer Covid patients in hospital beds on average than two weeks ago. We have been seeing similar numbers in critical care for more than a month and those in ICU with non-Covid conditions outnumber Covid patients by more than two to one. But hospital managers will still be concerned that there are more than 420 Covid patients in beds across Wales and bed occupancy is at 90% in acute hospitals, with the winter to come. Sadly, there are still people dying of Covid and figures from the ONS this week showed 88 deaths in Wales in the latest week. But numbers are down considerably on earlier waves - and after a spike in September, they are back within the range expected by scientists.

Mr Drakeford told the BBC's Dros Frecwast programme event organisers were responsible for checking people were carrying the correct Covid passes through a spot check system,as fines were being introduced for fake ones from Monday. ""When there are lots and lots of people trying to go in, for example, there will be no need to check each one,"" he said. At the briefing, he said he expected the introduction of Covid passes would be ""relatively smooth,"" but admitted it would not be without ""teething trouble"". ""I think that the system is easy to use,"" he added. Professor of epidemiology and biostatistics Mike Gravenor, of Swansea University Medical School, has been part of the team looking at the modelling of Covid-19 in Wales. He toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast:""We're still under a situation of uncertainty. A new variant is one factor and our understanding of how long immunity lasts for, in natural immunity and in vaccinated individuals."" All the indicators are pointing to an improving position with regards to Covid - case rates have been falling for the last nine days. The spike we saw in recent weeks was driven by high numbers of under-19s, especially secondary school-age children, testing positive, ahead of vaccinations being available for this age group. The character of this third wave spike was also influenced by record numbers of lateral flow tests coming back positive, so young people were being found to have Covid, even if not displaying symptoms. Because so many infections have involved young people, while many older and vulnerable people have been double-vaccinated, we have not seen anything like the Covid cases in hospital beds. Admissions have been higher in recent weeks than some early modelling predicted as likely, but numbers of patients with Covid are coming down. On Wednesday, there were 14% fewer Covid patients in hospital beds on average than two weeks ago. We have been seeing similar numbers in critical care for more than a month and those in ICU with non-Covid conditions outnumber Covid patients by more than two to one. But hospital managers will still be concerned that there are more than 420 Covid patients in beds across Wales and bed occupancy is at 90% in acute hospitals, with the winter to come. Sadly, there are still people dying of Covid and figures from the ONS this week showed 88 deaths in Wales in the latest week. But numbers are down considerably on earlier waves - and after a spike in September, they are back within the range expected by scientists.

"This video can not be played Care home visits will be easier, says first minister Christmas this year is likely to be more normal than in 2020, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. He said if nothing unexpected happens Wales can look forward to a holiday season ""much more like the ones we are used to"". The Welsh government said that all businesses are likely to be able to stay open this winter. But it has drawn up a""Covid Urgent"" plan,externalif a new variant risks overwhelming the NHS. In a statement setting out Wales'autumn and winter plan,external, the government said such a scenario could be the emergence of a new, fast-spreading variant or if vaccine immunity levels fall, causing a rise in pandemic pressures. But it is more likely the country will slowly move out of the pandemic, where coronavirus becomes a seasonal illness, and that businesses can stay open. Mr Drakeford said Wales remains at alert level zero, with no changes likely in the next three weeks beyond those already announced. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Q&A: What Covid rules will stay in Wales? Fines for faking Covid passes and tests in Wales At a briefing on Friday he also said it would now be easier to visit a loved one in a care home. It comes as Wales' case rates dip below 500 per 100,000 for the first time since mid-September. Mr Drakeford said in the most probable scenario ""we ought to be able to get through the autumn and the winter with restrictions at the sort of level we have at the moment. ""That would be very different to last Christmas, far more like the sort of Christmasses we were used to."" ""If nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to."" Wales went into lockdown days before Christmas last year, curtailing plans to allow more mixing over the period. Business owner Neil Collier said the news was ""reassuring"" Businesses said the news they would probably not be facing another winter lockdown was ""reassuring"". Neil Collier, owner of Colliers Photo Imaging in Uplands, Swansea, said he faced ""quite a hit"" last Christmas with ""panicked customers wondering if they were going to get their orders"". ""I think it's more security for business trade going into the winter months which is potentially our busiest period,"" he added. Last winter, Nicki Collier, who manages Bluebell Coffee and Kitchen in Tycoch, also Swansea, faced having to cancel bookings and process refunds. ""It's really reassuring to hear some good news finally. Shutting overnight last year was a really big shock,"" she said. ""Fingers crossed now this is good news for this Christmas."" Nikki Collier is optimistic about the months ahead Dr Richard Stanton, a virologist at Cardiff University, said the Welsh government should stick with current restrictions to ""keep a lid on transmission rates"" ahead of the winter. He said Covid-19 was now not the only concern, with other respiratory viruses such as flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - a common winter bug that can cause lung problems - likely to spread too. ""All those things will put pressure on the NHS and could result in further hospitalisations,"" he added.p What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Clubbers and businesses torn over Wales Covid pass Should my child have a Covid vaccine? Mr Drakeford confirmed there would be no changes to the current regulations for the next three weeks, beyond those already announced. Rules around care home visits will be reduced, however. Mr Drakeford said providers can now allow visitors to take lateral flow tests at home and will no longer have to socially distance in a resident's room or in a designated visiting room. Restrictions around gifts, including food and drink, will also be eased. The first minister set outtwo planning scenarios for the pandemic over the winter.,external In the first, calledCovid Stable,external, Wales remains at alert level zero through the autumn and winter, with all businesses able to open. The second,Covid Urgent,external, is designed to deal with any sudden changes to the situation. If that happens previously drawn up ""alert levels"" - including lockdown at level four - could be used as an option of last resort. ""While we do not think measures under a Covid Urgent scenario will be necessary this autumn or winter, we cannot completely rule them out,"" the plan added. All businesses are likely to be able to stay open this winter, according to the Welsh government Mr Drakeford told journalists that, should demand for PCR tests outstrip the ability to provide them during the winter, then some less-vulnerable groups would be offered lateral flow strips in the first instance. He told journalists there was no plan to charge for PCR tests, but said after the winter Wales will begin to move into an era where ""mass testing will play a less important part in the way we manage the virus"". ""We will be reserving the tests for the purposes for which they are most important"", he added. Prior to the press conference the first minister said Wales was ""facing a challenging winter ahead - coronavirus hasn't gone away and flu is forecast to return this winter."" ""Vaccination is the best defence we have against coronavirus - the more people who are fully vaccinated, the better our chances of controlling the spread of this awful virus."" He encouraged everyone who was eligible ""to have their flu jab this year"". He said he believed Wales was now past the peak of the third wave, following a decline in cases over the last few days. Mr Drakeford asked everyone to continue to wash hands and meet outdoors to reduce the transmission of coronavirus In other measures to keep Wales safe,Covid passes in nightclubs and large events will be introducedfrom Monday, following a narrow victory for the Welsh government in a knife-edge Senedd vote this week.

"Fellow politicians have paid tribute to Tory MP James Brokenshire, who has died aged 53, having been diagnosed with lung cancer more than three years ago. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the father of three, a former Northern Ireland secretary, as the ""nicest, kindest"" colleague. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called him ""a thoroughly decent man"". Mr Brokenshire, a lifelong non-smoker, stood down as a Home Office minister earlier this year. He died in hospital on Thursday night, having been admitted after his condition deteriorated. An MP since 2005, Mr Brokenshire served in government under three prime ministers - David Cameron, Theresa May and Mr Johnson. House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has ordered that flags in Parliament's New Palace Yard be flown at half-mast to mark ""a profound loss to us all"". Minister steps back from role for cancer surgery Brokenshire in lung cancer awareness call Mrs May tweeted: ""Truly saddened by the death of James Brokenshire. He was an outstanding public servant, a talented minister and a loyal friend."" And Mr Johnson tweeted that it was ""desperately sad"", adding: ""James was the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians but also extraordinarily effective."" Mr Brokenshire, who was MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup in Kent, resigned as Northern Ireland secretary in January 2018 following his lung cancer diagnosis, but made a comeback to the cabinet a few months later as housing secretary. He lost that job in July 2019, after Mr Johnson took over from Mrs May in 10 Downing Street. Mr Brokenshire re-entered government as a Home Office minister in February last year, but stood down in July this year, due to poor health. This video can not be played Former adviser Peter Cardwell: ""James was the best of politics and he was the best of humanity."" Following his death, Mr Brokenshire's family expressed ""deep sadness"", adding: ""James was not only a brilliant government minister... but a dedicated constituency MP. ""But most importantly, he was a loving father to his three children, a devoted husband to Cathy and a faithful friend to so many."" The family also thanked NHS staff, including those at Guy's & St Thomas' hospital in London, for treating Mr Brokenshire ""with such warmth, diligence and professionalism over the past three-and-a-half years"". They also shared a memorial page on his Twitter feed, which encouraged people to share memories and photos of Mr Brokenshire and to donate to the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation in lieu of flowers. ""In the last few years of his life James's passion was to help others with lung cancer, preventing others going through what he did,"" the memorial page said, describing him as an ""indefatigable campaigner for better lung cancer screening"". After his lung cancer diagnosis, Mr Brokenshire, a former lawyer, worked to promote greater awareness of the disease, urging people who showed symptoms to get tested. Fellow Conservative MP Karen Bradley told the BBC News Channel the news of her ""understated"" friend's death was ""heartbreaking"", adding: ""I can't believe I'm not going to be able to sit down with James again and have a laugh about life, and chat about the issues that we both cared about. ""My thoughts are with Cathy and the family, who are just the most wonderful family. I'm devastated."" James Brokenshire (right) served under Theresa May, as well as David Cameron and Boris Johnson Sir Keir Starmer tweeted: ""James Brokenshire was a thoroughly decent man, dedicated and effective in all briefs he held. ""He fought his illness with dignity and bravery. I'm incredibly sad to learn of his death and send my condolences to his wife and children."" The UK's most senior civil servant, Cabinet Secretary Simon Case, said: ""I had the personal privilege of working with him closely over a number of years and admired greatly his unwavering commitment to public service and compassion."" The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, tweeted: ""So sorry to hear of the death of James Brokenshire, whose courage and faith were an inspiration to so many, myself included."" Before becoming the Old Bexley & Sidcup MP in 2010, Mr Brokenshire represented the seat of Hornchurch and Rainham, north-east London, for five years. His death will prompt a Parliamentary by-election in Old Bexley and Sidcup, where he had a majority of 18,952 at the last general election.

"First Minister Paul Givan and Deputy First Minister Michelle joined Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin at the climate event Tackling climate change will need joined-up policies on the island of Ireland, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin has said. The Irish prime minister was speaking at an event in Belfast, where he is due to meet political leaders later. Mr Martin's visit comes as the EU and the UK prepare for intensive talks on the Northern Ireland Protocol. European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic has saidthe EU will bring forward new proposals. Mr Sefcovic told an event in Dublin that he hoped talks would begin before the end of October. He said his proposals would be ""very far reaching"" and that he hoped they would be seen as such. The taoiseach paid a visit to Women'sTec, which provides training for women in what are traditionally seen as men's jobs He also dropped into the creche at Women'sTec in north Belfast Mr Martin has visited Northern Ireland several times since he became taoiseach in the summer of 2020. During Friday's visit, he was joined by Northern Ireland's first and deputy first ministers at an event hosted by the Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry and Chambers Ireland exploring climate change. He told business leaders, just weeks ahead of theCOP26 climate conferencein Glasgow, that offshore wind would be an area of big expansion in the years ahead. ""There is no more significant and common concern for us on this island, and across these islands, than meeting the generational challenge of climate change,"" he said. ""So, to be fully effective on climate action, we need joined-up policy approaches and co-ordinated investment on a cross-border basis."" Climate bill would devastate rural economy - Poots A really simple guide to climate change Speaking ahead of their separate meeting, Ms O'Neill said she wanted to talk to Mr Martin about the EU and the British government bringing forward solutions to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Mr Martin will also visit Queen's University in Belfast. The Northern Ireland Protocol is a post-Brexit trade arrangement, which was agreed by the UK and the EU in order to avoid the reintroduction of a hard border on the island of Ireland. Why are there tensions over the NI Brexit deal? PM says NI Protocol could work if it was 'fixed' It ensures there is no need for checks along the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and was agreed as a way to protect the Good Friday Agreement by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. Unionists have said the protocol diminishes their Britishness and damages trade with other parts of the UK by creating a border in the Irish Sea. Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson saidhe believed the Northern Ireland Protocol could ""in principle work"" if it was ""fixed"". But he also did not rule out triggering Article 16 if the EU failed to come up with plans to deal with current issues. Article 16 can be triggered by either the UK or EU to suspend elements of the Brexit deal on the condition that the protocol is causing ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist, or to diversion of trade"". Brexit Minister Lord Frost has threatened to suspend parts of its deal with the EU if changes are not made. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has warned that his party may quit Stormont if its demands over the protocol are not met. Sir Jeffrey said he was ""pleased"" that the EU was to table new proposals, adding that he believed pressure from unionists had ""opened up the protocol"". It is understood the EU will offer a bespoke agri-food arrangement for Northern Ireland to try andend the so-called ""sausage wars"". It would mean chilled meats could continue to go from GB to NI beyond the current grace period. Brussels is expected to produce itsproposals on the Northern Ireland protocol on Wednesday.

"Old Street roundabout was blocked by protesters Police have arrested 35 Insulate Britain protesters who blocked a major road in central London and a junction on the M25 during rush hour. The Old Street roundabout and junction 25 of the motorway, at Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire, have reopened after long tailbacks. The Met Police said 16 arrests had been made on the M25 for obstructing the highway, with another 19 at Old Street. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps branded activists ""glued fools"". He toldLBC,external: ""It's dangerous, it's really outrageous, and actually, ironically, it probably adds to pollution as cars idle, waiting... for them to be unglued from the road."" Activists again glued themselves to roads... ... and specialist police teams removed them Mr Shapps added that he had applied for more than 100 court injunctions covering the national highway network around London and the South East, which could lead to jail terms. Why is Insulate Britain blocking roads? The action marks the 12th day in the past four weeks that Insulate Britain has carried out road protests. The activists want the government to commit to providing insulation for 29 million homes. On Tuesday,drivers clashed with protestersat the entrance to the Blackwall Tunnel where 38 people were arrested. This video can not be played Motorist: ""I need to go to the hospital, please let me pass. How can you be so selfish?"" Insulate Britain admitted that its latest action on the M25 was ""in breach"" of aninjunctionobtained by the government last month. However Tracey Mallagan, a spokeswoman for the group, said: ""If governments don't act soon to reduce emissions, we face a terrifying situation. ""We won't be worrying about shortages of pasta or loo rolls because law and order breaks down pretty quickly when there is not enough food to go round.""

"Fellow politicians have paid tribute to Tory MP James Brokenshire, who has died aged 53, having been diagnosed with lung cancer more than three years ago. Prime Minister Boris Johnson described the father of three, a former Northern Ireland secretary, as the ""nicest, kindest"" colleague. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called him ""a thoroughly decent man"". Mr Brokenshire, a lifelong non-smoker, stood down as a Home Office minister earlier this year. He died in hospital on Thursday night, having been admitted after his condition deteriorated. An MP since 2005, Mr Brokenshire served in government under three prime ministers - David Cameron, Theresa May and Mr Johnson. House of Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has ordered that flags in Parliament's New Palace Yard be flown at half-mast to mark ""a profound loss to us all"". Minister steps back from role for cancer surgery Brokenshire in lung cancer awareness call Mrs May tweeted: ""Truly saddened by the death of James Brokenshire. He was an outstanding public servant, a talented minister and a loyal friend."" And Mr Johnson tweeted that it was ""desperately sad"", adding: ""James was the nicest, kindest and most unassuming of politicians but also extraordinarily effective."" Mr Brokenshire, who was MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup in Kent, resigned as Northern Ireland secretary in January 2018 following his lung cancer diagnosis, but made a comeback to the cabinet a few months later as housing secretary. He lost that job in July 2019, after Mr Johnson took over from Mrs May in 10 Downing Street.

The family also thanked NHS staff, including those at Guy's & St Thomas' hospital in London, for treating Mr Brokenshire ""with such warmth, diligence and professionalism over the past three-and-a-half years"". They also shared a memorial page on his Twitter feed, which encouraged people to share memories and photos of Mr Brokenshire and to donate to the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation in lieu of flowers.

Fellow Conservative MP Karen Bradley told the BBC News Channel the news of her ""understated"" friend's death was ""heartbreaking"", adding: ""I can't believe I'm not going to be able to sit down with James again and have a laugh about life, and chat about the issues that we both cared about.

"The service is due to be held in St Patrick's Church of Ireland cathedral in Armagh on 21 October Two Irish government ministers are to attend a centenary church service in Armagh later this month organised by Irish church leaders. The service is timed to coincide with the centenary of the formation of Northern Ireland in 1921. Irish president Michael D Higginshas previously turned down an invitation, saying the event had become politicised. The SDLP has said it will be attending, while Sinn FÃ©in confirmed it would not. Foreign Minister Simon Coveney and government chief whip Jack Chambers will be present at the event. In a statement on Thursday evening, the Irish government said in considering the invitation ""its role in this matter is clearly distinct from that of the president"". It said it reiterated its ""full support and understanding"" of President Higgins' decision not to attend, which it said was ""properly made"" and based on concerns he had consistently expressed. But it added: ""Cognisant of that important distinction, and in recognition also of the spirit and intentions of the church leaders in organising the event, the government has decided that it will be represented at the event."" Mr Coveney is a member of the Fine Gael party while Mr Chambers is a member of Fianna FÃ¡il. The service will be held at St Patrick's Church of Ireland cathedral on 21 October. It is being described as a service of reflection and hope, to mark the centenary of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland. Last month, Catholic and Protestant church leaderssaid they had been saddened by ""the polarised political commentary""around the service they organised. Simon Coveney is Ireland's foreign minister Senator Gerard Craughwell, a signatory to a letter from six independent Irish senators who wrote to President Higgins asking him to reconsider his decision not to go to the service, said he did not agree with the decision to send two government ministers. ""The president of the country made his decision, I didn't agree with it at the time and I would still hold the same position,"" he told Good Morning Ulster on Friday. ""You're now having one of the most senior ministers of the cabinet countermanding the decision, for want of a better description, of the supreme leader, the president. ""So it's a really strange one, it's been really messed up from beginning to end as far as I can see. ""When the president made his decision that should have been it, if we wanted to have a representative at this event we should have found someone lower down the food chain in the Irish political system."" A decision has yet to be taken by the SDLP as to who will attend the service. Its leader Colum Eastwood said: ""Given the choice between remaining in the trenches of the last 100 years or reaching out to build a new future, I know which side I want to be on."" President Michael D Higgins declined an invitation to the event The British and Irish heads of state, the Queen and President Higgins, were both invited. The president's decision provoked criticism in Northern Ireland, with Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson saying it was a ""disappointing and retrograde step"". In September,President Higgins defended his decision to decline his invitation. On Thursday, Church of Ireland primate Archbishop John McDowell said the church leaders ""absolutely respect"" the decision of anyone who declines an invitation. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking on RTÃ radio, he insisted the organisers had chosen their words carefully in describing the service as ""marking"" the centenary. ""Not commemorate, not celebrate but to mark - which is a neutral phase - which allows for a very wide interpretation,"" he said. ""And it will include, and always has been planned to include, those who will want to say very clearly that partition, and the legacy of partition, have been a bitter experience for them."" Irish president defends turning down centenary event Church leaders hope for 'healing' centenary events DUP asks Higgins to rethink centenary invite BBC News NI has seen a copy of the letter sent by the church leaders on 4 October to people invited to service. It says: ""The service will provide the opportunity for honest reflection on the past 100 years, including an acknowledgement of different perceptions, with the recognition of failures and hurts. ""It will, however, also have a clear affirmation of our shared commitment to building a future marked by peace, reconciliation and a commitment to the common good.""

"Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov jointly won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize Journalists Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov have won the Nobel Peace Prize for their fights to defend freedom of expression in the Philippines and Russia. The Nobel committee called the pair ""representatives of all journalists who stand up for this ideal"". They are known for investigations that have angered their countries' rulers, and have faced significant threats. Both spoke in defence of freedom of the press following their win. Ms Ressa, who co-founded the news site Rappler, was commended for using freedom of expression to ""expose abuse of power, use of violence and growing authoritarianism in her native country, the Philippines"". The Nobel committee said Mr Muratov, the co-founder and editor of independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta, had for decades defended freedom of speech in Russia under increasingly challenging conditions. ""Free, independent and fact-based journalism serves to protect against abuse of power, lies and war propaganda,""the committee said in a statement.,external ""Without freedom of expression and freedom of the press, it will be difficult to successfully promote fraternity between nations, disarmament and a better world order to succeed in our time,"" it added. Award-winning journalist Ms Ressa wasconvicted last year of libelin a case seen as a test of Philippine press freedom. In a live broadcast by Rappler, she said she was ""in shock"". ""This shows that the Nobel Peace Prize committee realised that a world without facts means a world without truth and trust,"" she said. BBC journalists on Nobel Peace Prize winners Why do the Nobel prizes matter? Who is Philippine news boss Maria Ressa? Mr Muratov dedicated his prize to reporters at Novaya Gazeta who had been killed because of their work. The award came a day after the 15th anniversary ofthe killing of Anna Politkovskaya,external- one of the paper's top investigative reporters and a vocal critic of Russia's war in Chechnya, who was shot in a lift in her block of flats. ""I can't take all the credit. This is thanks to Novaya Gazeta and those who died while defending people's right to freedom of speech,"" he told Russian news agency Tass. The winners of the prestigious prize, worth 10m Swedish krona (Â£836,000; $1.1m), were chosen out of 329 candidates. Maria Ressa, 58, co-founded Rappler in 2012. The site now has 4.5 million followers on Facebook, and has become known for its intelligent analysis and hard-hitting investigations. It is one of the few Philippine media organisations to be openly critical of President Rodrigo Duterte and his policies. Rappler has published extensively on the populist president's deadly war on drugs, as well as taking a critical look at issues of misogyny, human rights violations and corruption. Ms Ressa has personally reported on the spread of government propaganda on social media. Ms Ressa has faced numerous legal cases, which she says are politically motivated. The government has maintained their legitimacy. In a statement, Rappler said it was ""honoured and astounded"" that its chief executive had been given the prize. ""It could not have come at a better time - a time when journalists and the truth are being attacked and undermined,"" it said. This video can not be played Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Ressa: ""Journalism has never been as important as it is today"" Dmitry Muratov, 59, co-founded Novaya Gazeta in 1993 and has since worked as its editor. Novaya Gazeta is one of the few remaining newspapers in Russia to be highly critical of the ruling elite, particularly President Vladimir Putin. Published three times a week, it regularly runs investigations into alleged corruption and other malpractice in ruling circles, and highlights the plight of people it considers victims of official abuse. The newspaper has been subjected to threats and harassment, including over its reporting of human rights abuses in Chechnya. Ms Politkovskaya is one of six Novaya Gazeta journalists and contributors to have been killed in connection with their work since 2000. The Kremlin, which has frequently opposed the paper, congratulated Mr Muratov. ""He persistently works in accordance with his own ideals, he is devoted to them, he is talented, he is brave,"" spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. However, allies ofjailed opposition figure Alexei NavalnyÂ criticised the Nobel committee's choice. ""Instead of pretentious and hypocritical speeches about 'freedom', they could protect a person who survived an assassination attempt and has been taken hostage by the murderers,"" Ruslan Shaveddinov tweeted. Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring Both Nobel laureates have been a thorn in the side of their respective governments for years. Maria Ressa and Rappler have faced concerted attacks from Rodrigo Duterte's government, and her conviction last year for ""cyber-libel"" was one of a string of cases ranging from defamation to tax avoidance. If Mr Duterte is trying to silence her, it hasn't worked. Rappler continues reporting on his administration, and this award will be a huge embarrassment. In her own words, Ms Ressa says: ""I've committed no crime but to speak truth to power."" And congratulations from the Russian government to Dmitry Muratov surely came through gritted teeth. He fully understands the risks that come with standing up to the state but he remains optimistic, saying of state crackdowns on opposition groups: ""It's impossible to kill dissent"". Ms Ressa and Mr Muratov are the 102nd winners of the prize. Last year's winner was the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP),which was awarded for its efforts to combat hunger and improve conditions for peace. Then US President Barack Obama took the prize in 2009 and other notable winners include child education activist Malala Yousafzai (shared 2014); the United Nations and its secretary-general at the time, Kofi Annan (shared 2001); and Mother Teresa (1979).

"Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the last decade, a study has shown. That reduction though is not happening quickly enough to meet a key national target, according to scientists. The aim is to reduce the environmental impact of our diets. This goal, set by theNational Food Strategy,external, is based on a review of the whole UK food system - from farming and production to hunger and sustainability. It recommends meat consumption in the UK fall by 30% over the next 10 years. Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Should there be a tax on red meat? Cows trained to use special 'MooLoo' toilet ""We now know we need a more substantial reduction,"" said lead researcher Cristina Stewart from the University of Oxford. The new study,published in the journal the Lancet Planetary Health,external, revealed that while most people are eating less red and processed meat compared to a decade ago, they are eating more white meat. High consumption of red and processed meat can increase the risk of health problems including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even certain cancers. Meat production also has a higher environmental impact - producing more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions - than other types of agriculture and food production. The environmental impact of raising livestock varies hugely and locally produced meat is generally more sustainable This Oxford-based research team used data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey - a detailed survey of the dietary habits of more than 15,000 people across the country. This showed that daily meat consumption had reduced by about 17g per person per day. What it did not reveal was the reason people were changing their diets. But market research in 2019 suggested that almost 40% of meat-eaters were actively trying to reduce their consumption, with many citing either health or environmental reasons. Dr Stewart stresses that, for those who want to reduce the environmental impact of what they eat, ""any reduction in meat will have an impact"". ""You don't have to be vegetarian,"" she said. ""Although, in general, meat-free dishes will have a lower impact. ""But if you're someone that eats meat every day, reducing your meat consumption by 30% just looks like having two meat-free days per week."" There is huge variation in the environmental impact of meat; it depends on what livestock are fed and where and how the meat is produced. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Why the COP26 climate summit is important What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? Simple guide to climate change ""Locally produced meat has a much lower impact than meat that has been imported,"" Dr Stewart pointed out. She and her colleagues have also been studying the effect of ""environmental impact labelling"" on consumer choices. They have designed experimental labels that score a product based on its greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, water-use and water pollution. ""When you don't have the information about environmental impact of food, it's really hard to shop with that in mind,"" she pointed out. Having the support of those we eat our meals with, the Oxford researchers say, makes it easier for us to change our diets. And the availability and prominence of meat-free food options has an effect on people's food choices, too. ""So, for example, if you're at a restaurant, you often see a vegetarian options 'box of shame' at the bottom of the menu rather than at the top with chef's specials,"" Dr Stewart explained. The team's ongoing study of what drives people to reduce their meat consumption,externalhas revealed some simple strategies that participants have found helpful, including: Trying one new vegetarian recipe; Making one meal in a day vegetarian, rather than going a whole day without meat; Reducing portion size: In a recipe that includes meat, like a bolognese, reduce the amount of meat and supplement that with lentils and vegetables. ""Hopefully this paper will help us understand the patterns and trends so we can tailor public health policies and behavioural nudges to help people choose more sustainable options,"" said Dr Stewart.

"Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford outlines his Covid winter plan, saying he expects businesses to stay open He says he hopes this Christmas will be more like we're used to but warns coronavirus is not over Travel firms have welcomed the latest relaxation of quarantine rules, as 47 countries are taken off the UK's ""red list"" The government is planning to replace expensive day two PCR tests with lateral flow tests for travel to the UK This change will be in place ""hopefully in time"" for those returning from half-term trips, the transport secretary says Grant Shapps adds it will ""certainly"" be in place by the end of this month but Drakeford says he's very concerned by the change People are being urged to get their flu jab amid concerns it will be the first winter that Covid and flu circulate fully The UK has eased travel restrictions for fully vaccinated Indians who have received a UK-approved jab Edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke That's all from our coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today. This live page has been written by Doug Faulkner and Jo Couzens, and edited by Emma Harrison and James Clarke. Thank you for joining us. ...here are some of the headlines from around the world before we bring our coverage to an end for the day. There have been protests and tributes to the dead in Brazil, where the number of pandemic-related deaths has reached 600,000 We've been bringing you the news today that the number of countries on the UK's red list will be cut to seven on Monday, with 47 destinations - including South Africa, Mexico, Thailand, Brazil and Costa Rica - removed. The amber and green lists have already been scrapped and rules for testing relaxed. As we've been reporting, anyone coming from a non-red list country won't need to self-isolate if they can show a full vaccination certificate, recognised by the UK. But all arrivals will still need to take a test on day two. However, the government says it will change the requirement so travellers could use the cheaper lateral flow test rather than the more expensive PCR before the end of October. As we've been reporting, Welsh First minister Mark Drakeford has said he is very concerned about the planned changes to testing - but adds it will be difficult for Wales not to follow suit as many Welsh travellers use English airports when arriving back from trips abroad. Read more Health officials are urging people in the UK to get a flu vaccination before winter. More than 40 million people will be offered the jab, amid fears the months ahead could see a surge in flu alongside a rise in Covid cases. For most people in England, the flu vaccine will be be offered via GPs, midwives and schools. Eligible patients can also book an appointment at a pharmacy. But who will be eligible to get a free flu jab - and what about the rest of the UK? Reality Check President Joe Biden says the tough regulations he put in place
for federal government workers and those in larger private companies to be
vaccinated are paying off. In a speech yesterday in Chicago, Biden said the
imposition of ""vaccination requirements results in more people getting
vaccinated"". From the end of July, all US federal workers have been
required either to be vaccinated or undergo regular testing.  And in
September this was extended to cover companies with more than 100 employees. However, US vaccination data presents a more complicated picture than Biden suggests. When the new rules were imposed on federal workers in July, vaccinations were already on an upward trend which continued largely unchanged following the introduction of the policy. When the policy was widened to include large private companies in September, there was a brief uptick mid-month but the prevailing falling trend then continued following this spike. So there is little to suggest from the US governmentâs own data that the introduction of tougher government requirements has had a significant impact on the overall rate of vaccination across the US. Vaccinations have begun to pick up in recent weeks and currently about 850,000 doses a day are being administered. England football manager Gareth Southgate has suggested medical confidentiality is the
reason for his players not publicly sharing whether they have had the Covid vaccine. ""There's a thing called medical confidentiality which seems to be being totally overlooked in a lot of areas at the moment,"" Southgate says, on the eve of England's World Cup qualifier against Andorra. ""These aren't our players. I don't think the clubs would thank us for sharing that sort of information and frankly, it is personal to the players."" Last week Southgate said he did not know how many of the team had received both doses. Fewer than half of players at most Premier League and English Football League clubs are vaccinated. Earlier this monthit was announcedPremier League players are only allowed to travel to UK-designated ""red-list"" nations to represent their countries in this month's World Cup qualifiers if they are fully vaccinated. The government has since announced the red list will be cut to just seven countries from Monday. However - and contrary to some media reports - BBC Sport understands Fifa does not want any player to be prevented from playing in the Qatar 2022 World Cup because of their vaccination status, and is looking into alternatives to being fully vaccinated, including proof of recovery from Covid-19 or negative tests. Read more:Why are some footballers vaccine hesitant and what happens next? There have been 36,060 confirmed Covid cases reported across England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to the latest figures. This is a slight fall from Thursday's UK-wide figure of 40,701 but a rise on last Friday's 35,577. A further 127 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were also reported - taking the total by that measure to 137,541. Both the cases and deaths figures from Wales have not been included in today's data due to a network issue, according to the government. A further 33,029 people received a first Covid jab on Thursday while 28,656 received their second dose. We've just brought you the news that the UK government is lifting its travel advisories for a further 51 countries. It says the change will make it easier for people to buy travel insurance for a wider range of destinations. Theupdate means the Foreign Office is no longer advising against travelto non-red list countries on Covid-19 grounds - except in
exceptional circumstances, such as if the local healthcare system is
overwhelmed. Travellers should still check its advice on entry requirements for their destination, including any proof of
vaccination they may need, as well as testing and quarantine rules, it adds. The US added a disappointing 194,000 jobs in September, as the Delta variant of coronavirus continued to drag on the economy, official figures show. The unemployment rate meanwhile fell from 5.2% in August to 4.8%. There were notable job gains in hospitality, retail and transportation, while employment in education declined,the US Bureau of Labor Statistics says,external. Yet the unemployment rate is still considerably higher than it was before the pandemic began. Richard Flynn, managing director at Charles Schwab UK, says: ""Investors will be disappointed by today's data, particularly as there has been much more positive economic data issued recently."" Read more in our story. The UK's government announces it will lift its advice against all but essential travel to a further 51 countries and territories. They include the Bahamas, Jamaica, Argentina, Chile, Cuba, Indonesia, Mexico, the Seychelles, South Africa and Thailand. This follows the removal of travel advisories to 32 countries on Wednesday. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the updates will make travel abroad easier - ""boosting trade, tourism and reuniting friends and families"". She says: ""I am delighted that the safe reopening of travel allows people to exercise personal responsibility and visit more destinations across the globe."" A director of public health is advising people to isolate if they have Covid-19 symptoms, even if they subsequently receive a negative PCR test result. GPs in the West say they are seeing ""a stream of patients"" who receive a positive lateral flow test and go on to receive negative PCR results. The UK Health Security Agency says it is investigating the cause. While it is understood lateral flow tests can sometimes produce a false negative, false positives are much rarer. The UK Health Security Agency says it has been made aware of ""some areas across the country"" anecdotally reporting positive lateral flow results with subsequent negative PCR tests. It adds there is currently no evidence of there being any technical issues with lateral flow tests or PCR test kits in relation to those reports. Read more here Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Just under 7% of children in
school years 7 to 11 in England had coronavirus in the week up to 2 October,
according to the latest data from the Office for National Statistics. Thatâs
the highest rate recorded for this age group and, while most age groups are
falling, their parentsâ age group (the 35 to 49-year-olds) are seeing slight
rises too in these figures. The ONS data only covers up to last Saturday and thereâs reason to hope from the more up-to-date data from daily testing. That data suggests thatboth have seen rates flattenand maybe even fall. Overall, about 940,000 people in
the UK would have tested positive for coronavirus, or one in 70 people. Thatâs
up on the previous week and driven by rises in England. Scotland and Northern
Ireland are both seeing falls, according to the ONS. Novavax trial volunteers Darren Green and his wife, Linda, are ""delighted"" they will be offered two doses of an approved vaccine Darren Green, 51, and his wife Linda, 59, who live in south Wales, werevolunteers in the Novavax trial. Linda was given a placebo rather than the vaccine and has since received two doses of an MHRA-approved Covid jab, meaning she is now free to travel. Darren, however, is not, because he received Novavax in the trial. He says it is a relief to know he can now get an approved vaccine. ""I felt a bit emotional when I heard the news. It's a big weight off my mind,"" he says. ""I'll be able to go out and do what other vaccinated people can. We have a trip planned with friends. I thought I was going to have to cancel."" On the prospect of needing more doses, he said: ""Apart from feeling a bit like a pin cushion, I'm absolutely delighted."" People who took part in trials of coronavirus vaccines that have not yet been approved will be offered two doses of another vaccine from next week, health officials say. This means more than 15,000 volunteers who received Novavax or other jabs will finally be able to travel abroad. People who signed up to Covid vaccine trials are recognised as fully-vaccinated in the UK - even if the vaccine has not been approved. But many other countries are not allowing them to enter. The NHS Covid app will be altered to permit the volunteers to travel after they've had their extra two doses. The move, announced by the Department of Health in England, has been developed with the help of the UK's vaccine committee and investigators who worked on the clinical trials. Read more England's R rate -the speed at which coronavirus spreads,external- has risen slightly and is estimated to be between 0.9 to 1.1. A value below one means the number of cases are falling, while a value over one means infections are increasing. It means that on average, every 10 people who are infected will pass the virus on to between nine and 11 other people in England. The growth rate of infections is estimated to be between -1% to +2% per day. Last week the R rate was estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.1, with a growth rate of -3% to +1% per day. Prof Peter Johnson spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital A professor who recovered from Covid is to sing a new piece of choral music based on the diaries of the hospital nurses who treated him when he was in intensive care. Prof Peter Johnstone, 72, spent nearly three months at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge last year. Vision Of A Garden will be performed at the Royal Festival Hall on 24 October - and Prof Johnstone will be one of the singers at the premiere. Clinical nurse Jill Hyde says the piece of music was ""a huge boost to staff morale"". Prof Johnstone, a professor of maths at St John's College, Cambridge, was the first Covid patient admitted to the hospital's Neurosciences and Trauma Critical Care Unit. Often unconscious, he was cared for round the clock for 75 days by hundreds of health care workers, Addenbrooke's said. Read more Christmas 2021 will be more like ""the ones that we're used to"" if nothing unexpected happens, the Welsh First Minister says. ""The most likely scenario in our control plan says that we ought to be able to get through the autumn and the winter with restrictions at the sort of level, we have at the moment,"" Mark Drakeford says. ""That would be very different to last Christmas, far more like the sort of Christmases we were used to. ""All that does depend on us all doing the things that keep us safe, coming forward for vaccination and the simple things that we've learned to do together. ""Then, if nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to."" Across Scotland, hospitals are dealing with thousands more pre-school patients than before the pandemic, figures reveal. Although the cause is unclear, it coincides with an unseasonal surge in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). According to aPublic Health Scotland report,external, a ""high"" level of RSV detections have been reported - and most were among children under five. Typically case numbers peak in winter but week-on-week rises have been recorded since the summer. RSV is a very common virus and almost all children are infected with it by the time they are two years old. Read more. As well as talking about winter plans Mark Drakeford says he's ""very concerned"" about the UK government's plans to change the testing rules for people returning from overseas. By the end of October, fully vaccinated people travelling to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival. Instead, they'll be able to take a lateral flow test. Wales' First Minister says the PCR tests allow variants to be traced and he ""wasnât clear"" how lateral flow tests could be used in the same way. He says there is ""a risk that we are lowering protections"". Drakeford adds it is ""very difficult"" for Wales not to follow the UK governmentâs plans as many travellers use airports in England to travel abroad.

Dr Caroline Whitworth, of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary (ERI), says bed occupancy in the hospital is now consistently 100% - with ""thousands"" in pain while on hold for procedures. A&E waiting times have been at record levels since mid-August. Most health boards have cancelled routine operations to make space for Covid patients and the seriously ill. Bed blocking has also been an issue for the ERI, with more than 100 elderly patients waiting to be discharged in recent days. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"Households will again see ""significant rises"" in energy prices next spring, regulator Ofgem has warned. Its chief executive, Jonathan Brearley, said the price cap, which limits how much energy providers can charge per unit, would go up again because of the ""unprecedented"" rise in gas prices. The cap is revised twice a year and is next due to be changed in April. Natural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. As a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it. Last month, nine of those companies went out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers. Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Ofgem's Mr Brearley told the BBC that the price cap was there to stop firms making unfair profits, but ""legitimate costs have to be passed through"". He said it was too early to say how much the rise in April would be or whether Ofgem would have to review the price cap more frequently in future. However, he added that the regulator might have to look at the formula according to which the cap was set. His warning comes as domestic customers are still reeling from the latest price cap increase, which took effect for households in England, Scotland and Wales this month. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they are not protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain. The energy crisis falls into three broad stages for UK consumers and businesses. Firstly, the here and now. Domestic customers have seen a rise in direct debit demands and bills from suppliers. They are, however, protected from the extreme cost of gas on the wholesale markets by the price cap. Businesses are not. Many are seeing instant and large increases in their energy bills. Secondly, as Ofgem confirms, significantly higher energy prices in the spring are inevitable, potentially adding hundreds of pounds to an annual household bill. That is something which customers can do nothing to stop. Thirdly, a review by the regulator will consider the extent to which the price cap protects customers versus the extra burden it places on all bill payers picking up the cost if the cap causes suppliers to fold. At any point in this process, the government can step in. Thus far, it has shown little appetite to do so. When the price cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills. That was the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a Â£153 increase. The next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February, but will come into force in April. Even if wholesale gas prices were to drop significantly from now, the extra costs that suppliers have had to shoulder in the last couple of months means a steep rise in household bills in April is inevitable. Analysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by Â£400, meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay about Â£1,660 a year. On Thursday, National Energy Action, a charity, said that between 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households could be hit by fuel poverty next year. Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is to hold talks later on Friday with representatives of industries which have the heaviest energy consumption, such as steel, cement and chemicals. While the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices. They have called for government help to control costs and keep plants open. The UK has lower levels of gas stored than many other European countries, making it more exposed to global price volatility. Mr Kwarteng said on Twitter protecting consumers from rising global gas prices was ""his top priority"". His meeting with the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) will include representative bodies UK Steel, the Chemical Industries Association, the Confederation of Paper Industries, the Mineral Products Association, the British Glass Manufacturers Federation, the British Ceramic Confederation, BOC, Air Products and the Major Energy Users Council. Ahead of the meeting, the director of UK Steel, Gareth Stace, told the BBC that the government needed to step in to help industries cope with the rising cost of energy. ""If the government does nothing, then tomorrow there'll be a steel crisis, and in terms of what impact that could have on jobs, then that wouldn't be good, not only for the steel sector, for those regions where steel, is but for the UK economy as a whole,"" he added. Last month, high gas prices forced two fertiliser factories to close, cutting supplies of carbon dioxide which is widely used in food production.

"Recently sacked Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has urged the prime minister not to water down planning reforms to enable more house building. Sources have told the BBC the changes - which would help meet a pledge to build 300,000 new homes - are being paused amid a backlash among Conservative MPs. Mr Jenrick's successor Michael Gove is said to want to address the concerns. But Mr Jenrick told the BBC's Newscast a government with a big majority must tackle difficult issues. The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities said it remained ""committed"" to meeting its housing targets. Why do ministers face a backlash on planning rules? Planning reforms paused amid Tory MP anger Is levelling up about to get the Gove treatment? In his Conservative Party conference speech on Wednesday, Boris Johnsonpromised to end declining property ownershipamong young people by constructing more houses in England. The government has pledged to build 300,000 new homes a year. To achieve that, a blueprint published last summer said the current regime - where local planning officials assess applications case-by-case - should replaced with new rules based on zones. Councils would have to classify all land in their area as ""protected"", for ""renewal"", or for ""growth"", which ministers argued would speed up developments. In addition, each council would have to plan for a share of homes from the government's annual house building target for England. Several Conservative MPs, concerned about the size and nature of potential developments in their constituencies, have spoken out against the plans, which are also opposed by Labour. In June, the Conservatives lost the previously safe seat of Chesham and Amersham to the Liberal Democrats in a by-election, in part due to concerns over more house building in the area. In September, government sources told the BBC they were pausing the reforms, following the cabinet reshuffle in which Mr Jenrick was sacked. But Mr Jenrick told Newscast ministers should not ""bottle"" making the changes. ""Housing is one of those areas where you can make a huge difference, helping people onto the housing ladder, reducing the cost of living, increasing productivity, helping small businesses,"" Mr Jenrick said. ""It cuts across all of the government's priorities, so I strongly, strongly urge the prime minister to stick with it."" Mr Jenrick also said a government with an 80-strong majority in the House of Commons was in an ""incredibly fortunate"" position and should be trying to tackle difficult questions. A Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities spokesperson said: ""We remain committed to continuing our progress towards our target of 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s. ""We are currently reviewing departmental programmes and we will come forward with our proposals for reform of the planning system in due course.""

"Tesla has announced it will move its company headquarters to Texas from California. Chief executive Elon Musk announced the move at the electric carmaker's annual shareholders' meeting in Austin. Mr Musk had fallen out with local politicians in Alameda county, California, the location of a key Tesla factory, over its Covid response. He gave several reasons for the move, telling shareholders its Californian factory in Fremont was ""jammed"". California was also a difficult place for his employees to find affordable housing, he told shareholders. ""There's a limit to how big you can scale it in the Bay Area. In Austin our factory is like five minutes from the airport, 15 minutes from downtown,"" he said. The billionaire technology entrepreneur has had an fractious relationship at times with California. In May, Musk had a high profile spat with local politicians in California after he was ordered to keep Tesla's Fremont plant closed. He tweeted: ""Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately."" However the move had not been confirmed until now. Allow Twitter content?

Despite moving its headquarters, Mr Musk also said that the company planned to increase output from its California and Nevada factories by 50%. ""This is not a matter of, sort of, Tesla leaving California,"" he said. Tesla is not the first company to move to Texas. In 2020, tech powerhouse Oracle announced it was moving from Silicon Valley to Austin. Technology firm HP and carmaker Toyota have also moved their US headquarters to Texas from California. California has stronger labour laws, and higher living costs and taxes than other states, while Texas is known for cheaper labour and less stringent regulation. Mr Musk moved his home to Texas from California at the end of last year to focus on Tesla's new car manufacturing plant there.

"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had warned that the US could fall into a recession if an agreement was not reached The US Senate has voted to temporarily raise the nation's debt limit, avoiding a historic default that experts say would have devastated the economy. Senators agreed to increase the limit by $480bn (Â£352bn), which will cover the US until early December. The bill was approved in a 50-48 vote, following weeks of partisan fighting. The breakthrough came less than two weeks before the US was set to be unable to borrow money or pay off loans for the first time ever. The bill now has to be approved by the House of Representatives, and will then be sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. The vote in the upper house of Congress came after Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell offered his support for a short-term extension. Senate Republicans have previously said that raising the debt limit is the ""sole responsibility"" of Democrats because they hold power in the White House and both chambers of Congress. They are frustrated by new spending proposals the Democrats are trying to push through without Republican support, and Mr McConnell tweeted last month that his party would ""not facilitate another reckless, partisan taxing and spending spree"". EXPLAINED:What's next for the US debt limit? Speaking after the vote, the Democrats' Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer said Republicans had ""played a dangerous and risky partisan game"". ""What is needed now is a long-term solution so we don't go through this risky drama every few months,"" he added. But several senior Republicans attacked Mr McConnell's decision to strike a deal with Mr Schumer. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham called the move ""a complete capitulation"". US lawmakers will still have to address this issue near the new December deadline to avert a default. If the US defaults on debts, experts say it will severely hurt the country's credit rating, plunge the global financial system into turmoil, and possibly lead to a self-inflicted recession. Mitch McConnell said Republicans and Democrats negotiated through the night ""in good faith"" The US government spends more money than it collects in taxes, so it borrows to make up for the shortfall. Borrowing is done via the US Treasury, through the issuing of bonds. US government bonds are seen as among the world's safest and most reliable investments. In 1939, Congress established an aggregate limit or ""ceiling"" on how much debt the government could accumulate. The ceiling has been lifted on more than 100 occasions to allow the government to borrow more. Congress often acts on it in a bipartisan manner and it is rarely the subject of a political standoff. But some Republicans have voiced frustration about new Democrat spending proposals. Democrats have pointed out that raising the debt ceiling is about paying off existing obligations rather than paying for new ones, and that President Biden's policies have only contributed to 3% of existing debts.
