"Neil and his wife Susanne run a towel and bedding stall in Barnsley outdoor market ""It's been hard financially, but our business can now get cracking,"" says Neil Conway, who runs a towel and bedding stall at Barnsley outdoor market with his wife Susanne. Open air markets and car showrooms will be allowed to re-open in England on Monday,with coronavirus-related measures in place,external. As with garden centres (which re-opened in May across the UK), the government says the risk of transmission of Covid-19 ""is lower in these outdoor and more open spaces"". To try to keep their customers safe, Neil and Susanne have overhauled how they work. The pair have printed new signs to encourage shoppers to keep a two-metre distance, as well as introducing contactless payments and designated payment and ""pick-up"" points for orders. ""We're hoping we can provide a good example of how things can work, and hopefully others will follow,"" says Susanne. She says that it's been a ""funny few months"" not trading during lockdown, having started work at the market when she was 12-years-old. ""We have wanted to know when we were coming back, and we were questioning if it was ever going to happen."" ""But now we're really looking forward to getting started, and helping get the economy back on its feet, safety-first of course,"" she adds. Although their market stall might benefit from lockdown measures gradually being lifted, Neil anticipates it might take some time for trade  - and customer confidence - to return. ""I don't think we'll take a great deal of money at first, but we've got to get into the swing of working again,"" Neil says. When will shops open and what will the rules be? John Lewis plans phased reopening of stores Harrods hits the shopping mall to stop congestion One trade body says that those who've carried on selling essential items like food during lockdown have shown that trading can be done safely. But they told the BBC they believe only a fraction of outdoor markets will resume straight away. Joe Harrison, chief executive of the National Market Traders Federation said: ""It will take a lot of time for markets to get back to their full potential, with the correct equipment in place."" Car showrooms have also been working to put measures in place to ensure the safety of staff and customers ahead of re-opening, said Sue Robinson, director of the National Franchised Dealers Association. She said they include one-way systems, hand sanitising stations, protective screens and more frequent cleaning for each car. At Sytner, the UK's largest car dealer, customers will have to test drive cars by themselves. Boss Darren Edwards told the BBC's Today programme customers were unlikely to buy cars they had not driven, and that the firm would do ""due diligence"" to ensure it was safe. He said he was hopeful that demand would pick up from current low levels but that the future remained uncertain. ""Clearly once the government's furlough scheme finishes in October we don't know what that is going to do to the economy and general consumer confidence. That's a bit of an unknown."" Other retailers in England have also been pressing ahead with their coronavirus-secure re-opening plans. Ikea, for example, could have stayed open during lockdown. But it chose to shut, and will only re-open in England and Northern Ireland from Monday. One store manager told the BBC that ""wardens"" will be working in-store, reminding customers of social distancing guidelines. Other shops classed as non-essential in England, however, won't be able to re-open until 15 June. No firm dates have been set for the reopening of non-essential shops in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,but each country has plans in place. This includes shopsselling things like clothes, toys, books and electronics,external, as well as tailors, auction houses, photography studios, and indoor markets. Tony Symons, owner of Roger's Menswear in Kent, has already been gearing-up to start trading again. He says that he has ordered a Perspex screen for the till area, and will introduce shorter openings hours and a cap on the number of customers allowed in his shop at one time. But like Neil the market trader, Tony only expects a trickle of trade initially. ""To be optimistic, I would say customers will come flocking through the door. Unfortunately, I don't think that will be the case."" As an independent retailer without an online sales platform, Tony is relying on customer visits, and hopes that footfall will build up over time.

"This video can not be played Robert Jenrick: ""The small changes... will have a huge impact on people's mental health"" The government is taking ""modest"" steps in easing lockdown restrictions, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said. He said he was ""reasonably confident"" the measures would be ""manageable"", but the room for manoeuvre was limited. From Monday in England primary schools will start to reopen and people can meet in groups of up to six. And vulnerable people in England and Wales will be able to go outdoors for the first time in months. Meanwhile,the UK has exceeded its targetto increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. Mr Jenrick's comments come aftersome scientific advisers voiced concernsabout the timing of the changes. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, he confirmedthe updated guidance on shieldingwhich will mean that people who have been advised to stay home since the lockdown began will now be able to go outside either with members of their household or to meet someone from another household. But Mr Jenrick said people in this group should only do what they are comfortable with, adding that the advice would be tightened again if conditions became ""less favourable"". What am I allowed to do now? Some people shielding to be allowed outdoors UK exceeds 200,000 testing capacity target Some patients' groups have expressed concern at the pace of the changes, and have called for the evidence behind them to be published. Confirmation of the changes to the restrictions came as it was announced another 113 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus. It takes the total number of people who have died to 38,489. On Saturday, Professor John Edmunds, a member of Sage - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies which advises the government - said the levels of coronavirus were still ""very high"", adding that it was a ""political decision"" to ease measures. ButForeign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the decision to ease lockdown. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the government had ""taken evidence from scientists"" and had met the five tests it said were needed to relax restrictions. ""Because we have made that progress, steadily, slowly, surely - week in, week out - we can very gradually, very carefully, take the steps that we are taking tomorrow,"" Mr Raab said. From Monday, a number of changes will come into effect across England: Primary school pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 can return to school Those in the shielded category will be allowed outdoors, with a family member or to meet one other friend Groups of six people can meet in parks or private gardens, always remaining 2m apart People can exercise outside with up to five othersfrom different households Competitive sport will be allowed to take place behind closed doors Outdoor markets and car showrooms can reopen, provided they are ""Covid-secure"" In Wales, people from two different households will be able to meet each other outdoors from Monday. Groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in Northern Ireland. And in Scotland members of two different households are already allowed to meet outdoors. A UK cancer charity chief has told the BBC he was concerned about the new guidance allowing those who were previously shielding to go outdoors. ""It's not helpful to bring changes really quickly that we don't know the evidence behind,"" said Alasdair Rankin, Blood Cancer UK's director of research and policy. ""We'd like to see the evidence the decision is based on and for the government to be really transparent."" And Phil Anderson, head of policy at the MS Society, said people would ""rightly want to hear a lot more about the scientific evidence showing this will be safe for them"". Meanwhile,the UK has exceeded its targetto increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May, with 205,634 tests available on Saturday. Widespread testing forms a central part of the government's strategy to control the virus, as it aims to ease blanket lockdown in favour of more targeted measures. Health Secretary Matt Hancock described it as ""an important milestone on our journey to control the spread of the virus"". While capacity for testing is over 200,000, a little more than 115,000 tests were carried out in the 24 hours up to 09:00 BST on Sunday. For several days, the government has been unable to give figures on the exact number of people who were tested. VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic The UK's R value - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to, on average - is currently between 0.7 and 0.9. If it goes above 1.0 the number of cases will increase exponentially, but if it stays below then the disease will eventually peter out. Mr Jenrick said the government would not go ahead with some of the plans to further ease lockdown if R rose above one ""or dangerously close to it"". ""We're going to be doing this in a cautious and data-driven way in the days and weeks ahead,"" he said. Elsewhere during the briefing, Mr Jenrick said: The government is ""working towards"" plans to reopen places of worship for individual and private prayer A decision on whether to reopen playgrounds will be kept under review, but Dr Harries said it is unlikely they will be back soon Some 6,000 new supported homeswill be made availablefor rough sleepers BBC FOOD:Low calorie fakeaways BBC BITESIZE:How long to make a vaccine?

"Parents bringing their children back to school on Monday in Norfolk Head teachers are reporting ""highly variable"" levels of attendance, ranging from 40% to 70%, as primary schools in England bring back more pupils. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL heads' union, says the return has been ""very mixed"" - with some schools not yet open and some children staying away. Children in Reception, Years 1 and 6 are the first groups able to return. It comes as lockdown measures are eased in England, including groups of six people being allowed to meet outside. Schools have remained open throughout the coronavirus restrictions for the children of key workers and vulnerable children - but from Monday more than two million more pupils have been invited back. Latest government figures show 39,045 people with the virus have died in the UK, across all settings. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there had been a day-on-day increase of 111 deaths and 1,570 new positive tests. An additional 445 deaths have been added to the overall death toll in the past day. The increase is explained by the retrospective inclusion of some patients whose tests were carried out by commercial partners, rather than the NHS or Public Health England. The first wave of primary school pupils has returned to school The head teachers' leader says the ""first impression"" has been of a very varied local picture - with not all schools either open or bringing back pupils as outlined in the government's plans. Some local authorities have not yet started to bring back more pupils, some schools have limited space, some are still training and not all staff are available, he said. ""Caution is the watchword, and everybody is approaching this task with the safety of pupils and staff as their absolute priority,"" said Mr Barton. Live: England goes back to school In pictures: the first day back at school Which children will be going back to school? How could all children fit in school with 15 pupils per classroom? A survey from the National Foundation for Educational Research suggested almost 50% of children would be kept at home by parents. Mr Barton's early feedback suggests ranges of between 30% and 60% of pupils not attending school. Social distancing markers have been added to school life But he said more key workers' children seemed to be coming in and he expected the overall numbers to increase as ""more parents become confident"". The biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, has warned it was not yet safe to open schools - and the union's co-leader, Kevin Courtney, said delaying the wider opening of schools would ""make our communities safer"". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said children needed to catch up with missed lessons and at school they ""will be with their teachers and friends again"". ""I'm excited to see my friends and see everyone but not excited for the work,"" says 11-year-old Sean, returning to school in Mortlake, West London. BBC News education reporter Judith Burns describes the return to school: ""You look like you've grown,"" says teacher Catherine Hughes to a reception pupil who hasn't been in school since March. Pupils have to learn a new way of behaving at school ""Are you excited to be back?"" Helen Frostick head of St Mary Magdalen's Catholic primary school in Mortlake, West London asks another. About half of those who could have returned have taken up their places, alongside 15 children of key workers who have continued to come into school throughout the lockdown. The classrooms have been completely reorganised, with desks in rows, facing forwards, instead of pushed together into big tables. Parents say goodbye for the first Monday morning back in 10 weeks There's lots of hand washing and the windows are open to let in fresh air. The school has split each class into two separate bubbles with one half in on Monday and Tuesday and the other on Thursday and Friday, which allows for a deep clean on Wednesdays. In the Reception class each table is separate, with its own tray of equipment so that the children don't need to get out of their seats so much, says teaching assistant, Clare Gordon. ""It really is best for the family,"" says mum Sophia as she brings her two sons to school. She has managed to do some home schooling with the boys over the past few weeks but it hasn't always been easy. A socially distanced first morning back in school ""I was 10% worried but 90% thinking it was the right thing to do,"" says Julia, who has just dropped off her son. ""The main thing is for normality and for his mental health. He needs the interaction with his friends. He's been begging to come back,"" she says. A survey from the National Foundation for Educational Research suggested approaching half of families would keep their children at home. It expected that: 46% of parents will keep children at home 50% of parents in schools in disadvantaged areas will keep children at home 25% of teachers are likely to be absent because of health issues for themselves or their families. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Jane Reid, a parent from York, said it was still not safe for her son to go back to school, saying: ""It's a definite no from me. ""Plus, the contradictory information is infuriating. I can take him to school, but can't get his hair cut."" ""How can I send them to school now, knowing it will be impossible for teachers to implement social distancing rules properly?"" asked Valerie Brooker from Haslemere in Surrey. Pupils have returned to find a different kind of classroom In other developments in England: Those shielding since lockdown began 10 weeks agowill be allowed outdoorswith a family member or to meet one other friend Groups of up to six people from different householdscan meet in parks and private gardens,as long as they remain two metres apart People can exercise outsidewith up to five othersfrom different households Domestic competitive sportwill be allowed behind closed doors Outdoor marketsand car showrooms can reopen, provided they have Covid-related measures in place People are banned from staying at another address overnight unless it is for a specified reason, such as work or attending a funeral. But they can leave their homes without needing a ""reasonable excuse"" The Association of Directors of Public Health, which represents council health figures,warned in the Guardian,externalthat restrictions were being relaxed too quickly as ""the public is not keeping to social distancing as it was"". In Wales, people from two different households can meet each other outdoors. Groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in Northern Ireland. And in Scotland members of two different households are already allowed to meet outdoors.

For some parents the decision has been taken out of their hands. Lancashire County Council is among those saying it is not yet safe to open schools. A mother in Lancashire, who wanted to remain anonymous, has described this as a relief as she did not want her child to go back, although her husband did. This video can not be played A Suffolk school has built a teepee to allow social distancing The way that schools are bringing back pupils has many local variations - spread out over the next couple of weeks and with many schools making their own arrangements over which year groups return and for how many days a week. The day looked very different for those pupils who did return - with staggered drop-off times and children staying in small groups of no more than 15 pupils. Ministers say opening schools will help with childcare for parents returning to work - and to help children catch up with missed lessons. Protesters outside the Department for Education warned that opening schools was not safe From 15 June secondary pupils will start to return, in Years 10 and 12 - and there are plans for all primary years to go back for the last month of term. Teachers' unions unconvinced by school safety plans 'Virus could be here for a year', so schools must reopen Nurseries and early years' providers are also opening, and a survey of 4,500 parents with young children, carried out by the Early Years Alliance, indicated a divided picture on take-up. 65% of nurseries and childcare settings open from 1 June 45% of parents planning to take up places The biggest reason for parents not sending in their children was concern about safety. Chief executive Neil Leitch warned the row over the prime minister's adviserDominic Cummings travelling during lockdownthreatened to undermine parents' trust on safety measures. A school in Tamworth with pupils back in class The concern was echoed by the Royal Society of Arts which published a survey of more than 2,000 adults in the UK showing 49% think the government is too caught up in the ""Dominic Cummings affair"" to be making the right decisions about schools. ""Despite the narrative from the government, the level of confidence for a return to schools remains low,"" said Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers. Tulip Siddiq, Labour's shadow minister for children and early years, said the lower demand for childcare places would put nurseries under ""extraordinary financial pressure"" and  ""millions of childcare places could be lost in this crisis"".

"Nicola Sturgeon has said people's quality of life is as important as restarting the economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first minister said she was trying to strike a balance between the two after more than nine weeks of lockdown. Ms Sturgeon said Scotland would stay on a ""slow and steady"" route out of restrictions. Scotland is in its third day of eased restrictions with people able to meet with friends and family outside. Follow our live updates here Scotland begins to ease out of lockdown Reassurance over tracer scam potential The sedate stroll out of lockdown Speaking on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, the first minister said the Scottish government was committed to taking a cautious approach because it was clear coronavirus had not gone away. She said: ""It's important to get the economy going as soon as it is safe to do so but I also think it is important we recognise the things that matter most to people's quality of life, and that is family, friendship and love. ""These are all things people have had to sacrifice over the past couple of  months."" The hot weather since the lockdown restrictions were eased has seen more people outdoors than before Ms Sturgeon said that because the virus ""could run out of control again"" there was a limit on the restrictions that could be lifted just now and it ""would be wrong"" to use all of that flexibility to just get the economy moving again. She added that she wanted to avoid a situation where, ""people are being told they have to go back to work and they remain in lockdown for the rest of the time - that would not give very much quality of life to people"". Ms Sturgeon also said there should be a clear distinction between politicians making decisions and scientists advising. The first minister reiterated that changes that mean vulnerable people in England who have been asked to remain at home (shielding) will be able to go outdoors again do not apply in Scotland. Meanwhile, 80 organisations from across different sectors of Scottish life have written to Ms Sturgeon calling for a radical response to the coronavirus recovery. Peter Kelly, director of Poverty Alliance, said: ""As we plan our economic recovery, we must build back better. ""We must design a more just taxation system, provide affordable and accessible public services, build a labour market that works for everyone, and ensure that everyone has an income that meets their needs.""

"George Floyd repeatedly told the police officers who detained him that he could not breathe The US has been convulsed by nationwide protests over the death of an African-American man in police custody. George Floyd, 46, died after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage of the arrest on 25 May shows a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck while he was pinned to the floor. Mr Chauvin, 44, has since been charged with murder. Transcripts of police bodycam footage show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained by the officers. The key events that led to Mr Floyd's death happened within just 30 minutes. Based on accounts from witnesses, video footage and official statements, here's what we know so far. It began with a report of a fake $20 (Â£16.20) bill. A report was made on the evening of 25 May, when Mr Floyd bought a pack of cigarettes from Cup Foods, a grocery store. Believing the $20 bill he used to be counterfeit, a store employee reported it to police. Mr Floyd had been living in Minneapolis for several years after moving there from his native Houston, Texas. He had recently been working as a bouncer in the city but, like millions of other Americans, was left jobless by the coronavirus pandemic. In pictures: Unrest spreads across US Why has a US city gone up in flames? Mr Floyd was a regular at Cup Foods. He was a friendly face, a pleasant customer who never caused any trouble,the store owner Mike Abumayyaleh told NBC,external. But Mr Abumayyaleh was not at work on the day of the incident. In reporting the suspicious bill, his teenage employee was just following protocol. In a call to 911, made at 20:01, the employee told the operator he had demanded the cigarettes back but ""he [Floyd] doesn't want to do that"",according to a transcript released by authorities,external. The employee said the man appeared ""drunk"" and ""not in control of himself"", the transcript says. Shortly after the call, at around 20:08, two police officers arrived. Mr Floyd was sitting with two other people in a car parked around the corner. After approaching the car, one of the officers, Thomas Lane, pulled out his gun and ordered Mr Floyd to show his hands.In an account of the incident,external, prosecutors do not explain why Mr Lane thought it necessary to draw his gun. Mr Lane, prosecutors said, ""put his hands on Mr Floyd, and pulled him out of the car"". Then Mr Floyd ""actively resisted being handcuffed"". Once handcuffed, though, Mr Floyd became compliant while Mr Lane explained he was being arrested for ""passing counterfeit currency"". Court transcripts from police body cameras show Mr Floyd appears co-operative at the beginning of the arrest, repeatedly apologising to the officers after they approach his parked car. Mr Lane asks Mr Floyd to show his hands at least 10 times before ordering him to get out of the vehicle. It was when officers tried to put Mr Floyd in their squad car that a struggle ensued. This video can not be played Minnesota governor on George Floyd death: 'Thank God a young person had a camera to video it' At about 20:14, Mr Floyd ""stiffened up, fell to the ground, and told the officers he was claustrophobic"", according to the report. Mr Chauvin arrived at the scene. He and other officers were involved in a further attempt to put Mr Floyd in the police car. During this attempt, at 20:19, Mr Chauvin pulled Mr Floyd away from the passenger side, causing him to fall to the ground, the report said. He lay there, face down, still in handcuffs. That's when witnesses started to film Mr Floyd, who appeared to be in a distressed state. These moments, captured on multiple mobile phones and shared widely on social media, would prove to be Mr Floyd's last. Twitter hides Trump tweet for 'glorifying violence' Mr Floyd was restrained by officers, while Mr Chauvin placed his left knee between his head and neck. For more than nine minutes, Mr Chauvin kept his knee on Mr Floyd's neck, the prosecutors say. The duration was initially given as eight minutes and 46 seconds but Minnesota prosecutors have since revised the time. The transcripts of bodycam footage from officers Lane and J Alexander Kueng show Mr Floyd said more than 20 times he could not breathe as he was restrained. He was also pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"". At one point, Mr Floyd gasps: ""You're going to kill me, man."" Derek Chauvin is charged with second degree murder Officer Chauvin replies: ""Then stop talking, stop yelling. It takes heck of a lot of oxygen to talk."" Mr Floyd says: ""Can't believe this, man. Mom, love you. Love you. Tell my kids I love them. I'm dead."" A female bystander told the police: ""His nose is bleeding, come on now."" About six minutes into that period, Mr Floyd became non-responsive. In videos of the incident, this was when Mr Floyd fell silent, as bystanders urged the officers to check his pulse. Officer Kueng did just that, checking Mr Floyd's right wrist, but ""couldn't find one"". Yet the other officers did not move. At 20:27, Mr Chauvin removed his knee from Mr Floyd's neck. Motionless, Mr Floyd was rolled on to a gurney and taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center in an ambulance. He was pronounced dead about an hour later. This video can not be played In June Panorama spoke to local people to piece together the moments leading up to George Floyd's death On the night before his death, Mr Floyd had spoken to one of his closest friends, Christopher Harris. He had advised Mr Floyd to contact a temporary jobs agency. Forgery, he said, was out of character for Mr Floyd. ""The way he died was senseless,"" Harris said. ""He begged for his life. He pleaded for his life. When you try so hard to put faith in this system, a system that you know isn't designed for you, when you constantly seek justice by lawful means and you can't get it, you begin to take the law into your own hands."" 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support. In pictures: Unrest spreads Why is a US city in flames?

"This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets again on Saturday night Curfews have been imposed in multiple cities in the US, after unrest and protests have spread across the country over the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, in police custody. Most of the protests began peacefully - and several stayed peaceful. But in a large number of cases, demonstrators clashed with police, set police cars on fire, vandalised property or looted shops. The National Guard has activated 5,000 of its personnel across 15 states and Washington DC. Experts have also drawn parallels with the 2011 England riots - when a peaceful protest over a man who was shot dead by police turned into four days of unrest, with widespread looting and buildings set alight. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life In pictures: Protests turn violent Why has a US city gone up in flames? How do protests spread so quickly - and why do some become violent? Many of the daytime protests were peaceful Incidents like Mr Floyd's death can ""become a trigger moment because it symbolises a broader experience, amongst much larger numbers of people, about the relationship between police and the black community,"" says Prof Clifford Stott, an expert in crowd behaviour and public order policing at Keele University. Confrontations are particularly likely when there are structural inequalities, he adds. Prof Stott studied the 2011 England riots extensively, and found that the riots there spread because protesters in different cities identified with each other - either because of their ethnicity, or because they shared a dislike of the police. This meant that, when the police appeared to be overwhelmed, rioters in different districts felt empowered to mobilise. England riots: Maps and timeline How one night in the riots changed my life Violent protests are less likely when police have a good relationship with the local community - but how they react to demonstrations on the day also matters, experts say. Protesters squared off against police in Los Angeles on Saturday ""Riots are a product of interactions - largely to do with the nature of the way police treats crowds,"" says Prof Stott. For example, he says, in a large crowd of protesters, tensions may begin with just a few people confronting the police. However, ""police often react towards the crowd as a whole"" - and if people feel that the police use of force against them is unjustified, this increases their ""us versus them"" mentality. This ""can change the way people feel about violence and confrontation - for example, they may start feeling that violence is legitimate given the circumstances."" Darnell Hunt, dean of social sciences at UCLA, believes police in the US ""ramped up their aggressiveness"" over the weekend. ""Deploying the National Guard, using rubber bullets, tear gas, and pepper spray - these are a range of police tactics that can exacerbate an already-tense situation."" This video can not be played Minneapolis voices: âAs a black American I am terrifiedâ It's a pattern that has been seen in other protests around the world too. For example, in 2019, Hong Kong saw seven months of anti-government protests, that began as mostly peaceful and ended up increasingly violent. Experts highlight a series of police tactics that were seen as heavy-handed - including the firing of large amounts of tear gas at young protesters - as moves that galvanised protesters and made them more confrontational. Prof Stott argues that police forces that have invested in de-escalation training are more likely to avoid violence at protests. He points to protests that were able to stay peaceful in the US over the weekend - such as in Camden, New Jersey, where officers joined the residents in a march against racism. Allow Twitter content?

Moral psychology can help explain why some protests turn violent, says Marloon Moojiman, an assistant professor in organisational behaviour at Rice University. A person's sense of morality is central to how they see themselves, so ""when we see something as immoral, it creates strong feelings, because we feel our understanding of morality has to be protected"". ""This can override other concerns people have about keeping peace"", because ""if you think the system is broken, you're going to want to really do something drastic to show that that's not acceptable."" This can apply to a wide range of beliefs - for example, in an extreme case, someone who thinks abortion is a moral outrage may be more likely to say it's OK to bomb an abortion clinic, he says. Research suggests that social media echo chambers could also make people more susceptible to endorsing violence, if they believe that their peers have the same moral views as them, he adds. In the US, hundreds of businesses have been damaged, and there has been widespread looting in LA and Minneapolis over the weekend. However, Prof Stott warns that while it's easy to assume that riots and crowds are ""irrational and chaotic, none of that is true - it's highly structured and meaningful for the people taking part"". ""To some extent, looting is an expression of power - black citizens may have felt disempowered in relation to the police - but in the context of a riot, the rioters momentarily become more powerful than the police."" Studies of previous riots show that places that get looted are often related to big businesses, and that looting ""often relates to the sense of inequality related to living in capitalistic economies"", he says. An Apple Store in Los Angeles was among those looted Prof Hunt has studied the 1992 Los Angeles riots, which were sparked after four white police officers were acquitted over the videotaped beating of black motorist Rodney King. He says there is ""a long history of targeting, or selectivity"", in vandalism and looting. ""In the LA uprisings, you'd often see 'minority owned' spray painted on minority businesses, so that people would bypass those."" However, both Prof Stott and Prof Hunt caution that looting is complicated - especially as lots of people with different motivations take part, including people in poverty, or organised criminals. The idea that violent protests are targeted and meaningful events to those taking part can also explain why looting occurs in some protests, but not others. This video can not be played How Hong Kong got trapped in a cycle of violence In Hong Kong, for example, protesters smashed shop windows, threw petrol bombs at police, and defaced the national emblem - but there was no looting. All the context you need on Hong Kong's protests Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions Young, radical and ready for tear gas Lawrence Ho, a specialist in policing and public order management at the Education University of Hong Kong, believes this is because those protests were triggered by political developments and anger at the police, rather than discrimination and social inequality. ""Vandalism was targeted at stores seen to have a strong connection to mainland China,"" says Dr Ho. ""It was a deliberate attempt to convey a message."" Public order experts say that for the police, being seen as legitimate and able to engage protesters in dialogue is key. ""Good policing tries to avoid an 'us' and 'them' mentality, and also tries to avoid the sense that police can act in ways that people see as illegitimate,"" says Prof Stott. Police cars, including in New York, were set on fire Dr Ho also believes that negotiation is the best way - but points out that ""one of the hardest things today is that a lot of protests are leaderless. If you can't find the leader, you can't negotiate with them."" More generally, he adds, politicians can make matters better - or worse - based on their approach to dialogue, and whether they use emergency legislation. Ultimately, however, riots can be a symptom of deep-seated tensions and complicated issues that don't have an easy solution. Prof Hunt says this week's US riots are the most serious ones since 1968 - after Martin Luther King was assassinated. ""You can't think about police brutality, and the profiling of certain communities, without thinking about the inequalities that exist in society and fuel those concerns,"" he says. ""The George Floyd case was not the cause - it's more like the straw that broke the camel's back. You could argue even the police killings are symptoms - the underlying cause is white supremacy, racism, and things the US has not fundamentally dealt with."" âAs a black American I am terrifiedâ Video, 00:03:41âAs a black American I am terrifiedâ In pictures: Protest clashes in Minneapolis The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

"This video can not be played Robert Jenrick: ""The small changes... will have a huge impact on people's mental health"" The government is taking ""modest"" steps in easing lockdown restrictions, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said. He said he was ""reasonably confident"" the measures would be ""manageable"", but the room for manoeuvre was limited. From Monday in England primary schools will start to reopen and people can meet in groups of up to six. And vulnerable people in England and Wales will be able to go outdoors for the first time in months. Meanwhile,the UK has exceeded its targetto increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. Mr Jenrick's comments come aftersome scientific advisers voiced concernsabout the timing of the changes. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, he confirmedthe updated guidance on shieldingwhich will mean that people who have been advised to stay home since the lockdown began will now be able to go outside either with members of their household or to meet someone from another household. But Mr Jenrick said people in this group should only do what they are comfortable with, adding that the advice would be tightened again if conditions became ""less favourable"". What am I allowed to do now? Some people shielding to be allowed outdoors UK exceeds 200,000 testing capacity target Some patients' groups have expressed concern at the pace of the changes, and have called for the evidence behind them to be published. Confirmation of the changes to the restrictions came as it was announced another 113 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus. It takes the total number of people who have died to 38,489. On Saturday, Professor John Edmunds, a member of Sage - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies which advises the government - said the levels of coronavirus were still ""very high"", adding that it was a ""political decision"" to ease measures. ButForeign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the decision to ease lockdown. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the government had ""taken evidence from scientists"" and had met the five tests it said were needed to relax restrictions. ""Because we have made that progress, steadily, slowly, surely - week in, week out - we can very gradually, very carefully, take the steps that we are taking tomorrow,"" Mr Raab said. From Monday, a number of changes will come into effect across England: Primary school pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 can return to school Those in the shielded category will be allowed outdoors, with a family member or to meet one other friend Groups of six people can meet in parks or private gardens, always remaining 2m apart People can exercise outside with up to five othersfrom different households Competitive sport will be allowed to take place behind closed doors Outdoor markets and car showrooms can reopen, provided they are ""Covid-secure"" In Wales, people from two different households will be able to meet each other outdoors from Monday. Groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in Northern Ireland. And in Scotland members of two different households are already allowed to meet outdoors. A UK cancer charity chief has told the BBC he was concerned about the new guidance allowing those who were previously shielding to go outdoors. ""It's not helpful to bring changes really quickly that we don't know the evidence behind,"" said Alasdair Rankin, Blood Cancer UK's director of research and policy. ""We'd like to see the evidence the decision is based on and for the government to be really transparent."" And Phil Anderson, head of policy at the MS Society, said people would ""rightly want to hear a lot more about the scientific evidence showing this will be safe for them"". Meanwhile,the UK has exceeded its targetto increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May, with 205,634 tests available on Saturday. Widespread testing forms a central part of the government's strategy to control the virus, as it aims to ease blanket lockdown in favour of more targeted measures. Health Secretary Matt Hancock described it as ""an important milestone on our journey to control the spread of the virus"". While capacity for testing is over 200,000, a little more than 115,000 tests were carried out in the 24 hours up to 09:00 BST on Sunday. For several days, the government has been unable to give figures on the exact number of people who were tested. VACCINE:How close are we to finding one? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic The UK's R value - the number of people each infected person passes the virus on to, on average - is currently between 0.7 and 0.9. If it goes above 1.0 the number of cases will increase exponentially, but if it stays below then the disease will eventually peter out. Mr Jenrick said the government would not go ahead with some of the plans to further ease lockdown if R rose above one ""or dangerously close to it"". ""We're going to be doing this in a cautious and data-driven way in the days and weeks ahead,"" he said. Elsewhere during the briefing, Mr Jenrick said: The government is ""working towards"" plans to reopen places of worship for individual and private prayer A decision on whether to reopen playgrounds will be kept under review, but Dr Harries said it is unlikely they will be back soon Some 6,000 new supported homeswill be made availablefor rough sleepers BBC FOOD:Low calorie fakeaways BBC BITESIZE:How long to make a vaccine?

""It all comes back to you, all the stuff that you learned at university,"" Du Plessis told BBC Radio Scotland. Read more At the UK government briefing, a reporter asked if the average number of daily deaths had stopped decreasing and was instead plateauing, as appears to be the case in the latest data shown in the graphic above. Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, said if that were happening, ""we should be really concerned"". But she added: ""We need to be watching over a longer period than a few days, to get a sense of what is happening."" She said people needed to keep abiding with social distancing measures and limiting the amount of social interactions they have. ""It is a critical time, we need to be very careful,"" she added. Jeane Freeman insists Scotland does have the capacity for 15,500 tests a day, as The Herald points out that just over 3,200 were done yesterday, the lowest number since 28 April. The health secretary says part of the strategy is to make sure they are ready for any spike in infections as lockdown measures are eased and that the Test & Protect programme is key in the next steps to overcome the virus. ""We are constantly looking to see what more we can do with that testing capacity, to ensure it is used more effectively,"" she says. Carers World Radio asks about the delicate situation faced by carers in the family home who may have a boss who is 'bullying' them back to an unsafe workplace, but who can't get home-care support that is safe. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says if anybody feels they are being pressurised into returning to work, then the Scottish government wants to know about it. National clinical director Jason Leitch adds: ""Anybody who finds they are unable to follow clinical advice for financial reasons, I think is wrong. ""If they can't get that sorted at employer level, they should raise it with their union - if they have one - and raise it with the government or local authority, and we should be able to fix it."" NHS services suspended in Scotland because of coronavirus are to be gradually restarted, the health secretary has announced. Jeane Freeman said pain clinics, dental treatment and cancer referrals would be among the first areas to be restored. Health boards have submitted mobilisation plans to ministers. These will see the return of regular NHS services but also maintain capacity in hospitals for dealing with Covid-19 cases. In addition, ""adjustments"" are anticipated to be made in the coming weeks to the guidelines for vulnerable people in Scotland shielding from Covid-19. Read thefull story here. Jeane Freeman says she wants to build on some of the good practices developed by the NHS in response to the pandemic when re-opening the health service, particularly when dealing with those who live in rural and remote areas. Acknowledging there must be a balance with efficiency and minimising travel and face-to-face time and a relationship with a clinician, the health secretary says new ways of working will continue to be explored. Chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen adds that there has been a ""public acceptance of using digital practice"" and points to areas like the Western Isles, where remote working has been deployed with some success prior to the current crisis. ""While it may be better to see someone in person in the first instance, often that treatment could continue on the phone or online,"" she says, referencing mental health issues. Jeane Freeman has faith that the majority of Scots continue to follow the public health guidance as phase one of easing lockdown coincides with remarkably good weather across the nation. But she does admit to concern at seeing groups together who are not observing safe social distancing. Two metres is not a number we have just dreamed up. It's to stop the virus jumping from one person to another."" Jeane Freeman Asked by The Telegraph if the behaviour of Dominic Cummings was likely to influence people, Ms Freeman added that there was ""not a favourable view"" of the actions of the Prime Minister's chief aide, but that had not stopped people from paying attention to the guidance. Prof Jason Leitch adds that he hopes crowded public spaces this weekend will not result in a spike in infections but says: ""Behaviour today doesn't give you problems tomorrow, that is one of the real problems"". The three-week review on policy is not coincidental, he explains. It is for clinical - not political - reasons, he says, and we will know in roughly two weeks if this weekend's behaviour leads to a leap in new cases. Today's UK government briefing is under way in Downing Street. It is being led by Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick. You canfollow it live here. The UK's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has announced a further 113 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died - taking the total to 38,489. The deaths were recorded as of 17:00 BST on Saturday. Jeane Freeman says she doesn't believe the Scottish government has had ""any assurance"" from UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak that he is prepared to modify his support - via the furlough scheme - for what happens in any of the four UK nations if it is decided that further lockdown restrictions are required. ""We would continue to press that, as part
of the United Kingdom, knowing there has been agreement that we may move at a different pace in
terms of how we ease lockdown restrictions, or whether we re-impose them,"" says the health secretary. ""I would hope support for that
approach is backed by making sure there are no obstacles to it in terms of people being
able to follow strong public health advice from us,"" Ms Freeman adds. She says the Scottish government will continue to have
conversations about the issue with the Treasury and other home nations. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says she does not believe deaths in care homes are being under-reported, as suggested by a question from The Sun. ""I am confident the figures published weekly in Scotland are accurate,"" she says. ""The figures are concerning and every one of those deaths is a loved one lost."" Ms Freeman adds that the issue of excess deaths in the care sector and elsewhere is being ""actively looked at"" in a bid to understand the higher than usual numbers. National clinical director Jason Leitch explains that excess deaths are a ""difficult statistical concept"" and the data is hard to gather before adding that anyone with Covid-19 mentioned anywhere on a death certificate is included in Scotland's mortality figures. PA ask how many contact tracers have been working since the Test & Protect programme was launched on Thursday and how many contacts have been made. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says she does not have those figures but just over 2000 staff were ready to be deployed at the end of last week. ""We have made a commitment to publish that information on a regular basis,"" she says. Prof Jason Leitch adds that he has heard of no problems with the new system in its first three days. Asked by BBC Scotland whetherchanges to shielding guidancein England and Wales has come too early, Jeane Freeman says she has not see what evidence officials might have seen to reach that decision, but is up to them to make decisions for people in those countries. She reiterates how hard it has been, and continues to be, for those shielding in Scotland, but reminds us ""they
are in a very risky position in terms of their own health and steps they need to
protect themselves"". âI want to be able to agree to some easing of restrictions, but have
to make sure our advice to that group of people â hard though it may be to
hear and even harder to put into practice - is absolutely focused on keeping them as

"Amazon has blamed a ""bad actor"" for racist abuse that appeared on multiple listings on its UK website. The abuse, now removed, appeared when users searched the online shop for Apple AirPods and similar products. It was unclear how long the racist language remained on the site, but it sparked outrage on Twitter and the sharing of screenshots and video grabs. ""We investigated, removed the images in question and took action against the bad actor,"" Amazon told the BBC. The company did not elaborate on the ""bad actor"", nor give details of how many products were defaced and how long the abuse was visible on the listings. Nadine White, a journalist for the Huffington Post, tweeted that the abuse ""needs to be acknowledged, removed, explained, apologised for asap. Being Black right now is hard enough; we don't need to be called the N- word while shopping online, to boot"". Another Twitter user said Amazon should have been able to remove the offending messages in minutes. ""They're still on Amazon UK. Extraordinarily poor site administration,"" he said during early hours of Sunday. US blacklists five Amazon foreign websites UK investigates fake reviews on major websites Retailers warned not to 'exploit' coronavirus fears Amazon also allows third-party retailers to sell goods through its website, with the company making about half its retail revenues from this. But the Amazon Marketplace platform has come under scrutiny. There has been concern about counterfeit goods appearing in the listings, and during the coronavirus pandemic Amazon was criticised for not doing enough to stop sellers inflating prices. In April,five Amazon e-commerce websites, including the UK,were added to the US trade regulator's ""notorious markets"" report on marketplaces known for counterfeiting and piracy concerns. Amazon disagreed strongly with the move, saying in a statement that ""this purely political act is another example of the administration using the US government to advance a personal vendetta against Amazon"".

"This video can not be played Robert Jenrick: ""The small changes... will have a huge impact on people's mental health"" The government is taking ""modest"" steps in easing lockdown restrictions, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said. He said he was ""reasonably confident"" the measures would be ""manageable"", but the room for manoeuvre was limited. From Monday in England primary schools will start to reopen and people can meet in groups of up to six. And vulnerable people in England and Wales will be able to go outdoors for the first time in months. Meanwhile,the UK has exceeded its targetto increase coronavirus testing capacity to 200,000 a day by the end of May. Mr Jenrick's comments come aftersome scientific advisers voiced concernsabout the timing of the changes. Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, he confirmedthe updated guidance on shieldingwhich will mean that people who have been advised to stay home since the lockdown began will now be able to go outside either with members of their household or to meet someone from another household. But Mr Jenrick said people in this group should only do what they are comfortable with, adding that the advice would be tightened again if conditions became ""less favourable"". What am I allowed to do now? Some people shielding to be allowed outdoors UK exceeds 200,000 testing capacity target Some patients' groups have expressed concern at the pace of the changes, and have called for the evidence behind them to be published. Confirmation of the changes to the restrictions came as it was announced another 113 people have died in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus. It takes the total number of people who have died to 38,489. On Saturday, Professor John Edmunds, a member of Sage - the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies which advises the government - said the levels of coronavirus were still ""very high"", adding that it was a ""political decision"" to ease measures. ButForeign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the decision to ease lockdown. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the government had ""taken evidence from scientists"" and had met the five tests it said were needed to relax restrictions. ""Because we have made that progress, steadily, slowly, surely - week in, week out - we can very gradually, very carefully, take the steps that we are taking tomorrow,"" Mr Raab said. From Monday, a number of changes will come into effect across England: Primary school pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 can return to school Those in the shielded category will be allowed outdoors, with a family member or to meet one other friend Groups of six people can meet in parks or private gardens, always remaining 2m apart People can exercise outside with up to five othersfrom different households Competitive sport will be allowed to take place behind closed doors Outdoor markets and car showrooms can reopen, provided they are ""Covid-secure"" In Wales, people from two different households will be able to meet each other outdoors from Monday. Groups of four to six people who are not in the same household can meet outdoors in Northern Ireland. And in Scotland members of two different households are already allowed to meet outdoors. A UK cancer charity chief has told the BBC he was concerned about the new guidance allowing those who were previously shielding to go outdoors. ""It's not helpful to bring changes really quickly that we don't know the evidence behind,"" said Alasdair Rankin, Blood Cancer UK's director of research and policy. ""We'd like to see the evidence the decision is based on and for the government to be really transparent.""

"Vulnerable people in England and Wales advised to stay home since the coronavirus lockdown began will be able to go outdoors again from Monday. The change means people will be able to go out with members of their household. Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Support for shielders, such as food and medicine deliveries, will continue. Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed. Who should be shielding? In England, those shielding will be advised that they can go outside once a day, with their household or, if they live alone, to meet one other person at a two-metre distance. In Wales, outdoor exercise for people shielding will be unlimited. Those shielding should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes. Around 2.5 million UK people were advised to stay at home as lockdown began, because they were identified as being at particularly high risk of needing hospital treatment for coronavirus symptoms. Most were notified by their GP. Thelist of people who should be shielding,externalincludes solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pregnant women with heart disease and people with severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and severe asthma.

ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Not all elderly people were asked to shield. Some were later removed from the shielding listif they no longer met the requirements. One of the scientists advising the government, Professor Peter Openshaw, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that we are learning more about the virus: ""I think we're going to be able to fine-tune the advice now and actually reassure some people we feared might be susceptible, that in fact they're not as vulnerable as we thought."" This video can not be played Primary school teacher Lynne Loomes says she has felt ""guilty"" about not being able to go into work with her colleagues Lynne Loomes, a primary school teacher from Gloucestershire, is one of those who has had to stay inside having been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease last year. She told BBC Breakfast that the easing of lockdown measures has made shielding more challenging - especially since she has had to tell her children they cannot go out for socially-distanced meet ups with friends. ""I'm having to say 'no, you can't, because that increases the risk for me',"" she said. ""In terms of day-to-day we've tried to get up as normal. We've tried to keep the routine as if we were going to work,"" she added. ""But it has actually got harder as some of the rules have eased, because we know that it doesn't really change for us as a family."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that ""thousands of lives"" had been saved by those who had shielded themselves. Some scientists have expressed concerns about England's easing of lockdown rules whileinfection rates remain at around 8,000 per dayaccording the Office for National Statistics. ""Many of us would prefer to see the incidence down to lower levels before we relax measures,""said Professor John Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine and one of the government's top advisors. ""Covid-19 spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England,"" tweeted Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said the consensus among scientists was that the new measures were not expected to push the rate of infection above the key R value of 1.0. However, heurged the public to be ""sensible and proportionate with the freedomwe have wanted to give people"", saying the UK is ""at a dangerous moment"" and the easing of lockdown ""has to go slowly"". Reacting to the change, Phil Anderson from the MS Society said thousands of the more than 130,000 people with MS in the UK had been feeling ""forgotten"" after months of shielding. He said they were concerned the news had come ""out of the blue"" and extremely vulnerable people would want to hear ""a lot more about the scientific evidence showing this will be safe for them"". He also called for better mental health support for everyone who needs it. BBC FOOD:Low calorie fakeaways BBC BITESIZE:How long to make a vaccine?

"School governors want ministers to drop plans for all primary pupils in England to return before the summer holidays. The first wave of children is due back from Monday but the government wants all primary pupils in class for the last four weeks of term. This ambition piles pressure on schools ""when actually it wouldn't be safe"", said Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governance Association. Ministers say the return of all pupils will depend on updated safety advice. Last week the schools minister Nick Gibb told MPs any decision on whether all pupils should return would be led by the science, and no decision had as yet been made. No decision on all primary years back to school How do schools double classes with no extra rooms? Many schools have been open to the children of key workers and vulnerable children throughout the lockdown, with all the others attempting to follow the primary curriculum at home. From Monday, the government wants all pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to return to their classrooms, with no more than 15 pupils per class. This means every class of 30 would have to be spread across two classrooms. Under these rules, if all year groups went back, there would not be enough classrooms in the vast majority of primary schools. Ms Knights has written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, ""asking him to review and to drop"" the expectation that all primary pupils should be back at school for the last four weeks of term. ""Unless something dramatic changes very soon in terms of the government's scientific and medical advice, it will simply not be possible for primary schools to invite all pupils back for a whole month of education before the summer holidays,"" she told the BBC. ""Indeed many of them won't be able to invite all pupils back at all before the summer holidays... ""It is adding to uncertainty for parents, but also extra pressure on school leaders and governing boards who think that they need to try and do this when actually it wouldn't be safe."" Mr Williamson has not as yet responded to the letter. Kerry Hill, head teacher at Eyres Monsell primary school in Leicestershire, told BBC Breakfast that her school would not reopen until the middle of June. She said that even then, it will be closed one day a week to all pupils apart from the children of key workers for deep cleaning. A one-way system will be put in place and any non-essential items that could potentially spread the virus, such as toys and soft furnishings, are being removed. ""In our classrooms we can't even fit 15 in and still observe social distancing,"" she said. ""In terms of the logistics, rearranging the entire school and having the available staff to come in and take all of those groups has been incredibly challenging - as well as the logistics of how are we going to do regular cleaning across the day."" She added: ""It is not just about the safety of minimising risks. We know parents are scared, anxious, and our staff a worried, so we're really trying to put in place measures that help keep that trust and confidence."" Just over 2,350 governors shared their plans for the return of pupils with the BBC. Many say, even with the limited numbers due to return in the first phase, they are already having to ask pupils to attend part-time, due to space constraints and the need for deep cleaning to keep the virus at bay. If schools have to spread out classes, how will all year groups be able to return? Of the governors who answered a BBC snapshot questionnaire: just under half (1,099) said their schools would be open to the first phase of pupils on Monday of the rest, most said it would be later in the month About four in five said they were able to accept pupils from all the eligible year groups. About a third of the schools are planning rota systems, for example with one half of pupils attending school for two days at the start of the week, and the other half for two days at the end, with a day for deep cleaning in between. There are wide variations in the numbers of parents who have committed to sending their children to school from Monday, with some schools expecting almost everyone, and others just a handful. Of the 2,350 governors asked whether it would be possible to have all pupils back for the last four weeks of term, 1,682 said this was unlikely or very unlikely. ""It would be physically impossible to bring all pupils back with reduced class sizes - we do not have the extra classrooms or staff to accommodate them safely,"" one governor wrote. ""It is going to be challenging enough to get Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils back into school, respecting all of the social distancing and also providing spaces for key worker and vulnerable children. This will take up all the classroom space in the school and use up all of the staff who are available,"" wrote another. However, another expressed frustration at being unable to welcome all children back to school immediately, saying parents ""need a break and the children are getting feral"". Overall, governors expressed concerns about the pressure placed on themselves and on headteachers by the pandemic. ""I can only say that the professionalism of our team has shone through and for everyone's sake we hope the advice is right and that safe and effective learning returns for some and continued remote learning carries on for others,"" said Nick Horslen, chair of governors at Kings Wood Primary and Nursery School in High Wycombe. ""The situation is a long way from ideal but the creativity and determination to help children is the constant priority."" Schools in Wales do not have a date for returning and schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland are going back in August. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

"Nicola Sturgeon has said people's quality of life is as important as restarting the economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first minister said she was trying to strike a balance between the two after more than nine weeks of lockdown. Ms Sturgeon said Scotland would stay on a ""slow and steady"" route out of restrictions. Scotland is in its third day of eased restrictions with people able to meet with friends and family outside. Follow our live updates here Scotland begins to ease out of lockdown Reassurance over tracer scam potential The sedate stroll out of lockdown Speaking on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, the first minister said the Scottish government was committed to taking a cautious approach because it was clear coronavirus had not gone away. She said: ""It's important to get the economy going as soon as it is safe to do so but I also think it is important we recognise the things that matter most to people's quality of life, and that is family, friendship and love. ""These are all things people have had to sacrifice over the past couple of  months."" The hot weather since the lockdown restrictions were eased has seen more people outdoors than before Ms Sturgeon said that because the virus ""could run out of control again"" there was a limit on the restrictions that could be lifted just now and it ""would be wrong"" to use all of that flexibility to just get the economy moving again. She added that she wanted to avoid a situation where, ""people are being told they have to go back to work and they remain in lockdown for the rest of the time - that would not give very much quality of life to people"". Ms Sturgeon also said there should be a clear distinction between politicians making decisions and scientists advising. The first minister reiterated that changes that mean vulnerable people in England who have been asked to remain at home (shielding) will be able to go outdoors again do not apply in Scotland. Meanwhile, 80 organisations from across different sectors of Scottish life have written to Ms Sturgeon calling for a radical response to the coronavirus recovery. Peter Kelly, director of Poverty Alliance, said: ""As we plan our economic recovery, we must build back better. ""We must design a more just taxation system, provide affordable and accessible public services, build a labour market that works for everyone, and ensure that everyone has an income that meets their needs.""

"Nicola Sturgeon has said people's quality of life is as important as restarting the economy in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first minister said she was trying to strike a balance between the two after more than nine weeks of lockdown. Ms Sturgeon said Scotland would stay on a ""slow and steady"" route out of restrictions. Scotland is in its third day of eased restrictions with people able to meet with friends and family outside. Follow our live updates here Scotland begins to ease out of lockdown Reassurance over tracer scam potential The sedate stroll out of lockdown Speaking on Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday show, the first minister said the Scottish government was committed to taking a cautious approach because it was clear coronavirus had not gone away. She said: ""It's important to get the economy going as soon as it is safe to do so but I also think it is important we recognise the things that matter most to people's quality of life, and that is family, friendship and love. ""These are all things people have had to sacrifice over the past couple of  months."" The hot weather since the lockdown restrictions were eased has seen more people outdoors than before Ms Sturgeon said that because the virus ""could run out of control again"" there was a limit on the restrictions that could be lifted just now and it ""would be wrong"" to use all of that flexibility to just get the economy moving again. She added that she wanted to avoid a situation where, ""people are being told they have to go back to work and they remain in lockdown for the rest of the time - that would not give very much quality of life to people"". Ms Sturgeon also said there should be a clear distinction between politicians making decisions and scientists advising. The first minister reiterated that changes that mean vulnerable people in England who have been asked to remain at home (shielding) will be able to go outdoors again do not apply in Scotland. Meanwhile, 80 organisations from across different sectors of Scottish life have written to Ms Sturgeon calling for a radical response to the coronavirus recovery. Peter Kelly, director of Poverty Alliance, said: ""As we plan our economic recovery, we must build back better. ""We must design a more just taxation system, provide affordable and accessible public services, build a labour market that works for everyone, and ensure that everyone has an income that meets their needs.""

"Latest figures show about 44 patients in critical care with coronavirus in hospitals in Wales A few months ago, NHS England's medical director, Stephen Powis, stated: ""If we can keep deaths below 20,000, we will have done very well in this epidemic."" At the time of writing this article,the figure stands at more than 37,000 people,external. As a palliative care doctor, I have treated a number of people with Covid-19, some of whom have died, and I have also lost colleagues. We have written and rewritten a huge amount of guidance and procedures, ranging from how best to manage agitation and breathlessness in Covid-19, to how best to prepare people for the worst and help them discuss treatment options. What makes this time so difficult is that many of the usual rules of societal norm and behaviour have been thrown out of the proverbial window, due to the high risk that transmission of this virus has created. We have had many discussions in hospitals, community and hospice settings, about how compassion can be combined with strict visiting rules, for instance. As caring health and social care professionals, it is against our nature to prevent loved-ones from coming in to support their seriously ill relatives. Dr Mark Taubert works at Velindre NHS Trust and also teaches at Cardiff University People have pleaded to be with their dying partner, even offering to find their own personal protective equipment (PPE) and accepting the risk should they contract the virus. Others have been understandably afraid of the very real transmission risks and have stayed away, with a broken heart. The grief process can be complex enough in normal times, but we are guaranteed to see huge emotional fallout from this horrendous time in the coming months and years. So it is important that we find ways of communicating well and perhaps putting on not just physical PPE in our response to this pandemic, but also to look at ways of seeking ""emotional and cognitive protection"". Such preparation and responsiveness is under-prioritised at everyone's peril, because preparing for difficult conversations and understanding grief and its stages can help, in order to support ourselves and those around us. A coronavirus patient in Milan speaking to a relative on a tablet One of the early lessons we took from Italy, where the European part of the pandemic had hit very hard in advance of the UK becoming affected, was the high number of patients who were dying alone in hospitals. Family members and loved ones had to stay away, due to the clear risk of contracting coronavirus themselves and causing further spread. Colleagues from Italy warned us to have video messaging software and computers ready, so that families and friends could at the very least be ""with someone"" remotely. We did this and were ready, and many patients took heart from the fact that they could see their loved ones from a hospital bed, some even taking part in normal life events like dinner, with family members who had set up the laptop in their home kitchen. It is often not the complex stuff we crave when we are really ill, but the day-to-day basics. Hospitals have been helping patients communicate with relatives who cannot visit them Knowing what to say when you, as a supporting relative, are zoomed into a hospital room can seem daunting, but we have found that it is the presence that matters most, not the perfect phrase of what best to say to the seriously ill friend or relative. Online versus the real world, there are many new challenges. How on earth do you behave in an online-streamed funeral and what should and shouldn't you say. I'd state that similar rules apply for online, as they do for the real-life events. How to grieve a loved one when you can't say goodbye Doctors urge 'difficult conversations' about death No wake, no funeral, just prayers in a cemetery 'Only close family' at funerals, churches say Many religious organisations have quickly adapted and most funeral homes can now give advice on not only physical but also online attendance. This may go some way to reassure people, but a recent survey suggested many are still afraid of saying the wrong thing. In my experience, people's grief is worsened by the absence of people's offers of help, rather than by attempts to say the right or wrong thing. So the fundamental thing is to show our readiness to provide a listening ear at any time, and that can be via video-messaging, in person or even by WhatsApp. Know what your friend or relative will respond to best and then send them a message. Less is not necessarily more when it comes to grief. I see my recent forays into video consultations as an example to illustrate this: For me and my team, some of the previously held notions have been severely challenged: before Covid-19, I would never have dreamed of communicating bad news, such as progression of cancer on a scan, or the death of a loved one, by telephone or video messaging. But I have had to adapt. And so have many of my colleagues, patients and those close to them. I have shared the key lessons with students and postgraduate doctors. But some of them are relevant to many aspects of life, where perhaps bad news may have to be shared via video-message. Imagine you need to break the bad news that someone in your family has died. Or perhaps you want to express your heartfelt condolences to someone via video. How exactly do you get this right? Perhaps there is no perfect way, but there are some tips I can share. It is important to be in a quiet, undisturbed room. Consider warning those nearby that you are about to have a serious conversation. Regarding the bad news, how much does the person suspect already? Have a plan for what to do next, before making the call, for instance if you can, you may wish to tell the person you are talking to that you will be in touch again tomorrow. A good tip to maintain your ""emotional PPE"", is to take breaks: If I've had multiple difficult phone or video conversations in a short time I take a break in between, as I would with real-life conversations. So should you, if you are conveying information of the death of a beloved family member to the wider family and/or community, one by one. Perhaps someone you trust can help you do this, so that you are not the only one. I've also made the classic error of not taking a toilet break prior to such a difficult call, so do consider the length of time you may be. Is it OK or even safe for them to talk right now? People pick up their smartphone in all sorts of situations and you may have to state that you will call back when they have stopped their car. Are they alone or is there anyone around who can potentially support later? I tend to give a warning shot of what may be coming: I nearly always preface that I have some difficult news. I might say something like: ""I am sorry, but there is some news that is not good, and I wanted to let you know about this."" If someone asks me to stop there, I do so, and offer a further phone or video call later on. They are not ready yet, but will probably feel a need to speak later. They need time to prepare. Tell the news: Give a summary of what you know. I do this with compassion, but also go in without too much prelude (apart from a warning shot) or hesitation. People want to know now, in my experience, so it is best not to make them wait, with too many platitudes. I once heard a healthcare professional talk about how great the weather was, before giving the bad news. What I often do is intersperse the news with occasional questions, checking what the person I am talking to already knows, or if they need a break, but then I try to align this with the newest information. I often find that people have already suspected and thought about the different bad news scenarios. ""Yes, doctor, this is what I was fearing all long."" Don't use jargon, be as clear as you can be. In closing these conversations, I try to bring people back into the now and the next few days. What will you do now? Shall we make a plan together? Are there other people you need to tell? Who is there to support you? I often phone back sooner if there aren't many people to support. I also try to ask the person to summarise a bit about what was talked about. It allows for questions, but we can also sometimes state how hard this all is. Sometimes, the white noise that breaks into our brains after a sentence like: ""Your cancer has spread""  or ""Malcolm has just died"", is so intense, that nothing beyond that is heard or understood. So I never assume that any other points I have tried to cover will be remembered, but a summary at the end can allow the person to come back with questions that are important to them and help clarify things. In Corsica, a nurse writes down a family message to be placed in a coffin In closing, I often make a point of sharing my own sadness about this situation and it sometimes helps people to know how much we care, and that we are all human. It can be a way to help people verbalise their own feelings, if they are perhaps less used to doing so. ""Yes, this is all so strange and sad, and I wish we were not in this terrible situation"", can open up an important discussion about regrets and fears. These sorts of conversations are never easy. Neither is grief. Grief for a lost loved one, or the grief of realising that a cancer has spread and that time will be short. On balance, we all appreciate the ability to have conversations, rather than none at all, so I suspect video and audio conversations are here to stay, even for condolence messages. To get the best emotional and cognitive PPE, we need to understand ourselves and we need to understand grief itself, as hard as that may sound.

"Samantha received a text message telling her she no longer needed to shield Some extremely vulnerable people have been told they have been removed from shielding lists via text message, without the knowledge of their GP. This has caused confusion, with charities demanding clearer guidance for this group as lockdown eases. GPs say they should be notified when their patients are added or removed from the lists. Shielding has now been extended until the end of June and is under constant review, the government says. Around 2.2 million people in the UK are staying at home to protect themselves from the virus because they were told they were at high risk of being seriously ill with Covid-19. But 40 healthcare charities say the lack of a clear plan for their future is causing anxiety and potentially putting their health at risk. Samantha Bruce, 35, from Rotherham, has severe asthma and was told to shield on 25 March. Out of the blue on Friday, she received a text message telling her she no longer needed to shield, and her food deliveries would be stopped. Her first reaction was that it could be a scam, so she called her GP - but he ""didn't have a clue"" why she'd been sent the message. Further investigation by her GP revealed that Samantha no longer ticked the required boxes to shield, based on her medication. Rather than feeling reassured, she was left confused and anxious. ""It doesn't make sense - the virus isn't going anywhere so why is it that suddenly I don't need to shield anymore?"" Samantha is wondering whether to send her son back to school Samantha also has two children - aged four and 10 months - to consider, and her husband is disabled and can't drive. The change in advice has thrown up questions for the whole family. ""Do I let my son go back to school?"" she asks, if her risk increases by taking him there and coming into contact with other parents. She has already decided she ""won't set foot in a supermarket"" anytime soon and has arranged priority deliveries instead. But the fear of contracting the virus is still ""very worrying"". ""If I ended up in hospital I would have to involve my mum and dad with the children, and that's putting them at risk,"" she says. Alison Cook, director of external affairs at Asthma UK and the British Lung Foundation, said they had heard of more people getting these official text messages with no explanation. At the same time, other people have received letters asking them to shield for longer - until the end of June. ""This is an utter mess,"" she said. ""There doesn't seem to be any evidence or logic behind these letters and texts."" CWho should be shielding? The government says all decisions about whether someone should shield are ""clinically led"" - in other words, made by doctors. ""Clinicians are identifying people who had initially been advised to shield from coronavirus but no longer need to do so,"" a spokesman said. GPs say this is a complex process and as the guidance changes, shielding will be relevant to different people. ""However, it is important that as guidance changes, and patients are either added or removed from 'shielding lists' based on conditions they have or medication they are taking, that GPs and relevant specialists are advised about this,"" the Royal College of GPs says. ""This is so that doctors can communicate effectively with their patients, if they have questions."" Sarah would love life return to normal - but she is scared, after staying at home for 50 days Shielding is taking a huge toll on millions of people who have not been outside of their home since March. They include people with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, those who have had bone marrow or stem cell transplants in the last six months and those with severe respiratory conditions, such as severe asthma. What links them is that they are allat high risk of becoming seriously ill with coronavirus,external. As a result, they would have received a letter advising them to shield nearly 10 weeks ago, or been told to do so by their GP. That means they cannot leave their house, meet friends or family or come into contact with someone with coronavirus symptoms. Sarah Davis, 29, a freelance artist and sculptor who lives in London, knows how that feels. She has not left her house for 50 days now. She was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, in 2017 and had to have a stem cell transplant in 2018. The impact on her immune system means she is extremely vulnerable. Shielding started off feeling surreal, now it just ""feels so unending"", Sarah says. She can't exercise properly indoors, she's had to give up all her freelance work and with the easing of lockdown measures for the general population, she feels left behind. ""We have had no new information in weeks. I feel stuck and isolated, unable to work in my art studio or move to a new house as planned,"" she says. ""Having been ill with cancer in the past, I do have coping mechanisms, but it is still a very triggering experience - to be locked away again and not know when it will all end."" Sarah has had to give up all her freelance art work while shielding Sarah wants the plight of people like her to be discussed at a national level so that they feel included in plans for their lives, as valid members of society. She is not alone - a group of 40 healthcare charities has written an open letter to the UK governments, calling for consistent advice on shielding measures for extremely vulnerable people. They include Macmillan Cancer Support, British Lung Foundation and Asthma UK, MS Society, Kidney Care UK and Cystic Fibrosis Trust - who all say more support and advice is needed as members of these people's households start to leave home to go to work or school. Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says patients should contact their GP or hospital specialist if they are in any doubt about whether to shield or not. There is nothing Sarah would like more than to go outside and feel a sense of normality again - but she worries that when that decision is made, it could be for the wrong reasons. ""I don't want to be told to go out when it's not safe,"" she says. ""Staying indoors feels like a new normal - it's scary to come out of that, despite the fact I'd love to do it.""

"Vulnerable people in England and Wales advised to stay home since the coronavirus lockdown began will be able to go outdoors again from Monday. The change means people will be able to go out with members of their household. Those living alone can meet with someone from another household while maintaining social distancing. Support for shielders, such as food and medicine deliveries, will continue. Shielding advice in Northern Ireland and Scotland has not yet changed. Who should be shielding? In England, those shielding will be advised that they can go outside once a day, with their household or, if they live alone, to meet one other person at a two-metre distance. In Wales, outdoor exercise for people shielding will be unlimited. Those shielding should not go out to work, to shop or visit friends in their homes. Around 2.5 million UK people were advised to stay at home as lockdown began, because they were identified as being at particularly high risk of needing hospital treatment for coronavirus symptoms. Most were notified by their GP. Thelist of people who should be shielding,externalincludes solid organ transplant recipients, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, pregnant women with heart disease and people with severe respiratory conditions such as cystic fibrosis and severe asthma.

ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? Not all elderly people were asked to shield. Some were later removed from the shielding listif they no longer met the requirements. One of the scientists advising the government, Professor Peter Openshaw, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that we are learning more about the virus: ""I think we're going to be able to fine-tune the advice now and actually reassure some people we feared might be susceptible, that in fact they're not as vulnerable as we thought."" This video can not be played Primary school teacher Lynne Loomes says she has felt ""guilty"" about not being able to go into work with her colleagues Lynne Loomes, a primary school teacher from Gloucestershire, is one of those who has had to stay inside having been diagnosed with an autoimmune disease last year. She told BBC Breakfast that the easing of lockdown measures has made shielding more challenging - especially since she has had to tell her children they cannot go out for socially-distanced meet ups with friends. ""I'm having to say 'no, you can't, because that increases the risk for me',"" she said. ""In terms of day-to-day we've tried to get up as normal. We've tried to keep the routine as if we were going to work,"" she added. ""But it has actually got harder as some of the rules have eased, because we know that it doesn't really change for us as a family."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that ""thousands of lives"" had been saved by those who had shielded themselves. Some scientists have expressed concerns about England's easing of lockdown rules whileinfection rates remain at around 8,000 per dayaccording the Office for National Statistics. ""Many of us would prefer to see the incidence down to lower levels before we relax measures,""said Professor John Edmunds, from the London School of Tropical Hygiene and Medicine and one of the government's top advisors. ""Covid-19 spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England,"" tweeted Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust. England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said the consensus among scientists was that the new measures were not expected to push the rate of infection above the key R value of 1.0. However, heurged the public to be ""sensible and proportionate with the freedomwe have wanted to give people"", saying the UK is ""at a dangerous moment"" and the easing of lockdown ""has to go slowly"". Reacting to the change, Phil Anderson from the MS Society said thousands of the more than 130,000 people with MS in the UK had been feeling ""forgotten"" after months of shielding. He said they were concerned the news had come ""out of the blue"" and extremely vulnerable people would want to hear ""a lot more about the scientific evidence showing this will be safe for them"". He also called for better mental health support for everyone who needs it. BBC FOOD:Low calorie fakeaways BBC BITESIZE:How long to make a vaccine?

"School governors want ministers to drop plans for all primary pupils in England to return before the summer holidays. The first wave of children is due back from Monday but the government wants all primary pupils in class for the last four weeks of term. This ambition piles pressure on schools ""when actually it wouldn't be safe"", said Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governance Association. Ministers say the return of all pupils will depend on updated safety advice. Last week the schools minister Nick Gibb told MPs any decision on whether all pupils should return would be led by the science, and no decision had as yet been made. No decision on all primary years back to school How do schools double classes with no extra rooms? Many schools have been open to the children of key workers and vulnerable children throughout the lockdown, with all the others attempting to follow the primary curriculum at home. From Monday, the government wants all pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to return to their classrooms, with no more than 15 pupils per class. This means every class of 30 would have to be spread across two classrooms. Under these rules, if all year groups went back, there would not be enough classrooms in the vast majority of primary schools. Ms Knights has written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, ""asking him to review and to drop"" the expectation that all primary pupils should be back at school for the last four weeks of term. ""Unless something dramatic changes very soon in terms of the government's scientific and medical advice, it will simply not be possible for primary schools to invite all pupils back for a whole month of education before the summer holidays,"" she told the BBC. ""Indeed many of them won't be able to invite all pupils back at all before the summer holidays... ""It is adding to uncertainty for parents, but also extra pressure on school leaders and governing boards who think that they need to try and do this when actually it wouldn't be safe."" Mr Williamson has not as yet responded to the letter. Kerry Hill, head teacher at Eyres Monsell primary school in Leicestershire, told BBC Breakfast that her school would not reopen until the middle of June. She said that even then, it will be closed one day a week to all pupils apart from the children of key workers for deep cleaning. A one-way system will be put in place and any non-essential items that could potentially spread the virus, such as toys and soft furnishings, are being removed. ""In our classrooms we can't even fit 15 in and still observe social distancing,"" she said. ""In terms of the logistics, rearranging the entire school and having the available staff to come in and take all of those groups has been incredibly challenging - as well as the logistics of how are we going to do regular cleaning across the day."" She added: ""It is not just about the safety of minimising risks. We know parents are scared, anxious, and our staff a worried, so we're really trying to put in place measures that help keep that trust and confidence."" Just over 2,350 governors shared their plans for the return of pupils with the BBC. Many say, even with the limited numbers due to return in the first phase, they are already having to ask pupils to attend part-time, due to space constraints and the need for deep cleaning to keep the virus at bay. If schools have to spread out classes, how will all year groups be able to return? Of the governors who answered a BBC snapshot questionnaire: just under half (1,099) said their schools would be open to the first phase of pupils on Monday of the rest, most said it would be later in the month About four in five said they were able to accept pupils from all the eligible year groups. About a third of the schools are planning rota systems, for example with one half of pupils attending school for two days at the start of the week, and the other half for two days at the end, with a day for deep cleaning in between. There are wide variations in the numbers of parents who have committed to sending their children to school from Monday, with some schools expecting almost everyone, and others just a handful. Of the 2,350 governors asked whether it would be possible to have all pupils back for the last four weeks of term, 1,682 said this was unlikely or very unlikely. ""It would be physically impossible to bring all pupils back with reduced class sizes - we do not have the extra classrooms or staff to accommodate them safely,"" one governor wrote. ""It is going to be challenging enough to get Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils back into school, respecting all of the social distancing and also providing spaces for key worker and vulnerable children. This will take up all the classroom space in the school and use up all of the staff who are available,"" wrote another. However, another expressed frustration at being unable to welcome all children back to school immediately, saying parents ""need a break and the children are getting feral"". Overall, governors expressed concerns about the pressure placed on themselves and on headteachers by the pandemic. ""I can only say that the professionalism of our team has shone through and for everyone's sake we hope the advice is right and that safe and effective learning returns for some and continued remote learning carries on for others,"" said Nick Horslen, chair of governors at Kings Wood Primary and Nursery School in High Wycombe. ""The situation is a long way from ideal but the creativity and determination to help children is the constant priority."" Schools in Wales do not have a date for returning and schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland are going back in August. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

"The US has been the largest single contributor to the WHO President Donald Trump has been criticised at home and abroad after announcing he is ending US ties with the World Health Organization (WHO). The EU urged him to reconsider the decision, while Germany's health minister called it a ""disappointing setback for international health"". The head of the US Senate's health committee, a Republican like Mr Trump, said now was not the time to leave. Mr Trump said the WHO had failed to hold China to account over coronavirus. The WHO, a UN agency that helps countries promote healthcare and tackle outbreaks of disease, has faced regular criticism from the US president over its handling of the outbreak. Trump's claims against WHO fact-checked He suspended US funding to the WHO last month and on Friday permanently halted the payment, which last year stood at more than $400m (Â£324m; â¬360m), the largest single contribution at around 15% of its total budget. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and top EU diplomat, Josep Borrell, said in a statement: ""In the face of this global threat, now is the time for enhanced co-operation and common solutions. Actions that weaken international results must be avoided. ""We urge the US to reconsider its announced decision."" German Health Minister Jens Spahn described the setback as ""disappointing"" although he accepted the WHO ""needs reform"". ""The EU must take a leading role and engage more financially,"" he said. Mr Trump says the WHO has been a ""puppet of China"" A spokesperson for the UK said: ""Coronavirus is a global challenge and the World Health Organization has an important role to play in leading the international health response. We have no plans to withdraw our funding."" The chair of the US Senate Health Committee, Lamar Alexander, said the move could hamper the discovery of a vaccine against Covid-19 and urged a reversal of the decision in the ""strongest terms possible"". ""Certainly there needs to be a good, hard look at mistakes the World Health Organization might have made in connection with coronavirus, but the time to do that is after the crisis has been dealt with, not in the middle of it,"" he said. Ex-presidential candidate and US Senator Elizabeth Warren tweeted: ""President Trump's decision to leave the @WHO during a global pandemic alienates our allies, undermines our global leadership, and threatens the health of the American people."" Anders Nordstrom, a former WHO acting director general, said he was ""deeply concerned"" the move would increase political tension at a time when ""we need to have global solidarity"". South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize called the decision ""unfortunate"". WHO member states agreed on 19 May to set up an independent inquiry into the global response to the pandemic. Speaking  at the White House, Mr Trump said: ""Because they have failed to make the requested and greatly needed reforms, we will be today terminating our relationship with the World Health Organization and redirecting those funds to other worldwide and deserving urgent global public health needs."" It is not clear when any US withdrawal might take place. A 1948 agreement between the US and WHO allows for one year's notice before pulling out. Mr Trump has accused China of trying to cover up the outbreak of coronavirus, which occurred in the city of Wuhan late last year. He also says that ""China has total control over the World Health Organization"". US-China battle over coronavirus The president accused China of pressurising the WHO to ""mislead the world"" about the virus, without elaborating. This video can not be played Mr Trump has repeatedly criticised China's early handling of the outbreak ""The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,"" he said. The US will redirect its funds for the WHO  to other health groups. More than 102,000 people in the US have lost their lives to Covid-19 - by far the biggest death toll in the world. Opponents say Mr Trump is trying to deflect criticism of his handling of the pandemic ahead of his re-election bid this year. Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian has said that Mr Trump is trying to mislead the public, smear China and ""shift the blame for [the US's] own incompetent response"".

""It all comes back to you, all the stuff that you learned at university,"" Du Plessis told BBC Radio Scotland. Read more At the UK government briefing, a reporter asked if the average number of daily deaths had stopped decreasing and was instead plateauing, as appears to be the case in the latest data shown in the graphic above. Dr Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, said if that were happening, ""we should be really concerned"". But she added: ""We need to be watching over a longer period than a few days, to get a sense of what is happening."" She said people needed to keep abiding with social distancing measures and limiting the amount of social interactions they have. ""It is a critical time, we need to be very careful,"" she added. Jeane Freeman insists Scotland does have the capacity for 15,500 tests a day, as The Herald points out that just over 3,200 were done yesterday, the lowest number since 28 April. The health secretary says part of the strategy is to make sure they are ready for any spike in infections as lockdown measures are eased and that the Test & Protect programme is key in the next steps to overcome the virus. ""We are constantly looking to see what more we can do with that testing capacity, to ensure it is used more effectively,"" she says. Carers World Radio asks about the delicate situation faced by carers in the family home who may have a boss who is 'bullying' them back to an unsafe workplace, but who can't get home-care support that is safe. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says if anybody feels they are being pressurised into returning to work, then the Scottish government wants to know about it. National clinical director Jason Leitch adds: ""Anybody who finds they are unable to follow clinical advice for financial reasons, I think is wrong. ""If they can't get that sorted at employer level, they should raise it with their union - if they have one - and raise it with the government or local authority, and we should be able to fix it."" NHS services suspended in Scotland because of coronavirus are to be gradually restarted, the health secretary has announced. Jeane Freeman said pain clinics, dental treatment and cancer referrals would be among the first areas to be restored. Health boards have submitted mobilisation plans to ministers. These will see the return of regular NHS services but also maintain capacity in hospitals for dealing with Covid-19 cases. In addition, ""adjustments"" are anticipated to be made in the coming weeks to the guidelines for vulnerable people in Scotland shielding from Covid-19. Read thefull story here. Jeane Freeman says she wants to build on some of the good practices developed by the NHS in response to the pandemic when re-opening the health service, particularly when dealing with those who live in rural and remote areas. Acknowledging there must be a balance with efficiency and minimising travel and face-to-face time and a relationship with a clinician, the health secretary says new ways of working will continue to be explored. Chief nursing officer Fiona McQueen adds that there has been a ""public acceptance of using digital practice"" and points to areas like the Western Isles, where remote working has been deployed with some success prior to the current crisis. ""While it may be better to see someone in person in the first instance, often that treatment could continue on the phone or online,"" she says, referencing mental health issues. Jeane Freeman has faith that the majority of Scots continue to follow the public health guidance as phase one of easing lockdown coincides with remarkably good weather across the nation. But she does admit to concern at seeing groups together who are not observing safe social distancing. Two metres is not a number we have just dreamed up. It's to stop the virus jumping from one person to another."" Jeane Freeman Asked by The Telegraph if the behaviour of Dominic Cummings was likely to influence people, Ms Freeman added that there was ""not a favourable view"" of the actions of the Prime Minister's chief aide, but that had not stopped people from paying attention to the guidance. Prof Jason Leitch adds that he hopes crowded public spaces this weekend will not result in a spike in infections but says: ""Behaviour today doesn't give you problems tomorrow, that is one of the real problems"". The three-week review on policy is not coincidental, he explains. It is for clinical - not political - reasons, he says, and we will know in roughly two weeks if this weekend's behaviour leads to a leap in new cases. Today's UK government briefing is under way in Downing Street. It is being led by Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick. You canfollow it live here. The UK's Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has announced a further 113 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died - taking the total to 38,489. The deaths were recorded as of 17:00 BST on Saturday. Jeane Freeman says she doesn't believe the Scottish government has had ""any assurance"" from UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak that he is prepared to modify his support - via the furlough scheme - for what happens in any of the four UK nations if it is decided that further lockdown restrictions are required. ""We would continue to press that, as part
of the United Kingdom, knowing there has been agreement that we may move at a different pace in
terms of how we ease lockdown restrictions, or whether we re-impose them,"" says the health secretary. ""I would hope support for that
approach is backed by making sure there are no obstacles to it in terms of people being
able to follow strong public health advice from us,"" Ms Freeman adds. She says the Scottish government will continue to have
conversations about the issue with the Treasury and other home nations. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says she does not believe deaths in care homes are being under-reported, as suggested by a question from The Sun. ""I am confident the figures published weekly in Scotland are accurate,"" she says. ""The figures are concerning and every one of those deaths is a loved one lost."" Ms Freeman adds that the issue of excess deaths in the care sector and elsewhere is being ""actively looked at"" in a bid to understand the higher than usual numbers. National clinical director Jason Leitch explains that excess deaths are a ""difficult statistical concept"" and the data is hard to gather before adding that anyone with Covid-19 mentioned anywhere on a death certificate is included in Scotland's mortality figures. PA ask how many contact tracers have been working since the Test & Protect programme was launched on Thursday and how many contacts have been made. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman says she does not have those figures but just over 2000 staff were ready to be deployed at the end of last week. ""We have made a commitment to publish that information on a regular basis,"" she says. Prof Jason Leitch adds that he has heard of no problems with the new system in its first three days. Asked by BBC Scotland whetherchanges to shielding guidancein England and Wales has come too early, Jeane Freeman says she has not see what evidence officials might have seen to reach that decision, but is up to them to make decisions for people in those countries. She reiterates how hard it has been, and continues to be, for those shielding in Scotland, but reminds us ""they
are in a very risky position in terms of their own health and steps they need to
protect themselves"". âI want to be able to agree to some easing of restrictions, but have
to make sure our advice to that group of people â hard though it may be to
hear and even harder to put into practice - is absolutely focused on keeping them as
safe as we can,"" she says. Once the health secretary has reached a view, she will communicate that clearly and set out the risks those people continue to face, she says. We will take our time to get it right, notwithstanding I know they are very keen to know what, if anything, can change, even in a small way, to make life easier than it has been. We have not forgotten that group.â Jeane Freeman Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,3.6128768e-05

""In our classrooms we can't even fit 15 in and still observe social distancing,"" she said. ""In terms of the logistics, rearranging the entire school and having the available staff to come in and take all of those groups has been incredibly challenging - as well as the logistics of how are we going to do regular cleaning across the day."" She added: ""It is not just about the safety of minimising risks. We know parents are scared, anxious, and our staff a worried, so we're really trying to put in place measures that help keep that trust and confidence."" Just over 2,350 governors shared their plans for the return of pupils with the BBC. Many say, even with the limited numbers due to return in the first phase, they are already having to ask pupils to attend part-time, due to space constraints and the need for deep cleaning to keep the virus at bay. If schools have to spread out classes, how will all year groups be able to return? Of the governors who answered a BBC snapshot questionnaire: just under half (1,099) said their schools would be open to the first phase of pupils on Monday of the rest, most said it would be later in the month About four in five said they were able to accept pupils from all the eligible year groups. About a third of the schools are planning rota systems, for example with one half of pupils attending school for two days at the start of the week, and the other half for two days at the end, with a day for deep cleaning in between. There are wide variations in the numbers of parents who have committed to sending their children to school from Monday, with some schools expecting almost everyone, and others just a handful. Of the 2,350 governors asked whether it would be possible to have all pupils back for the last four weeks of term, 1,682 said this was unlikely or very unlikely. ""It would be physically impossible to bring all pupils back with reduced class sizes - we do not have the extra classrooms or staff to accommodate them safely,"" one governor wrote. ""It is going to be challenging enough to get Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 pupils back into school, respecting all of the social distancing and also providing spaces for key worker and vulnerable children. This will take up all the classroom space in the school and use up all of the staff who are available,"" wrote another. However, another expressed frustration at being unable to welcome all children back to school immediately, saying parents ""need a break and the children are getting feral"". Overall, governors expressed concerns about the pressure placed on themselves and on headteachers by the pandemic. ""I can only say that the professionalism of our team has shone through and for everyone's sake we hope the advice is right and that safe and effective learning returns for some and continued remote learning carries on for others,"" said Nick Horslen, chair of governors at Kings Wood Primary and Nursery School in High Wycombe. ""The situation is a long way from ideal but the creativity and determination to help children is the constant priority."" Schools in Wales do not have a date for returning and schools in Scotland and Northern Ireland are going back in August. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

"School governors want ministers to drop plans for all primary pupils in England to return before the summer holidays. The first wave of children is due back from Monday but the government wants all primary pupils in class for the last four weeks of term. This ambition piles pressure on schools ""when actually it wouldn't be safe"", said Emma Knights, chief executive of the National Governance Association. Ministers say the return of all pupils will depend on updated safety advice. Last week the schools minister Nick Gibb told MPs any decision on whether all pupils should return would be led by the science, and no decision had as yet been made. No decision on all primary years back to school How do schools double classes with no extra rooms? Many schools have been open to the children of key workers and vulnerable children throughout the lockdown, with all the others attempting to follow the primary curriculum at home. From Monday, the government wants all pupils in Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 to return to their classrooms, with no more than 15 pupils per class. This means every class of 30 would have to be spread across two classrooms. Under these rules, if all year groups went back, there would not be enough classrooms in the vast majority of primary schools. Ms Knights has written to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, ""asking him to review and to drop"" the expectation that all primary pupils should be back at school for the last four weeks of term. ""Unless something dramatic changes very soon in terms of the government's scientific and medical advice, it will simply not be possible for primary schools to invite all pupils back for a whole month of education before the summer holidays,"" she told the BBC. ""Indeed many of them won't be able to invite all pupils back at all before the summer holidays... ""It is adding to uncertainty for parents, but also extra pressure on school leaders and governing boards who think that they need to try and do this when actually it wouldn't be safe."" Mr Williamson has not as yet responded to the letter. Kerry Hill, head teacher at Eyres Monsell primary school in Leicestershire, told BBC Breakfast that her school would not reopen until the middle of June. She said that even then, it will be closed one day a week to all pupils apart from the children of key workers for deep cleaning. A one-way system will be put in place and any non-essential items that could potentially spread the virus, such as toys and soft furnishings, are being removed. ""In our classrooms we can't even fit 15 in and still observe social distancing,"" she said.

"This video can not be played ""Go Nasa, go SpaceX. God speed Bob and Doug"" The private rocket company SpaceX has sent two Nasa astronauts into orbit. It's the first time since the retirement of the shuttles nine years ago that an American crew has made the journey from US territory. Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken are not only trialling a new capsule system, they are also initiating a new business model for Nasa. The agency will no longer own the vehicles it uses but merely purchase the ""taxi"" service offered by SpaceX. Live: Astronauts make history How we got to this point Evolution of the spacesuit Who are the astronauts? Key questions about the mission It was a triumphant day for Elon Musk and his SpaceX company It's hoped companies other than tech billionaire Elon Musk's SpaceX outfit will come in to expand the market. The aerospace giant Boeing already has a contract with Nasa to do so. Mr Musk himself said he was overcome with emotion watching his hardware take the astronauts to orbit. ""I think this is something that should get people right in the heart, of anyone that has the spirit of exploration. And the US is the distillation of the spirit of exploration,"" he told reporters. Doug Hurley (L) and Bob Behnken (R) will be in space for up to four months The new capability the CEO is offering will end the reliance of Nasa on Russian rockets and capsules to get its people to the International Space Station (ISS). It was a point picked up on by President Donald Trump, who came to Florida to watch the launch. ""Past leaders put the US at the mercy of foreign nations to send our astronauts into orbit. Not anymore,"" he said. ""Today we once again proudly launched American astronauts on American rockets - the best in the world - from right here on American soil."" Hurley's and Behnken's Dragon ship left Earth atop its Falcon-9 rocket precisely on time - at 15:22 EDT (19:22 GMT / 20:22 BST). Meteorologists had forecast only a 50:50 chance of favourable conditions around Florida's Kennedy Space Center at lift-off, but, as luck would have it, the weather window stayed open and the SpaceX controllers grabbed their opportunity. The Falcon soared off the spaceport's famous 39A pad to head northeast out over the Atlantic. After two-and-a-half minutes, the lower-stage of the vehicle had separated to return to a drone ship at sea. And after a further six minutes, the crew were safely inserted into orbit. Behnken (far) and Hurley (near) called down to Earth at the end of the day's activities Hurley and Behnken are set to arrive at the ISS on Sunday. They'll use some of the intervening hours to test equipment and procedures in their capsule, including doing some manual flying. Although the Dragon capsule is a fully automated vehicle capable of finding its own way to the ISS, the crew needs to prepare for all eventualities and that means knowing exactly how the ship will behave in their hands. Uniquely, the Dragon has no control stick; all flight commands must be entered via a touchscreen panel. One of their first tasks in orbit was simply to name their ship - in the tradition of past US spacefarers, all the way back to the Mercury programme. Radioing down to Earth, they announced it would be called Endeavour. Doug Hurley said: ""We chose Endeavour for a few reasons: One, because of this incredible endeavour that Nasa, SpaceX and the US have been on since the end of the shuttle programme back in 2011. The other reason is a little more personal to Bob and I. We both had our first flights on shuttle Endeavour and it just meant so much to us to carry on that name."" Endeavour was the ship commanded by British explorer James Cook on his voyage to Australia in the late 18th Century. Crowds were asked to stay away but local beaches were still full The length of Hurley's and Behnken's stay at the ISS is uncertain, but is likely to be somewhere between one and four months. Assuming their return to a splashdown in the Atlantic is as smooth as the launch, Nasa and SpaceX will move directly into the full terms of their new relationship. The company has a $2.6bn (Â£2.1bn) contract with the agency to fly six operational crew missions to the ISS. The first of these should occur at the end August, or very soon after; and will see four astronauts climb aboard a Dragon rather than just the two we saw on this occasion. People line the A.Max Brewer Causeway near Kennedy to watch the launch Saturday's launch went ahead against the background of the coronavirus crisis. Crowds were encouraged not to assemble near the Kennedy complex, and Nasa itself severely limited the number of guests invited on to the spaceport. As for the astronauts, they would ordinarily observe a quarantine before flight. But again Nasa reduced the number of people the men could come into contact with in the weeks running up to launch, and those that had to get close were instructed to wear masks. US President Donald Trump made the trip to Florida to watch the launch For SpaceX, Saturday marked another significant milestone for the company which was founded just 18 years ago. The firm has upended the launcher industry with its reusable vehicles and is now pioneering a new market-driven approach to human spaceflight. It hasn't all been plain sailing - as evidenced by a spectacular explosion at the  firm's prototyping facility in Boca Chica, Texas, on Friday. But the company has routinely proved naysayers wrong, and Nasa believes its relationship with Elon Musk will save billion of dollars that can be diverted to the more complex task of getting people back to the Moon and then to Mars. ""We want to establish a commercial environment in low-Earth orbit so that we can focus on the hard job of exploring beyond our home planet, to establish a sustained presence on the Moon and get to Mars to establish a presence there,"" said Bob Cabana, the director at Kennedy.  ""We can't do that if we're locked here in low-Earth orbit, and commercial crew - that's the beginning of a whole new era of spaceflight."" This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?
