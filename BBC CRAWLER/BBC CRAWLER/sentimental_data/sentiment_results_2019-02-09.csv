"Police officers throw tear gas grenades in Paris during the 13th consecutive demonstration by the ""yellow vests"" A ""yellow vest"" protester in France had his fingers ripped off during clashes at the parliament building in Paris, as the protests went into their 13th week. The protester attempted to pick up a rubber pellet grenade and it exploded in his hand, French media reported. There was also an arson attack on the home of the head of France's National Assembly, though it was not clear if the attack was linked to the protests. The ""yellow vest"" protests began in mid-November over fuel taxes. They have since broadened into a revolt against the President, Emmanuel Macron, and a political class seen as out of touch with common people. According to French government figures, 51,400 people joined the protests on Saturday, 4,000 of them in Paris. That was down from the previous week, when official figures put the number at 58,600, 10,500 in Paris. Representatives for the yellow vests disputed the previous week's numbers, claiming the turnout was higher. In Paris on Saturday, the protesters marched from the Champs-Elysees to the city's parliament buildings, where a violent contingent broke down barriers and threw projectiles at police. Police responded with tear gas and anti-riot munitions. Cars have been set on fire close to the yellow vests' protest in Bordeaux According to an eyewitness, the person who lost their hand was a photographer attempting to take pictures of people breaking down barriers around the National Assembly building. ""When the cops went to disperse people, he got hit by a sting-ball grenade in the calf,"" 21-year-old Cyprien Royer told AFP news agency. ""He wanted to bat it away so it didn't explode by his leg and it went off when he touched it. ""We put him to one side and called the street medics. It wasn't pretty: he was screaming with pain, he had no fingers - he didn't have much above the wrist."" Paris police confirmed that a demonstrator was injured in the hand and been treated by paramedics, but did not identify the victim. The story of the gilet jaunes Who are the gilets jaunes protesters? Voices of the gilets jaunes Tens of thousands of protesters turned out in other parts of France, including the port cities of Marseille and Montpellier and also in Bordeaux and Toulouse in the southwest. Eight police officers were lightly injured during clashes with protesters in Bordeaux, local police said. Politicians came together to condemn the arson attack on the home of Richard Ferrand, a close ally of Mr Macron, in Motreff, Brittany. Mr Ferrand published pictures on Twitter of his scorched living room, writing: ""Nothing justifies intimidations and violence towards an elected official of the Republic."" Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played 'Don't escape you bad little gorilla' Families have described their shock at coming across a chimpanzee outside its enclosure at Belfast Zoo. Chantal Baxter said ""one of the big chimpanzees just appeared from behind a bush"" on Saturday afternoon. Danielle Monaghan said she was ""petrified"" the chimp might ""attack or take the kids"". But the mother of two said the animal was ""not aggressive"" and ""just watched"" and therefore the experience had been ""amazing"". Footage posted on social media shows a chimpanzee on a path with members of the public, while several other chimpanzees remained on the enclosure wall. Belfast Zoo said the chimpanzees made an improvised ladder from a large tree branch propped up against a wall. This is the second escape attempt by animals at the zoo in as many months. In January,a red panda called Amber went missing from the zoo overnightbefore being discovered in a nearby garden. Exotic beasts that roamed Belfast's streets Ms Monaghan, from Holywood, was at the zoo with her two children Grace, eight, Leo, six, her partner Dean McFaul and his four-year-old nieces Summer and Willow. They filmed the entire escape from start to finish, and Ms Monaghan said it was a day she would ""never forget"". This video can not be played One of the chimps ventured a bit further than the others She said they ""could not believe it"" when the ""smart"" chimpanzees started to climb out of the enclosure, and when they went to take a closer look, they ended up ""a foot"" away from one of them. ""I was petrified, obviously, having the kids and I tried not to show fear but inside I was a bit like what happens if it attacks us or tries to take the kids or runs over,"" she told BBC News NI. ""But we just had to stay calm. ""It may have been a different story if it had been aggressive but it absolutely wasn't. It made us feel at ease. We just walked past it and it was absolutely grand."" Ms Baxter, from Larne, said when the chimpanzee appeared before them, her youngest child shouted at it. ""I think she scared it and it did sort of make its way back up the hill,"" she said. One chimpanzee went for a bit of a wander... ""But there were four of them that we could see were out. There was one on the path and there were three of them sitting on the wall. ""We were a bit shocked, obviously, being approached by this big chimpanzee. The kids were shocked. ""I suppose now it's easy to think it was funny, but it was quite dangerous."" Belfast City Council, which runs the zoo, said one chimpanzee ""briefly"" left its enclosure. ""Zookeepers were present as the chimpanzee quickly returned from an adjacent wall to the rest of the group inside the enclosure,"" a spokeswoman said. ... while the others remained on the wall The zoo's Alyn Cairns said: ""We think what has happened is that the trees in their enclosure have been weakened by the storms and so they've been able to break them and use them as a ladder to get out. He said the zoo's chimps were ""quite cowardly"" so went back into their enclosure themselves during the incident. The zoo's Alan Cairns said the ""intelligent"" primates ""got back in themselves"" ""They're intelligent primates and know they're not supposed to be out of their enclosure, so got back in themselves,"" he said. ""We like things to be natural in their enclosure, to have trees in it, but we will review it. ""We may have to remove the trees or make them a smaller level, although we don't want to do that."" The chimpanzees were locked into their inner enclosure after the great escape. Chimpanzees are one of four types of ""great ape"" - the others being bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans Humans and chimpanzees share 95% to 98% of the same DNA Chimpanzees walk on all fours and have longer arms than legs Chimpanzees sometimes hunt and eat small mammals such as bushbuck or monkeys They also eat fruit, nuts, seeds, blossoms, leaves, and many kinds of insects A full-grown chimpanzee has five or six times the strength of a human being Source: Jane Goodall Institute UK Exotic beasts that roamed Belfast's streets New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"Ulster rugby player Darren Cave gave his political views in a candid column for a sport website Ex-international Darren Cave has said his generation ""couldn't stomach"" it if Brexit disrupted the ""unique balance that makes Irish rugby so successful"". In a candid column for theSports Chronicle,external, the Ulster centre said the Brexit deadlock was a ""threat"" to the Good Friday peace deal. ""Being a proud Ulsterman and playing for Ireland should not be complicated in the 21st Century,"" he added. Cave also expressed dismay at the ""very sad state of affairs"" at Stormont. Cave, from Holywood in County Down, has been capped 11 times by Ireland, making his last international appearance in 2015. ""After everything we've been through in Northern Ireland, can you imagine the most successful Ireland captain ever - Rory Best - having to drive through a hard border to play at the Aviva Stadium?"" the 31 year old said. ""How is this good for my generation?"" Cave questioned whether Rory Best would have to ""drive through a hard border"" to captain Ireland in Dublin Cave said he could not remember the Troubles but he viewed the Brexit deadlock as a ""threat"" to the Good Friday Agreement, which led to peace in Northern Ireland. The UK's withdrawal from the EU had ""consumed my thoughts of late"", he said, and it ""deeply concerns my generation as peace is all we have ever known"". Cave also commented on the impasse at Stormont, saying Northern Ireland's politics was ""still in a dreadful place"". ""The political landscape... is a very sad state of affairs,"" he added. ""I don't know how it is going to change as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) versus Sinn FÃ©in saga rumbles ever on with the two communities entrenched on either side."" Cave said the global perception of the Republic of Ireland had ""radically altered"" He said problems with issues such as healthcare and homelessness had been ""ignored"" since the collapse of the Northern Ireland Assembly in January 2017. ""For over two years our elected officials have steadfastly refused to govern,"" said Cave. That meant that societal issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion had not been addressed in Northern Ireland, he added. Recent constitutional referendums in the Republic of Ireland havescrapped the country's ban on abortionandlegalised same-sex marriage. ""What is so depressing is that during this very same period of time the global perception of Ireland, has been radically altered following the [same-sex marriage and abortion] referendums,"" said Cave. ""Gone are so many old perceptions and in their stead appears Dublin, this modern, multi-cultural society.""

"The beach attack targeted tourists Seven jihadists have been sentenced to life in prison in Tunisia over attacks at a museum and a beach resort in 2015. Sixty people, mostly tourists, died in the two attacks and many were wounded. Some of the many defendants received lesser sentences and 27 were acquitted. Prosecutors plan to appeal. The first attack, at the Bardo Museum in Tunis in March 2015 killed 22. Three months later, 38 tourists, most of them British, were shot dead at Port El Kantaoui, near Sousse. The so-called Islamic State group said it had carried out the attacks. The man believed to have planned both, Chamseddine al-Sandi, remains at large. Unconfirmed reports suggested he may have died in a US air strike in February 2016 in Libya. Is it safe to go on holiday in Tunisia? How attack changed Tunisia's security There were two separate trials. In the Sousse trial, four militants were given life sentences, while five others were sentenced to between six months and 16 years. In the Bardo trial, three defendants received life terms and a number of others were jailed for shorter periods. Ten were acquitted. This video can not be played The sounds of gunfire triggered panic and confusion in the museum On 18 March, two gunmen in military uniforms stormed the National Bardo Museum, near the city's parliament buildings, where anti-terrorism legislation was under discussion. Twenty-two people, including 17 foreign tourists, were killed - 21 at the scene and one more 10 days later. Among the dead were citizens from Japan, Italy, Colombia, Australia, France, Poland and Spain. Two Tunisians, one a police officer, were also killed. More than 40 people were injured. The attackers, Tunisian citizens Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaoui, were killed by police. Three months later, on 26 June, a Tunisian electronics student, Seifeddine Rezgui, opened fire on tourists staying in the popular resort of Port El Kantaoui, just north of Sousse. This image of the Seifeddine Rezgui was distributed by IS-linked social media accounts Rezgui was dropped off down a side road, a short distance from the beach, and walked the rest of the way with a Kalashnikov rifle hidden in a parasol. When he arrived at the five-star Hotel Rui Imperial Marhaba, he opened fire indiscriminately at tourists on sun loungers on the beach. As holidaymakers fled for their lives, the gunman continued his attack, entering the hotel complex via the pool area. He killed 38 people before fleeing into the streets, where he was shot by police. Sousse beach attack: how it unfolded A state of emergency has been in place in Tunisia since the attacks. The nation's already faltering tourism industry was badly hit, but it has shown signs of recovery in the past year with travel bans lifted by several countries, including the UK. There has been considerable progress in combating jihadists in Tunisia thanks to concerted international help, according to the BBC's Middle East analyst, Sebastian Usher, but the militants still pose a potent threat while the endemic problems of chronic unemployment and lack of economic opportunity persist. Thirty of the 38 who lost their lives in the beach attack were British. Among the dead were a 24-year-old beauty blogger; a 49-year-old man, his father and his nephew; and several couples on holiday together. Beauty blogger Carly Lovett had recently got engaged to Liam, her childhood sweetheart of 10 years. Adrian Evans, 49, from Tipton in the West Midlands, died along with his father, 78-year-old Charles (known as Patrick) Evans, and nephew Joel Richards, 19, from Wednesbury. A number of married couples lost their lives. William Graham, 51, and Lisa Graham, 50, were in Tunisia to celebrate Mrs Graham's 50th birthday. Tunisia beach attack: The British victims The victims of the Bardo museum attack came from around the world. Three Japanese tourists died, alongside four Italians, three French, two Colombians, two Spaniards, and one national each from Russia and Britain. Two Tunisian citizens, including one police officer, died. More than 50 people were wounded. Most of those who died in the Tunisian beach attack were British How attack changed Tunisia's security Families to sue TUI over Tunisia attack Tunisia coroner rejects neglect call Terror survivor: 'We've had no support' Video, 00:02:07Terror survivor: 'We've had no support' Is it safe to go on holiday in Tunisia?

"Polar bears are forced on to land to look for food as sea ice diminishes A remote Russian region has declared a state of emergency over the appearance of dozens of polar bears in its human settlements, local officials say. Authorities in the Novaya Zemlya islands, home to a few thousand people, said there were cases of bears attacking people and entering residential and public buildings. Polar bears are affected by climate change and are increasingly forced on to land to look for food. Russia classes them as endangered. Hunting the bears is banned, and the federal environment agency has refused to issue licences to shoot them. The bears had lost their fear of police patrols and signals used to warn them off, meaning that more drastic measures were needed, officials said. They say that if other means to scare off the bears fail a cull could be the only answer. Polar bears 'running out of food' The 'face of climate change'? Polar bears travel further on ice The archipelago's main settlement, Belushya Guba, has reported a total of 52 bears in its vicinity, with between six and 10 constantly on its territory. Local administration head Vigansha Musin said more than five bears were on the territory of the local military garrison, where air and air defence forces are based. ""I've been on Novaya Zemlya since 1983,"" he said in an official press release. ""There's never been such a mass invasion of polar bears."" His deputy said normal life was being disrupted by the threat. ""People are scared, afraid to leave their homes, their daily routines are being broken, and parents are unwilling to let their children go to school or kindergarten,"" the deputy head of the local administration, Alexander Minayev, said. With Arctic sea ice diminishing as a result of climate change, polar bears are forced to change their hunting habits and spend more time on land looking for food - which potentially puts them in conflict with humans. In 2016five Russian scientists were besieged by polar bearsfor several weeks at a remote weather station on the island of Troynoy, east of Novaya Zemlya.

Cave, from Holywood in County Down, has been capped 11 times by Ireland, making his last international appearance in 2015. ""After everything we've been through in Northern Ireland, can you imagine the most successful Ireland captain ever - Rory Best - having to drive through a hard border to play at the Aviva Stadium?"" the 31 year old said. ""How is this good for my generation?"" Cave questioned whether Rory Best would have to ""drive through a hard border"" to captain Ireland in Dublin Cave said he could not remember the Troubles but he viewed the Brexit deadlock as a ""threat"" to the Good Friday Agreement, which led to peace in Northern Ireland. The UK's withdrawal from the EU had ""consumed my thoughts of late"", he said, and it ""deeply concerns my generation as peace is all we have ever known"". Cave also commented on the impasse at Stormont, saying Northern Ireland's politics was ""still in a dreadful place"". ""The political landscape... is a very sad state of affairs,"" he added. ""I don't know how it is going to change as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) versus Sinn FÃ©in saga rumbles ever on with the two communities entrenched on either side."" Cave said the global perception of the Republic of Ireland had ""radically altered"" He said problems with issues such as healthcare and homelessness had been ""ignored"" since the collapse of the Northern Ireland Assembly in January 2017. ""For over two years our elected officials have steadfastly refused to govern,"" said Cave. That meant that societal issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion had not been addressed in Northern Ireland, he added. Recent constitutional referendums in the Republic of Ireland havescrapped the country's ban on abortionandlegalised same-sex marriage. ""What is so depressing is that during this very same period of time the global perception of Ireland, has been radically altered following the [same-sex marriage and abortion] referendums,"" said Cave. ""Gone are so many old perceptions and in their stead appears Dublin, this modern, multi-cultural society.""

"Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson The family of the pilot of the plane carrying footballer Emiliano Sala which crashed into the sea have launched a fundraising appeal to find his body. David Ibbotson of North Lincolnshire was flying the Cardiff City player from Nantes to the UK when their plane crashed near Guernsey on 21 January. The footballer's body was recovered from the plane wreck on the seabed, but Mr Ibbotson's body has not been found. Thousands of pounds have been raised on a Gofundme page in a few hours. On the page, the family of Mr Ibbotson, from Crowle, said: ""As a family we are trying to come to terms with the tragedy and the loss of two incredible men. ""To be told the search has now been called off for the foreseeable future has only made this tragic time more difficult. ""We can not bear the thought of him being alone, we need him home so that we are able to lay him to rest."" The appeal has a target of Â£300,000. The AAIB released this photograph of the wreckage of the Piper Malibu found in 63m (205ft) of water north west of Guernsey The Piper Malibu N264DB was en route from France to Cardiff, two days after the Argentine striker's Â£15m transfer to Cardiff was announced. An official search was called off on 24 January after Guernsey's harbour master said the chances of survival were ""extremely remote"". But an online appeal started by Sala's agent raised Â£324,000 (371,000 euros) for a private search led by marine scientist and oceanographer David Mearns. Bid to recover body from Sala plane wreck Sala search boat arrives in Guernsey Who is the man behind the Sala search? Working jointly with the Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Mr Mearns' ship and the Geo Ocean III, began combing a four square mile area of the English Channel, 24 nautical miles north of Guernsey. The plane's wreckage was discovered on Sunday and Sala's body was recovered on Wednesday.

"Melati (seen here with one of her cubs) was mauled to death by the more powerful male Keepers were ""well aware"" of the risks of introducing two Sumatran tigers before the female was killed by her potential mate, London Zoo has said. The male, Asim, killed long-term resident Melati on Friday, 10 days after he was brought over from Denmark. Malcolm Fitzpatrick, senior curator of mammals, said introductions of large predators were ""high risk"" but it was ""important they are moved around"". The zoo is part of breeding programme for the critically endangered mammals. Ten-year-old Melati, who had been at London Zoo since 2012, was mauled by Asim shortly after they were introduced and could not be saved, despite the efforts of staff. Asim (pictured) had been matched with Melati through the European Endangered Species Programme The zoo had hoped the pair would be compatible as their previous male tiger, Jae-Jae, sired seven cubs with Melati before he was moved to French zoo Le Parc des FÃ©lins, on 30 January. Mr Fitzpatrick told the BBC that while the pair had been ""very well bonded... it is important we move them round the zoos as part of the genetic diversity that we need to ensure the population is healthy"". There are thought to be only 300 Sumatran tigers left in the wild. Jae Jae was moved to France last month Speaking about Asim's condition, Mr Fitzpatrick said the tiger had been through a ""traumatic event"" and suffered minor injuries, which were being ""monitored"". He added that the seven-year-old was ""sociable"" at his previous home where he had ""been introduced in an even shorter time to the female there,"" but ""occasionally incidents can happen in zoos with established pairs, and in the wild"". Speaking about the future of the programme, he said the zoo hoped to have another breeding pair of tigers and would use the death to ""evolve"" and ""learn"" for future introductions. Sumatran tigers are the smallest of the five tiger subspecies and have the narrowest black stripes The roar of a tiger can be so loud that it can be heard from two miles away (3.2km) A tiger can bite down with the force of 1,000lb (450kg) From sitting down, a tiger is able to leap forward 33ft (10m) Fossils found in China show tigers could have been alive two million years ago Source: ZSL London Zoo Tiger killed in zoo's mating introduction Meet London Zoo's newest arrivals.

"This video can not be played Elizabeth Warren: 'This is the fight of our lives... to build an America that works for everyone' US Senator Elizabeth Warren has formally launched her bid to stand for the White House in 2020 with a speech in which she promised to tackle economic inequality. She is the latest Democrat to launch a campaign to become the party's presidential candidate. Even before she had taken to the stage, President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign team had responded calling her a fraud. It is the first such intervention to target a possible Trump contender. ""The American people will reject her dishonest campaign and socialist ideas like the Green New Deal, that will raise taxes, kill jobs and crush America's middle-class,"" Mr Trump's campaign manager Brad Pascale wrote. He also accused her of ""impersonating and disrespecting"" Native Americans ""to advance her professional career,"" referring to a DNA test she took to prove her Cherokee ancestry. Mr Trump had long been calling her ""fake Pocahontas"". Ms Warren has apologisedfor taking the test. In her speech on Saturday in Lawrence, in her home state of Massachusetts, Ms Warren called Mr Trump ""the latest and most extreme symptom of what's gone wrong in America, a product of a rigged system that props up the rich and powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else"". Which Democrats are running in 2020? She added: ""This is the fight of our lives, the fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone."" In the shadow of long-unused smoke stacks, at the site of a famous factory strike more than a century ago, Elizabeth Warren formally launched her presidential bid. She used the backdrop to highlight what she sees as the plight of an American working class that has been left behind by rapacious big business and indifferent government. Despite sub-zero temperatures and a blustery wind, an estimated crowd of several thousand turned out to hear the Massachusetts senator pledge to fight corruption in Washington, level the economic playing field and reform the US democratic process. Warren enters a crowded presidential field, as Democrats tell pollsters they want to find the candidate most able to beat Donald Trump. There were some in Ms Warren's campaign kick-off crowd who expressed concern that her struggles to explain her past claims of Native American heritage could make her vulnerable to attack. Ms Warren has long been a star in the progressive left, however, and she has already built a formidable nationwide campaign. She has just under a year to make her case, before voters start rendering their judgement. Senator for Massachusetts since 2012 Born in Oklahoma, she now lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts Former Harvard law professor Co-author, with her daughter, of two books about household economics On the left of the Democratic party She switched from the Republican party to the Democrats in the 1990s Proposed a 2% wealth tax on those with $50m or more The phrase ""Nevertheless, she persisted"", used about her after a debate in 2017, was picked up as a feminist slogan Warren apologises to Native American tribe Warren takes step toward presidential run Trump in Pocahontas jibe at Navajo event Bernie's heir - who will lead the left in 2020?

Lots of his tracks were on the playlist last year, and even as we speak at the moment one of them is on the A-list, so it's one of the tunes that gets played the most. To see this happen to an artist just as he's about to break through is a really sad thing. He's from Gypsy Hill in south London and he started out in a crew called Gipset with Krept and Konan. He's consistently being putting out music - the Commitment and the Commitment 2 are probably two of the most known pieces of work he'd put out. He got so much recognition from those projects alone and lots more people have been paying attention to his music. He's worked with Krept and Konan, two of the biggest rappers in the UK, Donae'o and Deno Driz on Advice, which is probably one of the biggest tunes he put out there. It's quite a small scene so when something like this happens everybody within this industry knows it's happened. There's no doubt in my mind that he would have been playing at so many different places this summer because he's got so many big songs out at the moment and loads in the pipeline. In 2015, Krept brought Cadet on stage with him at Wireless Festival and this summer the rapper was due to perform at the festival. In a statement, Wireless said: ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family, friends and fans, of Cadet. ""Such sad news. ""We'll be keeping his Wireless performance as a time to reflect on the memory of Blaine."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Thousands of bus routes in England are under threat because councils have said they cannot afford to pay for them. They blamed an ""unsustainable"" funding gap of Â£652m in the free bus pass scheme, which local authorities have been forced to fill. Councils subsidise 44% of English bus routes but they warned that, without more funding, these could be cut. The government said it provides Â£250m a year to support bus routes and Â£1bn for free bus passes. Councils are required by law to reimburse bus operators for carrying passengers who hold a free off-peak bus pass, such as the over-65s and disabled people. Bus journeys fall by 90 million Reality Check: Does your council have to keep the buses running? Bus journeys: Your questions answered The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said that the gap between government funding for the free bus pass scheme and the actual costs has soared from Â£200m in 2016 to Â£652m in 2017/18. That increasingly means they have less money to spend on supporting rural bus services, as well as other optional forms of subsidy such as free peak-time travel for pass holders, post-16 school transport or support for young people's travel. The LGA is calling for the government to return to fully funding the costs of the free bus pass scheme in the Spending Review this year. Councillor Martin Tett, the LGA's transport spokesman, said: ""Properly funding the national free bus pass scheme is essential if the government wants councils to be able to maintain our essential bus services, reduce congestion and protect vital routes. ""If this is not addressed in the Spending Review it could lead to older people having a free bus pass but no bus to travel on."" The LGA said more than 3,000 routes have already been withdrawn, altered or reduced since 2010/11. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: ""It is for councils to decide which bus operations to support in their areas, but we help to subsidise costs through around Â£250m worth of investment every year."" She said that Â£42m of this sum goes to local authorities and an additional Â£1bn is used to fund free bus passes.

"As of January, there had been more than 153 appeals against fines for using the bus gate A psychologist fined for driving through a bus gate has won her appeal after arguing there were too many signs for the brain to process. Bernardine King's penalty charge notice (PCN) was quashed after a tribunal ruled signage was ""inadequate"". Essex County Council has taken Â£1.5m after 54,000 drivers were fined using the Chelmsford bus gate in 18 months. It said the PCNs had seen the number of people using the gate ""reduce to less than a quarter"" of the figure before. This video can not be played Psychologist Bernardine King said there were too many signs for drivers to take in by the bus gate Dr King - who has published several academic papers on how people process visual information - said the bus gate, a short section of road blocked off to all traffic except buses, cycles and taxis, was ""endangering lives"" ""Once you're committed to turn left on Duke Street, you have no way of safely turning around,"" she said. Council 'making money' from drivers Just one fine upheld at city's bus gate Bridge cameras catch 8,500 speeders ""Drivers are being trapped in the area and they're panicking. ""There are so many signs by the bus gate but a little contradiction in the brain means we cannot absorb all the information. ""To consciously process all the information, it may take a few seconds and by that point, you've already travelled 20ft or 30ft down the road."" The location of height restriction signage in the city implies the bus gate comes after the railway bridge - but it does not After visiting the site, the traffic penalty adjudicator said that although some of the signs by the bus gate were large and easily visible, they were ""cluttered"" together and meant ""drivers could be confused"". Dr King, who received her PCN in November, is now calling on the council to carry out a safety review of the bus gate, which she called ""a blight on Chelmsford"". An Essex County Council spokesman said: ""Before turning on enforcement cameras in 2017, we increased signage at all junctions, sent more than 3,000 warning notices and painted the words ""BUS GATE"" in five-foot high letters on the road at both entrances to help make drivers aware of the restrictions."" He added that all money generated by fines was ""reinvested to help improve public transport, roads and the transport network across Essex"".

"Seaborne Freight planned to launch services from Ramsgate by Brexit day on 29 March The government has axed its no-deal Brexit contract with a ferry company which had no ships, after the Irish company backing the deal pulled out. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had faced criticism for the Â£13.8m deal with Seaborne Freight, which the BBC found had never run a ferry service. The government said it is in ""advanced talks"" to find another ferry firm. But local MP Craig Mackinlay said this could be the ""last throw of the dice"" for commercial shipping from Ramsgate. Meanwhile, Labour has called on Mr Grayling to resign or be sacked, describing him as ""the worst secretary of state ever"". Could Channel ports cope with no-deal Brexit? No-deal Brexit ferry contract queried A really simple guide to Brexit What preparations are being made for a no-deal? Seaborne Freight was awarded the Â£13.8m contract in December to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend, Belgium, in the event that Britain leaves the EU without a deal. The governmentwas criticisedfor choosing Seaborne Freight, a company with no ships or trading history, and for leaving too little time to establish the new ferry service before the Brexit deadline of 29 March. And local politicians in both Ramsgate and Ostendwarnedthat the ports at both ends of the route will not be ready the deadline. At the time, the government said it awarded the contract ""in the full knowledge"" that Seaborne, which was formed in April 2017, was ""a new shipping provider"" but said the company had been ""carefully vetted"". On Saturday,the Daily Telegraph,externalreported that Arklow Shipping, a major Irish shipping firm, withdrew its support from Seaborne ""without warning"". The Department for Transport (DfT) said that it had become clear that Seaborne ""would not reach its contractual requirements"", after Arklow Shipping backed out of the deal. A spokesman said: ""The government is already in advanced talks with a number of companies to secure additional freight capacity - including through the Port of Ramsgate - in the event of a no-deal Brexit."" The Port of Ramsgate has not had a regular ferry service since 2013 Thanet District Council - which covers Ramsgate - said it was ""disappointing"" that Arklow Shipping had pulled out of the deal. It said it was in talks with the DfT about the port's role ""in terms of supporting Brexit resilience"". The council has been pumping money into the port to get it ready for ferry services. Earlier this week, it was considering cutting its budget for the port but, at the request of Mr Grayling,delayed its decision. Ramsgate has not had a regular ferry service since 2013 and needs to be dredged before services can start. Following the news that Seaborne Freight had lost the contract, the Conservative MP for South Thanet, Mr Mackinlay, said ferry companies had ""come and gone over the last few years"" but ""none of them have come to anything"". ""For me, this Seaborne operation was potentially the last throw of the dice for a chance for commercial shipping out of Ramsgate,"" he said. ""Perhaps it is time that we turned the page on Ramsgate port being for commercial activity and we can start doing something rather more exciting on those acres of land, potentially a marina village, hotels, restaurants, some housing, something really exciting that I think would be more welcomed by many people in Ramsgate."" Andrew Gwynne, the shadow secretary of state for communities and local government, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is yet again another indication of a government that had no plan for Britain should we leave the European Union without a deal. ""It's another example of a major disaster in the hands of Chris Grayling who must be classed as the worst secretary of state ever."" The government said that no taxpayer money has been transferred to Seaborne. It added that its confidence in the viability of the deal with Seaborne was based on Arklow Shipping's backing of the company and the assurances it received from them.

"Concerns have been raised over the readiness of a British firm contracted by the government to run extra ferries in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Seaborne Freight was awarded a Â£13.8m contract this weekto run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend. The firm has never run a ferry service and a local councillor said it would be impossible to launch before Brexit. The government said it had awarded the contract in ""the full knowledge that Seaborne is a new shipping provider"". The Department for Transport said that ""the extra capacity and vessels would be provided as part of its first services"". ""As with all contracts, we carefully vetted the company's commercial, technical and financial position in detail before making the award,"" it added. UK to spend Â£103m on no-deal ferries Brexit: A really simple guide Firms told to prepare for no-deal Brexit 'Six months of jams' under no-deal Brexit Conservative Kent county councillor Paul Messenger said it was impossible for the government to have carried out sufficient checks on the firm. ""It has no ships and no trading history so how can due diligence be done?"" he asked. Paul Messenger says Seaborne is a perplexing choice Mr Messenger said he didn't believe that it was possible to set up a new ferry service between Ramsgate and Ostend by 29 March - the date when the UK is due to leave the European Union. The narrow berths for ships at the Port of Ramsgate mean there are only a few suitable commercial vessels, most of which are currently already in service, he said. Ferry services have not operated from Ramsgate Port since 2013 after cross-channel operator TransEuropa collapsed, owing around Â£3.3m to Thanet District Council. Mr Messenger said he was ""perplexed"" at the choice of Seaborne Freight to run the service. ""Why choose a company that never moved a single truck in their entire history and give them Â£14m? I don't understand the logic of that,"" he said. But Seaborne Freight, which was formed less than two years ago to revive the Ramsgate-Ostend line, insisted it will launch its freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend before 29 March. UK ports face 'major disruption', MPs warn Brexit: Exports 'could be stuck at border' Chief executive Ben Sharp said the firm had been founded by seasoned shipping veterans. He declined to give details on which ships it planned to use for the service, saying the information was commercially sensitive, but said they planned to start operations with two ships before ""very quickly"" increasing to four by late summer. He said dredging in Ramsgate Port would start on 4 January in preparation for the freight service. The firm said it had originally intended to start the service in mid-February but this had now been delayed until late March for operational reasons. It said directors and shareholders had been working during the past two years to restart the service. ""This phase has included locating suitable vessels, making arrangements with the ports of Ostend and Ramsgate, building the infrastructure, as well as crewing the ferries once they start operating,"" the firm's statement added. The government has also awarded additional, much larger ferry contracts to French company Brittany Ferries and Danish shipping firm DFDS, worth Â£46.6m and Â£42.5m (â¬47.3m) respectively. The new contracts are part of the government's contingency planning, which aims to ease the potential for severe congestion at main port Dover if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal. The department has warned that increased border checks by EU countries in the case of a no-deal Brexit could ""cause delivery of critical goods to be delayed"", and ""significant wider disruption to the UK economy and to the road network in Kent"". By Joe Miller, BBC business correspondent The government has for some time now acknowledged that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, contingency plans at ports other than Dover would need to be in place. But it appears that Transport Secretary Chris Grayling's department only started awarding contracts to shipping firms a few weeks ago, with no time left, it says, for a full public tender process. And while the two large international firms enlisted to provide extra capacity have existing fleets and large operations, Seaborne does not, and has given few details on how it will get a service up and running in a matter of months. The Department for Transport also wasn't too keen on making much noise about these plans - it quietly posted notices of the awards on an EU portal on Christmas Eve, and the BBC was only alerted to them by a data firm, Tussell. And it's worth noting that without the award to Seaborne, the government would be in a position where the two beneficiaries of a no-deal Brexit were a Danish and a French firm - based, of course, in the EU. The Department for Transport says the new contracts will provide ""significant extra capacity"" to UK ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, The BBC understands that the three firms chosen are likely to retain a portion of their award even if their services are no longer needed, due to a deal being reached with Brussels. However, in that event, the government would then seek to sell the extra capacity back to the market. Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, a supporter of the Best for Britain campaign for a second referendum, said: ""Never has it been clearer that our government is selling us down the river over Brexit. ""A firm that has never run a ferry service before has been awarded a multi-million pound contract and they don't even have any ships. This idea should have been sunk before it saw the light of day."" Ed Davey, home affairs spokesperson for the Liberal Democrats, said reports that the government had signed a contract with ""a ferry company with no ferries"" summed up the government's ""farcical"" approach to Brexit.

The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March - following the result of the 2016 referendum. It and the EU have agreed a withdrawal agreement - or ""divorce deal"" - and a political declaration outlining ambition for future talks - but it needs to be agreed by Parliament for it to come into force. A vote by MPs on the deal had been scheduled for 11 December, but Prime Minister Theresa May postponed it until January when it became clear her deal would be rejected, leading to widespread anger in the Commons.

"FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland at Murrayfield Murray, Stockdale & Earls with the tries for Ireland Johnson with single try for Scots who lost Stuart Hogg to injury Jamie Lyall FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland Well, that was a ferocious contest and a pretty exciting one. Ireland's guile and ruthlessness got them over the line against a Scottish side that sparkled and infuriated in equal measure. Plenty more rugby to come across the BBC this weekend and beyond. Thanks for your company and enjoy the rest of your Saturday. FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland Gregor Townsend says he was disappointed his side could not sustain the pressure on Ireland over the entire game, despite a strong first-half performance. ""They're obviously disappointed, the effort the players put into the first-half was outstanding, how they implemented the game plan we worked on all week and put Ireland under pressure,"" the Scottish head coach said. ""We just didn't kick on in the second half, it was pretty flat for both teams, the energy dropped, we were disappointed with the execution, that's on my head as a coach. ""I felt we dominated that first half, a lot of that was through how we defended as well as how we attacked - it's a message for our players that we can play at that level and create more opportunities. ""But just that accuracy that's required to beat the top teams, that needs to be over 80 minutes, not 40."" FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland BBC One Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt said:""I think we just muscled our way through it. We restricted them to an intercept try and it was a massive defensive effort. Johnny Sexton got a bit of treatment out there and he got a stamp on the head but he is feeling better and we expect him to be back in the next couple of weeks. ""Scotland are a good team who play in a really positive manner."" On Joey Carbery's performance:""Throwing that intercept pass knocked his confidence a little bit but he recovered well and he is a guy that is growing. The more often he plays, the more comfortable he will be in the role."" #bbcrugby namelessopinion:Disappointing end after a promising first half. Lost the momentum. Hats off to Ireland, they know how to get to grips, adapt and take the win. brianchucky:Scotland losing that one because of poor execution on offense and no obvious attacking plan. Ireland went ahead and played to defend the lead but their intent was obvious from the onset. FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland Andy NicolFormer Scotland international on BBC One Scotland's physicality was there in the first half, and so was the creativity. But there were so many errors in the second half they just lost momentum. FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland Stuart McInally admitted the Scottish team could not deal with Ireland's pressure, and praised their ""excellent"" defence. ""We were too knackered, we couldn't really string a few phases together. That's credit to the Irish team, they put us under heaps of pressure, but we'll work hard and try and be better for next week,"" the hooker said. ""We felt really good in defence, marched them back numerous times then they scored two really cheap tries."" FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland Scotland captain Greig Laidlawhas a few choice words for referee Romain Poite in his post-match interview. ""Romain Poite picked us up in the middle of the field, Sean O'Brien's reefed the ball out and he's given a knock-on right in front of him,"" Laidlaw said. ""He doesn't seem to like us, Romain. He refereed us against South Africa as well and we don't seem to see eye-to-eye. We're not going to blame him, we look at ourselves, and credit to Ireland."" FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland Ireland captain Rory Beston BBC One: ""We have a lot of belief in what we're doing and how good a team we are. That was a really tough game, and it was tough mentally in the build-up to it. We asked for a physical reaction and by and large we got that. ""We had a couple of chances and we took them and were quite clinical. We've got a lot of improving to do. ""Joey Carbery has flourished since moving to Munster and starting regularly. We trust the players to come off the bench and step up as Joey did."" FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland Tony WardFormer Ireland fly-half on BBC Radio Ulster It wasn't pretty. It was an error-ridden second-half by Scotland but Ireland supplied the pressure and they had Scotland in a vice-like grip. I can't remember a mistake by Ireland in the second half which was in contrast to their performance in the first. Ireland are not particularly pretty on the eye, there's nothing new there, but when they get their performance right they are very hard to beat and that's what happened today. FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland Paul O'ConnellFormer Ireland captain on BBC One I don't think Ireland particularly played well. Scotland were so accurate in the first half but it just flipped after the break. All of the hosts' momentum was lost and Ireland could slow the game down. FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland Jamie HeaslipFormer Ireland international on BBC One Peter O'Mahony is the man of the match for his work rate throughout the field. Devin Toner was out but he stepped up to the plate and he has put his hand up again in showing what a great leader he is. FT: Scotland 13-22 Ireland Peter WrightFormer Scotland prop on BBC Radio Scotland It's been another game where we could have won if we cut out the errors. Second half was really disappointing, too many errors in the wrong areas and we couldn't sustain the pressure we did in the first half. You've got to be ruthless - Ireland have taken their chances and Scotland haven't.  Job done for Joe Schmidts Ireland. Their canny game-management came to the fore in that second half, as they inexorably eased their way to a vital win. Scotland played so much fine rugby, but made so many infuriating mistakes that killed their momentum. This one will sting for Gregor Townsend and his team. Scotland 13-22 Ireland Scotland win a scrum penalty and Russell kicks them down towards the Irish 22. They can't retain the line-out, though. Dillane gets his paws on it and Ireland steal. That pretty much sums up Scotland's second-half performance. Maddening stuff from the hosts.  Scotland 13-22 Ireland Tony WardFormer Ireland fly-half on BBC Radio Ulster It's been an immeasurably better Irish performance in the second half overall but especially in terms of imposing themselves physically on the Scots. In contrast, I think Gregor Townsend will be bitterly disappointed with aspects of the Scottish performance not only in terms of knock-ons but they've conceded costly penalties that have allowed Ireland off the hook too often. Scotland 13-22 Ireland Jamie Ritchie blazes into a ruck from the side and Ireland have a penalty and the ball in Scottish territory. The flanker didn't have much choice - if he didn't attempt some sort of clear-out, Ultan Dillane was going to win a turnover. Ireland are almost home and dry now...

"Jamal Khashoggi had gone to Istanbul to obtain a marriage document The Trump administration has refused to respond to a request from Congress to provide a report determining who killed the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Senators wrote in October demanding the murder be investigated and that the White House give more information. An administration official said the president was within his rights to decline to act. Khashoggi was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October last year. He was a strong critic of the Saudi government. His body was reportedly dismembered and has still not been found. US intelligence officials have reportedly saidsuch an operation would have needed the approval of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.,external Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? Why the Khashoggi crisis is far from over And on Saturday Baroness Helena Kennedy, member of a UN team of international experts who visited Turkey to investigate the murder, told the BBCthe murder was planned at the highest level. But Saudi officials insist he was murdered by a ""rogue"" team of Saudi agents not acting on the prince's orders. An administration statement said Mr Trump ""maintains his discretion to decline to act on congressional committee requests when appropriate"". However, Democratic senators told the New York Timesthe president was in breach of the so-called Magnitsky Act,,externalwhich requires a response within 120 days to requests from Senate committee leaders. That deadline passed on Friday. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has written to Senate leaders describing actions taken against individuals. However, the documents do not indicate who was responsible for Khashoggi's death, as demanded by the senators. The US has imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, including Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the crown prince who, it alleged, was ""part of the planning and execution of the operation"" that led to Khashoggi's murder. But Mr Trump has faced criticism from senators for failing to condemn the crown prince directly.

"This video can not be played PC Rob Pedley: ""You're carrying the county's number one murder weapon"" More than 1,000 10 to 19-year-olds were admitted to hospital with knife wounds in 2017/18. The figure, from NHS England, reveal a 54% rise in the number of children and teenagers treated for injuries from knives over five years. It comes as a leading consultant warns that she is seeing increasing numbers of girls involved in knife crime. Doctors also said that injuries were becoming more severe and victims getting younger. The figures record the number of people admitted to hospital for an overnight stay or longer, for knife crime injuries between 2012-13 and 2017-18. Among victims aged between 10 and 19, the numbers went up from 656 to 1,012 last year. Admissions have also grown by 30% across all ages, from 3,849 in 2012-13, to 4,986 last year. Doctors said the numbers could be even higher, as victims who received treatment in A&E for minor knife crime injuries were not recorded. Dr Martin Griffiths, consultant trauma surgeon at The Royal London Hospital, said: ""We are seeing a lot more adolescents and young people with severe injuries. That used to be an occasional occurrence, now it is the norm. ""This week I expect to see someone of school age as a matter of course. ""I see the wasted opportunities of young people stuck on hospital wards with life-changing injuries."" This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? Dr Gayle Hann, the lead for paediatric A&E at North Middlesex Hospital, pointed to the rising numbers of girls becoming involved. ""It used to be that we rarely saw girls and young women, but now we are seeing increasing numbers as both victims and aggressors. ""Young women are coming in who have had their mobile phones taken off them in an attack, then had their attack filmed as part of their humiliation. ""They are then told that if they say anything their attackers will put the video on the internet."" Dr Hann said knives are also getting bigger: ""I used to take kitchen knives off people, now we are seeing zombie knives."" Knife crime deaths at highest level since WW2 Is another year of rising knife crime ahead? Patrick Green, chief executive of the Ben Kinsella Trust, a charity which campaigns against knife crime, said: ""This is a crisis. Many young people see no other alternative for them than to carry knives in their environment. ""Youth workers in hospitals who are providing ongoing support to young people are making a big difference. ""But we need to prevent them getting there in the first place, and educate them to make better choices."" Dr Griffiths said the Royal London Hospital had done work with the charity St Giles Trust to reduce the numbers of young victims of knife attacks returning to hospital with further injuries. ""We've dramatically reduced readmissions by giving our victims of injury a case worker who will meet them in the hospital, and give them a further six months of bespoke care in the community"" he said. ""The best results are obtained by consistent, nurturing bonds. ""Knife violence is endemic. We all have a responsibility to engage with supporting youth to address this."" In January, Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced new knife crime prevention orders which can be issued by police to anyone aged 12 or over who is believed to be carrying a blade. The Asbo-style orders would give police more power to impose curfews, send young people caught with knives to educational courses and - in some cases - restrict their social media use to prevent rival disputes escalating.

"Princess Ubolratana has not addressed the issue of the ban directly The party that nominated a Thai princess to run for prime minister has said it will comply with the king's wishes after he opposed the move. Thai Raksa Chart is allied to divisive ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. On Friday, King Vajiralongkorn denounced his sister Princess Ubolratana Mahidol's unprecedented bid for political power as inappropriate. The candidacy would have broken with the tradition of the Thai royal family publicly staying out of politics. The party said it complied ""with the royal command with loyalty to the king and all members of the royal family"". A palace statement had said such an act would ""defy the nation's culture"". Thailand: Land of military coups Why Thais said yes to new constitution Broadcast on all Thai TV networks, the statement said: ""Even though she has relinquished her royal titles in writing, she maintained her status and carried herself as a member of the Chakri dynasty. King Vajiralongkorn says the princess retains her status as a member of the royal family ""Involvement of a high-ranking member of the royal family in politics, in whatever way, is considered an act that defies the nation's traditions, customs and culture, and therefore is considered extremely inappropriate."" The statement cited a passage of the constitution that says the monarchy should maintain political neutrality. Next month's vote is being closely watched as the first chance for Thailand to return to democracy after five years under military rule. Analysts say the king's intervention would in any case have been likely to have led to the election commission disqualifying her from the 24 March election. By the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok After unusually blunt criticism from King Vajiralongkorn, the Thai Raksa Chart party had no choice but to accept his instruction that members of the royal family could not be brought into politics. That ends a bold gambit by the anti-military coalition to boost its popularity and insulate itself against charges of being anti-monarchy, by having the king's flamboyant older sister Ubolratana run for prime minister, although her nomination cannot be legally withdrawn. Ultra-royalists are now demanding that Thai Raksa Chart be dissolved. That would leave the largest party in the coalition, which is aligned with exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, still contesting the election, but without an important partner. Coalition sources say they believed they had the king's acquiescence for his sister to run in the election. If that is the case, either there was a misunderstanding, or he changed his mind. Hours earlier, Princess Ubolratana defended her decision to run for office. In an Instagram post, she reiterated that she had relinquished all her royal titles and now lived as a commoner. She said she wanted to exercise her rights as an ordinary citizen by offering her candidacy for prime minister. She said she would work with all sincerity and determination for the prosperity of all Thais. Shortly after the king's statement she posted again without addressing the issue directly, simply thanking Thais for their support and saying that she wanted Thailand to ""move forward and become admired and accepted by the international community"". Born in 1951, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi is the eldest child of Thailand's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He died in 2016. How King Bhumibol shaped modern Thailand She attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and after marrying an American in 1972 she gave up her royal title. After her divorce she returned to Thailand in 2001 and once again started participating in royal life. The princess engages actively in social media and has also starred in several Thai movies. She has three children, one of whom died in the 2004 Asian tsunami. The other two now also live in Thailand. It will be the first vote since current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha took power in 2014, overthrowing the democratic government and ousting ex-PM Yingluck Shinawatra, the younger sister of Mr Thaksin. Who is Prayuth Chan-ocha? Both Mr Thaksin and his sister live in self-imposed exile but remain a powerful force in Thai politics, with many in the country remaining loyal to them. Prayuth Chan-ocha is running as a candidate for the pro-military Palang Pracharat party In 2016, Thais voted to approve a new constitution created by the country's military leaders, which was designed to perpetuate military influence and block Mr Thaksin's allies from winning another election. But the princess aligning herself with a party allied with Mr Thaksin threatened those plans, correspondents say. Thailand's lese-majeste law explained Who is Thaksin Shinawatra? A former general, Mr Prayuth also announced on Friday that he would be running for prime minister in the forthcoming election as a candidate for the pro-military Palang Pracharat party. Thailand has some of the world's toughest royal defamation ""lese-majeste"" laws but technically the princess is not covered by them. However, the royal family is revered in Thailand and rarely criticised, so there are questions around whether any other candidate would want to challenge a member of the royal family.

"Peter Biar Ajak was one of Sudan's ""Lost Boys"", displaced during the civil war A Cambridge University student facing the death penalty in South Sudan is being ""arbitrarily detained in a modern-day hellhole"", his lawyer says. PhD student Peter Biar Ajak, 35, a critic of his country's regime, has been detained without charge since his arrest at Juba Airport in July. His lawyer Jared Genser said this was ""in clear violation of his rights under international law"". The government of South Sudan could not be reached for comment. Shortly before his arrest, Mr Ajak hadtweeted about South Sudan's ""so-called leaders"".,external Human rights group Amnesty International is campaigning on his behalf and his plight was highlighted this week in the United States Congress. Mr Genser said his client was one of Sudan's ""Lost Boys"", displaced by the country's civil war. He resettled in the United States, studying at La Salle University in Philadelphia and Harvard University, before moving to Cambridge University. Returning to his home country on 28 July to hold a youth forum, he was arrested and taken directly to custody. Mr Ajak is the father to two young children Mr Genser said his client had called for the country's current leaders to step down so that younger people could take over and achieve peace. ""This has become a real problem for the government in South Sudan, which then decides to target him for arrest and arbitrary detention because he was being a very effective critic,"" he said. On Thursday, Congresswoman Madeleine Dean, who ""knew Peter as a brilliant student and leader"" while teaching at La Salle University, drew attention to his detention in the US House of Representatives.

"The beach attack targeted tourists Seven jihadists have been sentenced to life in prison in Tunisia over attacks at a museum and a beach resort in 2015. Sixty people, mostly tourists, died in the two attacks and many were wounded. Some of the many defendants received lesser sentences and 27 were acquitted. Prosecutors plan to appeal. The first attack, at the Bardo Museum in Tunis in March 2015 killed 22. Three months later, 38 tourists, most of them British, were shot dead at Port El Kantaoui, near Sousse. The so-called Islamic State group said it had carried out the attacks. The man believed to have planned both, Chamseddine al-Sandi, remains at large. Unconfirmed reports suggested he may have died in a US air strike in February 2016 in Libya. Is it safe to go on holiday in Tunisia? How attack changed Tunisia's security There were two separate trials. In the Sousse trial, four militants were given life sentences, while five others were sentenced to between six months and 16 years. In the Bardo trial, three defendants received life terms and a number of others were jailed for shorter periods. Ten were acquitted. This video can not be played The sounds of gunfire triggered panic and confusion in the museum On 18 March, two gunmen in military uniforms stormed the National Bardo Museum, near the city's parliament buildings, where anti-terrorism legislation was under discussion. Twenty-two people, including 17 foreign tourists, were killed - 21 at the scene and one more 10 days later. Among the dead were citizens from Japan, Italy, Colombia, Australia, France, Poland and Spain. Two Tunisians, one a police officer, were also killed. More than 40 people were injured. The attackers, Tunisian citizens Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaoui, were killed by police. Three months later, on 26 June, a Tunisian electronics student, Seifeddine Rezgui, opened fire on tourists staying in the popular resort of Port El Kantaoui, just north of Sousse. This image of the Seifeddine Rezgui was distributed by IS-linked social media accounts Rezgui was dropped off down a side road, a short distance from the beach, and walked the rest of the way with a Kalashnikov rifle hidden in a parasol. When he arrived at the five-star Hotel Rui Imperial Marhaba, he opened fire indiscriminately at tourists on sun loungers on the beach. As holidaymakers fled for their lives, the gunman continued his attack, entering the hotel complex via the pool area. He killed 38 people before fleeing into the streets, where he was shot by police. Sousse beach attack: how it unfolded A state of emergency has been in place in Tunisia since the attacks. The nation's already faltering tourism industry was badly hit, but it has shown signs of recovery in the past year with travel bans lifted by several countries, including the UK. There has been considerable progress in combating jihadists in Tunisia thanks to concerted international help, according to the BBC's Middle East analyst, Sebastian Usher, but the militants still pose a potent threat while the endemic problems of chronic unemployment and lack of economic opportunity persist. Thirty of the 38 who lost their lives in the beach attack were British. Among the dead were a 24-year-old beauty blogger; a 49-year-old man, his father and his nephew; and several couples on holiday together. Beauty blogger Carly Lovett had recently got engaged to Liam, her childhood sweetheart of 10 years. Adrian Evans, 49, from Tipton in the West Midlands, died along with his father, 78-year-old Charles (known as Patrick) Evans, and nephew Joel Richards, 19, from Wednesbury. A number of married couples lost their lives. William Graham, 51, and Lisa Graham, 50, were in Tunisia to celebrate Mrs Graham's 50th birthday. Tunisia beach attack: The British victims The victims of the Bardo museum attack came from around the world. Three Japanese tourists died, alongside four Italians, three French, two Colombians, two Spaniards, and one national each from Russia and Britain. Two Tunisian citizens, including one police officer, died. More than 50 people were wounded.

"This video can not be played Michael Rice's version of Bigger Than Us Michael Rice, who won BBC talent show All Together Now last year, has been chosen to fly the flag for the UK at this year's Eurovision Song Contest. The 21-year-old from Hartlepool, who was also on The X Factor in 2014, was picked in a TV viewers' vote on Friday. He will now travel to Israel in May in the hope of impressing Eurovision fans with his rousing anthem Bigger Than Us. The UK has struggled in recent years - it has not won for 22 years and has not finished in the top 10 for a decade. Rice won the Â£50,000 prize on All Together Now in March 2018, and used the money to take his family to Disneyland and to set up a shop selling ice cream and waffles. Below, he reveals that he went to Europe for the first time two weeks ago (and broke his toe while away), says his Eurovision song is dedicated to his late father - and insists he has a chance of winning. Are you in it to win it? Yeah, definitely. I believe in this song 100%. It might just be a ballad but that song's got a big message and I can't wait to perform it and show the rest of the world what this song's all about. You weren't born the last time the UK won Eurovision, so all you've ever known is British failure. How do you get such positivity? I think you have to be positive when it comes to stuff like this. Some people do take the mickey out of it and these other countries really do take it seriously. We might have lost loads of times, but I think, why couldn't it change? Why can't we make this different? We've got the best music industry - Adele, Sam Smith, The Beatles - why can't we send someone and hope for the best? What do the song's lyrics mean to you? I grew up with my mam, and my dad had drug problems and stuff like that, and later on I got to know him. He used to know I was singing and he was dead proud of me. When I'm singing them words at the beginning - ""Hear these words that I sing to you"" - it just reminds me of him. He's passed away, and winning All Together Now, and if he could see this today, it would make his world. Have you been to Europe much? Not really - two weeks ago was my first holiday with my friends and we went to Tenerife. It was the best time. I broke my toe as well. I fell in the pool. You couldn't write my life. Did you do karaoke in Tenerife? Yes I did, in the resort. I love Tina Turner, a bit of Whitney, just fling it at me and I'll give it a crack. You used to be a busker. Do you still busk? Yeah, on a weekend sometimes I'll just pop down to York or to Newcastle and go busking. Sometimes it's really nice because people recognise you and say, ""I remember you from that show"" or, ""Do you want to play at my wedding?"" I really love it. Is it a good earner? Yeah, sometimes you can make Â£250, maybe Â£300 for half a day or a day. At York Races, when they do the big races and everyone's dressed up and drunk, they just fling tenners in. What are your ambitions for your longer-term career? I finished my EP just before Christmas so hopefully now I'm doing Eurovision I can experience all this and then hopefully release an album and stuff like that, and see where it takes me because I'm still only young. There might be an odd atmosphere this year because of Brexit - do you think that will play a part? I'm not really into politics and stuff because I just don't have a clue about it. It's a singing competition and I'm just thinking, work hard and get the best result and hopefully turn a few heads and see if we can get a better score. There have been protestsabout the fact Eurovision's being held in Israel, with some saying it should be moved because of the treatment of the Palestinians - what's your response to that? I've seen a lot of things on social media, but it's not really my place to say. I don't know a lot about what's going on over there, and music unites everyone so hopefully we can do something positive. You also fronted an anti-bullying campaign - tell us about that. When I was growing up at secondary school I used to get bullied a lot - in Year 7 and Year 8. When I left school, I did The X Factor and I got loads of hate from that, and it really sparked me on to go to schools and tell people my story and inspire them. Rice will be hoping to improve on last year's UK performance, when singer SuRie finished 24th out of 26. Her performance wasinterrupted by a stage invader, who grabbed her microphone and shouted slogans about the media. The contest was eventuallywon by Israeli singer Nettawith her quirky song Toy, which encouraged people to celebrate their differences. The winning country hosts the following year's competition, and the 2019 event will take place in Tel Aviv on 18 May.

Lots of his tracks were on the playlist last year, and even as we speak at the moment one of them is on the A-list, so it's one of the tunes that gets played the most. To see this happen to an artist just as he's about to break through is a really sad thing. He's from Gypsy Hill in south London and he started out in a crew called Gipset with Krept and Konan. He's consistently being putting out music - the Commitment and the Commitment 2 are probably two of the most known pieces of work he'd put out. He got so much recognition from those projects alone and lots more people have been paying attention to his music. He's worked with Krept and Konan, two of the biggest rappers in the UK, Donae'o and Deno Driz on Advice, which is probably one of the biggest tunes he put out there. It's quite a small scene so when something like this happens everybody within this industry knows it's happened. There's no doubt in my mind that he would have been playing at so many different places this summer because he's got so many big songs out at the moment and loads in the pipeline. In 2015, Krept brought Cadet on stage with him at Wireless Festival and this summer the rapper was due to perform at the festival. In a statement, Wireless said: ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to the family, friends and fans, of Cadet. ""Such sad news. ""We'll be keeping his Wireless performance as a time to reflect on the memory of Blaine."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Horse racing is facing its biggest health - and financial - crisis in 18 years, with the industry forced to close down in the UK due to an outbreak of equine flu. More than 100 stables remain on lockdown, with six days of meetings cancelled, as the authorities work to contain an outbreak of the highly contagious illness. The industry, which is worth an estimated Â£3.5bn to the UK economy a year, and the wider sector employ close to 100,000 people (with about a fifth directly employed). It has not experienced such a shutdown since the the foot-and-mouth crisis of 2001. Racing is the second-highest attended sport in the UK after football, and supports a number of other ancillary sectors, from horse training and transportation, to catering, media coverage and gambling. Media reports have put the overall cost to racing at between Â£150m to Â£200m, with concerns that the shutdown - including the Super Saturday meeting at Newbury - will cost betting firms Â£2m a day. Three more horses diagnosed with equine flu British racing on lockdown over flu British racing cancelled for five days Equine flu: 'Outbreak quite frightening' The outbreak comes less than five weeks before the start of this year's Cheltenham Festival, which is followed by Aintree and the Grand National at the start of April. And there are fears that unless the outbreak is contained these high-profile showpiece events could be under threat. The Cheltenham Festival attracts tens of thousands of horse racing fans from the UK and Ireland More than a dozen meetings between 7 - 13 February have been called off, and the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) says it will make a further announcement on Monday. ""I don't want to be complacent but I think the best way, in all our experience, to ensure we manage things, is to lock down at the moment,"" says the BHA chief executive Nick Rust. ""Then we can identify cases if any more emerge. It gives us the best chance to isolate, and make sure our [future] fixtures are saved."" Millions of pounds are at stake if more races have to be called off. The BBC's racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght says: ""Any further shutdown - Cheltenham is again looming - would clearly have a considerable effect on the sport but [also] on all the ancillary industries that go with it."" When the UK was hit by foot-and-mouth in 2001,the estimated cost to the local Cheltenham economy,externalby the cancellation of the festival was put at Â£30m. Meanwhile, bookmakers were estimated to have lost Â£100m because of the call-off. This video can not be played Equine flu: Inside Newmarket laboratory which detected the outbreak And when Australia was hit by equine flu in August 2007, the industry was shut down for six months and the country was not declared free of the disease until 10 months later. At the beginning of the outbreak, containment and eradication cost A$500,000 (Â£273,000) a day, while wider ""associated income"" losses hit A$4.6m (Â£2.5m) a day. Sydney's spring racing carnival, which runs from August to October, was cancelled as the bottom fell out of the racing industry. Alan Switzer, from Deloitte's Sport Business unit, monitors the racing industry and produced a major report for the BHA six years ago. ""The initial financial cost will be to the racecourse, and then flow through the sector affecting things like betting and media revenues,"" he says. Bookmakers will be badly hit by the shutdown He points out that a reduction in gambling income will also mean a reduction in the amount paid to the industry via the betting levy. ""Hopefully the shutdown will not run for weeks. What the BHA have done is right, with regards to both animal welfare and business,"" he says. ""If they can have nipped things in the bud, they will have experienced a few days of disruption but managed to secure the medium and long-term future of the industry. ""The industry could withstand a short-term blow of this nature, but if Cheltenham were to be cancelled it would be a serious blow, both for the racing industry and wider economy - transport, restaurants, entertainment, hotels - which benefit from the festival."" Costs and refunds Harriet Collins from Newbury Racecourse - whose cancelled weekend event is seen as an important warm-up for Cheltenham - says the ""very disappointing"" outbreak is going to be costly to the industry. ""There are always going to be costs associated with losing any race days,"" she says. She said the Berkshire course had the necessary contingencies in place, ""including insurance"" to cover racing cancellations. Kempton Park Racecourse is closed In addition, race-going ticket holders have been quickly updated, and will now receive a full refund. She said the goal for the BHA was to balance horse welfare to ensure ""we don't lose [racing] for a longer period of time"". At Musselburgh, near Edinburgh, the course haslost its richest-ever jumps meeting, taking place this Sunday. If the venue's next meeting, scheduled for Wednesday, goes ahead there will be free admission for all racing fans. After the cost of admission, catering is the highest area of expenditure for most race-goers. Ivor Spreadbury runs the annual National Racecourse Catering Awards, having been involved with the sport for 30 years and employed in catering for half a century. He says equine flu could cost the catering industry hundreds of thousands of pounds, if not more. Eating and drinking is a big part of the race-going experience ""This is a huge blow for the industry, and certainly will have a major effect. It is very serious,"" he says. ""Without a shadow of a doubt it is going to cause financial damage. The ultimate cost will not be known until we know how long the lockdown is in place."" He said the racecourse catering sector spanned big firms like Sodexo, Arc, CGC, and Jockey Club Catering, via medium-sized outfits to one or two-person independent operators. Mr Spreadbury says that all aspects of catering will be affected, including fine dining, cafeterias, fast-food concessions and bars. ""They are all going to be hit across the board."" The big bookmaking firms saw their shares hit on Thursday, and were down again slightly on Friday. At close Ladbrokes-owner GVC was down 1.45%, William Hill was down 0.92%, and Paddy Power Betfair lost just 0.08%. Venetia Williams is a trainer specialising in National Hunt racing, and was due to have horses running during the abandoned period. Racecourses are standing silent across the UK ""We missed a large part of the week before through frost and snow, so missing another week is a nuisance and a pain,"" she says. ""Particularly for us, because the horses are running really well at the moment. ""This to us is the 'high season', so obviously it is disappointing from that point of view.""

"Princess Ubolratana has not addressed the issue of the ban directly The party that nominated a Thai princess to run for prime minister has said it will comply with the king's wishes after he opposed the move. Thai Raksa Chart is allied to divisive ex-Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra. On Friday, King Vajiralongkorn denounced his sister Princess Ubolratana Mahidol's unprecedented bid for political power as inappropriate. The candidacy would have broken with the tradition of the Thai royal family publicly staying out of politics. The party said it complied ""with the royal command with loyalty to the king and all members of the royal family"". A palace statement had said such an act would ""defy the nation's culture"". Thailand: Land of military coups Why Thais said yes to new constitution Broadcast on all Thai TV networks, the statement said: ""Even though she has relinquished her royal titles in writing, she maintained her status and carried herself as a member of the Chakri dynasty. King Vajiralongkorn says the princess retains her status as a member of the royal family ""Involvement of a high-ranking member of the royal family in politics, in whatever way, is considered an act that defies the nation's traditions, customs and culture, and therefore is considered extremely inappropriate."" The statement cited a passage of the constitution that says the monarchy should maintain political neutrality. Next month's vote is being closely watched as the first chance for Thailand to return to democracy after five years under military rule. Analysts say the king's intervention would in any case have been likely to have led to the election commission disqualifying her from the 24 March election. By the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok After unusually blunt criticism from King Vajiralongkorn, the Thai Raksa Chart party had no choice but to accept his instruction that members of the royal family could not be brought into politics. That ends a bold gambit by the anti-military coalition to boost its popularity and insulate itself against charges of being anti-monarchy, by having the king's flamboyant older sister Ubolratana run for prime minister, although her nomination cannot be legally withdrawn. Ultra-royalists are now demanding that Thai Raksa Chart be dissolved. That would leave the largest party in the coalition, which is aligned with exiled former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, still contesting the election, but without an important partner. Coalition sources say they believed they had the king's acquiescence for his sister to run in the election. If that is the case, either there was a misunderstanding, or he changed his mind. Hours earlier, Princess Ubolratana defended her decision to run for office. In an Instagram post, she reiterated that she had relinquished all her royal titles and now lived as a commoner. She said she wanted to exercise her rights as an ordinary citizen by offering her candidacy for prime minister. She said she would work with all sincerity and determination for the prosperity of all Thais. Shortly after the king's statement she posted again without addressing the issue directly, simply thanking Thais for their support and saying that she wanted Thailand to ""move forward and become admired and accepted by the international community"". Born in 1951, Princess Ubolratana Rajakanya Sirivadhana Barnavadi is the eldest child of Thailand's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej. He died in 2016. How King Bhumibol shaped modern Thailand She attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and after marrying an American in 1972 she gave up her royal title. After her divorce she returned to Thailand in 2001 and once again started participating in royal life. The princess engages actively in social media and has also starred in several Thai movies. She has three children, one of whom died in the 2004 Asian tsunami. The other two now also live in Thailand. It will be the first vote since current Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha took power in 2014, overthrowing the democratic government and ousting ex-PM Yingluck Shinawatra, the younger sister of Mr Thaksin. Who is Prayuth Chan-ocha? Both Mr Thaksin and his sister live in self-imposed exile but remain a powerful force in Thai politics, with many in the country remaining loyal to them. Prayuth Chan-ocha is running as a candidate for the pro-military Palang Pracharat party In 2016, Thais voted to approve a new constitution created by the country's military leaders, which was designed to perpetuate military influence and block Mr Thaksin's allies from winning another election. But the princess aligning herself with a party allied with Mr Thaksin threatened those plans, correspondents say. Thailand's lese-majeste law explained Who is Thaksin Shinawatra? A former general, Mr Prayuth also announced on Friday that he would be running for prime minister in the forthcoming election as a candidate for the pro-military Palang Pracharat party. Thailand has some of the world's toughest royal defamation ""lese-majeste"" laws but technically the princess is not covered by them. However, the royal family is revered in Thailand and rarely criticised, so there are questions around whether any other candidate would want to challenge a member of the royal family.

"Jamal Khashoggi had gone to Istanbul to obtain a marriage document The Trump administration has refused to respond to a request from Congress to provide a report determining who killed the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Senators wrote in October demanding the murder be investigated and that the White House give more information. An administration official said the president was within his rights to decline to act. Khashoggi was killed after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October last year. He was a strong critic of the Saudi government. His body was reportedly dismembered and has still not been found. US intelligence officials have reportedly saidsuch an operation would have needed the approval of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.,external Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? Why the Khashoggi crisis is far from over And on Saturday Baroness Helena Kennedy, member of a UN team of international experts who visited Turkey to investigate the murder, told the BBCthe murder was planned at the highest level. But Saudi officials insist he was murdered by a ""rogue"" team of Saudi agents not acting on the prince's orders. An administration statement said Mr Trump ""maintains his discretion to decline to act on congressional committee requests when appropriate"". However, Democratic senators told the New York Timesthe president was in breach of the so-called Magnitsky Act,,externalwhich requires a response within 120 days to requests from Senate committee leaders. That deadline passed on Friday. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has written to Senate leaders describing actions taken against individuals. However, the documents do not indicate who was responsible for Khashoggi's death, as demanded by the senators. The US has imposed sanctions on 17 Saudi officials, including Saud al-Qahtani, a former adviser to the crown prince who, it alleged, was ""part of the planning and execution of the operation"" that led to Khashoggi's murder.

"Thousands of bus routes in England are under threat because councils have said they cannot afford to pay for them. They blamed an ""unsustainable"" funding gap of Â£652m in the free bus pass scheme, which local authorities have been forced to fill. Councils subsidise 44% of English bus routes but they warned that, without more funding, these could be cut. The government said it provides Â£250m a year to support bus routes and Â£1bn for free bus passes. Councils are required by law to reimburse bus operators for carrying passengers who hold a free off-peak bus pass, such as the over-65s and disabled people. Bus journeys fall by 90 million Reality Check: Does your council have to keep the buses running? Bus journeys: Your questions answered The Local Government Association (LGA), which represents councils, said that the gap between government funding for the free bus pass scheme and the actual costs has soared from Â£200m in 2016 to Â£652m in 2017/18. That increasingly means they have less money to spend on supporting rural bus services, as well as other optional forms of subsidy such as free peak-time travel for pass holders, post-16 school transport or support for young people's travel. The LGA is calling for the government to return to fully funding the costs of the free bus pass scheme in the Spending Review this year. Councillor Martin Tett, the LGA's transport spokesman, said: ""Properly funding the national free bus pass scheme is essential if the government wants councils to be able to maintain our essential bus services, reduce congestion and protect vital routes. ""If this is not addressed in the Spending Review it could lead to older people having a free bus pass but no bus to travel on."" The LGA said more than 3,000 routes have already been withdrawn, altered or reduced since 2010/11. A Department for Transport spokeswoman said: ""It is for councils to decide which bus operations to support in their areas, but we help to subsidise costs through around Â£250m worth of investment every year."" She said that Â£42m of this sum goes to local authorities and an additional Â£1bn is used to fund free bus passes.

"Theresa May arrived at Farmleigh House in Dublin on Friday evening The prime minister has met Leo Varadkar in Dublin for talks focused on Brexit and the political deadlock in Northern Ireland. Theresa May has now returned to the UK after having dinner with the taoiseach (Irish prime minister). The talks in Farmleigh House lasted about two hours. The meeting took place after Mr Varadkar met Northern Ireland's main political parties in Belfast on Friday. Q&A: Irish border Brexit backstop Can technology solve Irish border problem? Labour: MPs will back our Brexit plan Mrs May was accompanied in Dublin by the UK's Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins and her chief of staff Gavin Barwell. The Irish government said the two leaders discussed ""the latest Brexit developments"" as well as the ""ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland"". The meeting comes after the EU said it will hold more talks with the UK to help the prime minister get a Brexit deal through the Commons. Earlier, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox met his Irish counterpart after travelling to Dublin for talks. Speaking in Belfast, Mr Varadkar said it was ""not a day for negotiations"" but it was an opportunity to ""share perspectives"". He added that he was looking to restore confidence and trust with the prime minister during their meeting on Friday night. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter A Friday night in Dublin for Theresa May as she continues trying to find a way through for her Brexit deal. The prime minister came face-to-face with her Irish counterpart over a fillet of beef with dauphinoise potatoes and green beans. It's been a diplomatic whirlwind of a week as Mr Varadkar and Mrs May have bounced from Belfast to Brussels, both seeking backing for their respective positions. Allow Twitter content?

It seems certain that the House of Commons will not pass any Brexit deal that includes the current backstop. But the Irish government again today insisted it has to stay, with Mr Varadkar adding that he and the EU speak with one voice on this. On Monday, UK-EU talks begin (again) in Brussels - but there's no sign of a compromise coming down the tracks. Severalcabinet ministers have told the BBC a no-deal Brexit could lead to a voteon Irish unification. But Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster poured cold water on the prospect, saying that the 1998 Good Friday Agreement sets out ""criteria for a border poll, and it hasn't been met - therefore it will not be called"". On Thursday, Mrs May met EU leaders in Brussels in a bid to secure changes to the Irish border backstop in the Brexit agreement. European Commission President Jean-Claude Junckerruled out legally-binding changes to the backstop clausein the 585-page withdrawal document. But he said the EU would be open to adding words to the non-binding future relations document that goes with the withdrawal agreement. Other officials, including European Parliament Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, have said the backstop is ""non-negotiable"". Allow Twitter content?

On Wednesday, Mr Varadkarheld meetings with top EU officialsabout the backstop and Ireland's plans for a no-deal outcome. He said that while he was ""open to further discussions"" with the UK government about post-Brexit relations, the legally-binding withdrawal agreement remained ""the best deal possible"". Speaking in Belfast, Mr Varadkar said ""time is running out"" to agree a deal, but that work needed to continue in order to ensure agreement was reached. ""When it comes to Brexit this is a negotiation that has the UK on one side and EU on the other,"" he said. ""Any negotiation can only happen with Ireland and the EU working together."" It is the insurance policy to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland unless and until another solution is found. The UK and EU made a commitment to avoid physical barriers or checks on the border, if no UK-EU trade deal is agreed before the Brexit transition period ends. Many people are concerned that the return of such checks would put the peace process at risk. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But there has been opposition to the backstop from the DUP and Brexiteer MPs, who believe its terms could keep the UK tied to EU rules in the long term. Last month, MPs backed an amendment in Parliament calling for ""alternative arrangements"" to replace the backstop. A group of Conservative MPshas held talks aimed at finding other Brexit optionsthat would avoid a hard border. The taoiseach travelled to Belfast to discuss the ""ongoing political impasse"", the Irish government said. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government for more than two years. Mr Varadkar, whose trip came days afterTheresa May met the parties at Stormont to discuss her bid to make changes to the withdrawal agreement, said he travelled north to ""hear the perspective of the main parties"". DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party had a ""wide-ranging"" discussion with the taoiseach. Mrs Foster also said some people were engaging in ""project fear"" with the Brexit negotiations. DUP leader Arlene Foster (centre) speaking after meeting Leo Varadkar in Belfast The party's deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, said the backstop ""is the problem"", but would not specify which possible alternative his party is supporting. Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said her party would ""hold the taoiseach's feet to the fire"" when it comes to defending the backstop. She said he had given her an assurance he would remain firm with his stance. The party also said they have been calling repeatedly for a border poll, and that they had urged Mr Varadkar to begin planning for one. The Ulster Unionist Party's (UUP) Brexit spokesperson Steve Aiken said there needed to be ""level-headed conversations"" and that the UUP had told the taoiseach how concerned they are by the terms of the Irish border backstop. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he had been watching recent events in Westminster ""with dismay"" The UUP said it is working on a number of alternative proposals it wants the UK and EU to consider. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said they had a very constructive and wide-ranging discussion with Mr Varadkar. ""It's fairly clear those this week suggesting there is some chance of the UK and Irish government doing a side deal without the EU are chasing after a no-way scenario,"" she said. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that it had been a ""good meeting"" and added that he and the taoiseach are ""on the same side of this argument"". ""We have been watching with some dismay what has been going on in Westminster over the last couple of months,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody within the Irish government or the European Commission sees any opportunity for diluting the protection of citizens in Northern Ireland."" Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker said their meeting was ""robust but constructive"" Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU negotiator Michel Barnier will hold talks in Strasbourg on Monday, as the EU and UK Brexit negotiating teams discuss proposed changes to the deal. British sources say the talks will include discussion of the legally-binding withdrawal agreement, the BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said. An EU source said the further talks are an opportunity to listen to the UK's ideas. Please upgrade your browser Mrs May and Mr Juncker will meet again before the end of February, to review progress. The prime minister is expected to put the deal to a vote in the Commons towards the end of February. She said the plan must change if it is to win the support of MPs who urged her to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop when rejecting the deal last month.

"This video can not be played PC Rob Pedley: ""You're carrying the county's number one murder weapon"" More than 1,000 10 to 19-year-olds were admitted to hospital with knife wounds in 2017/18. The figure, from NHS England, reveal a 54% rise in the number of children and teenagers treated for injuries from knives over five years. It comes as a leading consultant warns that she is seeing increasing numbers of girls involved in knife crime. Doctors also said that injuries were becoming more severe and victims getting younger. The figures record the number of people admitted to hospital for an overnight stay or longer, for knife crime injuries between 2012-13 and 2017-18. Among victims aged between 10 and 19, the numbers went up from 656 to 1,012 last year. Admissions have also grown by 30% across all ages, from 3,849 in 2012-13, to 4,986 last year. Doctors said the numbers could be even higher, as victims who received treatment in A&E for minor knife crime injuries were not recorded. Dr Martin Griffiths, consultant trauma surgeon at The Royal London Hospital, said: ""We are seeing a lot more adolescents and young people with severe injuries. That used to be an occasional occurrence, now it is the norm. ""This week I expect to see someone of school age as a matter of course. ""I see the wasted opportunities of young people stuck on hospital wards with life-changing injuries."" This video can not be played Knife crime: What's it like to be stabbed? Dr Gayle Hann, the lead for paediatric A&E at North Middlesex Hospital, pointed to the rising numbers of girls becoming involved. ""It used to be that we rarely saw girls and young women, but now we are seeing increasing numbers as both victims and aggressors. ""Young women are coming in who have had their mobile phones taken off them in an attack, then had their attack filmed as part of their humiliation. ""They are then told that if they say anything their attackers will put the video on the internet."" Dr Hann said knives are also getting bigger: ""I used to take kitchen knives off people, now we are seeing zombie knives."" Knife crime deaths at highest level since WW2 Is another year of rising knife crime ahead? Patrick Green, chief executive of the Ben Kinsella Trust, a charity which campaigns against knife crime, said: ""This is a crisis. Many young people see no other alternative for them than to carry knives in their environment. ""Youth workers in hospitals who are providing ongoing support to young people are making a big difference. ""But we need to prevent them getting there in the first place, and educate them to make better choices."" Dr Griffiths said the Royal London Hospital had done work with the charity St Giles Trust to reduce the numbers of young victims of knife attacks returning to hospital with further injuries. ""We've dramatically reduced readmissions by giving our victims of injury a case worker who will meet them in the hospital, and give them a further six months of bespoke care in the community"" he said. ""The best results are obtained by consistent, nurturing bonds. ""Knife violence is endemic. We all have a responsibility to engage with supporting youth to address this."" In January, Home Secretary Sajid Javid announced new knife crime prevention orders which can be issued by police to anyone aged 12 or over who is believed to be carrying a blade. The Asbo-style orders would give police more power to impose curfews, send young people caught with knives to educational courses and - in some cases - restrict their social media use to prevent rival disputes escalating.

"As of January, there had been more than 153 appeals against fines for using the bus gate A psychologist fined for driving through a bus gate has won her appeal after arguing there were too many signs for the brain to process. Bernardine King's penalty charge notice (PCN) was quashed after a tribunal ruled signage was ""inadequate"". Essex County Council has taken Â£1.5m after 54,000 drivers were fined using the Chelmsford bus gate in 18 months. It said the PCNs had seen the number of people using the gate ""reduce to less than a quarter"" of the figure before. This video can not be played Psychologist Bernardine King said there were too many signs for drivers to take in by the bus gate Dr King - who has published several academic papers on how people process visual information - said the bus gate, a short section of road blocked off to all traffic except buses, cycles and taxis, was ""endangering lives"" ""Once you're committed to turn left on Duke Street, you have no way of safely turning around,"" she said.

The location of height restriction signage in the city implies the bus gate comes after the railway bridge - but it does not After visiting the site, the traffic penalty adjudicator said that although some of the signs by the bus gate were large and easily visible, they were ""cluttered"" together and meant ""drivers could be confused"". Dr King, who received her PCN in November, is now calling on the council to carry out a safety review of the bus gate, which she called ""a blight on Chelmsford"". An Essex County Council spokesman said: ""Before turning on enforcement cameras in 2017, we increased signage at all junctions, sent more than 3,000 warning notices and painted the words ""BUS GATE"" in five-foot high letters on the road at both entrances to help make drivers aware of the restrictions.""

"Sir Philip Green's legal action against the Daily Telegraph has been formally ended by a High Court judge. The Topshop boss had gagged the paper from publishing misconduct allegations, including sexual and racial abuse and bullying, against five employees. He said the action was now ""pointless"" after he was named in Parliament as the businessman behind the injunction. Sir Philip said he was pleased with the judgement, and said the Daily Telegraph had pursued a ""vendetta"" against him. Sir Philip denies allegations he behaved wrongly. The five employees who made allegations about Sir Philip had all received substantial payments after settling their claims in return for saying no more about them - under non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). The paper's editor, Chris Evans, said he was delighted the injunction had been lifted. The Telegraph now intends to publish the details of the allegations against Sir Philip and the ""inside story"" of the High Court action on its website at 21:00 GMT on Friday and in Saturday's newspaper. The newspaper has also published an audio recording of Sir Philip in which he threatened to ""bankrupt"" the Telegraph if it printed the allegations. ""I will personally sue your editor for damages that will be long beyond what he'll be able to earn if he lives to 1,000 years old,"" he said on the call. Sir Philip has been left with a reported Â£3m legal bill and has been ordered to pay the ""bulk"" of the Telegraph's legal costs. Sometimes known as ""gagging orders"" or ""hush agreements"", they typically prevent staff and ex-staff making information public. Sir Philip had argued that the five former staff would be breaking the law if they breached NDAs they had signed in return for money. Sir Philip's statement said the Telegraph had ""knowingly and shamefully coaxed these [five] individuals to breach their obligations under these lawful agreements"". What are non-disclosure agreements? Sir Philip Green: From 'king of the High Street' to 'unacceptable face of capitalism' But Mr Evans said the Sir Philip case raised wider questions about the use of NDAs. ""In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein affair, we became aware that gagging orders called NDAs were being used to cover up allegations of sexual misconduct and racial abuse in the workplace. And that led to our investigation into Sir Philip Green and Arcadia. ""We maintain there is a clear public interest in telling people whether a prospective employer has been accused of sexual misconduct and racial abuse."" The chairwoman of the Parliamentary Women and Equality Select Committee, Maria Miller, said the Philip Green case  ""shows how broken the current system is"". ""NDAs are protecting the powerful and silencing victims. Employers and lawyers need to hear a strong message from government that this has to change."" Last August, the Daily Telegraph planned to run a story of allegations of misconduct made against Sir Philip by five employees. Sir Philip approached the court to stop it naming him. Initially, the court refused, but Sir Philip appealed and it did grant an injunction, saying there was a ""real prospect"" that publication would cause ""substantial and possibly irreversible harm"" to the claimants. It then ran a story saying simply that a ""leading businessman"" was involved in a number of NDAs with former employees. However, Sir Philip was named by Lord Hain in the House of Lords two days after the court's ruling. Sir Philip used to be known as the king of the High Street. He built a fortune from a retail empire that included Topshop, BHS, Burton and Miss Selfridge. He sold BHS in March 2015 for Â£1, but it went into administration a year later, leaving a Â£571m hole in its pension fund. He later agreed a Â£363m cash settlement with the Pensions Regulator to plug the gap. In a report into the collapse,externalof BHS, MPs called the episode ""the unacceptable face of capitalism"". He and his wife Cristina are estimated by Forbes to be worth Â£3.8bn. What are non-disclosure agreements?

"Sir Philip Green denies allegations of sexual harassment and racist behaviour Topshop boss Sir Philip Green has dropped his legal action against the Daily Telegraph, which prevented it publishing allegations of racist behaviour and sexual harassment. He had argued that former staff were breaking the law by breaching non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) they had signed. So how do these work? Sometimes known as ""gagging orders"" or ""hush agreements"". In employment law, they're parts of contracts, or sometimes standalone contracts, between employees and companies. They typically prevent staff and ex-staff making information public. In legal practice they are often described as ""confidentiality clauses"", but are better known to the public as NDAs. They can apply to commercially sensitive details such as inventions and ideas, or anything likely to damage an organisation's reputation. Sir Philip Green drops 'gagging' legal action 'Signing a gagging clause set me free' Are NDAs being abused? NDAs have also been used to prevent employees discussing allegations of misbehaviour in the workplace in the media after a settlement has been agreed. They're signed when employees and organisations resolve a dispute - such as a claim of wrongful dismissal - without going through a full tribunal hearing. But they can be signed earlier, such as when staff are taken on. NDAs don't stop people reporting alleged illegal acts. If a manager or colleague faced allegations of attempted rape or fraud, for instance, reporting these to the police would not be prevented. But allegations of a boss making sexual comments or bullying staff could be covered. However, bullying may be illegal if it relates to ""a protected characteristic"", such as age, disability, race, religion or sexual orientation, says Marc Jones, a partner at IBB Solicitors. The length of time for which an NDA applies varies. In the US, it's thought that athird of workers,externalhave signed NDAs but, according to Mr Jones, it's ""impossible to say"" how widespread they are in the UK. Julie Morris, a senior employment partner at Slater and Gordon Lawyers, says that, in her experience, ""almost all settlement agreements"" contain NDAs preventing employees ""speaking about various matters, including allegations about harassment or discrimination"". If someone breaches an NDA, they break a contract, leaving them open to being sued. But if a company thinks the NDA is going to be breached, it can apply for an injunction, as Sir Philip did to prevent his name being circulated by the Daily Telegraph in connection with allegations of racial and sexual harassment. If someone breaches an injunction, this is a criminal offence, and can lead to a fine or jail for those found guilty. Yes. Parliamentary privilege - guaranteeing free speech for parliamentarians - allows MPs and peers to mention them in the House of Commons or House of Lords. Last October, former Labour cabinet minister Lord Hain used this to name Sir Philip as the businessman accused by the Daily Telegraph of sexual and racial harassment, after the newspaper was prevented by the injunction from doing this. Sir Philip says he's ""not guilty of unlawful sexual or racist behaviour"" and he has been the subject of ""vicious"" and ""untrue"" personal attacks in the media.

"With less than three months to go until the UK is due to leave the EU, attention is focused on how to keep vital trade routes across the English Channel flowing as smoothly as possible. ""I am expecting the channel ports to operate normally in all Brexit circumstances,"" the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told the BBC this week. But in the event of a no-deal Brexit (the UK leaving the EU without any formal Withdrawal Agreement and no transition period), the government's own advice contradicts him. A statement issued by the Cabinet Office last month said that cross-government planning assumptions have been revised to show that, in a worst-case scenario, ""there will be very significantly reduced access across the short strait [between Dover and Calais] for up to six months"". The statement noted that, in a no-deal scenario, the EU would impose full third-country controls on people and goods entering the EU from the UK. The impact, the Cabinet Office said, would affect both imports and exports at Dover and Folkestone (home of the Channel Tunnel) because of the ""frequent and closed loop nature"" of the crossings. So why has Dover become so integral to the UK's economic system? It is by far the biggest destination in the country for roll-on roll-off ferries (known as Ro-Ro, which means cargo is driven on and off rather than lifted by cranes). Dover handled 2.9 million units of Ro-Ro freight last year, most of which were lorries with drivers. It is also the main access route for trade with the rest of the EU inside the single market. Lorries currently simply drive on and off ferries and are on the motorway within a matter of minutes. But any lorries arriving from a non-EU country, such as Switzerland, are subject to longer delays. ""If customs don't want to check anything, that would [still] delay the vehicle by about an hour or an hour and a half [while the driver waits for a decision],"" Andrew Baxter, the managing director of the freight logistics company Europa Worldwide, told a House of Commons Committee last year. ""If customs wanted to do a documentary check, that could delay it by up to three hours, and if there was an inspection of the goods, that could delay it by up to five hours,"" he added. Even though such checks are in the low single digits in percentage terms, it doesn't take much for long queues to develop in the tight confines of the port of Dover. That's why the government says that, in the event of no-deal, it would minimise checks at Dover to the greatest extent possible and could, in theory, simply wave trucks through. But, as the Cabinet Office acknowledges, it cannot control what the EU will do on the other side of the Channel. Supporters of Brexit, though, have said consistently that the threat of chaos at Dover has been exaggerated. The Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has often quoted a statistic that it takes only six seconds to complete customs checks for goods arriving at the port of Southampton from outside the EU. There is, he has suggested, no reason why ports such as Dover cannot implement similar systems. DP World Southampton, which operates the container terminal with the Port of Southampton, confirmed that customs declarations are processed in approximately six seconds, but it emphasised that, at that point, the cargo is not customs-cleared. It normally takes about an hour for customs clearance to be completed after a vessel arrives at port, but crucially that depends on customs declarations and other documents being submitted ""typically 2 to 3 days before"" the ship reaches Southampton. It is a system that works well at ports like Southampton or Felixstowe for goods arriving from the other side of the world. If a ship is at sea for several weeks, it gives companies plenty of time to get all their paperwork in order. The challenge with Ro-Ro freight, which becomes more acute as crossings get shorter, is that you have less time to do that. On the 90-minute journey from Calais to Dover, with the sheer volume of traffic which uses that route, it is something of a non-starter. One potential solution on the other side of the Channel, according to Andrew Baxter, would be to force companies not to use Calais as a customs point for checking industrial goods, but to use inland clearance points instead, perhaps in the EU country of final destination. ""No one wants delays, on either side,"" he said, ""and we have to be practical."" But EU law would not allow health and safety inspections for food and animal products arriving from a third country (like the post-Brexit UK) to take place very far inland. They have to be carried out at designated Border Inspection Posts (BIPs), at the first point of entry into the single market, on 100% of products. That has led the National Farmers Union to warn that parts of the British food industry could face 'catastrophic consequences' as a result. The Environment Secretary Michael Gove appears to agree. ""At the moment there are no Border Inspection Posts at Calais,"" Mr Gove told the Oxford Farming Conference on Thursday. ""While we do hope the French take steps to build capacity there, that capacity is unlikely by the end of March to be generous. ""It's a grim but inescapable fact that in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the effective tariffs on beef and sheep meat would be above 40%,"" he added. ""In both cases about 90% of that export trade goes to the EU."" And much of it is transported via the Channel Tunnel or from Dover to Calais by sea. Please upgrade your browser If you have a huge amount of space, there are ways to try to minimise the problem of queuing. Rotterdam in the Netherlands is Europe's largest port, and some of the freight containers that are shipped there are inspected at a BIP more than 40 kilometres from the furthest arrival terminals, but still inside the port authority area. Ro-Ro traffic is a little different, because the freight is accompanied by a driver and it is much more time-dependent, especially if lorries are carrying fresh produce. But the efficiency of the system is - according to a spokeswoman for Eurofrigo, the company that runs BIPs in Rotterdam - one of the main reasons customers use that route for import and export. So, can other ports share the load, to take some of the strain off the systems in Dover? That is certainly part of the government's contingency planning. The port of Ramsgate has received plenty of attention in the last few days, with thewell-documented newsthat a company which owns no ferries has been chosen to reopen the ferry route from Ramsgate to Ostend in Belgium. Thanet District Council, which runs the port, believes it has the potential to support up to 24 ferry sailings a day, although initial plans are for far fewer crossings. Dredging of the harbour, to allow the ferry route to reopen, began this week. Other ports could also increase their capacity for handling Ro-Ro traffic. About 10% of business at Felixstowe, the UK's largest port by volume of trade, is currently Ro-Ro, and it could handle more. Thegovernment has announced,externalthat - alongside theRamsgate-Ostend route- it has bought additional capacity on ferry routes between Immingham, Felixstowe, Portsmouth, Poole and Plymouth and destinations in France, Germany and the Netherlands, to be available in the event of no deal. But the journey time from Felixstowe to Rotterdam is about seven hours - much longer than the Dover-Calais crossing and therefore less convenient for just-in-time manufacturing processes, and more expensive. And even if Felixstowe traffic went up by 10-20%, that would only equate to 1-2% of the traffic at Dover. ""I don't think that 'no-deal' with zero mitigation measures for transport can work,"" said Pauline Bastidon from the Freight Transport Association. ""There's no two ways about it. You can move trade to different ports, you can adjust your supply chain - none of it will be enough."" Other ports are also concerned that they may not be ready to cope with extra traffic if it is suddenly re-routed from Dover. Portsmouth International Port, for example, currently transports up to 500 lorries a day abroad. But local councils are worried about congestion and delays if extra traffic had to be handled in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""The distance between the freight check-in desk at Portsmouth International Port and the beginning of the motorway is just 13 lorry lengths,"" said a statement issued on Thursday by council leaders in Hampshire, ""so a queue of 14 lorries or more would mean queuing traffic on the motorway."" That reflects a broad consensus within the industry that there is currently no viable alternative to Dover, and that it will take time to change the system. ""Five to six months would be a reasonable time for things to settle down and for people to get used to new ways of working,"" said Andrew Potter, a logistics expert at Cardiff University. But ports like Rotterdam and Ostend would also have to implement EU checks, and there is also the question of costs. ""Extra costs have to be paid somewhere,"" Dr Potter said. ""They either get passed on to consumers or they hit the profit margins of the companies involved."" In the meantime, as Parliament prepares to vote this month on Theresa May's Brexit deal, which includes a transition period of 21 months after Brexit when all the rules would stay the same, businesses are having to prepare for all possible outcomes. As a supporter of Brexit, Andrew Baxter of Europa Worldwide is relatively unusual in the freight logistics industry. He believes there will eventually be a Brexit deal to keep trade moving, but he has to make contingency plans just in case. ""I need to have a department with 40 people up and running for March 29th in the event of no-deal,"" he said. ""I haven't got it at the moment, and I'm starting now. We can't wait any longer.""

"As of January, there had been more than 153 appeals against fines for using the bus gate A psychologist fined for driving through a bus gate has won her appeal after arguing there were too many signs for the brain to process. Bernardine King's penalty charge notice (PCN) was quashed after a tribunal ruled signage was ""inadequate"". Essex County Council has taken Â£1.5m after 54,000 drivers were fined using the Chelmsford bus gate in 18 months. It said the PCNs had seen the number of people using the gate ""reduce to less than a quarter"" of the figure before. This video can not be played Psychologist Bernardine King said there were too many signs for drivers to take in by the bus gate Dr King - who has published several academic papers on how people process visual information - said the bus gate, a short section of road blocked off to all traffic except buses, cycles and taxis, was ""endangering lives"" ""Once you're committed to turn left on Duke Street, you have no way of safely turning around,"" she said. Council 'making money' from drivers Just one fine upheld at city's bus gate Bridge cameras catch 8,500 speeders ""Drivers are being trapped in the area and they're panicking. ""There are so many signs by the bus gate but a little contradiction in the brain means we cannot absorb all the information. ""To consciously process all the information, it may take a few seconds and by that point, you've already travelled 20ft or 30ft down the road."" The location of height restriction signage in the city implies the bus gate comes after the railway bridge - but it does not After visiting the site, the traffic penalty adjudicator said that although some of the signs by the bus gate were large and easily visible, they were ""cluttered"" together and meant ""drivers could be confused"". Dr King, who received her PCN in November, is now calling on the council to carry out a safety review of the bus gate, which she called ""a blight on Chelmsford"". An Essex County Council spokesman said: ""Before turning on enforcement cameras in 2017, we increased signage at all junctions, sent more than 3,000 warning notices and painted the words ""BUS GATE"" in five-foot high letters on the road at both entrances to help make drivers aware of the restrictions."" He added that all money generated by fines was ""reinvested to help improve public transport, roads and the transport network across Essex"".

"Communist Vietnam is seen as a model of economic and political reform for North Korea US President Donald Trump says his second summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un will be held in the Vietnamese capital Hanoi. The two men will meet on 27-28 February for talks expected to focus on persuading the communist state to give up its nuclear weapons programme.

Experts caution that despite Mr Trump's assertion that North Korea is no longer a nuclear threat,the country has never said it would give up its nuclear weapons programmewithout similar concessions from the US. The US wants North Korea to make a full declaration of all its nuclear weapons facilities and commit to destroying them, under international supervision. In a speech at Stanford University last week, Mr Biegun said the US would not agree to lift sanctions until this happens but he indicated it could provide assistance in other ways, saying: ""We did not say we will not do anything until you do everything.""

"Theresa May arrived at Farmleigh House in Dublin on Friday evening The prime minister has met Leo Varadkar in Dublin for talks focused on Brexit and the political deadlock in Northern Ireland. Theresa May has now returned to the UK after having dinner with the taoiseach (Irish prime minister). The talks in Farmleigh House lasted about two hours. The meeting took place after Mr Varadkar met Northern Ireland's main political parties in Belfast on Friday. Q&A: Irish border Brexit backstop Can technology solve Irish border problem? Labour: MPs will back our Brexit plan Mrs May was accompanied in Dublin by the UK's Brexit negotiator Olly Robbins and her chief of staff Gavin Barwell. The Irish government said the two leaders discussed ""the latest Brexit developments"" as well as the ""ongoing political impasse in Northern Ireland"". The meeting comes after the EU said it will hold more talks with the UK to help the prime minister get a Brexit deal through the Commons. Earlier, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox met his Irish counterpart after travelling to Dublin for talks. Speaking in Belfast, Mr Varadkar said it was ""not a day for negotiations"" but it was an opportunity to ""share perspectives"". He added that he was looking to restore confidence and trust with the prime minister during their meeting on Friday night. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter A Friday night in Dublin for Theresa May as she continues trying to find a way through for her Brexit deal. The prime minister came face-to-face with her Irish counterpart over a fillet of beef with dauphinoise potatoes and green beans. It's been a diplomatic whirlwind of a week as Mr Varadkar and Mrs May have bounced from Belfast to Brussels, both seeking backing for their respective positions. Allow Twitter content?

It seems certain that the House of Commons will not pass any Brexit deal that includes the current backstop. But the Irish government again today insisted it has to stay, with Mr Varadkar adding that he and the EU speak with one voice on this. On Monday, UK-EU talks begin (again) in Brussels - but there's no sign of a compromise coming down the tracks. Severalcabinet ministers have told the BBC a no-deal Brexit could lead to a voteon Irish unification. But Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster poured cold water on the prospect, saying that the 1998 Good Friday Agreement sets out ""criteria for a border poll, and it hasn't been met - therefore it will not be called"". On Thursday, Mrs May met EU leaders in Brussels in a bid to secure changes to the Irish border backstop in the Brexit agreement. European Commission President Jean-Claude Junckerruled out legally-binding changes to the backstop clausein the 585-page withdrawal document. But he said the EU would be open to adding words to the non-binding future relations document that goes with the withdrawal agreement. Other officials, including European Parliament Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, have said the backstop is ""non-negotiable"". Allow Twitter content?

On Wednesday, Mr Varadkarheld meetings with top EU officialsabout the backstop and Ireland's plans for a no-deal outcome. He said that while he was ""open to further discussions"" with the UK government about post-Brexit relations, the legally-binding withdrawal agreement remained ""the best deal possible"". Speaking in Belfast, Mr Varadkar said ""time is running out"" to agree a deal, but that work needed to continue in order to ensure agreement was reached. ""When it comes to Brexit this is a negotiation that has the UK on one side and EU on the other,"" he said. ""Any negotiation can only happen with Ireland and the EU working together."" It is the insurance policy to maintain an open border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland unless and until another solution is found. The UK and EU made a commitment to avoid physical barriers or checks on the border, if no UK-EU trade deal is agreed before the Brexit transition period ends. Many people are concerned that the return of such checks would put the peace process at risk. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But there has been opposition to the backstop from the DUP and Brexiteer MPs, who believe its terms could keep the UK tied to EU rules in the long term. Last month, MPs backed an amendment in Parliament calling for ""alternative arrangements"" to replace the backstop. A group of Conservative MPshas held talks aimed at finding other Brexit optionsthat would avoid a hard border. The taoiseach travelled to Belfast to discuss the ""ongoing political impasse"", the Irish government said. Northern Ireland has been without a devolved government for more than two years. Mr Varadkar, whose trip came days afterTheresa May met the parties at Stormont to discuss her bid to make changes to the withdrawal agreement, said he travelled north to ""hear the perspective of the main parties"". DUP leader Arlene Foster said her party had a ""wide-ranging"" discussion with the taoiseach. Mrs Foster also said some people were engaging in ""project fear"" with the Brexit negotiations. DUP leader Arlene Foster (centre) speaking after meeting Leo Varadkar in Belfast The party's deputy leader, Nigel Dodds, said the backstop ""is the problem"", but would not specify which possible alternative his party is supporting. Sinn FÃ©in's vice-president Michelle O'Neill said her party would ""hold the taoiseach's feet to the fire"" when it comes to defending the backstop. She said he had given her an assurance he would remain firm with his stance. The party also said they have been calling repeatedly for a border poll, and that they had urged Mr Varadkar to begin planning for one. The Ulster Unionist Party's (UUP) Brexit spokesperson Steve Aiken said there needed to be ""level-headed conversations"" and that the UUP had told the taoiseach how concerned they are by the terms of the Irish border backstop. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he had been watching recent events in Westminster ""with dismay"" The UUP said it is working on a number of alternative proposals it wants the UK and EU to consider. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said they had a very constructive and wide-ranging discussion with Mr Varadkar. ""It's fairly clear those this week suggesting there is some chance of the UK and Irish government doing a side deal without the EU are chasing after a no-way scenario,"" she said. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said that it had been a ""good meeting"" and added that he and the taoiseach are ""on the same side of this argument"". ""We have been watching with some dismay what has been going on in Westminster over the last couple of months,"" he said. ""I don't think anybody within the Irish government or the European Commission sees any opportunity for diluting the protection of citizens in Northern Ireland."" Theresa May and Jean-Claude Juncker said their meeting was ""robust but constructive"" Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU negotiator Michel Barnier will hold talks in Strasbourg on Monday, as the EU and UK Brexit negotiating teams discuss proposed changes to the deal. British sources say the talks will include discussion of the legally-binding withdrawal agreement, the BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said. An EU source said the further talks are an opportunity to listen to the UK's ideas. Please upgrade your browser Mrs May and Mr Juncker will meet again before the end of February, to review progress. The prime minister is expected to put the deal to a vote in the Commons towards the end of February. She said the plan must change if it is to win the support of MPs who urged her to seek ""alternative arrangements"" to the backstop when rejecting the deal last month.

"Seaborne Freight planned to launch services from Ramsgate by Brexit day on 29 March The government has axed its no-deal Brexit contract with a ferry company which had no ships, after the Irish company backing the deal pulled out. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had faced criticism for the Â£13.8m deal with Seaborne Freight, which the BBC found had never run a ferry service. The government said it is in ""advanced talks"" to find another ferry firm. But local MP Craig Mackinlay said this could be the ""last throw of the dice"" for commercial shipping from Ramsgate. Meanwhile, Labour has called on Mr Grayling to resign or be sacked, describing him as ""the worst secretary of state ever"". Could Channel ports cope with no-deal Brexit? No-deal Brexit ferry contract queried A really simple guide to Brexit What preparations are being made for a no-deal? Seaborne Freight was awarded the Â£13.8m contract in December to run a freight service between Ramsgate and Ostend, Belgium, in the event that Britain leaves the EU without a deal. The governmentwas criticisedfor choosing Seaborne Freight, a company with no ships or trading history, and for leaving too little time to establish the new ferry service before the Brexit deadline of 29 March. And local politicians in both Ramsgate and Ostendwarnedthat the ports at both ends of the route will not be ready the deadline. At the time, the government said it awarded the contract ""in the full knowledge"" that Seaborne, which was formed in April 2017, was ""a new shipping provider"" but said the company had been ""carefully vetted"". On Saturday,the Daily Telegraph,externalreported that Arklow Shipping, a major Irish shipping firm, withdrew its support from Seaborne ""without warning"". The Department for Transport (DfT) said that it had become clear that Seaborne ""would not reach its contractual requirements"", after Arklow Shipping backed out of the deal. A spokesman said: ""The government is already in advanced talks with a number of companies to secure additional freight capacity - including through the Port of Ramsgate - in the event of a no-deal Brexit."" The Port of Ramsgate has not had a regular ferry service since 2013 Thanet District Council - which covers Ramsgate - said it was ""disappointing"" that Arklow Shipping had pulled out of the deal. It said it was in talks with the DfT about the port's role ""in terms of supporting Brexit resilience"". The council has been pumping money into the port to get it ready for ferry services. Earlier this week, it was considering cutting its budget for the port but, at the request of Mr Grayling,delayed its decision. Ramsgate has not had a regular ferry service since 2013 and needs to be dredged before services can start. Following the news that Seaborne Freight had lost the contract, the Conservative MP for South Thanet, Mr Mackinlay, said ferry companies had ""come and gone over the last few years"" but ""none of them have come to anything"". ""For me, this Seaborne operation was potentially the last throw of the dice for a chance for commercial shipping out of Ramsgate,"" he said. ""Perhaps it is time that we turned the page on Ramsgate port being for commercial activity and we can start doing something rather more exciting on those acres of land, potentially a marina village, hotels, restaurants, some housing, something really exciting that I think would be more welcomed by many people in Ramsgate."" Andrew Gwynne, the shadow secretary of state for communities and local government, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This is yet again another indication of a government that had no plan for Britain should we leave the European Union without a deal. ""It's another example of a major disaster in the hands of Chris Grayling who must be classed as the worst secretary of state ever."" The government said that no taxpayer money has been transferred to Seaborne. It added that its confidence in the viability of the deal with Seaborne was based on Arklow Shipping's backing of the company and the assurances it received from them.

"(L-R) Keegan, Tilly Rose, Olly and Riley died in the blaze in the early hours of Tuesday A man and a woman have been arrested on suspicion of manslaughter by gross negligence after four children died in a house fire. A 24-year-old woman and a 28-year-old man are in custody, Staffordshire Police said. Riley Holt, eight, Keegan Unitt, six, Tilly Rose Unitt, four, and Olly Unitt, three, died in the blaze in Highfields, Stafford, on Tuesday. The force urged people not to speculate on what may have happened. The children's 24-year-old mother, Natalie Unitt, and her 28-year-old partner, Chris Moulton, leapt from a first-floor window with the siblings' two-year-old brother, Jack. They did not sustain life-threatening injuries. Neighbours and friends have been leaving tributes near the scene Staffordshire Police said: ""This incident has had a huge impact on the community and we understand there will be confusion and a demand for information."" The cause of the fire is unknown and investigations are continuing. Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service's deputy chief fire officer Rob Barber said: ""Our work investigating the cause of the fire continues and we will make that public as soon as we are able."" Vigil for fatal house fire family Neighbour's tears for children killed in fire Latest news and updates from the West Midlands A JustGiving page for the family has raised Â£29,000 and community centres say they have been ""inundated"" with donations. Emotional tributes have been paid to the youngsters, with teachers describing them as ""bright, happy, loving and lively"".

"Motions of no confidence in Labour MP Luciana Berger have been withdrawn by her local party after a bitter row. The Liverpool Wavertree MP has been a critic of leader Jeremy Corbyn's stances on anti-Semitism and Brexit. Activists had accused the Jewish MPof ""undermining"" Mr Corbyn,externalbut several Labour MPs supported her, calling it a ""disgraceful episode"" and ""bullying"". A source close to the Labour leadership said pulling the confidence vote was the right decision. But Labour MP for Liverpool Riverside Louise Ellman, who is also Jewish, called it ""an absolutely disgraceful episode"" and said it was ""very clear the attacks"" on Ms Berger had been down to anti-Semitism. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell had earlier sparked a backlash from supporters of the MP by suggesting she should have pledged loyalty to Labour and saying she had been linked to an alleged Labour ""breakaway"" party. In a statement after the motions were first put forward, Ms Berger said she would fight anti-Semitism wherever she found it, including in Labour, where it was being ""ignored"". Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson wrote to the party's general secretary Jennie Formby, calling for the Liverpool Wavertree Constituency Labour Party (CLP) to be suspended. He wrote: ""It is clear to me that Luciana Berger is being bullied. This behaviour by her local party is intolerable."" Labour row over MP no confidence vote How the Labour anti-Semitism saga unfolded Anti-Semitic hate incidents 'rise by 16%' MP Smith 'considering' quitting Labour An email has now been sent to Liverpool Wavertree Constituency Labour Party members, telling them that the meeting planned for next Sunday has been cancelled. ""This is because the two motions to be discussed have both been withdrawn by the members who proposed them,"" it said. Votes of no confidence carry no official force within the Labour Party, but local activists could hold a ""trigger ballot"", where sitting Labour MPs can be forced to compete for selection as a candidate against all-comers, ahead of the next general election. John McDonnell suggested Ms Berger should pledge her loyalty to the Labour Party Ms Berger has been the target of online abuse and had a police escort at last year's Labour Party conference following death threats. Earlier this week, she joined other MPs at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Partycalling for details on the party's efforts to tackle anti-Semitism to be released. Ms Berger reiterated her ""long-held view that Brexit will be a disaster for the people of Liverpool Wavertree and the wider country"", and said that, as a Jewish woman representing a city with a Jewish community, she was ""deeply disturbed by the lack of response from Jeremy Corbyn... to the anti-Semitism that stains our party"", claiming it was being ""wilfully ignored."" Former Labour leader Ed Miliband and prominent backbencher Yvette Cooper were among a number of her colleagues to express their support for Ms Berger after the news of a no-confidence vote broke on Tuesday night.

Ms Ellman, accused Mr McDonnell of thinking he and the party ""would get away with this"", and said Labour had been ""shamed"" into reversing the motions. She told Radio 4's PM programme that it was ""too easy [for Labour] to turn a blind eye"" to anti-Semitism and said dropping the motions was ""not the end of the matter"". ""Anti-Semitism is alive in the party [and] insufficient steps had been taken to [tackle it],"" she added. Former shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said Mr McDonnell ""should never have allowed his allies to have gone after Luciana like that in the first place"". Liverpool Mayor Labour's Joe Anderton also welcomed the decision to pull the votes. He told Radio 4's PM programme that there should be ""robust debate and discussion"" at local Labour Party meetings instead of motions of no confidence, and that he was ""really frustrated and angry"" at how the members had acted.

"This video can not be played CCTV of the group during the shopping trip in Sutton was shown in court A mother accused of not helping her three-year-old son as he was crushed by her boyfriend's car seat has told a court she had let down her son. Alfie Lamb was found unresponsive and later died following a car journey in south London on 1 February last year. The boy's mother Adrian Hoare, 23, told the Old Bailey she would have moved Alfie ""if I thought there was a serious problem"". She and her partner Stephen Waterson, 25, both deny manslaughter. Mr Waterson is accused of pushing the front passenger seat of his Audi into Alfie twice during the journey from Sutton to Croydon. Stephen Waterson and Adrian Hoare both deny manslaughter In court, prosecutors accused Ms Hoare of putting her boyfriend first before her son as their relationship was ""too important"". Jurors were shown CCTV of the three-year-old apparently having to run to keep up with her and Mr Waterson as they walked along an alleyway and into Asda. Referring to the footage, Duncan Atkinson QC asked Ms Hoare why her son was having to run and ""what allowances were you making for Alfie's little legs?"". The defendant denied she put what her partner wanted first, saying that it was ""just the way I walk"" and ""Alfie always runs."" Alfie Lamb had been in the rear footwell of the Audi with another child during the trip When asked why she had not taken her son out of the footwell and comforted him when he was ""crying"", ""screaming"", and ""coughing"", Ms Hoare said she could have ""but Stephen said we was all going together."" Mr Atkinson later asked whether ""looking back on it now, do you feel you let Alfie down?"", to which Ms Hoare replied: ""Yes."" Earlier, Mr Waterson's lawyer suggested the car seat had nothing to do with the toddler's injuries and Miss Hoare must have ""done something"". This was denied by the 23-year-old. Mr Waterson has told the court he only moved his seat back an inch, before moving forwards again Ms Hoare denies manslaughter, child cruelty and common assault on Emilie Williams, who was also in the car. Mr Waterson denies manslaughter and the intimidation of the car's driver Marcus Lamb. The couple and 19-year-old Ms Williams have pleaded guilty to conspiring to pervert the course of justice by making false statements to police. The trial continues.

"The name on Google Maps has since been changed A school was labelled on Google Maps as ""Hell on Earth"" in what is thought to have been a joke by one of its pupils. Hornsea School and Language College in East Yorkshire appeared on the website labelled as ""Hornsea Prison & Hell on Earth"". It is believed a pupil submitted the name change to the search engine and it was accepted. The school issued a statement saying the unauthorised listing had since been removed. Place names can be suggested to Google by anyone but must be verified by the business owner, to ensure they are the only ones who can edit them. The entry has since been changed and the school said the identity of the person responsible for the prank was known. Latest news and updates from Yorkshire Head teacher Steve Ostler said: ""We recommend that all schools take ownership of their Google map icon to prevent any copy-cat behaviours."" Hornsea School and Language College is a secondary comprehensive founded in 1958 and takes pupils from Hornsea and the surrounding area.
