"This video can not be played Sturgeon: I'm going to be around a lot longer Scotland's first minister has dismissed speculation about her future by saying she has ""no intention of going anywhere"". Nicola Sturgeon said rumours she might soon be looking to leave frontline politics were ""wishful thinking"" by her opponents. And she said she would continue to govern as first minister for the full term of the Scottish Parliament. Ms Sturgeon has served as first minister since 2014. She was re-elected in May after the SNP won the Scottish Parliament election with a record share of the vote. But she has regularly spoken about the emotional toll of leading the country through the Covid pandemic, leading to rumours that she may have one eye on her life after politics. Has Scotland moved closer to indyref2? This was heightened when Ms Sturgeon said ina recent interview with Vogue magazine,externalthat she and her husband - SNP chief executive Peter Murrell - may wish to foster children in the future. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg ahead of the SNP's autumn conference, which begins on Friday, Ms Sturgeon said she intended to remain as first minister for the full five-year parliamentary term. Referring to speculation about her future, she said: ""It is almost as if my opponents have concluded they can't beat me or remove me from office themselves, so they're kind of crossing their fingers and hoping that I'll remove myself from office. ""But they are going to be really disappointed because I'm going to be around a lot longer. ""I was elected seven months ago, having asked people in Scotland to put their trust in me for a five year term as first minister. ""They gave me that trust and they re-elected me. We face serious times as a country and I intend to fulfil that mandate."" Ms Sturgeon, who is 51, added that she has ""no intentions of going anywhere right now as first minister"", but that she hoped to still be ""relatively young when I get to the point of contemplating other things"". Ms Sturgeon was re-elected as first minister after the SNP won the Holyrood election in May The SNP's manifesto ahead of the election said it would hold a second referendum on independence by the end of 2023, Covid permitting. Ms Sturgeon said she would be taking the ""necessary steps"" to ensure that happens, with the Scottish government having recently resumed its plans for indyref2 after putting them on hold at the start of the pandemic. She said this would include publishing a referendum bill in the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish government will also set out the ""advantages and opportunities of independence"", which Ms Sturgeon said would include ""how we will navigate some of the more difficult issues"". Ms Sturgeon said Scotland must decide what kind of country it wants to be after the pandemic is over, but stressed she does not want a referendum to be held ""while we are still worrying about face coverings and testing ourselves every day"". The prime minister has said it would be reckless to have a referendum while the country is dealing with the impact of Covid She said she hoped the country would be out of the ""acute"" phase of the pandemic early next year, and that people's minds would be turning to the ""positive, optimistic task of how do we build a better country, how do we build a fairer, more equal, more prosperous country for the future"". The first minister added: ""That means for Scotland getting to choose who's making these decisions, not having somebody like Boris Johnson imposed on us and deciding for ourselves."" The UK government has said the question of Scottish independence should not be on the table while the country is still dealing with the pandemic, with the prime minister saying it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" to do so. And it has pointed to the UK-wide schemes such as the vaccine rollout and furlough as evidence that Scotland is better off as part of the UK. Opinion polls have suggested that Scotland remains split almost 50-50 on the question of independence - although support for remaining in the UK has been slightly ahead on average over the past six months. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that her side of the debate has ""still got a job to do"" to persuade a majority of Scottish voters that the country should become independent. She added: ""I think we are much closer to that than ever before, but are we there yet? No."" Sturgeon: I'm going to be around a lot longer.

"This video can not be played Independent regulator will strengthen English football - Tracey Crouch MP English football needs an independent regulator to stop it ""lurching from crisis to crisis"", says the chair of a fan-led review into the sport. Former sports minister Tracey Crouch is calling on the government to create a new independent regulator for English football (IREF). The review says this is necessary for the long-term financial stability of the men's professional game. ""This is a huge opportunity for football,"" Crouch told BBC Sport. ""We've seen football lurching from crisis to crisis over the past decade and unfortunately we haven't had the right levels of regulation in place to stop that from happening."" BBC Sport understands that Downing Street will support the plan for an independent regulator. Speaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Crouch added that the recommendations were to remove ""vested interests"" from football to ensure it can ""become sustainable for the long-term future"". The review, which was commissioned by the government, also recommends Premier League clubs paying a ""solidarity transfer levy"" to further support the football pyramid. It suggests clubs should have a 'shadow board' of fans so they are properly consulted on key decisions and that supporters hold a 'golden share' to protect their clubs' heritage and which competitions they play in. The review also proposes new owners' and directors' tests and that these are carried out by IREF instead of the Premier League, English Football League (EFL) and the Football Association (FA). Crouch said she is ""absolutely confident"" that such measures would stop any revival of thefailed European Super Leagueor a similar breakaway competition and would prevent a club going bust in the mannerBury FC did in 2019. She added she is ""extremely optimistic"" the government will support the idea of an independent regulator but said legislation will not be in place by the start of next season. However, she said a 'shadow regulator' could be set up 'straight away' to establish the guiding principles for IREF. The Premier League said it recognises the need to ""restore and retain"" the trust of fans in football governance and that it will study the recommendations before working with the government, fans, FA and EFL on these issues. The EFL said it hopes the review is a ""catalyst for positive change that can make clubs sustainable"". The FA said ""many positive changes have already been made"", some of which were ""directly as a result"" of the review. The Football Supporters' Association (FSA) said the review ""lay the basis for a prosperous and sustainable future"" for English football at all levels. The report makes 47 recommendations, which are summed up in 10 major points: The government should create a new independent regulator (IREF) IREF should oversee financial regulation in football IREF should establish new owners' and directors' tests A new corporate governance code should be set up Equality, diversity and inclusion plans should be mandatory for all clubs Supporters should be consulted on all key off-field decisions through a 'shadow board' Key items of club heritage should be protected by a 'golden share' for fans There should be more support from the Premier League to the pyramid through a solidarity transfer levy, paid by Premier League clubs on buying players from overseas or other top-flight clubs Women's football should be treated equally and given its own review Stakeholders should work to increase protection of welfare of players leaving the game The Premier League's owners' and directors' test has come under scrutiny recently following the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover of Newcastle. Amnesty Internationalhas urged the league to change the test to address human rights issues, with the Saudi state accused of human rights abuses. The Premier League said it has ""legally-binding assurances"" the Saudi state has no direct control over Newcastle, despite the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which has an 80% stake, being chaired by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Western intelligence agencies believe the crown prince approved the 2018 murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which he denies. The review did not state whether human rights issues would be considered in the new proposed tests but did say owners and directors must be of ""good character"" to pass. Crouch said she did not know if the new tests would have blocked the Newcastle takeover but added they would have ensured ""greater transparency"". The Premier League and EFL agreeda Â£250m rescue packagefor EFL clubs in light of the Covid-19 pandemic in December last year, before the top flight madeanother Â£25m availableto Leagues One and Two and the National League last week. The review says the proposed transfer levy will add to that and work in a similar way tostamp duty,externalin order to ""distribute revenues across the pyramid and into grassroots"". Crouch said the Premier League ""has a duty"" to pass more of its wealth down - but that both it and the EFL need to come to a decision on what the levy percentage should be. If they cannot agree, she said IREF will make the decision on their behalf. Football fans protested outside stadiums following the announcement of the European Super League in April The review heard more than 100 hours of evidence from fans representing more than 130 clubs, the FA, Premier League, EFL, League Managers' Association and Professional Footballers' Association. The government promised a fan-led review in its 2019 general election manifesto after Bury were expelled from League One following the collapse of a takeover bid. The review was brought forward as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, which caused matches to be held behind closed doors, affecting revenue, and the failed attempt to launch a 12-team European Super League in April. The review's recommendations seek to address concerns over the financial disparity between the Premier League and the Championship, with clubs in the second tier breaching profitability and sustainability rules in attempts to gain promotion. This has been apparent this season withReading deducted six pointsfor breaking financial rules andDerby County docked a further nine pointsfor breaches of EFL accounting rules, taking their overall deductions this season to 21 points. The European Super League, which involved six Premier League clubs, collapsed amid widespread condemnation from other clubs and players as well as governing bodies, politicians and especially fans. The review's 'golden share' proposal seeks to prevent this being attempted again as it gives fans a say over a club's heritage - including team colours and their stadium, as well as preventing them from playing in competitions not affiliated to Fifa, Uefa or the FA. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee chair Julian Knight MP said he welcomed the proposal of an independent football regulator. He said there must be ""urgent government action"" and called on Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries to introduce a football regulator in the next Queen's Speech. The Premier League said: ""We acknowledge the call for some form of independent regulation to protect English football's essential strengths and the Premier League has already undertaken our own governance and strategic reviews. ""These will continue to progress together with the ongoing work of the fan-led review. ""It is important to everyone that any reforms do not damage our game, its competitive balance or the levels of current investment."" EFL chairman Rick Parry said it is ""pleasing"" to see the review conclude that ""additional distributions"" from the top flight are required. He added: ""Achieving financial stability has to be the number one priority. ""Reducing volatility and fostering balance throughout the English leagues will provide the bedrock upon which reforms can be built."" Football Supporters' Association chief executive Kevin Miles said the review is ""potentially a huge step forward for football governance"" and that is ""now up to the government to deliver"". And the Manchester United Supporters Trust said the review included a ""big missed opportunity"" because of its ""failure to address the fundamental question of club ownership"". The Trust said it ""should have recommended measures to allow supporters who wish to invest in their club to do so"".

"The body of Sarah Everard was found hidden in woodland Met Police officer Wayne Couzens has been sentenced to a whole-life term for the murder of Sarah Everard, in a case that sparked national outrage and calls for more action to tackle violence against women. Couzens admitted the kidnap, rape and murder of the 33-year-old marketing executive when he appeared in court several months ago. But it was only during his sentencing that the full details of his crimes emerged. In full: Sarah Everard's family on their loss Does following the 'rules' keep women safe? Ms Everard was walking home from a friend's house in Clapham, south London, at about 21:30 BST on 3 March when she was abducted. Couzens' choice of victim was random, but the attack was planned. In his sentencing remarks, Lord Justice Fulford said there had been ""significant planning and premeditation"" by Couzens. The police officer had ""long planned to carry out a violent sexual assault on a yet-to-be-selected victim"" who he intended to coerce into his custody, noted the judge. Couzens spent at least a month travelling to London from Deal, Kent, where he lived, to research how best to carry out his crimes. Several days before the attack, he booked a hire car, which he would use for the abduction, as well as a roll of self-adhesive film advertised as a carpet protector on Amazon. After finishing a 12-hour shift at the US embassy that morning, Couzens, a parliamentary and diplomatic protection officer, went out ""hunting"" for a lone, young woman to kidnap and rape, the prosecution said. CCTV footage played in court showed Couzens and Ms Everard beside a vehicle on Poynders Road in Clapham The court heard how Couzens used the knowledge he had gained from working on Covid patrols in January and his Metropolitan Police-issue warrant card to trick his victim under the guise of a fake arrest for breaching coronavirus guidelines. The 48-year-old, who had been a police officer since 2002, handcuffed her before bundling her into the car and driving away. The abduction was witnessed by a couple travelling past in a car - but they believed they had seen an undercover police officer carrying out a legitimate arrest, so did not intervene. The whole kidnapping took less than five minutes. Couzens then drove to Dover in Kent, where he transferred Ms Everard to his own car, before travelling to a remote rural area nearby. It was there that he raped and murdered his victim - strangling her with his police belt. By 02:31 Couzens had left the scene and was spotted at a service station buying drinks. He visited the site where Ms Everard's body was dumped twice, leaving just before dawn. The next day, as the search for her escalated, Couzens bought petrol, which he used to burn her body inside a fridge. He also purchased two green rubble bags, which he used to dump the remains in a pond near an area of woodland he owned in Hoads Wood, Ashford. A week after she disappeared, Ms Everard's body was found in a woodland stream, just metres from land owned by Couzens. This video can not be played A CCTV timeline shows key evidence used to arrest and prosecute Wayne Couzens Meanwhile, Couzens returned to normal life, carrying out mundane activities like calling a vet about his dog. Days later, he even took his wife and two children on a family trip to the woods where he had burnt his victim's body. However, on the 8 March, the day he was due to return to work, he reported in sick. The following day he was arrested at his home in Deal. In a brief police interview, he told a false story about being threatened by an Eastern European gang, claiming they had demanded he deliver ""another girl"" after he had underpaid a prostitute a few weeks before. He then claimed he kidnapped Ms Everard, drove out of London and handed her over to three men in a van in a layby in Kent, while she was alive and uninjured. But after Ms Everard's body was discovered in a pond just 130 metres from land owned by Couzens, he was charged. This video can not be played In video from a police interview at his home on 9 March, Couzens denies knowing Sarah Everard Couzens has since been sacked by the Met, but the force is still facing questions over whether chances were missed to prevent his predatory behaviour. After Ms Everard's murder, the police watchdog announced it was probing alleged failures by the Met to investigate two indecent exposure incidents linked to Couzens in February. The Independent Office for Police Conduct is also investigating alleged failures by Kent Police to investigate a flashing incident linked to Couzens in 2015. Couzens transferred to the Met in 2018, from the Civil Nuclear Constabulary, where he had worked since 2011. Two years later he began working for the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command as an authorised firearms officer at diplomatic premises around central London. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape In July, appearing by video link from Belmarsh high security jail, Couzens pleaded guilty to murder at the Old Bailey. On Wednesday he appeared in court again - this time in person - for a two-day sentencing hearing. There, he faced Ms Everard's mother, father and sister, who described to the court the torment of losing their loved one in such horrendous circumstances. Her father, Jeremy, demanded that Couzens looked at him as he told the murderer he could never forgive him for taking away his daughter. Her mother, Susan, said she was ""tormented"" at the thought of what her ""precious little girl"" had endured. ""I go through the sequence of events. I wonder when she realised she was in mortal danger,"" she told the court. ""Burning her body was the final insult. It meant we could never again see her sweet face and never say goodbye. ""Our lives will never be the same. We should be a family of five, but now we are four. Her death leaves a yawning chasm in our lives that cannot be filled.""

"The government says ""stopping the boats"" crossing the English Channel is a key political priority. As part of this, it is pushing ahead with its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite a Supreme Court judgment that the policy is unlawful. Since the Supreme Court ruling,the government has signed a new treaty with Rwanda to strengthen its asylum process, and proposed new UK laws declaring that Rwanda is a safe country. As well as the Rwanda plan, theIllegal Migration Actincludes a number of new provisions: the home secretary has a duty to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally either to Rwanda, or another ""safe"" third country migrants will not be granted bail or able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detention under-18s, those medically unfit to fly or at risk of serious harm in the country to which they are being removed, will be able to delay departure the number of refugees the UK settles through ""safe and legal routes"" is capped. The government also signed a new agreement with France, under which the UK will pay Â£500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. Commercial documents published by the Home Office suggest thatthe government plans to spend at least Â£700m to manage small boat arrivals until 2030. How many people cross the Channel in small boats? Is migration to the UK slowing and other claims Why record numbers are suddenly being given asylum At the end of September 2023 there weremore than 56,000 asylum seekers living in hotels,externalacross the UK. The government hopes to save money by using other types of accommodation instead. There are currently about 300 asylum seekers housed on a barge called the Bibby Stockholm in Dorset, which has capacity for 500. In aletter to the Home Affairs Committee of MPs,external, the Home Office confirmed the contract to provide accommodation on the Bibby Stockholm is worth Â£22.5m. In August 2023, all of the 39 asylum seekers then on board were removed afterLegionella bacteria was found in the water system. On 12 December 2023,one of the migrants living on the barge died.The man is believed to have taken his own life. What is it like on the UK's first migrant barge? Why is Bibby Stockholm barge so controversial? No asylum seekers have yet been housed at RAF Scampton The government has alsosaid that three ex-military sites in Essex, Lincolnshire and East Sussexwill house several thousand migrants: Wethersfield in Essex is due to hold up to 1,700 people Scampton in Lincolnshire is due to hold up to 2,000 Bexhill in East Sussex is due to hold up to 1,200 Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire is also due to hold an unspecified number of people. The BBC understands about 600 asylum seekers are being housed at Wethersfield. In July 2023, some residentstested positive for tuberculosis(TB). The first asylum seekers were expected to arrive at Scampton in mid-August, but this was delayed until further notice. The Home Office says it is still ""exploring proposals"" to use the Bexhill site. In December 2023,the High Court ruled that asylum seekers could be housed at Wethersfield and Scampton, following legal action by the relevant local councils. They have applied for permission to take the case to the Court of Appeal. The Home Office commercial documents also show the government is looking for a partner to run two migrant reception centres in Kent until at least 2030 - and potentially to 2034. The Home Office insists there are a number of""safe and legal"",externalroutes to the UK. However, some are restricted to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan andUkraine,external, while other routes only accept limited numbers.Figures shown,externalare for the year to September 2023: Refugee Family Reunion- for partners and children under 18 of those already granted protection in the UK (6,114 grants) UK Resettlement Scheme- prioritises those from regions in conflict (525 grants) Community Sponsorship Scheme- for local community groups to provide accommodation and support for refugees (162 grants) Mandate Resettlement Scheme- to resettle refugees who have a close family member in the UK who can offer a home (13 grants) In April 2023, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick was asked in Parliament which safe and legal routes were available to a young person wanting to flee the conflict in Sudan. He said individuals should contact the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR. But it insisted""there is no mechanism through which refugees can approach UNHCR with the intention of seeking asylum in the UK"". Critics of the government's asylum proposals, such as the Refugee Council, say they risk breaking international law. The main principle of the1951 Refugee Convention,externalstates that refugees should not be returned to countries where they faced threats to life or freedom. Home Secretary James Cleverly said the new treaty with Rwanda addresses the UK Supreme Court's concerns The government insists its plan to send migrants to Rwanda for their asylum cases to be processedcomplies with international law. But the Supreme Court ruled in November 2023that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawfulbecause of the risk they could be moved on to countries where they could face harm, known as ""refoulement"". In response, the governmentsigned a new treaty with Rwandawhich it says will prevent refoulement. It has also publishednew legislation declaring Rwanda a safe country. No easy way forward for PM after win as Rwanda bill splits party Clarification 2 December: This article has been amended to make clear that the government's ""safe and legal"" routes are only available to certain groups of people who have already been recognised as refugees, or family members of refugees already in the UK.

"This video can not be played The moment Anthony Collins was arrested A bomb hoaxer who sent a suspicious package to a Covid jab plant has been jailed for two years and three months. Anthony Collins, 54, from Chatham, Kent, was convicted of posting an article to the factory in Wrexham, with the intention of inducing the belief it was likely to explode or ignite. The parcel caused 120 people to stop manufacturing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine at the factory in January. He denied the charge but was found guilty following trial. Man guilty of sending suspect package to jab plant Bomb hoax parcel included accused man's address Vaccine production resumes after suspect package The bomb scare caused 120 people to be evacuated from the site Bomb disposal teams successfully detonated the parcel but found no explosive material. Instead, the package contained a calculator, a garden glove, four batteries, a ""yellow biohazard bar"", a service wipe and a quantity of paper. But a supermarket receipt and a letter revealed Collins to be the culprit who sent the parcel.Â The Army sent a bomb disposal unit to Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine producer Wockhardt's unit CCTV also captured Collins buying the items and a transaction record was obtained by police. Collins admitted sending the package without being prompted to but denied intending to create a bomb scare, claiming he believed the items he was posting would be useful to workers at the factory. However, he did admit that he knew his actions might cause alarm.

"Jennifer and Stephen Chapple died at their home in Norton Fitzwarren, Somerset A man has been charged with the murders of a couple who were killed in their home as their children slept upstairs. Jennifer and Stephen Chapple were found seriously injured at the house on Dragon Rise in Norton Fitzwarren, Somerset, at 21:45 GMT on Sunday and died at the scene. Collin Reeves, 34, also of Dragon Rise, is due to appear at Taunton Magistrates' Court on Thursday. A post-mortem examination confirmed the couple died from multiple stab wounds. The children, aged five and six, were unhurt and are being looked after by family members, Avon and Somerset Police said. Tributes to the couple have been left near their home on Dragon Rise A 67-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been released under investigation.

"This video can not be played PMQs: Sir Keir Starmer claims the PM has devised a ""working class dementia tax"" to pay for health and social care costs Boris Johnson batted away opposition calls for him to stand down and defended himself against accusations of ""broken promises"" at PMQs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM on social care funding, rail investment and tax. Picking up on reports of Tory disquiet after the PM's chaotic speech to business leaders, he asked: ""Is everything OK, prime minister?"" The PM said the government was ""delivering for...working people"". The Conservative benches were packed for the exchanges, in contrast to last week's session. ""I see they have turned up this week prime minister,"" said Sir Keir, prompting uproar on all sides and an intervention from Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who ordered MPs to calm down. Several MPs have told the BBC that they were urged by party managers, via text or phone call, to attend Prime Minister's Questions to support Mr Johnson. PM accused of 'shambolic' speech to business group Is everything OK for Boris Johnson? Rail upgrade plans 'missed opportunity' for North Johnson: Peppa Pig World 'very much my kind of place' Sir Keir repeatedly claimed the government's plans for social care funding broke a Conservative manifesto pledge that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""He's picked the pockets of working people to protect the estates of the wealthiest,"" said the Labour leader, adding: ""How could he have devised a working class dementia tax?"" Mr Johnson said homes will not be included in the cap on costs, adding that Labour did not have a plan to solve the problem. The prime minister said the government's ""huge investment"" in health and social care meant people will be able to insure themselves against the ""catastrophic cost"" of suffering from diseases such as dementia. Sir Keir also accused Mr Johnson of breaking a promise not to raise taxes - and to deliver a ""rail revolution"" in the North of England, despite now cancelling the northern leg of HS2. ""Who knows if he'll make it to the next election, but if he does, how can he expect anyone to take his promises seriously?,"" asked the Labour leader. Mr Johnson insisted there would be a rail revolution, and claimed the government was spending Â£96bn on upgrading links. And he said Sir Keir had campaigned against HS2 - which runs through his Holborn and St Pancras constituency - adding that he had backed the new high speed rail link even though it affected his own constituents, because it was in the national interest. ""How can they trust that man?"" he asked. Talk of ousting the PM seems fanciful. He has a track record of bouncing back from adversity. But it is worth noting that loud cheers from a leader's own side does not mean that underlying concerns have evaporated. The former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, was greeted by regular, co-ordinated standing ovations at his party conference, but that didn't prevent MPs quietly but definitively submitting letters of no confidence. The mood at the moment though seems to be for the current Conservative leader to get a grip rather than to get out. While Mr Johnson was on the back foot at PMQs, he nonetheless managed to step up attacks on the Labour leader too - the most effective of which was to suggest that HS2 would never have been built at all if Sir Keir Starmer had got his way. Boris Johnson's premiership has looked juddery recently, but hasn't yet been derailed. The SNP's Westminster Leader, Ian Blackford, also seized on reports of Tory disquiet with the PM's recent performance, accusing him of ""floundering in failure"" and asking him if he had ""considered calling it a day"". ""In the real world, people are suffering a Tory cost of living crisis, Brexit is hitting the economy hard, but the prime minister can't even give a coherent speech to business leaders,"" he added. He asked why Mr Johnson was ""clinging on when he quite clearly isn't up to the job"". The prime minister said the British public wanted to hear less about politics and more about what the government is doing ""for the people of Scotland"". Earlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab praised Mr Johnson's ""ebullient, bouncy, optimistic, Tiggerish character"", saying it ""livens up"" his speeches. He said there was a ""steeliness"" to the prime minister, adding: ""We work as a team"", and he dismissed the criticism as Westminster ""tittle tattle"". This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister is asked if he's OK after talking about Peppa Pig in a speech to business leaders Mr Johnson appeared before the CBI conference earlier this week to make his pitch for a ""green industrial revolution"" to business, including support for electric cars, investing in wind power and the government's integrated rail plan. But it drew more negative attention after his impression of a car and his personal anecdote from a trip to Peppa Pig World. ""I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,"" he told the conference. ""Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. ""It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig."" Asked after the speech, ""is everything OK?"", Mr Johnson said he thought people had ""got the vast majority of the points"" he wanted to make and that the speech ""went over well"". This video can not be played Justice Secretary Dominic Raab: 'The prime minister is a Tiggerish character' It comes after a few weeks of turbulence at Westminster. The PMbacked attempts to overhaul the standards system for MPs' conduct, blocking the suspension of Tory MP Owen Paterson -who had been found to have broken lobbying rules. No 10 performed a U-turn on the move following a furious backlash from MPs, including some Conservatives. But the fall-out led to accusations about sleaze, and wider questions about MPs' second jobs. The PM came under further pressure this week over the cost cap element of his social care plan, which charities warned could unfairly hit people with fewer assets. MPs backed the proposals, but it was only a narrow victory for Mr Johnson thanks to a significant Tory rebellion.

"Digital devices make access to pornography far easier Children as young as 11 are learning about sex from pornography, sexual health experts have said. They say they are seeing an increasing number of young people who believe sex needs to be violent as a result. Dr Kate Howells is concerned a lack of detail in plans for a newrelationship and sex education (RSE) curriculumcould see inconsistent teaching. The Welsh government said ""online safety, consent and sexual health"" were all included in proposals. If approved in the Senedd in December, details ofthe RSE code will be publishedin January. It would then be introduced to schools in September 2022 as mandatory learning for all pupils aged three to 16. 'Porn warped my expectations of how sex should be' Sex and religious education to be compulsory Relationship focus as sex education overhauled Dr Kate Howells fears children learning sex from porn without context affects relationships Dr Howells, an associate specialist in sexual health working in Bridgend, Swansea and Neath Port Talbot, believes the biggest change in teaching young people about sex education is access to digital devices. ""Pornography is often only one or two clicks away,"" she said. ""For those as young as 10 or 11, it might be their first sexual experience."" Research by the British Board of Film Classification alsoshows more than 60% of children,externalaged 11 to 13 who had seen pornography said it was unintentional. A mother, who shared her experiences with the NSPCC, said she found hundreds of messages which were ""sexual in nature"" on her 13-year-old daughter's phone as well as ""pornographic cartoons and videos"". The new curriculum is due to be introduced in 2022 A 16-year-old said she was worried she had become addicted to porn after watching it every night since someone ""dared"" her to watch it in Year 7. Dr Howells believes such experiences mean some children are learning about sex from porn without the context of being in a caring relationship. ""We are seeing more young people think that sex needs to be violent,"" she added. ""It's often exaggerated and unrealistic and it could have a massive detrimental effect on young people if it isn't addressed."" Dr Jasmin Khan Singh says young people are often surprised by how unrealistic porn is Dr Jasmin Khan Singh, associate specialist in sexual medicine and sexual health at Cardiff Royal Infirmary, said often many young people are in disbelief that pornography is not realistic. ""You have to tell them the world is very different to what they're seeing online. They haven't got the developmental capacity to make sense of it,"" she said. Both experts have welcomed the fact online safety has been included in the draft guidance, but stress the importance of the curriculum tackling the effects of pornography and the dangers of digital devices. Dr Howells said: ""I think sometimes young people view porn as their sex education if they feel like they're not getting the information they need from elsewhere, that's where they'll look too to learn. Experts want more detail on what will be taught in schools Sophie Whitehead, a former secondary school teacher who now works withthe School of Sexuality Education,external, helps provide in-school workshops across Wales, England and Scotland about sexual health, pornography and positive relationships. She said: ""We teach the differences between what they see in pornography and what they can expect in their own sexual experiences."" Mrs Whitehead said access to digital devices has had an impact on what they now teach in lessons. ""In the last couple of years there's been probably an increase in experiences of receiving unsolicited explicit pictures,"" she added. ""We've started having more conversations about that and work with schools on how they approach it."" Children will be taught how to stay safe online However, she said it was not always easy for teachers in schools to talk to children about these topics. ""It's so difficult and really challenging, especially for teachers who don't necessarily have these conversations in their own day to day lives,"" said Mrs Whitehead. ""There needs to be a real focus on training for teachers so that they can feel confident when teaching these topics."" In January it was confirmed parents would no longer be able to withdraw children from sex education classes. ""We believe that all young people should have the right to access information that keeps them safe from harm,"" a Welsh government spokesman said. ""High quality RSE will help increase safety and well-being for all learners, and understanding of safe, consensual, equitable and positive relationships."" He added it has been designed to ""recognise learners' needs and experiences"", adding: ""Online safety, consent and sexual health are all included in the code at developmentally appropriate stages and are handled in a sensitive way.""

"Bulb has been handed about Â£1,000 per customer from the UK government to enable it to continue supplying energy. The firm was put into special administration on Wednesday, which will allow it keep trading for the moment. Bulb will be run by administrator Teneo until a buyer can be found or until its customers have moved. The government loan of nearly Â£1.7bn will mean the administration is managed in a way that the lights stay on for Bulb's 1.7 million customers. Teneo estimates it will cost around Â£2.1bn to keep Bulb trading until the end of April next year. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng can provide more money for the company if needed. Without the cash, Bulb would not have been able to keep going past the middle of December, court documents show. Due to its size, Bulb will be run as normal for the time being, rather than its customers being immediately transferred to other suppliers, as has happened with other failing energy providers. By April, the cap on energy prices may have increased significantly, which would mean higher revenues for the business. The company is three times larger than any other energy supplier that has failed in recent years. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Normally regulator Ofgem lets a firm fail and moves its customers to a new supplier. At the High Court in London, Justice Adam Johnson said that if left unresolved uncertainty over Bulb would be ""bound to have an effect on customers, employees and suppliers"". He said that the administration was designed ""to keep the energy supply company going, with a view to it being rescued if that is possible"". He added that an alternative would be to appoint a supplier of last resort, adding: ""That is thought to be impractical here, given the size and importance of Bulb as a supplier"". The judge said that the Â£1.7bn would be ""of existential importance to Bulb"". Earlier in the day, Mr Kwarteng said the special administration regime was a temporary arrangement to provide ""an ultimate safety net to protect consumers and ensure continued supply"". He told the House of Commons: ""We do not want this company to be in this temporary state longer than is absolutely necessary."" For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""With so many companies going bust in just two months, something not happening anywhere else in the world, it points to a systemic failure of regulation. ""Firms took risky bets and were allowed to do so and the government and Ofgem significantly deregulated the conditions of operation in 2016. Mr Miliband called for ""a proper external review of the regulation of the market"". As a result of a cap limiting what companies can charge their customers, some businesses have been forced to sell energy for less than they bought it for. Bigger companies tend to buy their gas further in advance, helping them avoid large hits from the price spike. However smaller firms that are less able to do that have come under pressure. Since the beginning of September, 22 energy suppliers have failed following a spike in gas prices. Labour MP Alex Sobel said: ""We're moving back to an oligopoly of energy companies who are increasing their profits whilst the supplier of last resort is socialising losses. Mr Kwarteng replied: ""I've always maintained that competition is absolutely essential in this market. ""What's happened is there's been a huge mismatch between the wholesale price and the retail price cap, and the retail price cap is there to protect consumers."" Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran suggested a ""Northern Rock-style energy company to take on customers of companies that have gone under"" if the current process is not working. Consumer group Which? said the support ""should provide reassurance"" to Bulb customers. ""We recommend Bulb customers to do nothing and wait for more information about the special administration process,"" said Which? home products and services editor Lisa Barber. ""Its customers will continue to see their bills limited by the price cap, which is likely to be the best deal for them at the moment. ""There are few savings to be made by switching and some suppliers are not taking on new customers due to high wholesale gas prices,"" she added. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust?

"This video can not be played Sturgeon: I'm going to be around a lot longer Scotland's first minister has dismissed speculation about her future by saying she has ""no intention of going anywhere"". Nicola Sturgeon said rumours she might soon be looking to leave frontline politics were ""wishful thinking"" by her opponents. And she said she would continue to govern as first minister for the full term of the Scottish Parliament. Ms Sturgeon has served as first minister since 2014. She was re-elected in May after the SNP won the Scottish Parliament election with a record share of the vote. But she has regularly spoken about the emotional toll of leading the country through the Covid pandemic, leading to rumours that she may have one eye on her life after politics. Has Scotland moved closer to indyref2? This was heightened when Ms Sturgeon said ina recent interview with Vogue magazine,externalthat she and her husband - SNP chief executive Peter Murrell - may wish to foster children in the future. Speaking to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg ahead of the SNP's autumn conference, which begins on Friday, Ms Sturgeon said she intended to remain as first minister for the full five-year parliamentary term. Referring to speculation about her future, she said: ""It is almost as if my opponents have concluded they can't beat me or remove me from office themselves, so they're kind of crossing their fingers and hoping that I'll remove myself from office. ""But they are going to be really disappointed because I'm going to be around a lot longer. ""I was elected seven months ago, having asked people in Scotland to put their trust in me for a five year term as first minister. ""They gave me that trust and they re-elected me. We face serious times as a country and I intend to fulfil that mandate."" Ms Sturgeon, who is 51, added that she has ""no intentions of going anywhere right now as first minister"", but that she hoped to still be ""relatively young when I get to the point of contemplating other things"". Ms Sturgeon was re-elected as first minister after the SNP won the Holyrood election in May The SNP's manifesto ahead of the election said it would hold a second referendum on independence by the end of 2023, Covid permitting. Ms Sturgeon said she would be taking the ""necessary steps"" to ensure that happens, with the Scottish government having recently resumed its plans for indyref2 after putting them on hold at the start of the pandemic. She said this would include publishing a referendum bill in the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish government will also set out the ""advantages and opportunities of independence"", which Ms Sturgeon said would include ""how we will navigate some of the more difficult issues"". Ms Sturgeon said Scotland must decide what kind of country it wants to be after the pandemic is over, but stressed she does not want a referendum to be held ""while we are still worrying about face coverings and testing ourselves every day"". The prime minister has said it would be reckless to have a referendum while the country is dealing with the impact of Covid She said she hoped the country would be out of the ""acute"" phase of the pandemic early next year, and that people's minds would be turning to the ""positive, optimistic task of how do we build a better country, how do we build a fairer, more equal, more prosperous country for the future"". The first minister added: ""That means for Scotland getting to choose who's making these decisions, not having somebody like Boris Johnson imposed on us and deciding for ourselves."" The UK government has said the question of Scottish independence should not be on the table while the country is still dealing with the pandemic, with the prime minister saying it would be ""irresponsible and reckless"" to do so. And it has pointed to the UK-wide schemes such as the vaccine rollout and furlough as evidence that Scotland is better off as part of the UK. Opinion polls have suggested that Scotland remains split almost 50-50 on the question of independence - although support for remaining in the UK has been slightly ahead on average over the past six months. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that her side of the debate has ""still got a job to do"" to persuade a majority of Scottish voters that the country should become independent. She added: ""I think we are much closer to that than ever before, but are we there yet? No."" Sturgeon: I'm going to be around a lot longer.

"This video can not be played Speaking from Downing Street, PM Boris Johnson 'shocked and saddened' at migrant deaths At least 27 people headed for the UK have drowned in the English Channel near Calais after their boat sank. The International Organization for Migration said it was the biggest single loss of life in the Channel since it began collecting data in 2014. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled"" by what happened, adding the UK would leave ""no stone unturned"" to stop human trafficking gangs. Five women and a girl were among the dead, France's interior minister said. Gerald Darmanin also said two people were rescued and one was missing. It was earlier reported 31 people had died, but the total was revised down overnight on Thursday. Four people had been arrested near to the Belgian border, he added, saying: ""We suspect that they were directly linked to this particular crossing."" On Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to step up joint efforts to prevent the crossings and stop the gangs putting people's lives at risk, Downing Street said. LIVE UPDATES: Dozens drown after migrant boat sinks Channel migrant deaths: What do we know so far? What happens to migrants who reach the UK? A fishing boat sounded the alarm on Wednesday afternoon after spotting several people at sea off the coast of France. French and British authorities are conducting a rescue operation by air and sea to see if they can find anyone. A French volunteer sea rescue organisation boat carrying bodies of migrants arrived at Calais harbour Mr Johnson said the deaths were a ""disaster"", adding that it was vital to ""break"" the people trafficking gangs which, he said, were ""literally getting away with murder"". Speaking after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting, the prime minister said more needed to be done to stop criminals organising crossings. ""It also shows how vital it is that we now step up our efforts to break the business model of the gangsters who are sending people to sea in this way,"" he said. He also admitted efforts so far to stem the flow of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats ""haven't been enough"" and that the UK would offer to increase its support to France. Downing Street later said Mr Johnson and Mr Macron agreed on the importance of close working with neighbours in Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as other European countries, to tackle the problem before people reach the French coast. Â The UK has pledged to give France â¬62.7m (Â£54m) during 2021-22 to help increase police patrols along its coastline, boost aerial surveillance and increase security infrastructure at ports. Home Secretary Priti Pateltweeted,externalthat the deaths were ""starkest possible reminder"" of the dangers migrants face attempting to cross the Channel. This video can not be played BBC Newsnight: Lewis Goodall reports from Dunkirk's new migrant camp. By BBC Newsnight policy editor Lewis Goodall The grim truth is today was predicted and predictable. We had been told that many would attempt to cross the Channel overnight due to rapidly worsening weather. But it became clear that the numbers involved and the quality of boats in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes made tragedy inevitable. Politicians on both sides of the Channel have already blamed the smugglers, who are indifferent to loss of life. But there will be questions for both governments. For France on the conditions in the camps, with children living in the woods and streets. And for Britain the lack of legal routes for asylum to the UK, which critics says is one of the main reasons people accept the risk of taking to the seas. I've been told today people were still trying to cross the Channel earlier this afternoon. The terrible weather âexpected in the coming days means people know this is their last chance to make it to the UK for a while. French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said five women and a girl were among those who died Mr Macron said: ""France will not let the Channel become a cemetery."" He promised to ""find and condemn those responsible"" for the tragedy. Mr Macron also called for an ""emergency meeting of European ministers concerned by the migration challenge"". He said since the start of this year 1,552 smugglers had been arrested in Northern France and 44 smuggler networks dismantled. Despite this, 47,000 attempted Channel crossings to the UK had taken place this year and 7,800 migrants have been rescued, Mr Macron added. Emergency services took part in the rescue operation at Calais harbour A group of migrants run on the beach with an inflatable dinghy near Wimereux in northern France on Wednesday morning A number of people are believed to have reached the UK in small boats on Wednesday, with people seen being brought ashore in Dover by immigration officials. BBC Newsnight's policy editor,Lewis Goodall,external, said he understood about 25 boats had attempted the crossing so far during the day. It comes amid record numbers of migrants making the crossing from France to the UK. More than 25,700 people have made the dangerous journey to the UK in small boats this year -more than three times the 2020 total. The Dover Strait is the busiest shipping lane in the world and has claimed many lives of people trying to cross to Britain in inflatable dinghies. It is thought at least 10 other people had died in the past few weeks while attempting to make the crossing. Were you in the area? Do you have any information to share?

"Ahmaud Arbery, 25, was shot dead in February 2020 in the US state of Georgia After being chased by three white men, Arbery was shot by Travis McMichael during a struggle Travis McMichael, his father Gregory and neighbour William Bryan were all found guilty of murder They claimed they were defending themselves while trying to make a citizen's arrest But prosecutors said Arbery was attacked by men who pursued him because of racial bias His family's lawyers have called it a modern-day lynching The case has raised questions about racial justice in the US South Edited by Jessica Murphy Thanks for following our live coverage as a US jury delivered a verdict in the Ahmaud Arbery murder trial. You can follow updates to the story here. Travis McMichael, his father Greg McMichael and their neighbour William Bryan were found guilty by a mostly-white jury of killing the 25-year-old black jogger in 2020. Family had called Arbery's killing a ""modern-day lynching"". The case drew national attention after a video of the confrontation went viral. The verdict, which came after two days of deliberations, followed 13 days of trial arguments and testimony. Supporters outside the court chanted Arbery's name as the convicted men were led out of the court in shackles. No sentencing date has yet been set for the trio, who each face decades behind bars. Lawyers for the McMichaels say they plan to appeal the decision. Earlier, the BBC spoke with Arbery's sister, Jasmine. ""Ahmaud was so much more than what happened that day,"" she said. You can watch the full interview below. Today's coverage was brought to you by Jessica Murphy, Ritu Prasad, Bernd Debusmann, Sam Cabral and Max Matza. This video can not be played Ahmaud Arbery: 'He was wonderful in every way' As we wind down our live coverage, here are some
of this afternoon's big moments:  File photo of Harris US Vice-President Kamala
Harris says that the Arbery murder trial verdicts ""send an important message"", but the country still has âwork to doâ in the wake of the verdict in the
Arbery case. In a statement, Harris, who is the nation's first black and Asian-American vice-president, said ""we still feel the weight of grief"". âAhmaud Arbery should be
alive, and nothing can take away the pain that his mother Wanda Cooper-Jones,
his father Marcus Arbery and the entire Arbery family and community feel today,â
she said. âI share that pain.â She also criticised the defence team for their tone ""that cast the attendance of ministers at the trial as intimidation
and dehumanised a young black man with racist tropes"". âAhmaud Arbery was a son. He
was a brother. He was a friend. His life had meaning,â the vice-president
added. ""We honour him best by continuing the fight for
justice."" Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr says he believes that the death of Ahmaud Arbery ""should
have never occurred"". In a statement on Wednesday, Carr said that âtodayâs verdict
brings us one step closer to justice, healing and reconciliation for Ahmaudâs
family, the community, the state and the nation"". In May 2020 â three months after Arberyâs death â Carr formally
requested that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation look into the conduct of prosecutors
in the case. One of the prosecutors, Jackie Johnson, now faces charges that she
violated her oath of office and that she hindered and obstructed a law enforcement
officer. Carr has said the state is committed to ""a complete and transparent review"" of the case's handling. Ahmaud Arbery was out for an afternoon jog in Brunswick, Georgia on 23 February 2020. Gregory McMichael, a neighbourhood resident, told police he believed Arbery resembled the suspect in a series of local break-ins. Police have said no reports were filed regarding these alleged break-ins. McMichael and his son Travis armed themselves with a pistol and a shotgun and pursued Arbery in a pickup truck through the neighbourhood. William Bryan later joined the pursuit. 



The 25-year-old Arbery was unarmed. The younger McMichael testified during the trial that he tried to talk to Arbery while the two were still in their truck and Arbery never responded. 



He got out of the truck and  fired his shotgun at Arbery during a struggle. Travis McMichael claimed self-defence saying Arbery grabbed at his gun. 



Three shots were fired.



A post-mortem examination showed Arbery had two gunshot wounds in his chest, and a gunshot graze wound on the inside of one of his wrists. Tears stream down the face of Wanda Cooper-Jones, Ahmaud Arbery's mother, as the jury delivers guilty verdicts against her son's killers Marcus Arbery (centre) hugs family attorney Ben Crump as the jury verdict is delivered Members of Arbery's extended family react outside the courtroom Civil rights leader Al Sharpton (centre) walks hand in hand with Arbery's parents - Wanda Cooper-Jones and Marcus Arbery - after the verdict Travis McMichael looks back at family after a jury found him guilty on all nine counts, including murder and false imprisonment Supporters react to the verdict outside the Glynn County courthouse Attorney Laura Hogue (right) hugs Greg McMichael's wife Leigh McMichael (centre) and his daughter Lindsey McMichael Reverend William Barber led an interfaith religious prayer in Glynn County this morning ahead of the verdict. A familiar figure at civil rights protests, Barber told CNN that today is ""a good and powerful day for justice"" but it was ""sad and ridiculous that we even had to have a trial"". ""It's a complicated day in America."" He called not for ""exuberance"" but an examination of how something like this could have happened in the first place. ""Three vicious killers... killing an unarmed black man, for running in the wrong place,"" he points out. Barber also questioned whether a jury would have returned a guilty verdict without the video evidence. He credited Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, for continuing to push for justice and accountability for her son's murder. ""When many of us weren't there. she fought a lot of this by herself and kept pushing."" Martin Luther King Jr was a Baptist preacher During the trial, black faith leaders from across the country flocked to the Arbery familyâs side, in response to what they deemed a ""21st-century lynching"". Religious leaders have long played a central role in black Americaâs civil rights struggle. Martin Luther King Jr, a Baptist minister, led the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955, shortly after the arrest of Rosa Parks, an African-American woman who refused to give up her seat to a white passenger. Two years later, King and other black ministers formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. âFreedom Songsâ derived from black gospel choir hymns imbued the spirit of the movement. At rallies around the courtroom, leaders like Martin Luther King III - the iconic preacherâs oldest living child - echoed decades-old calls to stand in solidarity and prayer. âDad used to say, 'injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,'"" King III recalled. The McMichaels and William Bryan were armed when they pursued Ahmaud Arbery and cornered him with their pickup trucks. They told police they suspected the jogger was linked to recent neighbourhood burglaries, so they wanted to make a ""citizen's arrest"". The citizen's arrest law dated back to the American Civil War era and was established in 1863. It allowed an individual to detain someone they had seen committing a serious crime and if the suspect was trying to escape. The state law was repealed last May in the wake of the Arbery murder. Campaigners said the law was used to round up escaped slaves. The Arbery incident also shone a spotlight on the fact that Georgia was one of only four states at the time with no hate crime statutes. Hate crime legislation has since been passed into law. A separate federal hate crimes trial against the three defendants is soon set to begin. Travis and Gregory McMichael and William Bryan stood silently as the jury read their verdict. All three declined to address the court afterward. Watch the moment below. This video can not be played The moment guilty verdicts read in black jogger murder trial All three defendants are still facing a federal
hate crimes trial after being indicted by a grand jury on 28 April. In the federal case, Travis and Gregory McMichael and William Bryan each face one count of interference
with rights and one count of attempted kidnapping. Additionally, the McMichaels were also each charged
with one count of using, carrying and brandishing â and in Travis McMichaelâs case, shooting â a firearm during a crime. The eight-page indictment accuses the men of targeting Arbery because
of his ""race and colour"". Jury selection in the federal trial has been scheduled for 7
February. Following a meeting with civil rights activists in April, US
Attorney General Merrick Garland said that the Department of Justice ""would
once again deploy all of its considerable resources to ensure, in the words of [Martin Luther] King, âjustice
for all peopleâ"".  A former prosecutor is still facing federal charges for allegedly
mishandling the Arbery case and shielding the defendants from prosecution. Then-district attorneyJackie Johnson stands charged of violatingher oath of office and obstructing and hindering a law enforcement officer. The September indictment from the Georgia Attorney Generalâs
office claims  Johnson âknowingly and wilfullyâ hindering the arrest of
Travis McMichael. It also alleges that Johnson showed âfavour and affectionâ to
Gregory McMichael, who was a former employee of the district attorneyâs office. She has denied any wrongdoing. She recused herself from the case because of her connection with
the elder McMichael. It was 74 days after Arberyâs death that the defendants
were arrested. The prosecutor who replaced Johnson, George Barnhill, eventually
recused himself amid widespread public backlash after it was revealed that his
son worked in her office with Gregory McMichael. He had also advised police against arrests following the shooting,
arguing that Arbery had been âburglarisingâ and was being following in âhot pursuitâ. Jason Sheffield, a lawyer for Travis McMichael,  tells reporters outside the court that this is a ""very very sad verdict"" for the men and their defense lawyers. The two McMichaels are men who ""honestly think they believe that what they were doing was the right thing to do,"" says Sheffield. ""However the Glynn County jury has found them guilty and they will be sentenced."" ""He was very stoic"" as the verdict was being read, lawyer Robert Rubin says of Greg McMichaels, adding that he was standing beside him as he heard his verdict. ""No single case is a referendum on the criminal justice system in America,"" adds Mr Rubin, who says the lawyers ""welcome"" the racial justice conversation the case has sparked. They add that they plan to appeal and praised the family of Arbery, the judge and jury. Earlier today, Kevin Gough, a lawyer for William Bryan, told the New York Times: âWhile we disagree with the verdict, we must respect it.â Leading black activists and public figures are hailing the jury verdict in Georgia as a sign of progress and change. A tweet from the Black Lives Matter organisation hailed the result: ""May this victory inspire the continued struggle for black freedom."" Oscar-winning actress Viola Davis said the guilty verdict was ""as it should be"". Georgia's black Senator Raphael Warnock and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams also expressed gratitude. And the Martin Luther King Jr Center echoed the words of the famous preacher: ""... until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream"". Allow Twitter content?

The trial over the killing of Ahmaud Arbery lasted 13 days before the jury began deliberating yesterday. Here are the key moments: This video can not be played Ahmaud Arbery: Key moments in the trial over black jogger's killing Chelsea BaileyDigital producer, BBC News When
it comes to understanding the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, it is as important to consider where this tragedy
happened as it is to consider how it happened. There
are still visible totems of slavery that can be seen throughout Glynn County, Georgia,
whether itâs the streets named after former slave owners, or idyllic
neighbourhoods still proudly called plantations. Arberyâs family can trace their lineage back to some of the first slaves
brought to this part of coastal Georgia. And it was that realisation that
compelled local lawyer, Jim Barger, to speak out after Arbery was killed. Barger
said a lot of white locals have âsequestered this incident into one encounterâ
and feel like it won't happen again. âBut
it will happen again,â he said. âAccountability, I think is first, truth.
Admitting what happened here and that it's part of a continuum of racial
violence, that was meant to scare (black) people. âIf
we can admit that, then we can start to overcome and create a society where we
all feel safe.â The White House has just released a statement from President Joe Biden in response to the verdict in Georgia. ""Ahmaud Arberyâs killing â witnessed by the world on video â is a devastating reminder of how far we have to go in the fight for racial justice in this country,"" he wrote. ""Mr Arbery should be here today, celebrating the holidays with his mother, Wanda Cooper Jones, and his father, Marcus Arbery."" ""Nothing can bring Mr Arbery back to his family and to his community, but the verdict ensures that those who committed this horrible crime will be punished,"" he continued. He credited the verdict as proof of the justice system ""doing its job"" but says ""that alone is not enough"", calling on Americans to recommit ""to building a future of unity and shared strength, where no one fears violence because of the colour of their skin"". After being found guilty of multiple counts of murder, the
judge must now set a sentencing date for Travis and Gregory McMichael and William
Bryan. Travis McMichael was found guilty of all nine counts, while
Gregory was found guilty of all the charges with the exception of malice
murder. William Bryan, for his part, was found guilty on three
counts of felony murder, as well as one count of aggravated assault, one count
of false imprisonment, and one count of criminal attempt to commit a felony. Felony and malice murder charges alone are punishable by
death or life imprisonment with or without the possibility of parole. Prosecutors
in the case are not seeking the death penalty. The judge will now determine whether the defendantâs life sentences have the possibility of parole. The other charges carry a range of punishments, ranging from
one to five years in prison for criminal contempt to commit a felony to 20
years for aggravated assault. Additionally, all three men now face a federal hate crimes
trial after being charged on 28 April. They are expected to stand trial in February. Georgia's Republican Governor Brian Kemp has just released this statement on the jury's verdict. ""Ahmaud Arbery was the victim of a vigilantism that has no place in Georgia,"" he says. He adds that ""legal efforts continue to hold accountable all who may be responsible"" for Arbery's death. ""We hope the Arbery family, the Brunswick community, our state, and those around the nation who have been following this case can now move forward down a path of healing and reconciliation."" Marcus Arbery (centre) Marcus Arbery, the father of  Ahmaud Arbery, is now speaking outside the court. ""We conquered that lynch mob,"" he shouts into microphones. ""I wouldn't want to see no daddy see their kid get lynched down and shot like that,"" he says. Earlier today he was evicted from the courtroom after cheering when the guilty verdict was read. ""Let's keep doing,"" he tells activists outside the Georgia courthouse. ""And let's keep fighting to make this place better for all human beings."" ""Love everybody,"" Mr Arbery continues. ""All human beings need to be treated equally."" ""Today is a good day,"" he concludes. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played PMQs: Sir Keir Starmer claims the PM has devised a ""working class dementia tax"" to pay for health and social care costs Boris Johnson batted away opposition calls for him to stand down and defended himself against accusations of ""broken promises"" at PMQs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM on social care funding, rail investment and tax. Picking up on reports of Tory disquiet after the PM's chaotic speech to business leaders, he asked: ""Is everything OK, prime minister?"" The PM said the government was ""delivering for...working people"". The Conservative benches were packed for the exchanges, in contrast to last week's session. ""I see they have turned up this week prime minister,"" said Sir Keir, prompting uproar on all sides and an intervention from Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who ordered MPs to calm down. Several MPs have told the BBC that they were urged by party managers, via text or phone call, to attend Prime Minister's Questions to support Mr Johnson. PM accused of 'shambolic' speech to business group Is everything OK for Boris Johnson? Rail upgrade plans 'missed opportunity' for North Johnson: Peppa Pig World 'very much my kind of place' Sir Keir repeatedly claimed the government's plans for social care funding broke a Conservative manifesto pledge that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""He's picked the pockets of working people to protect the estates of the wealthiest,"" said the Labour leader, adding: ""How could he have devised a working class dementia tax?"" Mr Johnson said homes will not be included in the cap on costs, adding that Labour did not have a plan to solve the problem. The prime minister said the government's ""huge investment"" in health and social care meant people will be able to insure themselves against the ""catastrophic cost"" of suffering from diseases such as dementia. Sir Keir also accused Mr Johnson of breaking a promise not to raise taxes - and to deliver a ""rail revolution"" in the North of England, despite now cancelling the northern leg of HS2. ""Who knows if he'll make it to the next election, but if he does, how can he expect anyone to take his promises seriously?,"" asked the Labour leader. Mr Johnson insisted there would be a rail revolution, and claimed the government was spending Â£96bn on upgrading links. And he said Sir Keir had campaigned against HS2 - which runs through his Holborn and St Pancras constituency - adding that he had backed the new high speed rail link even though it affected his own constituents, because it was in the national interest. ""How can they trust that man?"" he asked. Talk of ousting the PM seems fanciful. He has a track record of bouncing back from adversity. But it is worth noting that loud cheers from a leader's own side does not mean that underlying concerns have evaporated. The former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, was greeted by regular, co-ordinated standing ovations at his party conference, but that didn't prevent MPs quietly but definitively submitting letters of no confidence. The mood at the moment though seems to be for the current Conservative leader to get a grip rather than to get out. While Mr Johnson was on the back foot at PMQs, he nonetheless managed to step up attacks on the Labour leader too - the most effective of which was to suggest that HS2 would never have been built at all if Sir Keir Starmer had got his way. Boris Johnson's premiership has looked juddery recently, but hasn't yet been derailed. The SNP's Westminster Leader, Ian Blackford, also seized on reports of Tory disquiet with the PM's recent performance, accusing him of ""floundering in failure"" and asking him if he had ""considered calling it a day"". ""In the real world, people are suffering a Tory cost of living crisis, Brexit is hitting the economy hard, but the prime minister can't even give a coherent speech to business leaders,"" he added. He asked why Mr Johnson was ""clinging on when he quite clearly isn't up to the job"". The prime minister said the British public wanted to hear less about politics and more about what the government is doing ""for the people of Scotland"". Earlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab praised Mr Johnson's ""ebullient, bouncy, optimistic, Tiggerish character"", saying it ""livens up"" his speeches. He said there was a ""steeliness"" to the prime minister, adding: ""We work as a team"", and he dismissed the criticism as Westminster ""tittle tattle"". This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister is asked if he's OK after talking about Peppa Pig in a speech to business leaders Mr Johnson appeared before the CBI conference earlier this week to make his pitch for a ""green industrial revolution"" to business, including support for electric cars, investing in wind power and the government's integrated rail plan. But it drew more negative attention after his impression of a car and his personal anecdote from a trip to Peppa Pig World. ""I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,"" he told the conference. ""Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. ""It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig."" Asked after the speech, ""is everything OK?"", Mr Johnson said he thought people had ""got the vast majority of the points"" he wanted to make and that the speech ""went over well"". This video can not be played Justice Secretary Dominic Raab: 'The prime minister is a Tiggerish character' It comes after a few weeks of turbulence at Westminster. The PMbacked attempts to overhaul the standards system for MPs' conduct, blocking the suspension of Tory MP Owen Paterson -who had been found to have broken lobbying rules. No 10 performed a U-turn on the move following a furious backlash from MPs, including some Conservatives. But the fall-out led to accusations about sleaze, and wider questions about MPs' second jobs. The PM came under further pressure this week over the cost cap element of his social care plan, which charities warned could unfairly hit people with fewer assets. MPs backed the proposals, but it was only a narrow victory for Mr Johnson thanks to a significant Tory rebellion.

"Stella Creasy sat in the Commons chamber with her son in September An MP has said it ""has to be possible for politics and parenting to mix"" after being told she cannot sit in the Commons with her three-month-old son. Labour's Stella Creasy was informed it was against the rules to bring a child to a debate at Westminster Hall after doing so on Tuesday. Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has asked a committee of MPs to review the rules. Ms Creasy said she was""pleased to hear this"",external- as rules meant she could not be in the chamber for his statement. But Conservative MP Scott Benton criticised her stance on Twitter, saying: ""Parents who get paid a fraction of what you do pay for childcare and juggle responsibilities so they can go to work. What makes you so special?"" Addressing the Commons, Sir Lindsay said it was ""extremely important"" for parents to be able to participate fully in the work of the House, which has a nursery. ""Rules have to be seen in context and they change with the times,"" he told the House. He asked the Commons Procedure Committee to ""look into this matter"". The committee, chaired by Conservative MP Karen Bradley,makes recommendations on the practical operation of the House.,external This video can not be played Speaker Hoyle on babies in Commons: Rules change with the times Ms Creasy told the BBC she had regularly taken her son - whom she is breastfeeding - and before him, her daughter, into the Commons chamber. But after appearing with her son at the adjoining Westminster Hall on Tuesday, she received an email from the private secretary to the chairman of the ways and means committee, Dame Eleanor Laing, which said this was not in line with recently published rules on ""behaviour and courtesies"". Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said he had ""a lot of sympathy"" for Ms Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, and politicians needed to make sure ""our profession is brought into the modern world... [so] parents can juggle the jobs they do with the family time they need"". But, while saying a baby in the Commons ""certainly wouldn't distract me or get in the way of me doing my job"", Mr Raab said it was for the House authorities to decide the ""right balance"". Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the PM wanted to see ""further improvements"" on making Parliament family-friendly, though any change to the rules was a matter for the Commons. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment while the Procedure Committee considered the matter. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Creasy - who is encouraging more mothers to enter politics through a campaign called This Mum Votes - shared the email she was sent on Twitter, writing: ""Mothers in the mother of all parliaments are not to be seen or heard it seems..."" The rule book,which was issued,externalby the speaker and deputy speakers and applies to the chamber of the House of Commons and Westminster Hall, was updated in September. It says: ""You should not take your seat in the chamber when accompanied by your child, nor stand at either end of the Chamber, between divisions."" The same wording was also used in a previous version of the rule book. But another MP, Alex Davies-Jones, said she had been assured by Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle that if she needed to breastfeed her child in the chamber she could do so. Ms Creasy said this was ""not a system that works for anyone who isn't a man of a certain age from a certain background"". ""I don't have maternity cover - I don't have the employment rights to have maternity cover,"" she said, adding the situation as it stands ""is bad for our democracy"". Asked what needed to change to help MPs continue to work as new parents, she said: ""It's too late for me - so I am trying my best to make sure Walthamstow continues to be heard because it deserves to be heard."" She called for the MPs' rule book to be reviewed and has asked House authorities what she should do if she continues to bring her son to work. ""I've had a baby, I haven't given up my brain or capacity to do things and our politics and our policy making will be better by having more mums at the table,"" she added. Former MP Jo Swinson is believed to have been the first MP to cradle a baby during a Commons debate in 2018 While MPs are entitled to paid maternity leave for six months and a proxy vote, some have said it is difficult to obtain funding for adequate maternity cover. And MPs must be physically present at Westminster in order to represent constituents' views during Commons debates, for example. Former Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinsonwas thought to be the first MPto cradle her baby during a debate in the Commons chamber in 2018. Also that year, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardernbecame the first world leaderto take her baby to the floor of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. A House of Commons spokesperson said it was vital all MPs were able to carry out their duties in and around Parliament. They could consult with the Speaker, deputy Speakers, clerks and doorkeepers about their requirements while in the chamber or Westminster Hall at any time, they added.

"This video can not be played Speaking from Downing Street, PM Boris Johnson 'shocked and saddened' at migrant deaths At least 27 people headed for the UK have drowned in the English Channel near Calais after their boat sank. The International Organization for Migration said it was the biggest single loss of life in the Channel since it began collecting data in 2014. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled"" by what happened, adding the UK would leave ""no stone unturned"" to stop human trafficking gangs. Five women and a girl were among the dead, France's interior minister said. Gerald Darmanin also said two people were rescued and one was missing. It was earlier reported 31 people had died, but the total was revised down overnight on Thursday. Four people had been arrested near to the Belgian border, he added, saying: ""We suspect that they were directly linked to this particular crossing."" On Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to step up joint efforts to prevent the crossings and stop the gangs putting people's lives at risk, Downing Street said. LIVE UPDATES: Dozens drown after migrant boat sinks Channel migrant deaths: What do we know so far? What happens to migrants who reach the UK? A fishing boat sounded the alarm on Wednesday afternoon after spotting several people at sea off the coast of France. French and British authorities are conducting a rescue operation by air and sea to see if they can find anyone. A French volunteer sea rescue organisation boat carrying bodies of migrants arrived at Calais harbour Mr Johnson said the deaths were a ""disaster"", adding that it was vital to ""break"" the people trafficking gangs which, he said, were ""literally getting away with murder"". Speaking after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting, the prime minister said more needed to be done to stop criminals organising crossings. ""It also shows how vital it is that we now step up our efforts to break the business model of the gangsters who are sending people to sea in this way,"" he said. He also admitted efforts so far to stem the flow of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats ""haven't been enough"" and that the UK would offer to increase its support to France. Downing Street later said Mr Johnson and Mr Macron agreed on the importance of close working with neighbours in Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as other European countries, to tackle the problem before people reach the French coast. Â The UK has pledged to give France â¬62.7m (Â£54m) during 2021-22 to help increase police patrols along its coastline, boost aerial surveillance and increase security infrastructure at ports. Home Secretary Priti Pateltweeted,externalthat the deaths were ""starkest possible reminder"" of the dangers migrants face attempting to cross the Channel. This video can not be played BBC Newsnight: Lewis Goodall reports from Dunkirk's new migrant camp. By BBC Newsnight policy editor Lewis Goodall The grim truth is today was predicted and predictable. We had been told that many would attempt to cross the Channel overnight due to rapidly worsening weather. But it became clear that the numbers involved and the quality of boats in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes made tragedy inevitable. Politicians on both sides of the Channel have already blamed the smugglers, who are indifferent to loss of life. But there will be questions for both governments. For France on the conditions in the camps, with children living in the woods and streets. And for Britain the lack of legal routes for asylum to the UK, which critics says is one of the main reasons people accept the risk of taking to the seas. I've been told today people were still trying to cross the Channel earlier this afternoon. The terrible weather âexpected in the coming days means people know this is their last chance to make it to the UK for a while. French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said five women and a girl were among those who died Mr Macron said: ""France will not let the Channel become a cemetery."" He promised to ""find and condemn those responsible"" for the tragedy. Mr Macron also called for an ""emergency meeting of European ministers concerned by the migration challenge"". He said since the start of this year 1,552 smugglers had been arrested in Northern France and 44 smuggler networks dismantled. Despite this, 47,000 attempted Channel crossings to the UK had taken place this year and 7,800 migrants have been rescued, Mr Macron added. Emergency services took part in the rescue operation at Calais harbour A group of migrants run on the beach with an inflatable dinghy near Wimereux in northern France on Wednesday morning A number of people are believed to have reached the UK in small boats on Wednesday, with people seen being brought ashore in Dover by immigration officials. BBC Newsnight's policy editor,Lewis Goodall,external, said he understood about 25 boats had attempted the crossing so far during the day. It comes amid record numbers of migrants making the crossing from France to the UK. More than 25,700 people have made the dangerous journey to the UK in small boats this year -more than three times the 2020 total. The Dover Strait is the busiest shipping lane in the world and has claimed many lives of people trying to cross to Britain in inflatable dinghies. It is thought at least 10 other people had died in the past few weeks while attempting to make the crossing. Were you in the area? Do you have any information to share?

"One hundred people with learning disabilities and autism in England have been held in specialist hospitals for at least 20 years, the BBC has learned. The finding was made during an investigation into the case of an autistic man detained since 2001. Tony Hickmott's parents are fighting to get him housed in the community near them. BBC News overturned a court order which had prevented reporting of the case. Mr Hickmott's case is being heard at the Court of Protection - which makes decisions on financial or welfare matters for people who ""lack mental capacity"". Senior Judge Carolyn Hilder has described ""egregious"" delays and ""glacial"" progress in finding him the right care package which would enable him to live in the community. He lives in a secure Assessment and Treatment Unit (ATU) - designed to be a short-term safe space used in a crisis. It is a two-hours' drive from his family. This week, Judge Hilder lifted the anonymity order on Mr Hickmott's case - ruling it was in the public interest to let details be reported. She said he had been ""detained for so long"" partly down to a ""lack of resources"". Like many young autistic people with a learning disability, Mr Hickmott struggled as he grew into an adult. In 2001, he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. He is now 44. Pam and Roy Hickmott - their son Tony is pictured at the top of article ""Nine months we were told he'd be away, until they found him a suitable place in the Brighton area,"" says his father, 78-year-old Roy. Mr Hickmott was finally declared ""fit for discharge"" by psychiatrists in 2013, but he is still waiting for the authorities to find him a suitable home with the right level of care for his needs. ""If he'd murdered someone he'd be out now. He's lost his family, he's lost his home,"" says his mother Pam, who is 81. ""He's just a shadow of the human he used to be. There are so many families like us - crying and screaming. We are our children's voices."" His Assessment and Treatment Unit care is paid for by the NHS - but the cost of housing and caring for him in the community with trained staff would fall to Pam and Roy's local authority, Brighton and Hove, and local NHS commissioners. That process has been bogged down in delays and wrangles. Pam believes the delays are over funding. ""We've got judges telling them to get on with it but they're still not doing it, they're still fighting over the money."" Finding suitable housing with skilled support staff can be a complicated process. But Mr Hickmott's family argue it should have been put in place a long time ago. Pam and Roy's home is full of photographs showing their son in happier times. Birthday parties, smiling with his two sisters, holidaying with his mum and dad. The couple used to visit him twice a week - although, now they are that bit older, they just travel up on a Thursday. ""I've gone through three cars traveling to and fro,"" says Roy. ""Sometimes Pam and I travel back and pull in at the side of the road and we just cry."" Six evenings a week - at 17:00 - they speak to their son on the phone. ""He describes all the rooms in our house. His memory of his home is all he's got,"" says Pam. During past visits to the ATU, Pam says they drew pictures of a house with a garden by the sea. She would tell her son he would be home soon. ""He doesn't believe us any more. He doesn't believe he's coming home."" Pam and Roy Hickmott's family photos In addition to the 100 patients, including Mr Hickmott, who have been held for more than 20 years - there are currently nearly 2,000 other people with learning disabilities and/or autism detained in specialist hospitals across England. In 2015, the Government promised ""homes not hospitals"" when it launched its Transforming Care programme in the wake of the abuse and neglect scandal uncovered by the BBC at Winterbourne View specialist hospital near Bristol. But data shows the programme has had minimal impact. Ministers pledged to reduce the number of patients in such hospital settings by 35% by March 2020, with the aim of people being back in their communities with tailored support packages. But, by March last year, there were only 300 fewer patients detained - a reduction of just 13%. The 35% target has now slipped to 2023/24. It was further BBC News analysis of this official data which revealed that of 350 people detained for more than a decade, 100 of them have been in hospital settings for more than two decades. Numbers of people with learning disabilities and/or autism in inpatient units in England: March 2015 - 2,395 March 2020 - 2,095 October 2021 - 2,070 Source: NHS Digital Last month, crossbench peer Baroness Hollins - who has been reviewing long-term segregated care - told the House of Lords it was time to ""end the scandals"" and give people back their lives. But she also spoke of another man - Mr W - held largely in solitary confinement for 20 years but who, for the past three years, had lived around the corner from his parents. ""Despite still recovering from the trauma, he is now happy,"" she said. This is what Roy and Pam Hickmott want. The author of the Serious Case Review into what happened at Winterbourne View, Dr Margaret Flynn told us the ""institutions"" detaining people like Tony should not exist. ""It's appalling. These people are not criminals. They are stuck, just as people used to be stuck in long-stay institutions."" She says there is so much testimony from people with a learning disability and/or autism - and their families - about ""harmful experiences"" when they are removed from ""all that is familiar to them"". âWe tried 225 childrenâs homes, none would take herâ Autistic man goes home after 15 years in hospital Judge Hilder - who has allowed Tony Hickmott's case to be reported following an application by the BBC and Sky News - has ordered the authorities involved in his care to work together to move him back to Brighton by May. In a statement, Brighton and Hove Council said: ""Tony has extremely complex needs. We've tried on a number of occasions to find a sustainable solution nearer to Brightonâ¦ these were not successful."" The council says it is working with the NHS and Mr Hickmott's family to find other options. NHS England in the South East says it is continuing to work with partner organisations - and Roy and Pam Hickmott - to ensure ""appropriate care and support is in place"". The Department for Health and Social Care told us it was determined to keep reducing the number of autistic people, and those with a learning disability, in specialist inpatient units - and that it was providing an extra Â£90m of funding this financial year. Its national strategy, it said, was to make life ""fundamentally better for autistic people, their families and carers"".

"Jennifer and Stephen Chapple died at their home in Norton Fitzwarren, Somerset A man has been charged with the murders of a couple who were killed in their home as their children slept upstairs. Jennifer and Stephen Chapple were found seriously injured at the house on Dragon Rise in Norton Fitzwarren, Somerset, at 21:45 GMT on Sunday and died at the scene. Collin Reeves, 34, also of Dragon Rise, is due to appear at Taunton Magistrates' Court on Thursday. A post-mortem examination confirmed the couple died from multiple stab wounds. The children, aged five and six, were unhurt and are being looked after by family members, Avon and Somerset Police said. Tributes to the couple have been left near their home on Dragon Rise A 67-year-old man who was arrested on suspicion of murder has been released under investigation. Mr Chapple, 36, taught computing at West Somerset College, where head teacher Gregg Mockridge said he will be ""sadly missed"". His wife, 33, worked in the coffee shop at a garden centre in the village, where staff said they were ""devastated"" at the loss of their ""much-loved friend"". Tributes were left among flowers laid near the couple's home on Dragon Rise in Norton Fitzwarren Det Insp Neil Meade, of Avon and Somerset Police, said: ""Specialist officers are providing support to Jennifer and Stephen's families and our thoughts remain with them this evening. ""We've been keeping them fully updated on the progress of our investigation and they're aware of this latest development."" The force has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) due to prior contact with the couple. Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Britain could face shortage of wine and spirits at Christmas, a drinks trade body has warned. In a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) said rising costs and supply chain chaos have held up deliveries. Imports were now taking up to five times longer than a year ago, it said. The government said: ""We do not expect disruption to the supply of alcohol this Christmas"". The letter was co-signed by 49 firms, including Pernod Ricard, MoÃ«t Hennessy and the Wine Society. It said the sector has been badly affected by the HGV driver shortage crisis, which the industry has blamed on factors including Covid and Brexit. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Lorry driver shortage: Government to lift rules on foreign haulier deliveries The letter said drinks businesses were still struggling, and further action was needed, particularly in the run up to Christmas - ""a critical trading period for our sector"". ""Unless urgent action is taken, we will fall deeper into delivery chaos,"" it added. ""Businesses like ours previously able to fulfil orders in two to three days now have to operate on a day one for day fifteen basis,"" the letter said. In addition, businesses are reporting increased costs of around 7% - and often more - by freight forwarders to account for driver retention. ""This is particularly a concern for SMEs [small and medium sized enterprises] who are unable to compete with large businesses to attract drivers."" It said drivers and vehicles were ""increasingly unpredictable"" in their arrival times, which meant goods being either not ready or left waiting for collection. It warned that being unable to fulfil orders on time would mean lost business and could ultimately lead to increased costs for consumers. ""Government needs to be doing all it can to ensure British business is not operating with one hand tied behind its back over the festive season and beyond,"" said Miles Beale, WSTA chief executive. The WSTA called for the temporary visa scheme for HGV drivers to be extended for a year. It also wants the government to act to help smooth congested freight routes from ports, and to provide more regular updates on how many HGV driver licences are being processed by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK has a strong food supply chain and we do not expect disruption to the supply of alcohol this Christmas. ""The government acted quickly to tackle the challenges to our supply chains, which were brought on by global pressures including the pandemic and the international shortage of HGV drivers."" It has invested Â£32.5m in roadside facilities for hauliers, put Â£17m into creating new HGV skills bootcamps, and launched a review of training, the spokesperson said. ""These measures are working, cutting the backlog through a huge increase in vocational licences issued and HGV tests conducted compared to before the pandemic, and there is now spare capacity in the testing system."" The warning from the drinks industry comes as food distributors warned MPs that consumers could face less food choice this Christmas because of supply chain issues. Shane Brennan, head of the Cold Chain Federation, said suppliers were scaling back plans to ensure they can deliver. The Cold Chain Federation represents firms involved in the storage and distribution of chilled and frozen products, including food. ""It's about reducing the amount of goods you're expected to put on the shelves,"" Mr Brennan said. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Former Tesco boss to advise on supply chain crisis Industry fears food shortages could be permanent He made the comments on Wednesday morning to the Transport Select Committee inquiry into the road freight supply chain. ""We are very good at piling high and selling it cheap at Christmas time,"" he said. ""What we're having to do is strategically scale that back, in order to basically meet the promise that there will be the stuff you expect to see on the shelves, but not necessarily all the extras."" Mr Brennan said the unpredictability of the past two years had made it the toughest period in members' memories, adding that there was a lot of tiredness in the industry and problems with retention. The supply chain is facing a number of pressures, such as drivers leaving the industry and difficulties recruiting new ones, border issues and delays with the movement of shipping containers. Global shipping supplies are in ""an unprecedented period of stress"", Mr Brennan told the committee. He said it was taking two or three days for fresh food arriving at UK ports to be delivered to stores, whereas this would normally happen on a same day or next day basis. For frozen food, the timescale has increased from between one and three days to up to five and six days. ""We're seeing significant changes and having to re-plan on that basis,"" Mr Brennan said. In September, Food and Drink Federation (FDF) boss Ian Wright warned that the UK was in for permanent food shortages. He said: ""The UK shopper and consumer could have previously expected just about any product they want to be on the [supermarket] shelf or in the restaurant all the time. ""That's over. And I don't think it's coming back."" According to the FDF, the food and drink industry is short of about half a million workers - or one in eight of the total workforce - which is leading to supply chain issues. Several companies including supermarkets, pubs and restaurants have blamed a lack of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) lorry drivers for causing problems in their supply chains, including shortages of some products. Lorry driver shortages have also been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. Elizabeth de Jong, the director of policy at freight and haulage trade association Logistics UK, highlighted a lack of available lorry parking facilities as a key reason putting people off driving jobs. She told the Transport Select Committee there had been evidence for years that there were far too few parking spaces, with people having to stay in their cabs at side of the road or on industrial estates, with no hygiene facilities. Duncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association, told the committee that many people loved lorry driving, but it was often it was the conditions that made them leave. However, Mr Buchanan added that the extent of the lorry driver shortage has started to ease. ""We are seeing improved throughput in tests. We had tests suspended. Since April there's been a real uptick in the throughput of people undertaking and passing tests. ""We reckon the shortage has probably fallen by about 15,000. Much of that is to do with improved test performance and improved retention. And these things when you talk about the driver shortage, everything is estimates based on intelligence we get, hard numbers are very difficult. ""But our estimate is we've come back 15,000.  And that's substantial, over 6 months."" Online giant warns of Christmas product shortages Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"One hundred people with learning disabilities and autism in England have been held in specialist hospitals for at least 20 years, the BBC has learned. The finding was made during an investigation into the case of an autistic man detained since 2001. Tony Hickmott's parents are fighting to get him housed in the community near them. BBC News overturned a court order which had prevented reporting of the case. Mr Hickmott's case is being heard at the Court of Protection - which makes decisions on financial or welfare matters for people who ""lack mental capacity"". Senior Judge Carolyn Hilder has described ""egregious"" delays and ""glacial"" progress in finding him the right care package which would enable him to live in the community. He lives in a secure Assessment and Treatment Unit (ATU) - designed to be a short-term safe space used in a crisis. It is a two-hours' drive from his family. This week, Judge Hilder lifted the anonymity order on Mr Hickmott's case - ruling it was in the public interest to let details be reported. She said he had been ""detained for so long"" partly down to a ""lack of resources"". Like many young autistic people with a learning disability, Mr Hickmott struggled as he grew into an adult. In 2001, he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. He is now 44. Pam and Roy Hickmott - their son Tony is pictured at the top of article ""Nine months we were told he'd be away, until they found him a suitable place in the Brighton area,"" says his father, 78-year-old Roy. Mr Hickmott was finally declared ""fit for discharge"" by psychiatrists in 2013, but he is still waiting for the authorities to find him a suitable home with the right level of care for his needs. ""If he'd murdered someone he'd be out now. He's lost his family, he's lost his home,"" says his mother Pam, who is 81. ""He's just a shadow of the human he used to be. There are so many families like us - crying and screaming. We are our children's voices."" His Assessment and Treatment Unit care is paid for by the NHS - but the cost of housing and caring for him in the community with trained staff would fall to Pam and Roy's local authority, Brighton and Hove, and local NHS commissioners. That process has been bogged down in delays and wrangles. Pam believes the delays are over funding. ""We've got judges telling them to get on with it but they're still not doing it, they're still fighting over the money."" Finding suitable housing with skilled support staff can be a complicated process. But Mr Hickmott's family argue it should have been put in place a long time ago. Pam and Roy's home is full of photographs showing their son in happier times. Birthday parties, smiling with his two sisters, holidaying with his mum and dad. The couple used to visit him twice a week - although, now they are that bit older, they just travel up on a Thursday. ""I've gone through three cars traveling to and fro,"" says Roy. ""Sometimes Pam and I travel back and pull in at the side of the road and we just cry."" Six evenings a week - at 17:00 - they speak to their son on the phone. ""He describes all the rooms in our house. His memory of his home is all he's got,"" says Pam. During past visits to the ATU, Pam says they drew pictures of a house with a garden by the sea. She would tell her son he would be home soon. ""He doesn't believe us any more. He doesn't believe he's coming home."" Pam and Roy Hickmott's family photos In addition to the 100 patients, including Mr Hickmott, who have been held for more than 20 years - there are currently nearly 2,000 other people with learning disabilities and/or autism detained in specialist hospitals across England. In 2015, the Government promised ""homes not hospitals"" when it launched its Transforming Care programme in the wake of the abuse and neglect scandal uncovered by the BBC at Winterbourne View specialist hospital near Bristol. But data shows the programme has had minimal impact. Ministers pledged to reduce the number of patients in such hospital settings by 35% by March 2020, with the aim of people being back in their communities with tailored support packages. But, by March last year, there were only 300 fewer patients detained - a reduction of just 13%. The 35% target has now slipped to 2023/24. It was further BBC News analysis of this official data which revealed that of 350 people detained for more than a decade, 100 of them have been in hospital settings for more than two decades.

But she also spoke of another man - Mr W - held largely in solitary confinement for 20 years but who, for the past three years, had lived around the corner from his parents. ""Despite still recovering from the trauma, he is now happy,"" she said. This is what Roy and Pam Hickmott want. The author of the Serious Case Review into what happened at Winterbourne View, Dr Margaret Flynn told us the ""institutions"" detaining people like Tony should not exist. ""It's appalling. These people are not criminals. They are stuck, just as people used to be stuck in long-stay institutions."" She says there is so much testimony from people with a learning disability and/or autism - and their families - about ""harmful experiences"" when they are removed from ""all that is familiar to them"". âWe tried 225 childrenâs homes, none would take herâ Autistic man goes home after 15 years in hospital Judge Hilder - who has allowed Tony Hickmott's case to be reported following an application by the BBC and Sky News - has ordered the authorities involved in his care to work together to move him back to Brighton by May. In a statement, Brighton and Hove Council said: ""Tony has extremely complex needs. We've tried on a number of occasions to find a sustainable solution nearer to Brightonâ¦ these were not successful."" The council says it is working with the NHS and Mr Hickmott's family to find other options. NHS England in the South East says it is continuing to work with partner organisations - and Roy and Pam Hickmott - to ensure ""appropriate care and support is in place"". The Department for Health and Social Care told us it was determined to keep reducing the number of autistic people, and those with a learning disability, in specialist inpatient units - and that it was providing an extra Â£90m of funding this financial year.

Numbers of people with learning disabilities and/or autism in inpatient units in England: March 2015 - 2,395 March 2020 - 2,095 October 2021 - 2,070 Source: NHS Digital Last month, crossbench peer Baroness Hollins - who has been reviewing long-term segregated care - told the House of Lords it was time to ""end the scandals"" and give people back their lives. But she also spoke of another man - Mr W - held largely in solitary confinement for 20 years but who, for the past three years, had lived around the corner from his parents. ""Despite still recovering from the trauma, he is now happy,"" she said. This is what Roy and Pam Hickmott want. The author of the Serious Case Review into what happened at Winterbourne View, Dr Margaret Flynn told us the ""institutions"" detaining people like Tony should not exist. ""It's appalling. These people are not criminals. They are stuck, just as people used to be stuck in long-stay institutions."" She says there is so much testimony from people with a learning disability and/or autism - and their families - about ""harmful experiences"" when they are removed from ""all that is familiar to them"". âWe tried 225 childrenâs homes, none would take herâ Autistic man goes home after 15 years in hospital Judge Hilder - who has allowed Tony Hickmott's case to be reported following an application by the BBC and Sky News - has ordered the authorities involved in his care to work together to move him back to Brighton by May. In a statement, Brighton and Hove Council said: ""Tony has extremely complex needs. We've tried on a number of occasions to find a sustainable solution nearer to Brightonâ¦ these were not successful."" The council says it is working with the NHS and Mr Hickmott's family to find other options. NHS England in the South East says it is continuing to work with partner organisations - and Roy and Pam Hickmott - to ensure ""appropriate care and support is in place"". The Department for Health and Social Care told us it was determined to keep reducing the number of autistic people, and those with a learning disability, in specialist inpatient units - and that it was providing an extra Â£90m of funding this financial year. Its national strategy, it said, was to make life ""fundamentally better for autistic people, their families and carers"".

"World Health Organization says more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week It warns against a ""false sense of security"" created by vaccines and stresses the need to be cautious Some 1.5 million Covid deaths have already been recorded in the WHO's Europe region of 53 countries The EU's public health agency says European countries should consider vaccine boosters for all adults Poland is warning that restrictions could be reintroduced if its infection rates don't start to fall The danger of a future UK pandemic is as serious as threats to the UK's defences, an ex-vaccines tsar says Netherlands considering new curbs after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus Edited by Paul Gribben Thank you for joining us today. As our live coverage comes to an end, here are some of Thursday's key developments in the pandemic: Today's live page was edited by Paul Gribben, and written by Dulcie Lee, Mal Siret, Adam Durbin and Matt Murphy. NFL star Aaron Rodgers has told US media he has developed a painful case of ""Covid toe"" after a brush with the virus earlier this month. The condition causes discoloration or lesions around the toes and researchers believe that it is caused by excess interferon, a protein which the body uses to fight infection. Rodgers told reporters after Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings that the condition is ""very, very painful"". The Green Bay Packers quarterback prompted controversy over his vaccination status when he tested positive for Covid-19 and entered a 10-day quarantine period - the minimum amount of time an unvaccinated player is asked to quarantine under NFL rules. However, in August he had seemed to indicate that he had received the jab, telling reporters that he was ""immunised"". He later said that he had been referring to his antibody levels and that he was treating his infection using the drug ivermectin, on the advice of podcast host Joe Rogan. Vladimir Putin has said he ""cannot understand"" the levels of vaccine hesitancy among Russians Russian officials say they have started to target people spreading anti-vaccine information online as the country aims to energise its sluggish vaccine rollout. The state healthcare regulator, Roszdravnadzor, said it had instructed its regional branches to report people - including
medical professionals - who ""deliberately spread false
information about the dangers of vaccination"". The agency told Reuters that it had already reported more
than 30 anti-vaccine campaigners, who could face fines of around Â£19,000 and up to five years in prison under ""fake news"" laws passed last year. Russia has struggled with widespread vaccine hesitancy and just 37% of people are fully vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly pleaded with people to take the jab. Last month he told state TV that he ""couldn't understand"" why people were refusing to come forward for the shot. âWe have a reliable and efficient vaccine,"" he said. ""The vaccine really reduces the risks of illness, grave complications and death.""  France is set to announce fresh measures on Thursday to curb the spread of Covid-19, as infection rates surge domestically and across Europe. However, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says there are no plans to introduce a new lockdown as some EU countries have done, the Reuters news agency reports. Speaking at a news conference, Attal says the government is looking to avoid major restrictions on public life. He explains it is instead looking to use other means of suppressing transmission like stricter social distancing, increasing the number and pace of booster jabs and tightening vaccine passport rules. Government spokesman Gabriel Attal says more detail will be announced tomorrow following a meeting of France's cabinet ""We must protect the French people by building on what we have, to save the end-of-year festivities and get through the winter as well as possible,"" the minister says. France's vaccine passport - known as the health pass - allows entry to cafes, restaurants, museums, cinemas and other public places for those who are fully vaccinated or have recently tested negative. The seven-day average of cases exceeded 20,000 for the first time since August on Tuesday, while coronavirus patients in intensive care rose to 1,455. Attal declined to specify what measures may be announced on Thursday, but the government is expected to follow the advice of France's health regulator to allow anyone over-40 to access a third dose of a Covid vaccine. Slovakia will limit
movement as part of a two-week lockdown in an attempt to stem a fast rise in
Covid-19 cases, the government has announced. Slovakians will only be permitted to travel for essential shopping,
work, school or medical visits, government ministers said on Wednesday. They will assess the situation after 10 days, although any easing of restrictions will be limited to those fully vaccinated against the virus. The decision to return to a lockdown comes after the government imposed new restrictions on unvaccinated people earlier this week in an attempt to push up vaccinations. Slovakia has the third-lowest vaccination rate in the EU. Less than 50% of people in the country of 5.5 million have been vaccinated and the vast majority of people in hospital are unvaccinated.  Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent This video can not be played Police fire warning shots at Covid protesters in the Netherlands The first suspects charged in connection with theriots in Rotterdamearlier this week over the partial lockdown called in the Netherlands have been appearing in court. A 26-year-old woman from Spijkenisse (a city that is part of the greater Rotterdam area) was found guilty of throwing stones at police vehicles. She was jailed for five months - two of them conditional - and ordered to pay 1,000 euros (Â£840) for damage to the cars. The second person to appear in court was a 29-year-old man from Delft, who was given a five-month sentence and a one-year restraining order for a large part of Rotterdam. The sentencing comes on the day the Netherlands reports 23,789 new Covid cases - the biggest one-day increase on record. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent in Strasbourg President David-Maria Sassoli (centre) at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Walking
into the European Parliament there are officials standing ready to check your Covid ""status"". People queue, with phone apps open, to prove they've been
double-jabbed. Inside, everyone on the move is wearing masks. Yet it was only
on Friday that the president of the European Parliament David-Maria Sassoli confirmed
the return to ""hybrid"" proceedings. That means members can participate in
debates and votes remotely. As a result, the
parliament continues to be less busy and less buzzy than before. Having said
that, walking the halls and dropping into the cafes, there are still plenty of
face-to-face meetings going on. People chatting over a coffee, lunch or even a
drink in the evening. Sat down, the masks largely come off. One of those
moments where things seem a little more normal. But it's a normality that
people here again think could increasingly evaporate as winter sets in and Covid once again grips large parts of Europe.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin said vaccinations should be voluntary ""on the whole"" Russia is registering a version of the country's Sputnik-V vaccine for children aged between 12 and 17, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. Ms Golikova has told a government meeting on Covid-19 that registration of the new treatment, named Gam-Covid-Vac, would take place later in the day, state news agency Tass reports. She said it was hoped the vaccine would enter civilian circulation in Russia from the end of December. The new vaccine will only be given to children under 15 with the consent of their parents or the child's legal representative, and to children over 15 only with their own consent, Ms Golikova said. Speaking at the same meeting, President Vladimir Putin urged the government to pay attention to the need for vaccines for children, but voiced scepticism about compulsory vaccination. ""On the whole, inoculations should be voluntary - specially for children,"" Tass quoted him as saying. There have been 43,676 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours,according to the latest data,external. This means there have been 303,071 people who have tested positive for the virus in the last seven days, - up by 11.1% on the week before. There have also been 149 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, taking the weekly total to 926 - a 9.4% fall on the previous seven-day period. Around 80.4% of people over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated, while 88.4% have had a single dose of a Covid jab and 27.8% have received a third booster dose. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Europe is once again at the epicentre of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, said more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week. The organisation said the highly infectious Delta variant has increased the risk of transmission among vaccinated people. Dr Tedros warned against a ""false sense of security"" created by the vaccines, stressing that those who are vaccinated can still get and spread the virus. Those who are vaccinated must therefore continue to take precautions, such as mask wearing, social distancing, avoiding crowds, and meeting others outside or in well-ventilated rooms, he said. Dr Tedros stressed, however, that the vaccines do reduce the risk of severe illness and death. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said a decision on further restrictions would be announced on Friday The Dutch government looks set to announce a raft of new coronavirus restrictions after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus. Officials announced on Wednesday that more than 23,700 Covid-19 infections had been recorded in 24 hours, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. It means that cases have jumped by more than 40% over the past week, despite more than 85% of Dutch people being fully vaccinated. Experts have warned that hospitals will reach full capacity in less than a week if new restrictions are not introduced. ""The
infection rate is higher than ever before"", Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said
in a letter to parliament on Wednesday. ""Hospital admissions
keep exceeding expectations and we have not seen the worst
yet."" He
said the government's panel of health experts would provide
fresh policy advice by Thursday and that a decision would
follow on Friday. Plans to restrict
access to many public places to people who have
been vaccinated or have recently recovered from COVID-19 promptedthree nights of riotinglast week and more than 170 people have been arrested. Boris Johnson was criticised earlier this month for not wearing a mask during a visit to a hospital Downing Street has insisted that the prime minister ""follows all Covid rules"" when asked about reports that he attended a performance of Macbeth without wearing a mask. The Guardian said another audience member saw Boris Johnson without his mask on at all times during Tuesday's play at the Almeida Theatre in north London. A different audience member saw him maskless in a public area of the venue, the paper said. Mask-wearing rules were dropped in England in the summer, but some transport networks, shops and venues - including the Almeida - still ask for them to be worn. Earlier this month, Mr Johnson was criticised for not wearing a mask during a hospital tour and while sitting next to 95-year-old environmental campaigner Sir David Attenborough at the COP26 climate summit. Protesters carry a banner reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" through Kyiv Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv to protest against Covid measures and the country's mandatory vaccination programme for some workers. Protesters carried placards reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" and ""say 'no' to lies"". Some were also demanding the release of anti-vaccine activist Ostap Stakhiv, who was arrested in the city of Lviv last week accused of undermining public health through alleged links with Russia. Mr Stakhiv has denied all the allegations against him. Ukraine, which has recently seen a rise in vaccination numbers after imposing restrictions in public places, is still struggling to persuade a large number of its citizens who remain hesitant to receive their shots. The country is experiencing a new surge in coronavirus cases as the highly transmissible Delta variant sweeps across Europe. Ukraine today reported 14,325 new daily Covid cases and 595 coronavirus-related deaths. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent The Greens backed the government on vaccine passports when case numbers were rising As we heard yesterday, the Scottish government has decided not to expand its vaccine passport scheme to more venues.

Many Scottish children struggling in education before Covid ""fell off the radar"" in the first few months of the pandemic, a children rights charity has told politicians. Dr Colin Morrison, a co-director at Children's parliament, says there could be a ""legacy of disengagement"" for some pupils who lacked electronic devices to access online learning materials - the consequences of  which might be ""difficult to address"". Speaking to MSPs at the Education, Children and Young People Committee at Holyrood, Dr Morrison says many children the charity works with ""were just gone to the education system"" in the three or four months from March last year. He adds: ""What I also know is many head teachers we knew who love and care for their children were literally scrambling about and delivering devices every day, knocking on doors and making sure people had food, never mind digital devices."" Last year the Scottish government pledged 50,000 devices would be given to children in need - later rising to 70,000 - while the SNP promised an age-appropriate device for every Scottish school student as part of their manifesto ahead of May's election. But Dr Morrison explains that some children are still without what they need, warning the loss of engagement for some of them could have ""long-term consequences"" for their learning. ""If there's a gap in attainment there's certainly a gap in how children are using that digital space to learn. ""For some children that's just taken off and they're blossoming with it, for other children there's a legacy of disengagement that's going to be difficult to address,"" he argues. London Underground workers are being put in potentially dangerous situations as mask-wearing is now being ""openly ignored"" on a large scale, unions are warning. The train drivers' union Aslef says there has been a noticeable dip in travellers wearing masks on the Tube - even though it's a requirement. And Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT), says: ""It's no wonder there's talk of new restrictions and controls if we can't even deliver the basics."" Transport for London - which runs the Tube network - said it has 500 enforcement officers to ask customers to comply with its mask rules. It says it has refused entry to 408 people and asked 126 to leave services since national rules were relaxed in July. Read more:What are the rules on mask wearing now? Prime Minister Naftali Bennett watches as his nine-year-old son is vaccinated Nearly 40% of Israel's Covid-19 patients are below the age of 12, the country's Health Ministry has said. Officials said that of 6,505 Israelis currently infected with the disease, 2,574 of those are children. The announcement comes as the government launched its vaccination campaign for children aged 5-11 this week. Around 1.2 million children will be inoculated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine over the coming months. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had his nine-year-old son vaccinated in front of media on Tuesday and urged other lawmakers to set a similar example. Israel recently emerged from a fourth Covid-19 wave which saw daily infections peak at more than 8,000 cases per day. But daily infections have been relatively low for the last few weeks and million of people have now received a third booster jab. But despite the country's progress, the government has extended ""Green Pass"" regulations meant to restrict access to certain venues to vaccinated or recovered individuals for another two weeks.

"Scotland's prisons have seen a surge in drug seizures during the pandemic, new figures show. There has been an 18-fold increase in stoppages of so-called street Valium in the space of a year, while seizures of psychoactive substances have nearly doubled. Illegal substances often get inside prisons throughdrug-soaked clothing or lettersbefore being smoked. The Scottish Prison Service said it has invested in new ways to detect drugs. One expert said more prisoners may have turned to drugs during the pandemic as family visits were stopped. Six ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis Scottish prisons 'awash' with synthetic drugs linked to violence FM to examine prison drug letter claims A spate of drug overdoses at HMP Shotts in North Lanarkshire in recent weeks have been linked to new psychoactive substances. These substances, such as synthetic cannabinoid ""Spice"", and ""street"" benzodiazepines, such as Etizolam, are now thought to be the dominant drugs in prisons. One serving officer at a large Scottish jail, speaking to BBC Scotland anonymously, said: ""The prisoners don't know the strength of this stuff from one batch to another, so it's proper Russian roulette territory. ""Detection is difficult when its sold in postage-stamp sized quantities and then cut up even smaller. ""It's hard to deal with at times, especially when prisoners are so unpredictable, but you have to remember it's no different to what you are seeing on schemes up and down the country."" Etizolam has been dubbed the ""blue plague"" as a result of the number of drugs-related deaths it is involved in Figures released to BBC Scotland under freedom of information laws show there were 229 recoveries of suspected psychoactive substances across the prison estate in June 2020. In June of this year there were 421 such seizures. For Etizolam, there were 11 recoveries by wardens in jails across Scotland in June 2020 but 198 in the same month this year. The quantities of drugs involved in each incident was not released. Etizolam is a benzodiazepine known as fake Valium and is many times stronger than prescription drugs. These substances are a major factor in Scotland's wider drugs deaths problem and this is also reflected in prison fatalities. Of the 20 drug-related deaths in Scotland's prisons since 2016, 12 involved psychoactive substances and six Etizolam. David Mackie, a retired sheriff and chairman of penal reform charity Howard League Scotland, warned the drug trade in jails was having an ""impact way beyond the walls of the prison"". He said: ""If somebody is in prison being supplied with drugs which are costing three to five times what they cost outside, how is that person paying for that drugs? Because he won't have the money in prison. ""It is almost certain that person's family may be put under pressure to either raise the money and pay for the drugs or do something for the organised crime groups."" Mr Mackie added that for ""those participating in the trade it seems to be quite a safe and lucrative occupation, there seems to be little risk of prosecution."" A spokesman for the SPS said it treats the issue of smuggling drugs into prisons ""very seriously"" and the service had ""invested in technology to better detect suspicious substances and work closely with partner agencies to garner relevant intelligence"". He added: ""The particular problem of psychoactive substances is impacting on the whole of our society, not just the prison system. These substances are sometimes difficult to detect and their use can be lethal. ""We have over the last few years pointed out on many occasions, to those in our care, the dangers of using such substances. If we suspect that an item many contain such materials, then we quarantine them and do not allow them to enter a prison."" Joey McGuiness says drugs are moved about prisons ""in the blink of an eye"" so it makes detection difficult Joey McGuiness is a recovering cocaine addict being supported by the Glasgow-based Sisco charity which delivers drug recovery services for people in and out of the prison system. The 34-year-old spent five weeks in the city's Barlinnie prison and said most of the people he met there had drug addiction issues. ""It's very easy to get drugs in prison,"" he says. ""I used to see people in the morning and they were alright but by lunchtime they were a completely different person. Joey admits he was tempted to take drugs in prison ""to escape"" but stopped himself as he was grappling with taking the first step to ending a cocaine problem which he says had taken over his life. A near fatal-overdose months after leaving prison in 2019 was the moment when Joey first admitted he was a cocaine addict and began his road to recovery. Now 10 months clean, Joey is enjoying life without drugs and repairing relationships with his family. ""My wee ma's proud of me today. First time I can say that,"" he says. ""When I used to go into my mum's house she used to have fear on her face but when I go in today it's a smile."" Leeh Howell, of Sisco, says Joey's experience of drugs in prison is common and thinks the problems have got worse since the start of the Covid pandemic. He said: ""It's not really stopped substances getting into the prison. ""I think with things like family visits being stopped, all the feelings and thoughts that they've been sitting with have been amplified and it's making it that much harder to not take substances.""

"French footballer Karim Benzema lost his place in the national team over the scandal France and Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been found guilty of conspiring to blackmail a fellow French footballer with a sex tape. A judge handed Benzema a one-year suspended jail term and ordered him to pay a â¬75,000 (Â£63,000; $84,000) fine. Benzema, 33, was one of five people put on trial last month over an attempt to extort Frenchman Mathieu Valbuena. The scandal has stunned the football community in France and both players lost their national team places. The case dates back to June 2015, when the two footballers were at a French training camp. At the camp, Benzema put pressure on Valbuena to pay off the blackmailers, whom he had conspired with to act as an intermediary, prosecutors said. Benzema has always denied the allegations and insisted he was only trying to help Valbuena get rid of the compromising video. Benzema has since returned to the France team and is expected to start for Real Madrid on Wednesday night when they play FC Sheriff Tiraspol in the Champions League. Benzema was not present in court in Versailles for the verdict, nor was Valbuena, who plays for Greek club Olympiakos. Four of Benzema's co-defendants in the trial were also found guilty on Wednesday. They were handed jail sentences ranging from 18 months suspended to two-and-a-half years in prison. Benzema's lawyers said they would appeal his conviction. ""The reaction is ultimately an angry one to this judgment which is perfectly contradictory,"" his lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, told reporters outside court. But when delivering the verdict, the judge said Benzema had ""implicated himself personally, through subterfuge and lies, to convince his teammate to submit to the blackmail"". Benzema's lawyers said the French footballer would appeal the conviction Benzema made a surprise comeback to the French national team in May, five years after he was exiled from the side when the allegations first surfaced in 2015. But last month, the French football federation said a guilty verdict would not necessarily jeopardise Benzema's position in the national side. Since being called back by France manager Didier Deschamps, Benzema has been in prolific form, scoring nine times in 13 games for his country. He's also scored 10 goals this season for his club, Real Madrid, who are yet to comment on the verdict. For his performances on the pitch, Benzema was named a candidate for the Ballon d'Or footballer of the year award which will be announced next week. Analysis by BBC Sport's European football expert Guillem Balague There are two ways of dealing with the private lives of footballers and we have seen that in the case of Benzema. The story hasn't been given much importance in the sports media in Spain, but it has been hugely prominent in France. In France, Benzema will be questioned professionally because of his behaviour off the pitch, much more so than in Spain. In France, private lives are more relevant, not just in sport but also in politics. Benzema - who is of Algerian descent - has suggested there was an element of racism in this case. He felt that, had he been a white player, he would have been treated differently. But none of it affects his status at Real Madrid, at all. In Spain, there is a view that your private life is your private life, and there has even been a strong campaign in the Madrid media for him to win the Ballon d'Or. It began in 2015 when Valbuena, now 37, asked a man in Marseille, Axel Angot, to upload the contents of his mobile phone to a new device. Mr Angot found sexually explicit material on the phone. He and another defendant in the trial, Mustapha Zouaoui, were accused of trying to blackmail Valbuena by threatening to make the tape public. Mr Zouaoui told reporters he had shared the tape, but there had never been an attempt to extort money. Valbuena described being approached by another defendant, Younes Houass, who told the court he had warned the player about the issue without asking for money. Mathieu Valbuena and Karim Benzema (right) were both playing for France until the case emerged When the footballer went to the police, they set up a sting operation involving an undercover agent. Prosecutors said another defendant was then brought into the scam - Karim Zenati, who is a childhood friend of Benzema. At this point, Benzema was asked to act as a ""middleman"" in the scheme, prosecutors said. In October 2015, Benzema approached his fellow France player in his room at the national team's training camp. Benzema said he had merely tried to help his teammate dispose of the x-rated video, warning him: ""Be careful, Math, they're big, big thugs."" He then offered to put him touch with someone he could trust - his childhood friend, Mr Zenati. Benzema returned to the French national team in May after being exiled for five years Police were by now tapping their phone calls and recorded Benzema telling his friend: ""He's not taking us seriously."" Mr Zenati is said to have replied: ""We're here to sort it out; if he doesn't want that he'll have to deal with the piranhas."" Giving evidence at the start of the trial, Valbuena said he had never considered handing over money to stop the video getting out. Unlike his former teammate, Valbuena has not played for France since the scandal began. Testifying during the trial, Valbuena told the court that football was his life. ""I knew if that video got out it would make things difficult with the French team,"" he said.

"The government says ""stopping the boats"" crossing the English Channel is a key political priority. As part of this, it is pushing ahead with its plan to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda, despite a Supreme Court judgment that the policy is unlawful. Since the Supreme Court ruling,the government has signed a new treaty with Rwanda to strengthen its asylum process, and proposed new UK laws declaring that Rwanda is a safe country. As well as the Rwanda plan, theIllegal Migration Actincludes a number of new provisions: the home secretary has a duty to detain and remove those arriving in the UK illegally either to Rwanda, or another ""safe"" third country migrants will not be granted bail or able to seek judicial review for the first 28 days of detention under-18s, those medically unfit to fly or at risk of serious harm in the country to which they are being removed, will be able to delay departure the number of refugees the UK settles through ""safe and legal routes"" is capped. The government also signed a new agreement with France, under which the UK will pay Â£500m over three years to fund more patrol officers and a new detention centre. Commercial documents published by the Home Office suggest thatthe government plans to spend at least Â£700m to manage small boat arrivals until 2030. How many people cross the Channel in small boats? Is migration to the UK slowing and other claims Why record numbers are suddenly being given asylum At the end of September 2023 there weremore than 56,000 asylum seekers living in hotels,externalacross the UK. The government hopes to save money by using other types of accommodation instead. There are currently about 300 asylum seekers housed on a barge called the Bibby Stockholm in Dorset, which has capacity for 500. In aletter to the Home Affairs Committee of MPs,external, the Home Office confirmed the contract to provide accommodation on the Bibby Stockholm is worth Â£22.5m. In August 2023, all of the 39 asylum seekers then on board were removed afterLegionella bacteria was found in the water system. On 12 December 2023,one of the migrants living on the barge died.The man is believed to have taken his own life. What is it like on the UK's first migrant barge? Why is Bibby Stockholm barge so controversial? No asylum seekers have yet been housed at RAF Scampton The government has alsosaid that three ex-military sites in Essex, Lincolnshire and East Sussexwill house several thousand migrants: Wethersfield in Essex is due to hold up to 1,700 people Scampton in Lincolnshire is due to hold up to 2,000 Bexhill in East Sussex is due to hold up to 1,200 Catterick Garrison in Yorkshire is also due to hold an unspecified number of people. The BBC understands about 600 asylum seekers are being housed at Wethersfield. In July 2023, some residentstested positive for tuberculosis(TB). The first asylum seekers were expected to arrive at Scampton in mid-August, but this was delayed until further notice. The Home Office says it is still ""exploring proposals"" to use the Bexhill site. In December 2023,the High Court ruled that asylum seekers could be housed at Wethersfield and Scampton, following legal action by the relevant local councils. They have applied for permission to take the case to the Court of Appeal. The Home Office commercial documents also show the government is looking for a partner to run two migrant reception centres in Kent until at least 2030 - and potentially to 2034. The Home Office insists there are a number of""safe and legal"",externalroutes to the UK. However, some are restricted to people from specific countries such as Afghanistan andUkraine,external, while other routes only accept limited numbers.Figures shown,externalare for the year to September 2023: Refugee Family Reunion- for partners and children under 18 of those already granted protection in the UK (6,114 grants) UK Resettlement Scheme- prioritises those from regions in conflict (525 grants) Community Sponsorship Scheme- for local community groups to provide accommodation and support for refugees (162 grants) Mandate Resettlement Scheme- to resettle refugees who have a close family member in the UK who can offer a home (13 grants) In April 2023, Immigration Minister Robert Jenrick was asked in Parliament which safe and legal routes were available to a young person wanting to flee the conflict in Sudan. He said individuals should contact the UN Refugee Agency, the UNHCR. But it insisted""there is no mechanism through which refugees can approach UNHCR with the intention of seeking asylum in the UK"". Critics of the government's asylum proposals, such as the Refugee Council, say they risk breaking international law. The main principle of the1951 Refugee Convention,externalstates that refugees should not be returned to countries where they faced threats to life or freedom. Home Secretary James Cleverly said the new treaty with Rwanda addresses the UK Supreme Court's concerns The government insists its plan to send migrants to Rwanda for their asylum cases to be processedcomplies with international law. But the Supreme Court ruled in November 2023that sending asylum seekers to Rwanda was unlawfulbecause of the risk they could be moved on to countries where they could face harm, known as ""refoulement"". In response, the governmentsigned a new treaty with Rwandawhich it says will prevent refoulement. It has also publishednew legislation declaring Rwanda a safe country. No easy way forward for PM after win as Rwanda bill splits party Clarification 2 December: This article has been amended to make clear that the government's ""safe and legal"" routes are only available to certain groups of people who have already been recognised as refugees, or family members of refugees already in the UK.

"This video can not be played Speaking from Downing Street, PM Boris Johnson 'shocked and saddened' at migrant deaths At least 27 people headed for the UK have drowned in the English Channel near Calais after their boat sank. The International Organization for Migration said it was the biggest single loss of life in the Channel since it began collecting data in 2014. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""appalled"" by what happened, adding the UK would leave ""no stone unturned"" to stop human trafficking gangs. Five women and a girl were among the dead, France's interior minister said. Gerald Darmanin also said two people were rescued and one was missing. It was earlier reported 31 people had died, but the total was revised down overnight on Thursday. Four people had been arrested near to the Belgian border, he added, saying: ""We suspect that they were directly linked to this particular crossing."" On Wednesday evening, Mr Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to step up joint efforts to prevent the crossings and stop the gangs putting people's lives at risk, Downing Street said. LIVE UPDATES: Dozens drown after migrant boat sinks Channel migrant deaths: What do we know so far? What happens to migrants who reach the UK? A fishing boat sounded the alarm on Wednesday afternoon after spotting several people at sea off the coast of France. French and British authorities are conducting a rescue operation by air and sea to see if they can find anyone. A French volunteer sea rescue organisation boat carrying bodies of migrants arrived at Calais harbour Mr Johnson said the deaths were a ""disaster"", adding that it was vital to ""break"" the people trafficking gangs which, he said, were ""literally getting away with murder"". Speaking after chairing an emergency Cobra meeting, the prime minister said more needed to be done to stop criminals organising crossings. ""It also shows how vital it is that we now step up our efforts to break the business model of the gangsters who are sending people to sea in this way,"" he said. He also admitted efforts so far to stem the flow of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats ""haven't been enough"" and that the UK would offer to increase its support to France. Downing Street later said Mr Johnson and Mr Macron agreed on the importance of close working with neighbours in Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as other European countries, to tackle the problem before people reach the French coast. Â The UK has pledged to give France â¬62.7m (Â£54m) during 2021-22 to help increase police patrols along its coastline, boost aerial surveillance and increase security infrastructure at ports. Home Secretary Priti Pateltweeted,externalthat the deaths were ""starkest possible reminder"" of the dangers migrants face attempting to cross the Channel. This video can not be played BBC Newsnight: Lewis Goodall reports from Dunkirk's new migrant camp. By BBC Newsnight policy editor Lewis Goodall The grim truth is today was predicted and predictable. We had been told that many would attempt to cross the Channel overnight due to rapidly worsening weather. But it became clear that the numbers involved and the quality of boats in one of the world's busiest shipping lanes made tragedy inevitable. Politicians on both sides of the Channel have already blamed the smugglers, who are indifferent to loss of life. But there will be questions for both governments. For France on the conditions in the camps, with children living in the woods and streets. And for Britain the lack of legal routes for asylum to the UK, which critics says is one of the main reasons people accept the risk of taking to the seas. I've been told today people were still trying to cross the Channel earlier this afternoon. The terrible weather âexpected in the coming days means people know this is their last chance to make it to the UK for a while. French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said five women and a girl were among those who died Mr Macron said: ""France will not let the Channel become a cemetery."" He promised to ""find and condemn those responsible"" for the tragedy. Mr Macron also called for an ""emergency meeting of European ministers concerned by the migration challenge"". He said since the start of this year 1,552 smugglers had been arrested in Northern France and 44 smuggler networks dismantled. Despite this, 47,000 attempted Channel crossings to the UK had taken place this year and 7,800 migrants have been rescued, Mr Macron added. Emergency services took part in the rescue operation at Calais harbour A group of migrants run on the beach with an inflatable dinghy near Wimereux in northern France on Wednesday morning A number of people are believed to have reached the UK in small boats on Wednesday, with people seen being brought ashore in Dover by immigration officials. BBC Newsnight's policy editor,Lewis Goodall,external, said he understood about 25 boats had attempted the crossing so far during the day. It comes amid record numbers of migrants making the crossing from France to the UK. More than 25,700 people have made the dangerous journey to the UK in small boats this year -more than three times the 2020 total. The Dover Strait is the busiest shipping lane in the world and has claimed many lives of people trying to cross to Britain in inflatable dinghies. It is thought at least 10 other people had died in the past few weeks while attempting to make the crossing. Were you in the area? Do you have any information to share?

"Britain could face shortage of wine and spirits at Christmas, a drinks trade body has warned. In a letter to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, the Wine and Spirit Trade Association (WSTA) said rising costs and supply chain chaos have held up deliveries. Imports were now taking up to five times longer than a year ago, it said. The government said: ""We do not expect disruption to the supply of alcohol this Christmas"". The letter was co-signed by 49 firms, including Pernod Ricard, MoÃ«t Hennessy and the Wine Society. It said the sector has been badly affected by the HGV driver shortage crisis, which the industry has blamed on factors including Covid and Brexit. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Lorry driver shortage: Government to lift rules on foreign haulier deliveries The letter said drinks businesses were still struggling, and further action was needed, particularly in the run up to Christmas - ""a critical trading period for our sector"". ""Unless urgent action is taken, we will fall deeper into delivery chaos,"" it added. ""Businesses like ours previously able to fulfil orders in two to three days now have to operate on a day one for day fifteen basis,"" the letter said. In addition, businesses are reporting increased costs of around 7% - and often more - by freight forwarders to account for driver retention. ""This is particularly a concern for SMEs [small and medium sized enterprises] who are unable to compete with large businesses to attract drivers."" It said drivers and vehicles were ""increasingly unpredictable"" in their arrival times, which meant goods being either not ready or left waiting for collection. It warned that being unable to fulfil orders on time would mean lost business and could ultimately lead to increased costs for consumers. ""Government needs to be doing all it can to ensure British business is not operating with one hand tied behind its back over the festive season and beyond,"" said Miles Beale, WSTA chief executive. The WSTA called for the temporary visa scheme for HGV drivers to be extended for a year. It also wants the government to act to help smooth congested freight routes from ports, and to provide more regular updates on how many HGV driver licences are being processed by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK has a strong food supply chain and we do not expect disruption to the supply of alcohol this Christmas. ""The government acted quickly to tackle the challenges to our supply chains, which were brought on by global pressures including the pandemic and the international shortage of HGV drivers."" It has invested Â£32.5m in roadside facilities for hauliers, put Â£17m into creating new HGV skills bootcamps, and launched a review of training, the spokesperson said. ""These measures are working, cutting the backlog through a huge increase in vocational licences issued and HGV tests conducted compared to before the pandemic, and there is now spare capacity in the testing system."" The warning from the drinks industry comes as food distributors warned MPs that consumers could face less food choice this Christmas because of supply chain issues. Shane Brennan, head of the Cold Chain Federation, said suppliers were scaling back plans to ensure they can deliver. The Cold Chain Federation represents firms involved in the storage and distribution of chilled and frozen products, including food. ""It's about reducing the amount of goods you're expected to put on the shelves,"" Mr Brennan said. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Former Tesco boss to advise on supply chain crisis Industry fears food shortages could be permanent He made the comments on Wednesday morning to the Transport Select Committee inquiry into the road freight supply chain. ""We are very good at piling high and selling it cheap at Christmas time,"" he said. ""What we're having to do is strategically scale that back, in order to basically meet the promise that there will be the stuff you expect to see on the shelves, but not necessarily all the extras."" Mr Brennan said the unpredictability of the past two years had made it the toughest period in members' memories, adding that there was a lot of tiredness in the industry and problems with retention. The supply chain is facing a number of pressures, such as drivers leaving the industry and difficulties recruiting new ones, border issues and delays with the movement of shipping containers. Global shipping supplies are in ""an unprecedented period of stress"", Mr Brennan told the committee. He said it was taking two or three days for fresh food arriving at UK ports to be delivered to stores, whereas this would normally happen on a same day or next day basis. For frozen food, the timescale has increased from between one and three days to up to five and six days. ""We're seeing significant changes and having to re-plan on that basis,"" Mr Brennan said. In September, Food and Drink Federation (FDF) boss Ian Wright warned that the UK was in for permanent food shortages. He said: ""The UK shopper and consumer could have previously expected just about any product they want to be on the [supermarket] shelf or in the restaurant all the time. ""That's over. And I don't think it's coming back."" According to the FDF, the food and drink industry is short of about half a million workers - or one in eight of the total workforce - which is leading to supply chain issues. Several companies including supermarkets, pubs and restaurants have blamed a lack of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) lorry drivers for causing problems in their supply chains, including shortages of some products. Lorry driver shortages have also been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. Elizabeth de Jong, the director of policy at freight and haulage trade association Logistics UK, highlighted a lack of available lorry parking facilities as a key reason putting people off driving jobs. She told the Transport Select Committee there had been evidence for years that there were far too few parking spaces, with people having to stay in their cabs at side of the road or on industrial estates, with no hygiene facilities. Duncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association, told the committee that many people loved lorry driving, but it was often it was the conditions that made them leave. However, Mr Buchanan added that the extent of the lorry driver shortage has started to ease. ""We are seeing improved throughput in tests. We had tests suspended. Since April there's been a real uptick in the throughput of people undertaking and passing tests. ""We reckon the shortage has probably fallen by about 15,000. Much of that is to do with improved test performance and improved retention. And these things when you talk about the driver shortage, everything is estimates based on intelligence we get, hard numbers are very difficult. ""But our estimate is we've come back 15,000.  And that's substantial, over 6 months."" Online giant warns of Christmas product shortages Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

Lorry driver shortage: Government to lift rules on foreign haulier deliveries The letter said drinks businesses were still struggling, and further action was needed, particularly in the run up to Christmas - ""a critical trading period for our sector"". ""Unless urgent action is taken, we will fall deeper into delivery chaos,"" it added. ""Businesses like ours previously able to fulfil orders in two to three days now have to operate on a day one for day fifteen basis,"" the letter said. In addition, businesses are reporting increased costs of around 7% - and often more - by freight forwarders to account for driver retention. ""This is particularly a concern for SMEs [small and medium sized enterprises] who are unable to compete with large businesses to attract drivers."" It said drivers and vehicles were ""increasingly unpredictable"" in their arrival times, which meant goods being either not ready or left waiting for collection. It warned that being unable to fulfil orders on time would mean lost business and could ultimately lead to increased costs for consumers. ""Government needs to be doing all it can to ensure British business is not operating with one hand tied behind its back over the festive season and beyond,"" said Miles Beale, WSTA chief executive. The WSTA called for the temporary visa scheme for HGV drivers to be extended for a year. It also wants the government to act to help smooth congested freight routes from ports, and to provide more regular updates on how many HGV driver licences are being processed by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK has a strong food supply chain and we do not expect disruption to the supply of alcohol this Christmas. ""The government acted quickly to tackle the challenges to our supply chains, which were brought on by global pressures including the pandemic and the international shortage of HGV drivers."" It has invested Â£32.5m in roadside facilities for hauliers, put Â£17m into creating new HGV skills bootcamps, and launched a review of training, the spokesperson said. ""These measures are working, cutting the backlog through a huge increase in vocational licences issued and HGV tests conducted compared to before the pandemic, and there is now spare capacity in the testing system."" The warning from the drinks industry comes as food distributors warned MPs that consumers could face less food choice this Christmas because of supply chain issues. Shane Brennan, head of the Cold Chain Federation, said suppliers were scaling back plans to ensure they can deliver. The Cold Chain Federation represents firms involved in the storage and distribution of chilled and frozen products, including food. ""It's about reducing the amount of goods you're expected to put on the shelves,"" Mr Brennan said. Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Former Tesco boss to advise on supply chain crisis Industry fears food shortages could be permanent He made the comments on Wednesday morning to the Transport Select Committee inquiry into the road freight supply chain. ""We are very good at piling high and selling it cheap at Christmas time,"" he said. ""What we're having to do is strategically scale that back, in order to basically meet the promise that there will be the stuff you expect to see on the shelves, but not necessarily all the extras."" Mr Brennan said the unpredictability of the past two years had made it the toughest period in members' memories, adding that there was a lot of tiredness in the industry and problems with retention. The supply chain is facing a number of pressures, such as drivers leaving the industry and difficulties recruiting new ones, border issues and delays with the movement of shipping containers. Global shipping supplies are in ""an unprecedented period of stress"", Mr Brennan told the committee. He said it was taking two or three days for fresh food arriving at UK ports to be delivered to stores, whereas this would normally happen on a same day or next day basis. For frozen food, the timescale has increased from between one and three days to up to five and six days. ""We're seeing significant changes and having to re-plan on that basis,"" Mr Brennan said. In September, Food and Drink Federation (FDF) boss Ian Wright warned that the UK was in for permanent food shortages. He said: ""The UK shopper and consumer could have previously expected just about any product they want to be on the [supermarket] shelf or in the restaurant all the time. ""That's over. And I don't think it's coming back."" According to the FDF, the food and drink industry is short of about half a million workers - or one in eight of the total workforce - which is leading to supply chain issues. Several companies including supermarkets, pubs and restaurants have blamed a lack of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) lorry drivers for causing problems in their supply chains, including shortages of some products. Lorry driver shortages have also been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. Elizabeth de Jong, the director of policy at freight and haulage trade association Logistics UK, highlighted a lack of available lorry parking facilities as a key reason putting people off driving jobs. She told the Transport Select Committee there had been evidence for years that there were far too few parking spaces, with people having to stay in their cabs at side of the road or on industrial estates, with no hygiene facilities. Duncan Buchanan, policy director at the Road Haulage Association, told the committee that many people loved lorry driving, but it was often it was the conditions that made them leave. However, Mr Buchanan added that the extent of the lorry driver shortage has started to ease. ""We are seeing improved throughput in tests. We had tests suspended. Since April there's been a real uptick in the throughput of people undertaking and passing tests. ""We reckon the shortage has probably fallen by about 15,000. Much of that is to do with improved test performance and improved retention. And these things when you talk about the driver shortage, everything is estimates based on intelligence we get, hard numbers are very difficult. ""But our estimate is we've come back 15,000.  And that's substantial, over 6 months."" Online giant warns of Christmas product shortages Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

"Jennifer and Stephen Chapple were killed at their home while their two young children slept upstairs A couple who were killed in their home as their children were asleep upstairs may have been involved in rows over parking, residents said. Jennifer and Stephen Chappledied at their homein Norton Fitzwarren, Somerset, at 21:45 BST on Sunday. Residents described the couple as ""very friendly"" and said although it was a quiet neighbourhood, there had been disagreements over parking. Two men, aged 34 and 67, were arrested on suspicion of murder. The older man has been released under investigation and police have been granted more time to question the younger man. The couple's two sons, aged five and six, were unhurt and are now being looked after by family members, Avon and Somerset Police said. Floral tributes have been left at the scene A post-mortem examination confirmed Mrs Chapple, 33, died of multiple stab wounds. Investigations into the cause of death of her 36-year-old husband are ongoing. Mr Chapple taught computing at the nearby West Somerset College. Head teacher Gregg Mockridge said he will be ""sadly missed"". ""Steve was a fantastic colleague at West Somerset College, a brilliant teacher that cared deeply about the students in his care,"" he said. Tributes were left among flowers laid near the couple's home on Dragon Rise in Norton Fitzwarren Mrs Chapple worked in the coffee shop at a garden centre in the village, where staff said they were ""devastated"" at the loss of their ""much-loved friend"". Taunton MP Rebecca Pow said it was ""absolutely tragic and shocking"" to hear the news. She said: ""It's a very close knit community so it is really devastating news. I'm sure it would have shaken them to their foundations."" Due to prior contact with the couple, Avon and Somerset Police has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC).

"Covid infection rates have started rising sharply in parts of Western Europe, prompting the introduction of fresh restrictions and lockdowns. It has triggered fears the UK could follow suit. But there are plenty of reasons to believe Britain will escape the worst of what is being seen on the continent. In fact, the UK may well be in the strongest position of all to weather Covid this winter. To understand why that could be the case, you need to look at the reasons why cases have started to take off in Western Europe. Unlike the UK - and England in particular - many parts of Europe kept major restrictions in place for much longer. Whereas England fully unlocked in mid-July, parts of Europe did not do this until the autumn, and in many places kept tougher restrictions in place even as they did. Part of this was to do with timing. The UK was hit by the more infectious Alpha variant and then Delta sooner, meaning it was in a position to push ahead with unlocking before others. But it was also a conscious choice backed by the government's top scientists, Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance. The logic - along with the benefit of ending restrictions that themselves cause harm to health -  was that it was better to have the rebound in infection, the so-called exit wave, in the summer. It was felt the increase in the spread of the virus would be mitigated by the better weather, meaning more time spent outdoors, and would avoid the winter crunch when pressure on the health system increases across the board. The UK has, in effect, already had the wave the rest of Europe is seeing and has managed to avoid being swamped by it. That is mainly because of the amount of immunity built up. A combination of good vaccine rollout, particularly among the older more vulnerable groups who are the ones most at risk of serious illness, and natural immunity from infection means there is likely to be a much smaller pool of vulnerable people for the virus to infect. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine have been trying to quantify this by looking at what would happen if everyone was suddenly exposed to the virus in one go. Theymodelled this for England,external- although there is nothing to suggest Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would be any different - and 18 other European nations. If this hypothetical situation happened, England would have by far the fewest people ending up in hospital - 62 per 100,000 people - because of immunity built up by vaccination and infection. That compares with more than 300 in Germany, largely because of their lower levels of infection to date, and more than 800 in Romania, which has struggled to convince its public to come forward for vaccination. This was the picture at the end of October. If the same analysis was done at the end of November it is likely the situation would be even more favourable for England, says lead researcher Dr Lloyd Chapman. That's because the UK is ploughing ahead faster than other nations with boosters. Again part of this is related to timing. As the UK was quicker off the mark with Covid vaccinations initially, there are greater numbers of people becoming eligible for a booster. ""We are giving those boosters to the very people who are most at risk at perhaps the best time - they will have the best protection in winter."" But Dr Chapman also points out this has come at a price - the high rates of infection have resulted in a greater amount of serious illness and death in recent months than many of our Western European neighbours. And he adds the research should not be seen as a guarantee we will escape the winter without seeing a surge in cases. ""We may be in the strongest position - but we could still see cases double and that would cause problems."" But is that likely? What is perhaps most remarkable about the UK is just how stable infection levels have been. Ever since the sharp rise seen in early summer peaked in mid-July, infection rates have bobbled along, small rises being followed by similar drops. There is no other part of Europe that has seen Covid infections held so stable with very few restrictions in place. Instead, when other nations have seen cases surge restrictions have tended to be reimposed. This is happening now in parts of Western Europe and follows on from what happened in Eastern Europe early in the autumn. Romania, for example, saw a sharp rise in cases in September and October and reacted by introducing a night curfew, sending children home from school and introducing health passes for access to public venues. It is telling that those nations that have had the most problems as winter arrives are the ones identified by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having the greatest pool of vulnerable people. How far this pattern spreads across Europe remains to be seen. But immunity alone does not explain why the UK, and in particular England, has seen such stable rates, says Prof Graham Medley, who chairs the government's infectious disease modelling group. Prof Medley, speaking in a personal capacity, believes it is more complex than that. ""I think we are seeing the public playing an important role."" He says a combination of limiting mixing and frequent use of rapid tests, which are more easy to access here than in many other countries, seems to be doing just enough to keep the virus in check. ""The government has passed the risk management to the public - and we've been able to do that better than other countries."" The big question is whether that will last throughout winter -ScotlandandNorthern Irelandare already talking about the possibility of tightening of restrictions. Prof Medley says it is ""delicately"" balanced, but with every passing week the chances are getting better.

"World Health Organization says more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week It warns against a ""false sense of security"" created by vaccines and stresses the need to be cautious Some 1.5 million Covid deaths have already been recorded in the WHO's Europe region of 53 countries The EU's public health agency says European countries should consider vaccine boosters for all adults Poland is warning that restrictions could be reintroduced if its infection rates don't start to fall The danger of a future UK pandemic is as serious as threats to the UK's defences, an ex-vaccines tsar says Netherlands considering new curbs after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus Edited by Paul Gribben Thank you for joining us today. As our live coverage comes to an end, here are some of Thursday's key developments in the pandemic: Today's live page was edited by Paul Gribben, and written by Dulcie Lee, Mal Siret, Adam Durbin and Matt Murphy. NFL star Aaron Rodgers has told US media he has developed a painful case of ""Covid toe"" after a brush with the virus earlier this month. The condition causes discoloration or lesions around the toes and researchers believe that it is caused by excess interferon, a protein which the body uses to fight infection. Rodgers told reporters after Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings that the condition is ""very, very painful"". The Green Bay Packers quarterback prompted controversy over his vaccination status when he tested positive for Covid-19 and entered a 10-day quarantine period - the minimum amount of time an unvaccinated player is asked to quarantine under NFL rules. However, in August he had seemed to indicate that he had received the jab, telling reporters that he was ""immunised"". He later said that he had been referring to his antibody levels and that he was treating his infection using the drug ivermectin, on the advice of podcast host Joe Rogan. Vladimir Putin has said he ""cannot understand"" the levels of vaccine hesitancy among Russians Russian officials say they have started to target people spreading anti-vaccine information online as the country aims to energise its sluggish vaccine rollout. The state healthcare regulator, Roszdravnadzor, said it had instructed its regional branches to report people - including
medical professionals - who ""deliberately spread false
information about the dangers of vaccination"". The agency told Reuters that it had already reported more
than 30 anti-vaccine campaigners, who could face fines of around Â£19,000 and up to five years in prison under ""fake news"" laws passed last year. Russia has struggled with widespread vaccine hesitancy and just 37% of people are fully vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly pleaded with people to take the jab. Last month he told state TV that he ""couldn't understand"" why people were refusing to come forward for the shot. âWe have a reliable and efficient vaccine,"" he said. ""The vaccine really reduces the risks of illness, grave complications and death.""  France is set to announce fresh measures on Thursday to curb the spread of Covid-19, as infection rates surge domestically and across Europe. However, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says there are no plans to introduce a new lockdown as some EU countries have done, the Reuters news agency reports. Speaking at a news conference, Attal says the government is looking to avoid major restrictions on public life. He explains it is instead looking to use other means of suppressing transmission like stricter social distancing, increasing the number and pace of booster jabs and tightening vaccine passport rules. Government spokesman Gabriel Attal says more detail will be announced tomorrow following a meeting of France's cabinet ""We must protect the French people by building on what we have, to save the end-of-year festivities and get through the winter as well as possible,"" the minister says. France's vaccine passport - known as the health pass - allows entry to cafes, restaurants, museums, cinemas and other public places for those who are fully vaccinated or have recently tested negative. The seven-day average of cases exceeded 20,000 for the first time since August on Tuesday, while coronavirus patients in intensive care rose to 1,455. Attal declined to specify what measures may be announced on Thursday, but the government is expected to follow the advice of France's health regulator to allow anyone over-40 to access a third dose of a Covid vaccine. Slovakia will limit
movement as part of a two-week lockdown in an attempt to stem a fast rise in
Covid-19 cases, the government has announced. Slovakians will only be permitted to travel for essential shopping,
work, school or medical visits, government ministers said on Wednesday. They will assess the situation after 10 days, although any easing of restrictions will be limited to those fully vaccinated against the virus. The decision to return to a lockdown comes after the government imposed new restrictions on unvaccinated people earlier this week in an attempt to push up vaccinations. Slovakia has the third-lowest vaccination rate in the EU. Less than 50% of people in the country of 5.5 million have been vaccinated and the vast majority of people in hospital are unvaccinated.  Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent This video can not be played Police fire warning shots at Covid protesters in the Netherlands The first suspects charged in connection with theriots in Rotterdamearlier this week over the partial lockdown called in the Netherlands have been appearing in court. A 26-year-old woman from Spijkenisse (a city that is part of the greater Rotterdam area) was found guilty of throwing stones at police vehicles. She was jailed for five months - two of them conditional - and ordered to pay 1,000 euros (Â£840) for damage to the cars. The second person to appear in court was a 29-year-old man from Delft, who was given a five-month sentence and a one-year restraining order for a large part of Rotterdam. The sentencing comes on the day the Netherlands reports 23,789 new Covid cases - the biggest one-day increase on record.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin said vaccinations should be voluntary ""on the whole"" Russia is registering a version of the country's Sputnik-V vaccine for children aged between 12 and 17, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. Ms Golikova has told a government meeting on Covid-19 that registration of the new treatment, named Gam-Covid-Vac, would take place later in the day, state news agency Tass reports. She said it was hoped the vaccine would enter civilian circulation in Russia from the end of December. The new vaccine will only be given to children under 15 with the consent of their parents or the child's legal representative, and to children over 15 only with their own consent, Ms Golikova said. Speaking at the same meeting, President Vladimir Putin urged the government to pay attention to the need for vaccines for children, but voiced scepticism about compulsory vaccination. ""On the whole, inoculations should be voluntary - specially for children,"" Tass quoted him as saying. There have been 43,676 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours,according to the latest data,external. This means there have been 303,071 people who have tested positive for the virus in the last seven days, - up by 11.1% on the week before. There have also been 149 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, taking the weekly total to 926 - a 9.4% fall on the previous seven-day period. Around 80.4% of people over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated, while 88.4% have had a single dose of a Covid jab and 27.8% have received a third booster dose. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Europe is once again at the epicentre of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, said more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week. The organisation said the highly infectious Delta variant has increased the risk of transmission among vaccinated people. Dr Tedros warned against a ""false sense of security"" created by the vaccines, stressing that those who are vaccinated can still get and spread the virus. Those who are vaccinated must therefore continue to take precautions, such as mask wearing, social distancing, avoiding crowds, and meeting others outside or in well-ventilated rooms, he said. Dr Tedros stressed, however, that the vaccines do reduce the risk of severe illness and death. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said a decision on further restrictions would be announced on Friday The Dutch government looks set to announce a raft of new coronavirus restrictions after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus. Officials announced on Wednesday that more than 23,700 Covid-19 infections had been recorded in 24 hours, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. It means that cases have jumped by more than 40% over the past week, despite more than 85% of Dutch people being fully vaccinated. Experts have warned that hospitals will reach full capacity in less than a week if new restrictions are not introduced. ""The
infection rate is higher than ever before"", Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said
in a letter to parliament on Wednesday. ""Hospital admissions
keep exceeding expectations and we have not seen the worst
yet."" He
said the government's panel of health experts would provide
fresh policy advice by Thursday and that a decision would
follow on Friday. Plans to restrict
access to many public places to people who have
been vaccinated or have recently recovered from COVID-19 promptedthree nights of riotinglast week and more than 170 people have been arrested. Boris Johnson was criticised earlier this month for not wearing a mask during a visit to a hospital Downing Street has insisted that the prime minister ""follows all Covid rules"" when asked about reports that he attended a performance of Macbeth without wearing a mask. The Guardian said another audience member saw Boris Johnson without his mask on at all times during Tuesday's play at the Almeida Theatre in north London. A different audience member saw him maskless in a public area of the venue, the paper said. Mask-wearing rules were dropped in England in the summer, but some transport networks, shops and venues - including the Almeida - still ask for them to be worn. Earlier this month, Mr Johnson was criticised for not wearing a mask during a hospital tour and while sitting next to 95-year-old environmental campaigner Sir David Attenborough at the COP26 climate summit. Protesters carry a banner reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" through Kyiv Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv to protest against Covid measures and the country's mandatory vaccination programme for some workers. Protesters carried placards reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" and ""say 'no' to lies"". Some were also demanding the release of anti-vaccine activist Ostap Stakhiv, who was arrested in the city of Lviv last week accused of undermining public health through alleged links with Russia. Mr Stakhiv has denied all the allegations against him. Ukraine, which has recently seen a rise in vaccination numbers after imposing restrictions in public places, is still struggling to persuade a large number of its citizens who remain hesitant to receive their shots. The country is experiencing a new surge in coronavirus cases as the highly transmissible Delta variant sweeps across Europe. Ukraine today reported 14,325 new daily Covid cases and 595 coronavirus-related deaths.

Also, according to the national news agency CNA, the share of fully vaccinated people in the country is close to reaching 50%. More
than 11.6 million people have received two vaccine doses in Taiwan - 49.8% of
the population. More than 77% have received at least one vaccine dose. The Central Epidemic Command Centre is conditionally relaxing Covid restrictions ""for attending funerals or visiting relatives for people in home isolation/quarantine,external"". On Thursday, it will begin to offer recipients of

Many Scottish children struggling in education before Covid ""fell off the radar"" in the first few months of the pandemic, a children rights charity has told politicians. Dr Colin Morrison, a co-director at Children's parliament, says there could be a ""legacy of disengagement"" for some pupils who lacked electronic devices to access online learning materials - the consequences of  which might be ""difficult to address"". Speaking to MSPs at the Education, Children and Young People Committee at Holyrood, Dr Morrison says many children the charity works with ""were just gone to the education system"" in the three or four months from March last year. He adds: ""What I also know is many head teachers we knew who love and care for their children were literally scrambling about and delivering devices every day, knocking on doors and making sure people had food, never mind digital devices."" Last year the Scottish government pledged 50,000 devices would be given to children in need - later rising to 70,000 - while the SNP promised an age-appropriate device for every Scottish school student as part of their manifesto ahead of May's election. But Dr Morrison explains that some children are still without what they need, warning the loss of engagement for some of them could have ""long-term consequences"" for their learning. ""If there's a gap in attainment there's certainly a gap in how children are using that digital space to learn. ""For some children that's just taken off and they're blossoming with it, for other children there's a legacy of disengagement that's going to be difficult to address,"" he argues. London Underground workers are being put in potentially dangerous situations as mask-wearing is now being ""openly ignored"" on a large scale, unions are warning. The train drivers' union Aslef says there has been a noticeable dip in travellers wearing masks on the Tube - even though it's a requirement. And Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT), says: ""It's no wonder there's talk of new restrictions and controls if we can't even deliver the basics."" Transport for London - which runs the Tube network - said it has 500 enforcement officers to ask customers to comply with its mask rules. It says it has refused entry to 408 people and asked 126 to leave services since national rules were relaxed in July. Read more:What are the rules on mask wearing now? Prime Minister Naftali Bennett watches as his nine-year-old son is vaccinated Nearly 40% of Israel's Covid-19 patients are below the age of 12, the country's Health Ministry has said. Officials said that of 6,505 Israelis currently infected with the disease, 2,574 of those are children. The announcement comes as the government launched its vaccination campaign for children aged 5-11 this week. Around 1.2 million children will be inoculated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine over the coming months. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had his nine-year-old son vaccinated in front of media on Tuesday and urged other lawmakers to set a similar example. Israel recently emerged from a fourth Covid-19 wave which saw daily infections peak at more than 8,000 cases per day. But daily infections have been relatively low for the last few weeks and million of people have now received a third booster jab. But despite the country's progress, the government has extended ""Green Pass"" regulations meant to restrict access to certain venues to vaccinated or recovered individuals for another two weeks.

"There are more bird break-ups in years with warmer water, a study of 15,500 breeding pairs has found When relationships end it might be because the spark has disappeared, or maybe you just can't make time for one another. But can climate change cause break-ups? It might do, according to a new study which suggests albatrosses - some of the world's most loyal creatures - are ""divorcing"" more. Research published in theRoyal Society journal,externallooked at 15,500 breeding pairs in the Falkland Islands over 15 years. Albatross divorce is basically just cheating, in human terms. It's when one part of a couple mates with a different individual. Wildlife forced to move or adapt by climate change Brexit: Will the Falkland Islands wildlife suffer? Like humans, albatrosses also have an awkward growing-up phase, trying (and sometimes failing) to figure out the best way to get into a relationship. But ultimately, when they find a good match, they normally stick together for life. Just 1% of albatrosses separate after choosing their life partner - much lower thanthe human divorce ratein the UK. ""Monogamy and long-term bonds is very common for them,"" says Francesco Ventura, researcher at the University of Lisbon and co-author of the study. But in the years covered by the study with warmer water temperatures, up to 8% of albatross couples split up. The study says ""environmentally-driven divorce may be an overlooked consequence"" of climate change. Normally, albatross divorce is triggered when a pair fail to breed, so they find new partners in the next breeding season. But the findings showed pairs were divorcing even if they'd had a successful breeding season. Warmer waters mean flying further for food Francesco says there are two possible theories for the rise - the first one being linked to the struggles of a long-distance relationship. Warming waters force the birds to hunt for longer and fly further. If birds then fail to return in time for a breeding season, their partners may move on with a new partner. Animals 'shapeshifting due to climate change' How people online help stop poachers in Africa Another theory is albatross stress hormones go up in harsher environments, such as when waters are warmer. With tougher breeding conditions, and food scarcity, it can cause more stress and a partner can be blamed for their ""poor performance"" - which can ultimately trigger divorce, Francesco says. Albatrosses are some of the world's most loyal creatures when it comes to finding a breeding partner The research comes as many international albatross populations are in trouble. Somedata from 2017 suggeststhe number of breeding pairs of the species are a little more than half of what they were in the 1980s. Francesco says in the Falkland Islands, it's not an immediate concern for the population - but in other areas where the population of albatross is limited, it is a worry. ""Temperatures are going up and will go up, so this might introduce more disruptions,"" he says. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

"This video can not be played PMQs: Sir Keir Starmer claims the PM has devised a ""working class dementia tax"" to pay for health and social care costs Boris Johnson batted away opposition calls for him to stand down and defended himself against accusations of ""broken promises"" at PMQs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM on social care funding, rail investment and tax. Picking up on reports of Tory disquiet after the PM's chaotic speech to business leaders, he asked: ""Is everything OK, prime minister?"" The PM said the government was ""delivering for...working people"". The Conservative benches were packed for the exchanges, in contrast to last week's session. ""I see they have turned up this week prime minister,"" said Sir Keir, prompting uproar on all sides and an intervention from Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who ordered MPs to calm down. Several MPs have told the BBC that they were urged by party managers, via text or phone call, to attend Prime Minister's Questions to support Mr Johnson. PM accused of 'shambolic' speech to business group Is everything OK for Boris Johnson? Rail upgrade plans 'missed opportunity' for North Johnson: Peppa Pig World 'very much my kind of place' Sir Keir repeatedly claimed the government's plans for social care funding broke a Conservative manifesto pledge that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""He's picked the pockets of working people to protect the estates of the wealthiest,"" said the Labour leader, adding: ""How could he have devised a working class dementia tax?"" Mr Johnson said homes will not be included in the cap on costs, adding that Labour did not have a plan to solve the problem. The prime minister said the government's ""huge investment"" in health and social care meant people will be able to insure themselves against the ""catastrophic cost"" of suffering from diseases such as dementia. Sir Keir also accused Mr Johnson of breaking a promise not to raise taxes - and to deliver a ""rail revolution"" in the North of England, despite now cancelling the northern leg of HS2. ""Who knows if he'll make it to the next election, but if he does, how can he expect anyone to take his promises seriously?,"" asked the Labour leader. Mr Johnson insisted there would be a rail revolution, and claimed the government was spending Â£96bn on upgrading links. And he said Sir Keir had campaigned against HS2 - which runs through his Holborn and St Pancras constituency - adding that he had backed the new high speed rail link even though it affected his own constituents, because it was in the national interest. ""How can they trust that man?"" he asked. Talk of ousting the PM seems fanciful. He has a track record of bouncing back from adversity. But it is worth noting that loud cheers from a leader's own side does not mean that underlying concerns have evaporated. The former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, was greeted by regular, co-ordinated standing ovations at his party conference, but that didn't prevent MPs quietly but definitively submitting letters of no confidence. The mood at the moment though seems to be for the current Conservative leader to get a grip rather than to get out. While Mr Johnson was on the back foot at PMQs, he nonetheless managed to step up attacks on the Labour leader too - the most effective of which was to suggest that HS2 would never have been built at all if Sir Keir Starmer had got his way. Boris Johnson's premiership has looked juddery recently, but hasn't yet been derailed. The SNP's Westminster Leader, Ian Blackford, also seized on reports of Tory disquiet with the PM's recent performance, accusing him of ""floundering in failure"" and asking him if he had ""considered calling it a day"". ""In the real world, people are suffering a Tory cost of living crisis, Brexit is hitting the economy hard, but the prime minister can't even give a coherent speech to business leaders,"" he added. He asked why Mr Johnson was ""clinging on when he quite clearly isn't up to the job"". The prime minister said the British public wanted to hear less about politics and more about what the government is doing ""for the people of Scotland"". Earlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab praised Mr Johnson's ""ebullient, bouncy, optimistic, Tiggerish character"", saying it ""livens up"" his speeches. He said there was a ""steeliness"" to the prime minister, adding: ""We work as a team"", and he dismissed the criticism as Westminster ""tittle tattle"". This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister is asked if he's OK after talking about Peppa Pig in a speech to business leaders Mr Johnson appeared before the CBI conference earlier this week to make his pitch for a ""green industrial revolution"" to business, including support for electric cars, investing in wind power and the government's integrated rail plan. But it drew more negative attention after his impression of a car and his personal anecdote from a trip to Peppa Pig World. ""I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,"" he told the conference. ""Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. ""It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig."" Asked after the speech, ""is everything OK?"", Mr Johnson said he thought people had ""got the vast majority of the points"" he wanted to make and that the speech ""went over well"". This video can not be played Justice Secretary Dominic Raab: 'The prime minister is a Tiggerish character' It comes after a few weeks of turbulence at Westminster. The PMbacked attempts to overhaul the standards system for MPs' conduct, blocking the suspension of Tory MP Owen Paterson -who had been found to have broken lobbying rules. No 10 performed a U-turn on the move following a furious backlash from MPs, including some Conservatives. But the fall-out led to accusations about sleaze, and wider questions about MPs' second jobs. The PM came under further pressure this week over the cost cap element of his social care plan, which charities warned could unfairly hit people with fewer assets. MPs backed the proposals, but it was only a narrow victory for Mr Johnson thanks to a significant Tory rebellion.

"Stella Creasy sat in the Commons chamber with her son in September An MP has said it ""has to be possible for politics and parenting to mix"" after being told she cannot sit in the Commons with her three-month-old son. Labour's Stella Creasy was informed it was against the rules to bring a child to a debate at Westminster Hall after doing so on Tuesday. Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has asked a committee of MPs to review the rules. Ms Creasy said she was""pleased to hear this"",external- as rules meant she could not be in the chamber for his statement. But Conservative MP Scott Benton criticised her stance on Twitter, saying: ""Parents who get paid a fraction of what you do pay for childcare and juggle responsibilities so they can go to work. What makes you so special?"" Addressing the Commons, Sir Lindsay said it was ""extremely important"" for parents to be able to participate fully in the work of the House, which has a nursery. ""Rules have to be seen in context and they change with the times,"" he told the House. He asked the Commons Procedure Committee to ""look into this matter"". The committee, chaired by Conservative MP Karen Bradley,makes recommendations on the practical operation of the House.,external This video can not be played Speaker Hoyle on babies in Commons: Rules change with the times Ms Creasy told the BBC she had regularly taken her son - whom she is breastfeeding - and before him, her daughter, into the Commons chamber. But after appearing with her son at the adjoining Westminster Hall on Tuesday, she received an email from the private secretary to the chairman of the ways and means committee, Dame Eleanor Laing, which said this was not in line with recently published rules on ""behaviour and courtesies"". Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said he had ""a lot of sympathy"" for Ms Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, and politicians needed to make sure ""our profession is brought into the modern world... [so] parents can juggle the jobs they do with the family time they need"". But, while saying a baby in the Commons ""certainly wouldn't distract me or get in the way of me doing my job"", Mr Raab said it was for the House authorities to decide the ""right balance"". Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the PM wanted to see ""further improvements"" on making Parliament family-friendly, though any change to the rules was a matter for the Commons. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment while the Procedure Committee considered the matter. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Creasy - who is encouraging more mothers to enter politics through a campaign called This Mum Votes - shared the email she was sent on Twitter, writing: ""Mothers in the mother of all parliaments are not to be seen or heard it seems..."" The rule book,which was issued,externalby the speaker and deputy speakers and applies to the chamber of the House of Commons and Westminster Hall, was updated in September. It says: ""You should not take your seat in the chamber when accompanied by your child, nor stand at either end of the Chamber, between divisions."" The same wording was also used in a previous version of the rule book. But another MP, Alex Davies-Jones, said she had been assured by Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle that if she needed to breastfeed her child in the chamber she could do so. Ms Creasy said this was ""not a system that works for anyone who isn't a man of a certain age from a certain background"". ""I don't have maternity cover - I don't have the employment rights to have maternity cover,"" she said, adding the situation as it stands ""is bad for our democracy"". Asked what needed to change to help MPs continue to work as new parents, she said: ""It's too late for me - so I am trying my best to make sure Walthamstow continues to be heard because it deserves to be heard."" She called for the MPs' rule book to be reviewed and has asked House authorities what she should do if she continues to bring her son to work. ""I've had a baby, I haven't given up my brain or capacity to do things and our politics and our policy making will be better by having more mums at the table,"" she added. Former MP Jo Swinson is believed to have been the first MP to cradle a baby during a Commons debate in 2018 While MPs are entitled to paid maternity leave for six months and a proxy vote, some have said it is difficult to obtain funding for adequate maternity cover. And MPs must be physically present at Westminster in order to represent constituents' views during Commons debates, for example. Former Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinsonwas thought to be the first MPto cradle her baby during a debate in the Commons chamber in 2018. Also that year, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardernbecame the first world leaderto take her baby to the floor of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. A House of Commons spokesperson said it was vital all MPs were able to carry out their duties in and around Parliament. They could consult with the Speaker, deputy Speakers, clerks and doorkeepers about their requirements while in the chamber or Westminster Hall at any time, they added.

"Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. The PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. Under the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023: those with assets of less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay anything from these towards care fees - although they might have to pay from their income those with more than Â£100,000 in assets - the value of their home, savings or investments - will not get any financial help from the council those with assets between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 will qualify for council help, but will have to pay Â£86,000 out of their own pocket to reach the cap On Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246. Nineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead. The bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. What could care changes cost you and your family? Claims about social care fact-checked What are the challenges facing social care? Will the cap really fix the social care system? Defending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win. Pushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament. The Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a ""step in the right direction"" and ""an improvement on what we have today"". But he said its plans for calculating the cap were a ""big disappointment"" and ""not as generous as people like me wanted"". After a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like. But that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place. And on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable. The vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. Read Laura's blog in full Under the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit. The threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to Â£100,000 able to qualify, rather than Â£23,250 currently. The governmentannounced last week,externalthat only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap. Local authorities will meet care costs beyond the Â£86,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded througha new health and social care tax. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care. Sally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was ""sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment"". ""The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,"" she said. ""It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this."" When asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I can't predict individual situations."" After the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: ""Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected."" But the prime minister said the new system would be ""progressive"" and ""much better"" than the existing one. ""Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of Â£23,000 or more - now you get support if you have Â£100,000 or less, so we're helping people,"" Mr Johnson said. He added: ""We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country."" Lorraine, pictured as a child, and her mother Roma Lorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent ""every penny that she ever earned"" on care. Despite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of Â£140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. She says for her mother, 83, selling her home was ""probably the worst thing ever"". ""She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,"" Lorraine adds. ""Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances."" Every adult receiving care will have an account measuring how much they spend on care fees from their own income or assets Those with total assets worth more than Â£100,000 will have to pay all the care fees themselves Once assets fall below Â£100,000, people will be able to claim means-tested payments from their council to help with costs If they cannot pay for care from their income, they will have to contribute Â£1 for every Â£250 they have in assets Care home fees - such as for food and rent - will not count towards the Â£86,000 limit but will be capped at Â£200 a week People with assets under Â£20,000 won't have to contribute to their care costs, although they might have to contribute from their income.

"This video can not be played PMQs: Sir Keir Starmer claims the PM has devised a ""working class dementia tax"" to pay for health and social care costs Boris Johnson batted away opposition calls for him to stand down and defended himself against accusations of ""broken promises"" at PMQs.

""In the real world, people are suffering a Tory cost of living crisis, Brexit is hitting the economy hard, but the prime minister can't even give a coherent speech to business leaders,"" he added. He asked why Mr Johnson was ""clinging on when he quite clearly isn't up to the job"". The prime minister said the British public wanted to hear less about politics and more about what the government is doing ""for the people of Scotland"". Earlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab praised Mr Johnson's ""ebullient, bouncy, optimistic, Tiggerish character"", saying it ""livens up"" his speeches. He said there was a ""steeliness"" to the prime minister, adding: ""We work as a team"", and he dismissed the criticism as Westminster ""tittle tattle"". This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister is asked if he's OK after talking about Peppa Pig in a speech to business leaders Mr Johnson appeared before the CBI conference earlier this week to make his pitch for a ""green industrial revolution"" to business, including support for electric cars, investing in wind power and the government's integrated rail plan. But it drew more negative attention after his impression of a car and his personal anecdote from a trip to Peppa Pig World. ""I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,"" he told the conference. ""Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. ""It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig."" Asked after the speech, ""is everything OK?"", Mr Johnson said he thought people had ""got the vast majority of the points"" he wanted to make and that the speech ""went over well"". This video can not be played Justice Secretary Dominic Raab: 'The prime minister is a Tiggerish character' It comes after a few weeks of turbulence at Westminster. The PMbacked attempts to overhaul the standards system for MPs' conduct, blocking the suspension of Tory MP Owen Paterson -who had been found to have broken lobbying rules. No 10 performed a U-turn on the move following a furious backlash from MPs, including some Conservatives. But the fall-out led to accusations about sleaze, and wider questions about MPs' second jobs. The PM came under further pressure this week over the cost cap element of his social care plan, which charities warned could unfairly hit people with fewer assets. MPs backed the proposals, but it was only a narrow victory for Mr Johnson thanks to a significant Tory rebellion.

"Michael Vaughan played for Yorkshire from 1993 to 2009 Former England captain Michael Vaughan will not be involved in the BBC's coverage of the Ashes in Australia. He wasnamed in Yorkshire's reportinto Azeem Rafiq's claims of racism during his time at the club. Vaughan, 47, said he is ""very disappointed"" and wants to be ""part of the solution, listening, educating myself and helping to make it a more welcoming sport for all"". He has repeatedly denied the allegation made against him. Vaughan wasstood downfrom his BBC Radio 5 Live show this month and will also not be involved in the BBC's ""wider coverage of the sport at the moment"". England will play five Tests against Australia, the first starting on 8 December in Brisbane. Vaughan joined the BBC's Test Match Special radio team as a summariser in 2009. ""While he is involved in a significant story in cricket, for editorial reasons we do not believe that it would be appropriate for Michael Vaughan to have a role in our Ashes team or wider coverage of the sport at the moment,"" read a BBC statement. ""We require our contributors to talk about relevant topics and his involvement in the Yorkshire story represents a conflict of interest."" Rafiq alleged Vaughan said ""too many of you lot, we need to do something about it"" to him and three other players during a County Championship match for Yorkshire in 2009. Rafiq's account was supported by former Pakistan bowler Rana Naved-ul-Hasan andEngland leg-spinner Adil Rashid, who said they heard the comment. The fourth player in the group - bowler Ajmal Shahzad - previouslytold the Daily Mail,externalhe had no recollection of the event and ""the senior guys were really good to me"". Vaughan wrote in his Daily Telegraph column that he""totally denies""making the comment. Following the BBC's decision on Wednesday, he said: ""Very disappointed not to be commentating for TMS on the Ashes and will miss working with great colleagues and friends, but looking forward to being behind the mic for Fox Cricket in Australia. ""The issues facing cricket are bigger than any individual case."" More than 2,000 people have contacted the Independent Commission for Equity in Cricket's (ICEC) inquiry into discrimination in the sport following the racism scandal at Yorkshire. This weekJahid Ahmedbecame the third former Essex player to allege he experienced racist abuse at the club. A 12-point plan which will tackle the issues raised by Rafiq and others is due to be released by the England and Wales Cricket Board. Rafiq criticised Vaughan when he appeared in front of a Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee this month. ""It's important on Michael that we don't make it all about Michael,"" Rafiq said of Vaughan's newspaper column, where the ex-England captain had revealed he was named in the Yorkshire investigation.

"Scotland's prisons have seen a surge in drug seizures during the pandemic, new figures show. There has been an 18-fold increase in stoppages of so-called street Valium in the space of a year, while seizures of psychoactive substances have nearly doubled. Illegal substances often get inside prisons throughdrug-soaked clothing or lettersbefore being smoked. The Scottish Prison Service said it has invested in new ways to detect drugs. One expert said more prisoners may have turned to drugs during the pandemic as family visits were stopped. Six ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis Scottish prisons 'awash' with synthetic drugs linked to violence FM to examine prison drug letter claims A spate of drug overdoses at HMP Shotts in North Lanarkshire in recent weeks have been linked to new psychoactive substances. These substances, such as synthetic cannabinoid ""Spice"", and ""street"" benzodiazepines, such as Etizolam, are now thought to be the dominant drugs in prisons. One serving officer at a large Scottish jail, speaking to BBC Scotland anonymously, said: ""The prisoners don't know the strength of this stuff from one batch to another, so it's proper Russian roulette territory. ""Detection is difficult when its sold in postage-stamp sized quantities and then cut up even smaller. ""It's hard to deal with at times, especially when prisoners are so unpredictable, but you have to remember it's no different to what you are seeing on schemes up and down the country."" Etizolam has been dubbed the ""blue plague"" as a result of the number of drugs-related deaths it is involved in Figures released to BBC Scotland under freedom of information laws show there were 229 recoveries of suspected psychoactive substances across the prison estate in June 2020. In June of this year there were 421 such seizures. For Etizolam, there were 11 recoveries by wardens in jails across Scotland in June 2020 but 198 in the same month this year. The quantities of drugs involved in each incident was not released. Etizolam is a benzodiazepine known as fake Valium and is many times stronger than prescription drugs. These substances are a major factor in Scotland's wider drugs deaths problem and this is also reflected in prison fatalities. Of the 20 drug-related deaths in Scotland's prisons since 2016, 12 involved psychoactive substances and six Etizolam. David Mackie, a retired sheriff and chairman of penal reform charity Howard League Scotland, warned the drug trade in jails was having an ""impact way beyond the walls of the prison"". He said: ""If somebody is in prison being supplied with drugs which are costing three to five times what they cost outside, how is that person paying for that drugs? Because he won't have the money in prison. ""It is almost certain that person's family may be put under pressure to either raise the money and pay for the drugs or do something for the organised crime groups."" Mr Mackie added that for ""those participating in the trade it seems to be quite a safe and lucrative occupation, there seems to be little risk of prosecution."" A spokesman for the SPS said it treats the issue of smuggling drugs into prisons ""very seriously"" and the service had ""invested in technology to better detect suspicious substances and work closely with partner agencies to garner relevant intelligence"". He added: ""The particular problem of psychoactive substances is impacting on the whole of our society, not just the prison system. These substances are sometimes difficult to detect and their use can be lethal. ""We have over the last few years pointed out on many occasions, to those in our care, the dangers of using such substances. If we suspect that an item many contain such materials, then we quarantine them and do not allow them to enter a prison."" Joey McGuiness says drugs are moved about prisons ""in the blink of an eye"" so it makes detection difficult Joey McGuiness is a recovering cocaine addict being supported by the Glasgow-based Sisco charity which delivers drug recovery services for people in and out of the prison system. The 34-year-old spent five weeks in the city's Barlinnie prison and said most of the people he met there had drug addiction issues. ""It's very easy to get drugs in prison,"" he says. ""I used to see people in the morning and they were alright but by lunchtime they were a completely different person. Joey admits he was tempted to take drugs in prison ""to escape"" but stopped himself as he was grappling with taking the first step to ending a cocaine problem which he says had taken over his life. A near fatal-overdose months after leaving prison in 2019 was the moment when Joey first admitted he was a cocaine addict and began his road to recovery. Now 10 months clean, Joey is enjoying life without drugs and repairing relationships with his family. ""My wee ma's proud of me today. First time I can say that,"" he says. ""When I used to go into my mum's house she used to have fear on her face but when I go in today it's a smile."" Leeh Howell, of Sisco, says Joey's experience of drugs in prison is common and thinks the problems have got worse since the start of the Covid pandemic. He said: ""It's not really stopped substances getting into the prison. ""I think with things like family visits being stopped, all the feelings and thoughts that they've been sitting with have been amplified and it's making it that much harder to not take substances.""

"Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. The PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. Under the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023: those with assets of less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay anything from these towards care fees - although they might have to pay from their income those with more than Â£100,000 in assets - the value of their home, savings or investments - will not get any financial help from the council those with assets between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 will qualify for council help, but will have to pay Â£86,000 out of their own pocket to reach the cap On Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246. Nineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead. The bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. What could care changes cost you and your family? Claims about social care fact-checked What are the challenges facing social care? Will the cap really fix the social care system? Defending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win. Pushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament. The Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a ""step in the right direction"" and ""an improvement on what we have today"". But he said its plans for calculating the cap were a ""big disappointment"" and ""not as generous as people like me wanted"". After a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like. But that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place. And on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable. The vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. Read Laura's blog in full Under the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit. The threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to Â£100,000 able to qualify, rather than Â£23,250 currently. The governmentannounced last week,externalthat only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap. Local authorities will meet care costs beyond the Â£86,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded througha new health and social care tax. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care. Sally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was ""sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment"". ""The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,"" she said. ""It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this."" When asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I can't predict individual situations."" After the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: ""Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected."" But the prime minister said the new system would be ""progressive"" and ""much better"" than the existing one. ""Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of Â£23,000 or more - now you get support if you have Â£100,000 or less, so we're helping people,"" Mr Johnson said. He added: ""We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country."" Lorraine, pictured as a child, and her mother Roma Lorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent ""every penny that she ever earned"" on care. Despite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of Â£140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. She says for her mother, 83, selling her home was ""probably the worst thing ever"". ""She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,"" Lorraine adds. ""Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances."" Every adult receiving care will have an account measuring how much they spend on care fees from their own income or assets Those with total assets worth more than Â£100,000 will have to pay all the care fees themselves Once assets fall below Â£100,000, people will be able to claim means-tested payments from their council to help with costs If they cannot pay for care from their income, they will have to contribute Â£1 for every Â£250 they have in assets Care home fees - such as for food and rent - will not count towards the Â£86,000 limit but will be capped at Â£200 a week People with assets under Â£20,000 won't have to contribute to their care costs, although they might have to contribute from their income.

"French footballer Karim Benzema lost his place in the national team over the scandal France and Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been found guilty of conspiring to blackmail a fellow French footballer with a sex tape. A judge handed Benzema a one-year suspended jail term and ordered him to pay a â¬75,000 (Â£63,000; $84,000) fine. Benzema, 33, was one of five people put on trial last month over an attempt to extort Frenchman Mathieu Valbuena. The scandal has stunned the football community in France and both players lost their national team places. The case dates back to June 2015, when the two footballers were at a French training camp. At the camp, Benzema put pressure on Valbuena to pay off the blackmailers, whom he had conspired with to act as an intermediary, prosecutors said. Benzema has always denied the allegations and insisted he was only trying to help Valbuena get rid of the compromising video. Benzema has since returned to the France team and is expected to start for Real Madrid on Wednesday night when they play FC Sheriff Tiraspol in the Champions League. Benzema was not present in court in Versailles for the verdict, nor was Valbuena, who plays for Greek club Olympiakos. Four of Benzema's co-defendants in the trial were also found guilty on Wednesday. They were handed jail sentences ranging from 18 months suspended to two-and-a-half years in prison. Benzema's lawyers said they would appeal his conviction. ""The reaction is ultimately an angry one to this judgment which is perfectly contradictory,"" his lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, told reporters outside court. But when delivering the verdict, the judge said Benzema had ""implicated himself personally, through subterfuge and lies, to convince his teammate to submit to the blackmail"". Benzema's lawyers said the French footballer would appeal the conviction Benzema made a surprise comeback to the French national team in May, five years after he was exiled from the side when the allegations first surfaced in 2015. But last month, the French football federation said a guilty verdict would not necessarily jeopardise Benzema's position in the national side. Since being called back by France manager Didier Deschamps, Benzema has been in prolific form, scoring nine times in 13 games for his country. He's also scored 10 goals this season for his club, Real Madrid, who are yet to comment on the verdict. For his performances on the pitch, Benzema was named a candidate for the Ballon d'Or footballer of the year award which will be announced next week. Analysis by BBC Sport's European football expert Guillem Balague There are two ways of dealing with the private lives of footballers and we have seen that in the case of Benzema. The story hasn't been given much importance in the sports media in Spain, but it has been hugely prominent in France. In France, Benzema will be questioned professionally because of his behaviour off the pitch, much more so than in Spain. In France, private lives are more relevant, not just in sport but also in politics. Benzema - who is of Algerian descent - has suggested there was an element of racism in this case. He felt that, had he been a white player, he would have been treated differently. But none of it affects his status at Real Madrid, at all. In Spain, there is a view that your private life is your private life, and there has even been a strong campaign in the Madrid media for him to win the Ballon d'Or. It began in 2015 when Valbuena, now 37, asked a man in Marseille, Axel Angot, to upload the contents of his mobile phone to a new device. Mr Angot found sexually explicit material on the phone. He and another defendant in the trial, Mustapha Zouaoui, were accused of trying to blackmail Valbuena by threatening to make the tape public. Mr Zouaoui told reporters he had shared the tape, but there had never been an attempt to extort money. Valbuena described being approached by another defendant, Younes Houass, who told the court he had warned the player about the issue without asking for money. Mathieu Valbuena and Karim Benzema (right) were both playing for France until the case emerged When the footballer went to the police, they set up a sting operation involving an undercover agent. Prosecutors said another defendant was then brought into the scam - Karim Zenati, who is a childhood friend of Benzema. At this point, Benzema was asked to act as a ""middleman"" in the scheme, prosecutors said. In October 2015, Benzema approached his fellow France player in his room at the national team's training camp. Benzema said he had merely tried to help his teammate dispose of the x-rated video, warning him: ""Be careful, Math, they're big, big thugs."" He then offered to put him touch with someone he could trust - his childhood friend, Mr Zenati. Benzema returned to the French national team in May after being exiled for five years Police were by now tapping their phone calls and recorded Benzema telling his friend: ""He's not taking us seriously."" Mr Zenati is said to have replied: ""We're here to sort it out; if he doesn't want that he'll have to deal with the piranhas."" Giving evidence at the start of the trial, Valbuena said he had never considered handing over money to stop the video getting out. Unlike his former teammate, Valbuena has not played for France since the scandal began. Testifying during the trial, Valbuena told the court that football was his life. ""I knew if that video got out it would make things difficult with the French team,"" he said.

Analysis by BBC Sport's European football expert Guillem Balague There are two ways of dealing with the private lives of footballers and we have seen that in the case of Benzema. The story hasn't been given much importance in the sports media in Spain, but it has been hugely prominent in France. In France, Benzema will be questioned professionally because of his behaviour off the pitch, much more so than in Spain. In France, private lives are more relevant, not just in sport but also in politics. Benzema - who is of Algerian descent - has suggested there was an element of racism in this case. He felt that, had he been a white player, he would have been treated differently. But none of it affects his status at Real Madrid, at all. In Spain, there is a view that your private life is your private life, and there has even been a strong campaign in the Madrid media for him to win the Ballon d'Or. It began in 2015 when Valbuena, now 37, asked a man in Marseille, Axel Angot, to upload the contents of his mobile phone to a new device. Mr Angot found sexually explicit material on the phone. He and another defendant in the trial, Mustapha Zouaoui, were accused of trying to blackmail Valbuena by threatening to make the tape public. Mr Zouaoui told reporters he had shared the tape, but there had never been an attempt to extort money. Valbuena described being approached by another defendant, Younes Houass, who told the court he had warned the player about the issue without asking for money. Mathieu Valbuena and Karim Benzema (right) were both playing for France until the case emerged When the footballer went to the police, they set up a sting operation involving an undercover agent. Prosecutors said another defendant was then brought into the scam - Karim Zenati, who is a childhood friend of Benzema. At this point, Benzema was asked to act as a ""middleman"" in the scheme, prosecutors said. In October 2015, Benzema approached his fellow France player in his room at the national team's training camp. Benzema said he had merely tried to help his teammate dispose of the x-rated video, warning him: ""Be careful, Math, they're big, big thugs."" He then offered to put him touch with someone he could trust - his childhood friend, Mr Zenati. Benzema returned to the French national team in May after being exiled for five years Police were by now tapping their phone calls and recorded Benzema telling his friend: ""He's not taking us seriously."" Mr Zenati is said to have replied: ""We're here to sort it out; if he doesn't want that he'll have to deal with the piranhas."" Giving evidence at the start of the trial, Valbuena said he had never considered handing over money to stop the video getting out. Unlike his former teammate, Valbuena has not played for France since the scandal began. Testifying during the trial, Valbuena told the court that football was his life. ""I knew if that video got out it would make things difficult with the French team,"" he said.

"World Health Organization says more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week It warns against a ""false sense of security"" created by vaccines and stresses the need to be cautious Some 1.5 million Covid deaths have already been recorded in the WHO's Europe region of 53 countries The EU's public health agency says European countries should consider vaccine boosters for all adults Poland is warning that restrictions could be reintroduced if its infection rates don't start to fall The danger of a future UK pandemic is as serious as threats to the UK's defences, an ex-vaccines tsar says Netherlands considering new curbs after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus Edited by Paul Gribben Thank you for joining us today. As our live coverage comes to an end, here are some of Thursday's key developments in the pandemic: Today's live page was edited by Paul Gribben, and written by Dulcie Lee, Mal Siret, Adam Durbin and Matt Murphy. NFL star Aaron Rodgers has told US media he has developed a painful case of ""Covid toe"" after a brush with the virus earlier this month. The condition causes discoloration or lesions around the toes and researchers believe that it is caused by excess interferon, a protein which the body uses to fight infection. Rodgers told reporters after Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings that the condition is ""very, very painful"". The Green Bay Packers quarterback prompted controversy over his vaccination status when he tested positive for Covid-19 and entered a 10-day quarantine period - the minimum amount of time an unvaccinated player is asked to quarantine under NFL rules. However, in August he had seemed to indicate that he had received the jab, telling reporters that he was ""immunised"". He later said that he had been referring to his antibody levels and that he was treating his infection using the drug ivermectin, on the advice of podcast host Joe Rogan. Vladimir Putin has said he ""cannot understand"" the levels of vaccine hesitancy among Russians Russian officials say they have started to target people spreading anti-vaccine information online as the country aims to energise its sluggish vaccine rollout. The state healthcare regulator, Roszdravnadzor, said it had instructed its regional branches to report people - including
medical professionals - who ""deliberately spread false
information about the dangers of vaccination"". The agency told Reuters that it had already reported more
than 30 anti-vaccine campaigners, who could face fines of around Â£19,000 and up to five years in prison under ""fake news"" laws passed last year. Russia has struggled with widespread vaccine hesitancy and just 37% of people are fully vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly pleaded with people to take the jab. Last month he told state TV that he ""couldn't understand"" why people were refusing to come forward for the shot. âWe have a reliable and efficient vaccine,"" he said. ""The vaccine really reduces the risks of illness, grave complications and death.""  France is set to announce fresh measures on Thursday to curb the spread of Covid-19, as infection rates surge domestically and across Europe. However, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says there are no plans to introduce a new lockdown as some EU countries have done, the Reuters news agency reports. Speaking at a news conference, Attal says the government is looking to avoid major restrictions on public life. He explains it is instead looking to use other means of suppressing transmission like stricter social distancing, increasing the number and pace of booster jabs and tightening vaccine passport rules. Government spokesman Gabriel Attal says more detail will be announced tomorrow following a meeting of France's cabinet ""We must protect the French people by building on what we have, to save the end-of-year festivities and get through the winter as well as possible,"" the minister says. France's vaccine passport - known as the health pass - allows entry to cafes, restaurants, museums, cinemas and other public places for those who are fully vaccinated or have recently tested negative. The seven-day average of cases exceeded 20,000 for the first time since August on Tuesday, while coronavirus patients in intensive care rose to 1,455. Attal declined to specify what measures may be announced on Thursday, but the government is expected to follow the advice of France's health regulator to allow anyone over-40 to access a third dose of a Covid vaccine. Slovakia will limit
movement as part of a two-week lockdown in an attempt to stem a fast rise in
Covid-19 cases, the government has announced. Slovakians will only be permitted to travel for essential shopping,
work, school or medical visits, government ministers said on Wednesday. They will assess the situation after 10 days, although any easing of restrictions will be limited to those fully vaccinated against the virus. The decision to return to a lockdown comes after the government imposed new restrictions on unvaccinated people earlier this week in an attempt to push up vaccinations. Slovakia has the third-lowest vaccination rate in the EU. Less than 50% of people in the country of 5.5 million have been vaccinated and the vast majority of people in hospital are unvaccinated.  Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent This video can not be played Police fire warning shots at Covid protesters in the Netherlands The first suspects charged in connection with theriots in Rotterdamearlier this week over the partial lockdown called in the Netherlands have been appearing in court. A 26-year-old woman from Spijkenisse (a city that is part of the greater Rotterdam area) was found guilty of throwing stones at police vehicles. She was jailed for five months - two of them conditional - and ordered to pay 1,000 euros (Â£840) for damage to the cars. The second person to appear in court was a 29-year-old man from Delft, who was given a five-month sentence and a one-year restraining order for a large part of Rotterdam. The sentencing comes on the day the Netherlands reports 23,789 new Covid cases - the biggest one-day increase on record. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent in Strasbourg President David-Maria Sassoli (centre) at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Walking
into the European Parliament there are officials standing ready to check your Covid ""status"". People queue, with phone apps open, to prove they've been
double-jabbed. Inside, everyone on the move is wearing masks. Yet it was only
on Friday that the president of the European Parliament David-Maria Sassoli confirmed
the return to ""hybrid"" proceedings. That means members can participate in
debates and votes remotely. As a result, the
parliament continues to be less busy and less buzzy than before. Having said
that, walking the halls and dropping into the cafes, there are still plenty of
face-to-face meetings going on. People chatting over a coffee, lunch or even a
drink in the evening. Sat down, the masks largely come off. One of those
moments where things seem a little more normal. But it's a normality that
people here again think could increasingly evaporate as winter sets in and Covid once again grips large parts of Europe.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin said vaccinations should be voluntary ""on the whole"" Russia is registering a version of the country's Sputnik-V vaccine for children aged between 12 and 17, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. Ms Golikova has told a government meeting on Covid-19 that registration of the new treatment, named Gam-Covid-Vac, would take place later in the day, state news agency Tass reports. She said it was hoped the vaccine would enter civilian circulation in Russia from the end of December. The new vaccine will only be given to children under 15 with the consent of their parents or the child's legal representative, and to children over 15 only with their own consent, Ms Golikova said. Speaking at the same meeting, President Vladimir Putin urged the government to pay attention to the need for vaccines for children, but voiced scepticism about compulsory vaccination. ""On the whole, inoculations should be voluntary - specially for children,"" Tass quoted him as saying. There have been 43,676 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours,according to the latest data,external. This means there have been 303,071 people who have tested positive for the virus in the last seven days, - up by 11.1% on the week before. There have also been 149 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, taking the weekly total to 926 - a 9.4% fall on the previous seven-day period. Around 80.4% of people over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated, while 88.4% have had a single dose of a Covid jab and 27.8% have received a third booster dose. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Europe is once again at the epicentre of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, said more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week. The organisation said the highly infectious Delta variant has increased the risk of transmission among vaccinated people. Dr Tedros warned against a ""false sense of security"" created by the vaccines, stressing that those who are vaccinated can still get and spread the virus. Those who are vaccinated must therefore continue to take precautions, such as mask wearing, social distancing, avoiding crowds, and meeting others outside or in well-ventilated rooms, he said. Dr Tedros stressed, however, that the vaccines do reduce the risk of severe illness and death. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said a decision on further restrictions would be announced on Friday The Dutch government looks set to announce a raft of new coronavirus restrictions after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus. Officials announced on Wednesday that more than 23,700 Covid-19 infections had been recorded in 24 hours, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. It means that cases have jumped by more than 40% over the past week, despite more than 85% of Dutch people being fully vaccinated. Experts have warned that hospitals will reach full capacity in less than a week if new restrictions are not introduced. ""The
infection rate is higher than ever before"", Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said
in a letter to parliament on Wednesday. ""Hospital admissions
keep exceeding expectations and we have not seen the worst
yet."" He
said the government's panel of health experts would provide
fresh policy advice by Thursday and that a decision would
follow on Friday. Plans to restrict
access to many public places to people who have
been vaccinated or have recently recovered from COVID-19 promptedthree nights of riotinglast week and more than 170 people have been arrested. Boris Johnson was criticised earlier this month for not wearing a mask during a visit to a hospital Downing Street has insisted that the prime minister ""follows all Covid rules"" when asked about reports that he attended a performance of Macbeth without wearing a mask. The Guardian said another audience member saw Boris Johnson without his mask on at all times during Tuesday's play at the Almeida Theatre in north London. A different audience member saw him maskless in a public area of the venue, the paper said. Mask-wearing rules were dropped in England in the summer, but some transport networks, shops and venues - including the Almeida - still ask for them to be worn. Earlier this month, Mr Johnson was criticised for not wearing a mask during a hospital tour and while sitting next to 95-year-old environmental campaigner Sir David Attenborough at the COP26 climate summit. Protesters carry a banner reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" through Kyiv Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv to protest against Covid measures and the country's mandatory vaccination programme for some workers. Protesters carried placards reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" and ""say 'no' to lies"". Some were also demanding the release of anti-vaccine activist Ostap Stakhiv, who was arrested in the city of Lviv last week accused of undermining public health through alleged links with Russia. Mr Stakhiv has denied all the allegations against him. Ukraine, which has recently seen a rise in vaccination numbers after imposing restrictions in public places, is still struggling to persuade a large number of its citizens who remain hesitant to receive their shots. The country is experiencing a new surge in coronavirus cases as the highly transmissible Delta variant sweeps across Europe. Ukraine today reported 14,325 new daily Covid cases and 595 coronavirus-related deaths. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent The Greens backed the government on vaccine passports when case numbers were rising As we heard yesterday, the Scottish government has decided not to expand its vaccine passport scheme to more venues. It's been branded a ""U-turn"" by opposition parties. So what was it that changed their minds? Read the full analysishere.  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Taiwan hasnot recorded any local Covid cases since 4 November,external, according to official data. Also, according to the national news agency CNA, the share of fully vaccinated people in the country is close to reaching 50%. More
than 11.6 million people have received two vaccine doses in Taiwan - 49.8% of
the population. More than 77% have received at least one vaccine dose. The Central Epidemic Command Centre is conditionally relaxing Covid restrictions ""for attending funerals or visiting relatives for people in home isolation/quarantine,external"". On Thursday, it will begin to offer recipients of
the AstraZeneca vaccine second doses of either Pfizer or Moderna.
This was the first vaccine that was made available to residents in Taiwan, and
the Taipei Times says thatpeople can apply online for these ""mix and match bookings"",external. The Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and
locally-made Medigen vaccine are available there. The latter has gained some international
recognition â Taiwan News says that Palau now allows visitors to enter if they
have received the Taiwan-made vaccine. However, it reports that a man has
been refused transit to Palau from the US pacific island territory of Guam, asthe vaccine is not yet recognised there,external.

Many Scottish children struggling in education before Covid ""fell off the radar"" in the first few months of the pandemic, a children rights charity has told politicians. Dr Colin Morrison, a co-director at Children's parliament, says there could be a ""legacy of disengagement"" for some pupils who lacked electronic devices to access online learning materials - the consequences of  which might be ""difficult to address"". Speaking to MSPs at the Education, Children and Young People Committee at Holyrood, Dr Morrison says many children the charity works with ""were just gone to the education system"" in the three or four months from March last year. He adds: ""What I also know is many head teachers we knew who love and care for their children were literally scrambling about and delivering devices every day, knocking on doors and making sure people had food, never mind digital devices."" Last year the Scottish government pledged 50,000 devices would be given to children in need - later rising to 70,000 - while the SNP promised an age-appropriate device for every Scottish school student as part of their manifesto ahead of May's election. But Dr Morrison explains that some children are still without what they need, warning the loss of engagement for some of them could have ""long-term consequences"" for their learning. ""If there's a gap in attainment there's certainly a gap in how children are using that digital space to learn. ""For some children that's just taken off and they're blossoming with it, for other children there's a legacy of disengagement that's going to be difficult to address,"" he argues. London Underground workers are being put in potentially dangerous situations as mask-wearing is now being ""openly ignored"" on a large scale, unions are warning. The train drivers' union Aslef says there has been a noticeable dip in travellers wearing masks on the Tube - even though it's a requirement. And Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT), says: ""It's no wonder there's talk of new restrictions and controls if we can't even deliver the basics."" Transport for London - which runs the Tube network - said it has 500 enforcement officers to ask customers to comply with its mask rules. It says it has refused entry to 408 people and asked 126 to leave services since national rules were relaxed in July. Read more:What are the rules on mask wearing now? Prime Minister Naftali Bennett watches as his nine-year-old son is vaccinated Nearly 40% of Israel's Covid-19 patients are below the age of 12, the country's Health Ministry has said. Officials said that of 6,505 Israelis currently infected with the disease, 2,574 of those are children. The announcement comes as the government launched its vaccination campaign for children aged 5-11 this week. Around 1.2 million children will be inoculated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine over the coming months. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had his nine-year-old son vaccinated in front of media on Tuesday and urged other lawmakers to set a similar example. Israel recently emerged from a fourth Covid-19 wave which saw daily infections peak at more than 8,000 cases per day. But daily infections have been relatively low for the last few weeks and million of people have now received a third booster jab. But despite the country's progress, the government has extended ""Green Pass"" regulations meant to restrict access to certain venues to vaccinated or recovered individuals for another two weeks.

Ukraine, which has recently seen a rise in vaccination numbers after imposing restrictions in public places, is still struggling to persuade a large number of its citizens who remain hesitant to receive their shots. The country is experiencing a new surge in coronavirus cases as the highly transmissible Delta variant sweeps across Europe. Ukraine today reported 14,325 new daily Covid cases and 595 coronavirus-related deaths. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent The Greens backed the government on vaccine passports when case numbers were rising As we heard yesterday, the Scottish government has decided not to expand its vaccine passport scheme to more venues.

For anyone considering travelling in the pandemic, the variety and complexity of rules can feel a bit overwhelming, with the broad spectrum of testing, vaccination and self-isolation requirements in place around the world. However, to give prospective tourists and travelling business people a hand we've picked a selection of destinations many British people might be planning to travel to, aiming to explain their rules as simply as possible. The seven countries we've selected are - Spain, France, Italy, the US, Irish Republic, Greece and Germany.

Many Scottish children struggling in education before Covid ""fell off the radar"" in the first few months of the pandemic, a children rights charity has told politicians. Dr Colin Morrison, a co-director at Children's parliament, says there could be a ""legacy of disengagement"" for some pupils who lacked electronic devices to access online learning materials - the consequences of  which might be ""difficult to address"". Speaking to MSPs at the Education, Children and Young People Committee at Holyrood, Dr Morrison says many children the charity works with ""were just gone to the education system"" in the three or four months from March last year. He adds: ""What I also know is many head teachers we knew who love and care for their children were literally scrambling about and delivering devices every day, knocking on doors and making sure people had food, never mind digital devices."" Last year the Scottish government pledged 50,000 devices would be given to children in need - later rising to 70,000 - while the SNP promised an age-appropriate device for every Scottish school student as part of their manifesto ahead of May's election. But Dr Morrison explains that some children are still without what they need, warning the loss of engagement for some of them could have ""long-term consequences"" for their learning. ""If there's a gap in attainment there's certainly a gap in how children are using that digital space to learn. ""For some children that's just taken off and they're blossoming with it, for other children there's a legacy of disengagement that's going to be difficult to address,"" he argues. London Underground workers are being put in potentially dangerous situations as mask-wearing is now being ""openly ignored"" on a large scale, unions are warning. The train drivers' union Aslef says there has been a noticeable dip in travellers wearing masks on the Tube - even though it's a requirement. And Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT), says: ""It's no wonder there's talk of new restrictions and controls if we can't even deliver the basics."" Transport for London - which runs the Tube network - said it has 500 enforcement officers to ask customers to comply with its mask rules. It says it has refused entry to 408 people and asked 126 to leave services since national rules were relaxed in July. Read more:What are the rules on mask wearing now? Prime Minister Naftali Bennett watches as his nine-year-old son is vaccinated Nearly 40% of Israel's Covid-19 patients are below the age of 12, the country's Health Ministry has said. Officials said that of 6,505 Israelis currently infected with the disease, 2,574 of those are children. The announcement comes as the government launched its vaccination campaign for children aged 5-11 this week. Around 1.2 million children will be inoculated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine over the coming months. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had his nine-year-old son vaccinated in front of media on Tuesday and urged other lawmakers to set a similar example. Israel recently emerged from a fourth Covid-19 wave which saw daily infections peak at more than 8,000 cases per day. But daily infections have been relatively low for the last few weeks and million of people have now received a third booster jab. But despite the country's progress, the government has extended ""Green Pass"" regulations meant to restrict access to certain venues to vaccinated or recovered individuals for another two weeks.

"Stella Creasy sat in the Commons chamber with her son in September An MP has said it ""has to be possible for politics and parenting to mix"" after being told she cannot sit in the Commons with her three-month-old son. Labour's Stella Creasy was informed it was against the rules to bring a child to a debate at Westminster Hall after doing so on Tuesday. Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has asked a committee of MPs to review the rules. Ms Creasy said she was""pleased to hear this"",external- as rules meant she could not be in the chamber for his statement. But Conservative MP Scott Benton criticised her stance on Twitter, saying: ""Parents who get paid a fraction of what you do pay for childcare and juggle responsibilities so they can go to work. What makes you so special?"" Addressing the Commons, Sir Lindsay said it was ""extremely important"" for parents to be able to participate fully in the work of the House, which has a nursery. ""Rules have to be seen in context and they change with the times,"" he told the House. He asked the Commons Procedure Committee to ""look into this matter"". The committee, chaired by Conservative MP Karen Bradley,makes recommendations on the practical operation of the House.,external This video can not be played Speaker Hoyle on babies in Commons: Rules change with the times Ms Creasy told the BBC she had regularly taken her son - whom she is breastfeeding - and before him, her daughter, into the Commons chamber. But after appearing with her son at the adjoining Westminster Hall on Tuesday, she received an email from the private secretary to the chairman of the ways and means committee, Dame Eleanor Laing, which said this was not in line with recently published rules on ""behaviour and courtesies"". Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab said he had ""a lot of sympathy"" for Ms Creasy, MP for Walthamstow, and politicians needed to make sure ""our profession is brought into the modern world... [so] parents can juggle the jobs they do with the family time they need"". But, while saying a baby in the Commons ""certainly wouldn't distract me or get in the way of me doing my job"", Mr Raab said it was for the House authorities to decide the ""right balance"". Boris Johnson's official spokesman said the PM wanted to see ""further improvements"" on making Parliament family-friendly, though any change to the rules was a matter for the Commons. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer's spokesman said it would be inappropriate to comment while the Procedure Committee considered the matter. Allow Twitter content?

Ms Creasy - who is encouraging more mothers to enter politics through a campaign called This Mum Votes - shared the email she was sent on Twitter, writing: ""Mothers in the mother of all parliaments are not to be seen or heard it seems..."" The rule book,which was issued,externalby the speaker and deputy speakers and applies to the chamber of the House of Commons and Westminster Hall, was updated in September. It says: ""You should not take your seat in the chamber when accompanied by your child, nor stand at either end of the Chamber, between divisions."" The same wording was also used in a previous version of the rule book. But another MP, Alex Davies-Jones, said she had been assured by Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle that if she needed to breastfeed her child in the chamber she could do so. Ms Creasy said this was ""not a system that works for anyone who isn't a man of a certain age from a certain background"". ""I don't have maternity cover - I don't have the employment rights to have maternity cover,"" she said, adding the situation as it stands ""is bad for our democracy"". Asked what needed to change to help MPs continue to work as new parents, she said: ""It's too late for me - so I am trying my best to make sure Walthamstow continues to be heard because it deserves to be heard."" She called for the MPs' rule book to be reviewed and has asked House authorities what she should do if she continues to bring her son to work. ""I've had a baby, I haven't given up my brain or capacity to do things and our politics and our policy making will be better by having more mums at the table,"" she added. Former MP Jo Swinson is believed to have been the first MP to cradle a baby during a Commons debate in 2018 While MPs are entitled to paid maternity leave for six months and a proxy vote, some have said it is difficult to obtain funding for adequate maternity cover. And MPs must be physically present at Westminster in order to represent constituents' views during Commons debates, for example. Former Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinsonwas thought to be the first MPto cradle her baby during a debate in the Commons chamber in 2018. Also that year, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardernbecame the first world leaderto take her baby to the floor of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. A House of Commons spokesperson said it was vital all MPs were able to carry out their duties in and around Parliament. They could consult with the Speaker, deputy Speakers, clerks and doorkeepers about their requirements while in the chamber or Westminster Hall at any time, they added.

"This video can not be played PMQs: Sir Keir Starmer claims the PM has devised a ""working class dementia tax"" to pay for health and social care costs Boris Johnson batted away opposition calls for him to stand down and defended himself against accusations of ""broken promises"" at PMQs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM on social care funding, rail investment and tax. Picking up on reports of Tory disquiet after the PM's chaotic speech to business leaders, he asked: ""Is everything OK, prime minister?"" The PM said the government was ""delivering for...working people"". The Conservative benches were packed for the exchanges, in contrast to last week's session. ""I see they have turned up this week prime minister,"" said Sir Keir, prompting uproar on all sides and an intervention from Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who ordered MPs to calm down. Several MPs have told the BBC that they were urged by party managers, via text or phone call, to attend Prime Minister's Questions to support Mr Johnson. PM accused of 'shambolic' speech to business group Is everything OK for Boris Johnson? Rail upgrade plans 'missed opportunity' for North Johnson: Peppa Pig World 'very much my kind of place' Sir Keir repeatedly claimed the government's plans for social care funding broke a Conservative manifesto pledge that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""He's picked the pockets of working people to protect the estates of the wealthiest,"" said the Labour leader, adding: ""How could he have devised a working class dementia tax?"" Mr Johnson said homes will not be included in the cap on costs, adding that Labour did not have a plan to solve the problem. The prime minister said the government's ""huge investment"" in health and social care meant people will be able to insure themselves against the ""catastrophic cost"" of suffering from diseases such as dementia. Sir Keir also accused Mr Johnson of breaking a promise not to raise taxes - and to deliver a ""rail revolution"" in the North of England, despite now cancelling the northern leg of HS2. ""Who knows if he'll make it to the next election, but if he does, how can he expect anyone to take his promises seriously?,"" asked the Labour leader. Mr Johnson insisted there would be a rail revolution, and claimed the government was spending Â£96bn on upgrading links. And he said Sir Keir had campaigned against HS2 - which runs through his Holborn and St Pancras constituency - adding that he had backed the new high speed rail link even though it affected his own constituents, because it was in the national interest. ""How can they trust that man?"" he asked. Talk of ousting the PM seems fanciful. He has a track record of bouncing back from adversity. But it is worth noting that loud cheers from a leader's own side does not mean that underlying concerns have evaporated. The former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, was greeted by regular, co-ordinated standing ovations at his party conference, but that didn't prevent MPs quietly but definitively submitting letters of no confidence. The mood at the moment though seems to be for the current Conservative leader to get a grip rather than to get out. While Mr Johnson was on the back foot at PMQs, he nonetheless managed to step up attacks on the Labour leader too - the most effective of which was to suggest that HS2 would never have been built at all if Sir Keir Starmer had got his way. Boris Johnson's premiership has looked juddery recently, but hasn't yet been derailed. The SNP's Westminster Leader, Ian Blackford, also seized on reports of Tory disquiet with the PM's recent performance, accusing him of ""floundering in failure"" and asking him if he had ""considered calling it a day"". ""In the real world, people are suffering a Tory cost of living crisis, Brexit is hitting the economy hard, but the prime minister can't even give a coherent speech to business leaders,"" he added. He asked why Mr Johnson was ""clinging on when he quite clearly isn't up to the job"". The prime minister said the British public wanted to hear less about politics and more about what the government is doing ""for the people of Scotland"". Earlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab praised Mr Johnson's ""ebullient, bouncy, optimistic, Tiggerish character"", saying it ""livens up"" his speeches. He said there was a ""steeliness"" to the prime minister, adding: ""We work as a team"", and he dismissed the criticism as Westminster ""tittle tattle"". This video can not be played Watch: The prime minister is asked if he's OK after talking about Peppa Pig in a speech to business leaders Mr Johnson appeared before the CBI conference earlier this week to make his pitch for a ""green industrial revolution"" to business, including support for electric cars, investing in wind power and the government's integrated rail plan. But it drew more negative attention after his impression of a car and his personal anecdote from a trip to Peppa Pig World. ""I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,"" he told the conference. ""Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. ""It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig."" Asked after the speech, ""is everything OK?"", Mr Johnson said he thought people had ""got the vast majority of the points"" he wanted to make and that the speech ""went over well"". This video can not be played Justice Secretary Dominic Raab: 'The prime minister is a Tiggerish character' It comes after a few weeks of turbulence at Westminster. The PMbacked attempts to overhaul the standards system for MPs' conduct, blocking the suspension of Tory MP Owen Paterson -who had been found to have broken lobbying rules. No 10 performed a U-turn on the move following a furious backlash from MPs, including some Conservatives. But the fall-out led to accusations about sleaze, and wider questions about MPs' second jobs. The PM came under further pressure this week over the cost cap element of his social care plan, which charities warned could unfairly hit people with fewer assets. MPs backed the proposals, but it was only a narrow victory for Mr Johnson thanks to a significant Tory rebellion.

"World Health Organization says more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week It warns against a ""false sense of security"" created by vaccines and stresses the need to be cautious Some 1.5 million Covid deaths have already been recorded in the WHO's Europe region of 53 countries The EU's public health agency says European countries should consider vaccine boosters for all adults Poland is warning that restrictions could be reintroduced if its infection rates don't start to fall The danger of a future UK pandemic is as serious as threats to the UK's defences, an ex-vaccines tsar says Netherlands considering new curbs after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus Edited by Paul Gribben Thank you for joining us today. As our live coverage comes to an end, here are some of Thursday's key developments in the pandemic: Today's live page was edited by Paul Gribben, and written by Dulcie Lee, Mal Siret, Adam Durbin and Matt Murphy. NFL star Aaron Rodgers has told US media he has developed a painful case of ""Covid toe"" after a brush with the virus earlier this month. The condition causes discoloration or lesions around the toes and researchers believe that it is caused by excess interferon, a protein which the body uses to fight infection. Rodgers told reporters after Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings that the condition is ""very, very painful"". The Green Bay Packers quarterback prompted controversy over his vaccination status when he tested positive for Covid-19 and entered a 10-day quarantine period - the minimum amount of time an unvaccinated player is asked to quarantine under NFL rules. However, in August he had seemed to indicate that he had received the jab, telling reporters that he was ""immunised"". He later said that he had been referring to his antibody levels and that he was treating his infection using the drug ivermectin, on the advice of podcast host Joe Rogan. Vladimir Putin has said he ""cannot understand"" the levels of vaccine hesitancy among Russians Russian officials say they have started to target people spreading anti-vaccine information online as the country aims to energise its sluggish vaccine rollout. The state healthcare regulator, Roszdravnadzor, said it had instructed its regional branches to report people - including
medical professionals - who ""deliberately spread false
information about the dangers of vaccination"". The agency told Reuters that it had already reported more
than 30 anti-vaccine campaigners, who could face fines of around Â£19,000 and up to five years in prison under ""fake news"" laws passed last year. Russia has struggled with widespread vaccine hesitancy and just 37% of people are fully vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly pleaded with people to take the jab. Last month he told state TV that he ""couldn't understand"" why people were refusing to come forward for the shot. âWe have a reliable and efficient vaccine,"" he said. ""The vaccine really reduces the risks of illness, grave complications and death.""  France is set to announce fresh measures on Thursday to curb the spread of Covid-19, as infection rates surge domestically and across Europe. However, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says there are no plans to introduce a new lockdown as some EU countries have done, the Reuters news agency reports. Speaking at a news conference, Attal says the government is looking to avoid major restrictions on public life. He explains it is instead looking to use other means of suppressing transmission like stricter social distancing, increasing the number and pace of booster jabs and tightening vaccine passport rules. Government spokesman Gabriel Attal says more detail will be announced tomorrow following a meeting of France's cabinet ""We must protect the French people by building on what we have, to save the end-of-year festivities and get through the winter as well as possible,"" the minister says. France's vaccine passport - known as the health pass - allows entry to cafes, restaurants, museums, cinemas and other public places for those who are fully vaccinated or have recently tested negative. The seven-day average of cases exceeded 20,000 for the first time since August on Tuesday, while coronavirus patients in intensive care rose to 1,455. Attal declined to specify what measures may be announced on Thursday, but the government is expected to follow the advice of France's health regulator to allow anyone over-40 to access a third dose of a Covid vaccine. Slovakia will limit
movement as part of a two-week lockdown in an attempt to stem a fast rise in
Covid-19 cases, the government has announced. Slovakians will only be permitted to travel for essential shopping,
work, school or medical visits, government ministers said on Wednesday. They will assess the situation after 10 days, although any easing of restrictions will be limited to those fully vaccinated against the virus. The decision to return to a lockdown comes after the government imposed new restrictions on unvaccinated people earlier this week in an attempt to push up vaccinations. Slovakia has the third-lowest vaccination rate in the EU. Less than 50% of people in the country of 5.5 million have been vaccinated and the vast majority of people in hospital are unvaccinated.  Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent This video can not be played Police fire warning shots at Covid protesters in the Netherlands The first suspects charged in connection with theriots in Rotterdamearlier this week over the partial lockdown called in the Netherlands have been appearing in court. A 26-year-old woman from Spijkenisse (a city that is part of the greater Rotterdam area) was found guilty of throwing stones at police vehicles. She was jailed for five months - two of them conditional - and ordered to pay 1,000 euros (Â£840) for damage to the cars. The second person to appear in court was a 29-year-old man from Delft, who was given a five-month sentence and a one-year restraining order for a large part of Rotterdam. The sentencing comes on the day the Netherlands reports 23,789 new Covid cases - the biggest one-day increase on record. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent in Strasbourg President David-Maria Sassoli (centre) at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Walking
into the European Parliament there are officials standing ready to check your Covid ""status"". People queue, with phone apps open, to prove they've been
double-jabbed. Inside, everyone on the move is wearing masks. Yet it was only
on Friday that the president of the European Parliament David-Maria Sassoli confirmed
the return to ""hybrid"" proceedings. That means members can participate in
debates and votes remotely. As a result, the
parliament continues to be less busy and less buzzy than before. Having said
that, walking the halls and dropping into the cafes, there are still plenty of
face-to-face meetings going on. People chatting over a coffee, lunch or even a
drink in the evening. Sat down, the masks largely come off. One of those
moments where things seem a little more normal. But it's a normality that
people here again think could increasingly evaporate as winter sets in and Covid once again grips large parts of Europe.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin said vaccinations should be voluntary ""on the whole"" Russia is registering a version of the country's Sputnik-V vaccine for children aged between 12 and 17, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. Ms Golikova has told a government meeting on Covid-19 that registration of the new treatment, named Gam-Covid-Vac, would take place later in the day, state news agency Tass reports. She said it was hoped the vaccine would enter civilian circulation in Russia from the end of December. The new vaccine will only be given to children under 15 with the consent of their parents or the child's legal representative, and to children over 15 only with their own consent, Ms Golikova said. Speaking at the same meeting, President Vladimir Putin urged the government to pay attention to the need for vaccines for children, but voiced scepticism about compulsory vaccination. ""On the whole, inoculations should be voluntary - specially for children,"" Tass quoted him as saying. There have been 43,676 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours,according to the latest data,external. This means there have been 303,071 people who have tested positive for the virus in the last seven days, - up by 11.1% on the week before. There have also been 149 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, taking the weekly total to 926 - a 9.4% fall on the previous seven-day period. Around 80.4% of people over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated, while 88.4% have had a single dose of a Covid jab and 27.8% have received a third booster dose. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Europe is once again at the epicentre of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, said more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week. The organisation said the highly infectious Delta variant has increased the risk of transmission among vaccinated people. Dr Tedros warned against a ""false sense of security"" created by the vaccines, stressing that those who are vaccinated can still get and spread the virus. Those who are vaccinated must therefore continue to take precautions, such as mask wearing, social distancing, avoiding crowds, and meeting others outside or in well-ventilated rooms, he said. Dr Tedros stressed, however, that the vaccines do reduce the risk of severe illness and death. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said a decision on further restrictions would be announced on Friday The Dutch government looks set to announce a raft of new coronavirus restrictions after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus. Officials announced on Wednesday that more than 23,700 Covid-19 infections had been recorded in 24 hours, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. It means that cases have jumped by more than 40% over the past week, despite more than 85% of Dutch people being fully vaccinated. Experts have warned that hospitals will reach full capacity in less than a week if new restrictions are not introduced. ""The
infection rate is higher than ever before"", Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said
in a letter to parliament on Wednesday. ""Hospital admissions
keep exceeding expectations and we have not seen the worst
yet."" He
said the government's panel of health experts would provide
fresh policy advice by Thursday and that a decision would
follow on Friday. Plans to restrict
access to many public places to people who have
been vaccinated or have recently recovered from COVID-19 promptedthree nights of riotinglast week and more than 170 people have been arrested. Boris Johnson was criticised earlier this month for not wearing a mask during a visit to a hospital Downing Street has insisted that the prime minister ""follows all Covid rules"" when asked about reports that he attended a performance of Macbeth without wearing a mask. The Guardian said another audience member saw Boris Johnson without his mask on at all times during Tuesday's play at the Almeida Theatre in north London. A different audience member saw him maskless in a public area of the venue, the paper said. Mask-wearing rules were dropped in England in the summer, but some transport networks, shops and venues - including the Almeida - still ask for them to be worn. Earlier this month, Mr Johnson was criticised for not wearing a mask during a hospital tour and while sitting next to 95-year-old environmental campaigner Sir David Attenborough at the COP26 climate summit. Protesters carry a banner reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" through Kyiv Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv to protest against Covid measures and the country's mandatory vaccination programme for some workers. Protesters carried placards reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" and ""say 'no' to lies"". Some were also demanding the release of anti-vaccine activist Ostap Stakhiv, who was arrested in the city of Lviv last week accused of undermining public health through alleged links with Russia. Mr Stakhiv has denied all the allegations against him. Ukraine, which has recently seen a rise in vaccination numbers after imposing restrictions in public places, is still struggling to persuade a large number of its citizens who remain hesitant to receive their shots. The country is experiencing a new surge in coronavirus cases as the highly transmissible Delta variant sweeps across Europe.

Many Scottish children struggling in education before Covid ""fell off the radar"" in the first few months of the pandemic, a children rights charity has told politicians. Dr Colin Morrison, a co-director at Children's parliament, says there could be a ""legacy of disengagement"" for some pupils who lacked electronic devices to access online learning materials - the consequences of  which might be ""difficult to address"". Speaking to MSPs at the Education, Children and Young People Committee at Holyrood, Dr Morrison says many children the charity works with ""were just gone to the education system"" in the three or four months from March last year. He adds: ""What I also know is many head teachers we knew who love and care for their children were literally scrambling about and delivering devices every day, knocking on doors and making sure people had food, never mind digital devices."" Last year the Scottish government pledged 50,000 devices would be given to children in need - later rising to 70,000 - while the SNP promised an age-appropriate device for every Scottish school student as part of their manifesto ahead of May's election. But Dr Morrison explains that some children are still without what they need, warning the loss of engagement for some of them could have ""long-term consequences"" for their learning. ""If there's a gap in attainment there's certainly a gap in how children are using that digital space to learn. ""For some children that's just taken off and they're blossoming with it, for other children there's a legacy of disengagement that's going to be difficult to address,"" he argues. London Underground workers are being put in potentially dangerous situations as mask-wearing is now being ""openly ignored"" on a large scale, unions are warning. The train drivers' union Aslef says there has been a noticeable dip in travellers wearing masks on the Tube - even though it's a requirement. And Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT), says: ""It's no wonder there's talk of new restrictions and controls if we can't even deliver the basics."" Transport for London - which runs the Tube network - said it has 500 enforcement officers to ask customers to comply with its mask rules. It says it has refused entry to 408 people and asked 126 to leave services since national rules were relaxed in July. Read more:What are the rules on mask wearing now? Prime Minister Naftali Bennett watches as his nine-year-old son is vaccinated Nearly 40% of Israel's Covid-19 patients are below the age of 12, the country's Health Ministry has said. Officials said that of 6,505 Israelis currently infected with the disease, 2,574 of those are children. The announcement comes as the government launched its vaccination campaign for children aged 5-11 this week. Around 1.2 million children will be inoculated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine over the coming months. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had his nine-year-old son vaccinated in front of media on Tuesday and urged other lawmakers to set a similar example. Israel recently emerged from a fourth Covid-19 wave which saw daily infections peak at more than 8,000 cases per day. But daily infections have been relatively low for the last few weeks and million of people have now received a third booster jab. But despite the country's progress, the government has extended ""Green Pass"" regulations meant to restrict access to certain venues to vaccinated or recovered individuals for another two weeks.

"French footballer Karim Benzema lost his place in the national team over the scandal France and Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema has been found guilty of conspiring to blackmail a fellow French footballer with a sex tape. A judge handed Benzema a one-year suspended jail term and ordered him to pay a â¬75,000 (Â£63,000; $84,000) fine. Benzema, 33, was one of five people put on trial last month over an attempt to extort Frenchman Mathieu Valbuena. The scandal has stunned the football community in France and both players lost their national team places. The case dates back to June 2015, when the two footballers were at a French training camp. At the camp, Benzema put pressure on Valbuena to pay off the blackmailers, whom he had conspired with to act as an intermediary, prosecutors said. Benzema has always denied the allegations and insisted he was only trying to help Valbuena get rid of the compromising video. Benzema has since returned to the France team and is expected to start for Real Madrid on Wednesday night when they play FC Sheriff Tiraspol in the Champions League. Benzema was not present in court in Versailles for the verdict, nor was Valbuena, who plays for Greek club Olympiakos. Four of Benzema's co-defendants in the trial were also found guilty on Wednesday. They were handed jail sentences ranging from 18 months suspended to two-and-a-half years in prison. Benzema's lawyers said they would appeal his conviction. ""The reaction is ultimately an angry one to this judgment which is perfectly contradictory,"" his lawyer, Sylvain Cormier, told reporters outside court. But when delivering the verdict, the judge said Benzema had ""implicated himself personally, through subterfuge and lies, to convince his teammate to submit to the blackmail"". Benzema's lawyers said the French footballer would appeal the conviction Benzema made a surprise comeback to the French national team in May, five years after he was exiled from the side when the allegations first surfaced in 2015. But last month, the French football federation said a guilty verdict would not necessarily jeopardise Benzema's position in the national side. Since being called back by France manager Didier Deschamps, Benzema has been in prolific form, scoring nine times in 13 games for his country. He's also scored 10 goals this season for his club, Real Madrid, who are yet to comment on the verdict. For his performances on the pitch, Benzema was named a candidate for the Ballon d'Or footballer of the year award which will be announced next week. Analysis by BBC Sport's European football expert Guillem Balague There are two ways of dealing with the private lives of footballers and we have seen that in the case of Benzema. The story hasn't been given much importance in the sports media in Spain, but it has been hugely prominent in France. In France, Benzema will be questioned professionally because of his behaviour off the pitch, much more so than in Spain. In France, private lives are more relevant, not just in sport but also in politics. Benzema - who is of Algerian descent - has suggested there was an element of racism in this case. He felt that, had he been a white player, he would have been treated differently. But none of it affects his status at Real Madrid, at all. In Spain, there is a view that your private life is your private life, and there has even been a strong campaign in the Madrid media for him to win the Ballon d'Or. It began in 2015 when Valbuena, now 37, asked a man in Marseille, Axel Angot, to upload the contents of his mobile phone to a new device. Mr Angot found sexually explicit material on the phone. He and another defendant in the trial, Mustapha Zouaoui, were accused of trying to blackmail Valbuena by threatening to make the tape public. Mr Zouaoui told reporters he had shared the tape, but there had never been an attempt to extort money. Valbuena described being approached by another defendant, Younes Houass, who told the court he had warned the player about the issue without asking for money. Mathieu Valbuena and Karim Benzema (right) were both playing for France until the case emerged When the footballer went to the police, they set up a sting operation involving an undercover agent. Prosecutors said another defendant was then brought into the scam - Karim Zenati, who is a childhood friend of Benzema. At this point, Benzema was asked to act as a ""middleman"" in the scheme, prosecutors said. In October 2015, Benzema approached his fellow France player in his room at the national team's training camp. Benzema said he had merely tried to help his teammate dispose of the x-rated video, warning him: ""Be careful, Math, they're big, big thugs."" He then offered to put him touch with someone he could trust - his childhood friend, Mr Zenati. Benzema returned to the French national team in May after being exiled for five years Police were by now tapping their phone calls and recorded Benzema telling his friend: ""He's not taking us seriously."" Mr Zenati is said to have replied: ""We're here to sort it out; if he doesn't want that he'll have to deal with the piranhas."" Giving evidence at the start of the trial, Valbuena said he had never considered handing over money to stop the video getting out. Unlike his former teammate, Valbuena has not played for France since the scandal began. Testifying during the trial, Valbuena told the court that football was his life. ""I knew if that video got out it would make things difficult with the French team,"" he said.

"This video can not be played PMQs: Sir Keir Starmer claims the PM has devised a ""working class dementia tax"" to pay for health and social care costs Boris Johnson batted away opposition calls for him to stand down and defended himself against accusations of ""broken promises"" at PMQs. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer challenged the PM on social care funding, rail investment and tax. Picking up on reports of Tory disquiet after the PM's chaotic speech to business leaders, he asked: ""Is everything OK, prime minister?"" The PM said the government was ""delivering for...working people"". The Conservative benches were packed for the exchanges, in contrast to last week's session. ""I see they have turned up this week prime minister,"" said Sir Keir, prompting uproar on all sides and an intervention from Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who ordered MPs to calm down. Several MPs have told the BBC that they were urged by party managers, via text or phone call, to attend Prime Minister's Questions to support Mr Johnson. PM accused of 'shambolic' speech to business group Is everything OK for Boris Johnson? Rail upgrade plans 'missed opportunity' for North Johnson: Peppa Pig World 'very much my kind of place' Sir Keir repeatedly claimed the government's plans for social care funding broke a Conservative manifesto pledge that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""He's picked the pockets of working people to protect the estates of the wealthiest,"" said the Labour leader, adding: ""How could he have devised a working class dementia tax?"" Mr Johnson said homes will not be included in the cap on costs, adding that Labour did not have a plan to solve the problem. The prime minister said the government's ""huge investment"" in health and social care meant people will be able to insure themselves against the ""catastrophic cost"" of suffering from diseases such as dementia. Sir Keir also accused Mr Johnson of breaking a promise not to raise taxes - and to deliver a ""rail revolution"" in the North of England, despite now cancelling the northern leg of HS2. ""Who knows if he'll make it to the next election, but if he does, how can he expect anyone to take his promises seriously?,"" asked the Labour leader. Mr Johnson insisted there would be a rail revolution, and claimed the government was spending Â£96bn on upgrading links. And he said Sir Keir had campaigned against HS2 - which runs through his Holborn and St Pancras constituency - adding that he had backed the new high speed rail link even though it affected his own constituents, because it was in the national interest. ""How can they trust that man?"" he asked. Talk of ousting the PM seems fanciful. He has a track record of bouncing back from adversity. But it is worth noting that loud cheers from a leader's own side does not mean that underlying concerns have evaporated. The former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, was greeted by regular, co-ordinated standing ovations at his party conference, but that didn't prevent MPs quietly but definitively submitting letters of no confidence. The mood at the moment though seems to be for the current Conservative leader to get a grip rather than to get out. While Mr Johnson was on the back foot at PMQs, he nonetheless managed to step up attacks on the Labour leader too - the most effective of which was to suggest that HS2 would never have been built at all if Sir Keir Starmer had got his way. Boris Johnson's premiership has looked juddery recently, but hasn't yet been derailed. The SNP's Westminster Leader, Ian Blackford, also seized on reports of Tory disquiet with the PM's recent performance, accusing him of ""floundering in failure"" and asking him if he had ""considered calling it a day"". ""In the real world, people are suffering a Tory cost of living crisis, Brexit is hitting the economy hard, but the prime minister can't even give a coherent speech to business leaders,"" he added. He asked why Mr Johnson was ""clinging on when he quite clearly isn't up to the job"". The prime minister said the British public wanted to hear less about politics and more about what the government is doing ""for the people of Scotland"". Earlier, deputy PM Dominic Raab praised Mr Johnson's ""ebullient, bouncy, optimistic, Tiggerish character"", saying it ""livens up"" his speeches. He said there was a ""steeliness"" to the prime minister, adding: ""We work as a team"", and he dismissed the criticism as Westminster ""tittle tattle"".

""I was a bit hazy about what I would find at Peppa Pig World, but I loved it,"" he told the conference. ""Peppa Pig World is very much my kind of place. ""It has very safe streets, discipline in schools, a heavy emphasis on mass transit systems I noticed, even if they are a bit stereotypical about Daddy Pig.""

"Scotland's prisons have seen a surge in drug seizures during the pandemic, new figures show. There has been an 18-fold increase in stoppages of so-called street Valium in the space of a year, while seizures of psychoactive substances have nearly doubled. Illegal substances often get inside prisons throughdrug-soaked clothing or lettersbefore being smoked. The Scottish Prison Service said it has invested in new ways to detect drugs. One expert said more prisoners may have turned to drugs during the pandemic as family visits were stopped. Six ways to tackle Scotland's drugs crisis Scottish prisons 'awash' with synthetic drugs linked to violence FM to examine prison drug letter claims A spate of drug overdoses at HMP Shotts in North Lanarkshire in recent weeks have been linked to new psychoactive substances. These substances, such as synthetic cannabinoid ""Spice"", and ""street"" benzodiazepines, such as Etizolam, are now thought to be the dominant drugs in prisons. One serving officer at a large Scottish jail, speaking to BBC Scotland anonymously, said: ""The prisoners don't know the strength of this stuff from one batch to another, so it's proper Russian roulette territory. ""Detection is difficult when its sold in postage-stamp sized quantities and then cut up even smaller. ""It's hard to deal with at times, especially when prisoners are so unpredictable, but you have to remember it's no different to what you are seeing on schemes up and down the country."" Etizolam has been dubbed the ""blue plague"" as a result of the number of drugs-related deaths it is involved in Figures released to BBC Scotland under freedom of information laws show there were 229 recoveries of suspected psychoactive substances across the prison estate in June 2020. In June of this year there were 421 such seizures. For Etizolam, there were 11 recoveries by wardens in jails across Scotland in June 2020 but 198 in the same month this year. The quantities of drugs involved in each incident was not released. Etizolam is a benzodiazepine known as fake Valium and is many times stronger than prescription drugs. These substances are a major factor in Scotland's wider drugs deaths problem and this is also reflected in prison fatalities. Of the 20 drug-related deaths in Scotland's prisons since 2016, 12 involved psychoactive substances and six Etizolam. David Mackie, a retired sheriff and chairman of penal reform charity Howard League Scotland, warned the drug trade in jails was having an ""impact way beyond the walls of the prison"". He said: ""If somebody is in prison being supplied with drugs which are costing three to five times what they cost outside, how is that person paying for that drugs? Because he won't have the money in prison. ""It is almost certain that person's family may be put under pressure to either raise the money and pay for the drugs or do something for the organised crime groups."" Mr Mackie added that for ""those participating in the trade it seems to be quite a safe and lucrative occupation, there seems to be little risk of prosecution."" A spokesman for the SPS said it treats the issue of smuggling drugs into prisons ""very seriously"" and the service had ""invested in technology to better detect suspicious substances and work closely with partner agencies to garner relevant intelligence"". He added: ""The particular problem of psychoactive substances is impacting on the whole of our society, not just the prison system. These substances are sometimes difficult to detect and their use can be lethal. ""We have over the last few years pointed out on many occasions, to those in our care, the dangers of using such substances. If we suspect that an item many contain such materials, then we quarantine them and do not allow them to enter a prison."" Joey McGuiness says drugs are moved about prisons ""in the blink of an eye"" so it makes detection difficult Joey McGuiness is a recovering cocaine addict being supported by the Glasgow-based Sisco charity which delivers drug recovery services for people in and out of the prison system. The 34-year-old spent five weeks in the city's Barlinnie prison and said most of the people he met there had drug addiction issues. ""It's very easy to get drugs in prison,"" he says. ""I used to see people in the morning and they were alright but by lunchtime they were a completely different person. Joey admits he was tempted to take drugs in prison ""to escape"" but stopped himself as he was grappling with taking the first step to ending a cocaine problem which he says had taken over his life. A near fatal-overdose months after leaving prison in 2019 was the moment when Joey first admitted he was a cocaine addict and began his road to recovery. Now 10 months clean, Joey is enjoying life without drugs and repairing relationships with his family. ""My wee ma's proud of me today. First time I can say that,"" he says. ""When I used to go into my mum's house she used to have fear on her face but when I go in today it's a smile."" Leeh Howell, of Sisco, says Joey's experience of drugs in prison is common and thinks the problems have got worse since the start of the Covid pandemic. He said: ""It's not really stopped substances getting into the prison. ""I think with things like family visits being stopped, all the feelings and thoughts that they've been sitting with have been amplified and it's making it that much harder to not take substances.""

The condition causes discoloration or lesions around the toes and researchers believe that it is caused by excess interferon, a protein which the body uses to fight infection. Rodgers told reporters after Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings that the condition is ""very, very painful"". The Green Bay Packers quarterback prompted controversy over his vaccination status when he tested positive for Covid-19 and entered a 10-day quarantine period - the minimum amount of time an unvaccinated player is asked to quarantine under NFL rules. However, in August he had seemed to indicate that he had received the jab, telling reporters that he was ""immunised"". He later said that he had been referring to his antibody levels and that he was treating his infection using the drug ivermectin, on the advice of podcast host Joe Rogan. Vladimir Putin has said he ""cannot understand"" the levels of vaccine hesitancy among Russians Russian officials say they have started to target people spreading anti-vaccine information online as the country aims to energise its sluggish vaccine rollout. The state healthcare regulator, Roszdravnadzor, said it had instructed its regional branches to report people - including
medical professionals - who ""deliberately spread false
information about the dangers of vaccination"". The agency told Reuters that it had already reported more
than 30 anti-vaccine campaigners, who could face fines of around Â£19,000 and up to five years in prison under ""fake news"" laws passed last year. Russia has struggled with widespread vaccine hesitancy and just 37% of people are fully vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly pleaded with people to take the jab. Last month he told state TV that he ""couldn't understand"" why people were refusing to come forward for the shot. âWe have a reliable and efficient vaccine,"" he said. ""The vaccine really reduces the risks of illness, grave complications and death.""  France is set to announce fresh measures on Thursday to curb the spread of Covid-19, as infection rates surge domestically and across Europe. However, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says there are no plans to introduce a new lockdown as some EU countries have done, the Reuters news agency reports. Speaking at a news conference, Attal says the government is looking to avoid major restrictions on public life. He explains it is instead looking to use other means of suppressing transmission like stricter social distancing, increasing the number and pace of booster jabs and tightening vaccine passport rules. Government spokesman Gabriel Attal says more detail will be announced tomorrow following a meeting of France's cabinet ""We must protect the French people by building on what we have, to save the end-of-year festivities and get through the winter as well as possible,"" the minister says. France's vaccine passport - known as the health pass - allows entry to cafes, restaurants, museums, cinemas and other public places for those who are fully vaccinated or have recently tested negative. The seven-day average of cases exceeded 20,000 for the first time since August on Tuesday, while coronavirus patients in intensive care rose to 1,455. Attal declined to specify what measures may be announced on Thursday, but the government is expected to follow the advice of France's health regulator to allow anyone over-40 to access a third dose of a Covid vaccine. Slovakia will limit
movement as part of a two-week lockdown in an attempt to stem a fast rise in
Covid-19 cases, the government has announced. Slovakians will only be permitted to travel for essential shopping,
work, school or medical visits, government ministers said on Wednesday. They will assess the situation after 10 days, although any easing of restrictions will be limited to those fully vaccinated against the virus. The decision to return to a lockdown comes after the government imposed new restrictions on unvaccinated people earlier this week in an attempt to push up vaccinations. Slovakia has the third-lowest vaccination rate in the EU. Less than 50% of people in the country of 5.5 million have been vaccinated and the vast majority of people in hospital are unvaccinated.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin said vaccinations should be voluntary ""on the whole"" Russia is registering a version of the country's Sputnik-V vaccine for children aged between 12 and 17, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. Ms Golikova has told a government meeting on Covid-19 that registration of the new treatment, named Gam-Covid-Vac, would take place later in the day, state news agency Tass reports. She said it was hoped the vaccine would enter civilian circulation in Russia from the end of December. The new vaccine will only be given to children under 15 with the consent of their parents or the child's legal representative, and to children over 15 only with their own consent, Ms Golikova said. Speaking at the same meeting, President Vladimir Putin urged the government to pay attention to the need for vaccines for children, but voiced scepticism about compulsory vaccination. ""On the whole, inoculations should be voluntary - specially for children,"" Tass quoted him as saying. There have been 43,676 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours,according to the latest data,external. This means there have been 303,071 people who have tested positive for the virus in the last seven days, - up by 11.1% on the week before. There have also been 149 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, taking the weekly total to 926 - a 9.4% fall on the previous seven-day period. Around 80.4% of people over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated, while 88.4% have had a single dose of a Covid jab and 27.8% have received a third booster dose. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Europe is once again at the epicentre of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, said more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week. The organisation said the highly infectious Delta variant has increased the risk of transmission among vaccinated people. Dr Tedros warned against a ""false sense of security"" created by the vaccines, stressing that those who are vaccinated can still get and spread the virus. Those who are vaccinated must therefore continue to take precautions, such as mask wearing, social distancing, avoiding crowds, and meeting others outside or in well-ventilated rooms, he said. Dr Tedros stressed, however, that the vaccines do reduce the risk of severe illness and death. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said a decision on further restrictions would be announced on Friday The Dutch government looks set to announce a raft of new coronavirus restrictions after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus. Officials announced on Wednesday that more than 23,700 Covid-19 infections had been recorded in 24 hours, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. It means that cases have jumped by more than 40% over the past week, despite more than 85% of Dutch people being fully vaccinated. Experts have warned that hospitals will reach full capacity in less than a week if new restrictions are not introduced. ""The
infection rate is higher than ever before"", Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said
in a letter to parliament on Wednesday. ""Hospital admissions
keep exceeding expectations and we have not seen the worst
yet."" He
said the government's panel of health experts would provide
fresh policy advice by Thursday and that a decision would
follow on Friday. Plans to restrict
access to many public places to people who have
been vaccinated or have recently recovered from COVID-19 promptedthree nights of riotinglast week and more than 170 people have been arrested. Boris Johnson was criticised earlier this month for not wearing a mask during a visit to a hospital Downing Street has insisted that the prime minister ""follows all Covid rules"" when asked about reports that he attended a performance of Macbeth without wearing a mask. The Guardian said another audience member saw Boris Johnson without his mask on at all times during Tuesday's play at the Almeida Theatre in north London. A different audience member saw him maskless in a public area of the venue, the paper said. Mask-wearing rules were dropped in England in the summer, but some transport networks, shops and venues - including the Almeida - still ask for them to be worn. Earlier this month, Mr Johnson was criticised for not wearing a mask during a hospital tour and while sitting next to 95-year-old environmental campaigner Sir David Attenborough at the COP26 climate summit. Protesters carry a banner reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" through Kyiv Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv to protest against Covid measures and the country's mandatory vaccination programme for some workers. Protesters carried placards reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" and ""say 'no' to lies"". Some were also demanding the release of anti-vaccine activist Ostap Stakhiv, who was arrested in the city of Lviv last week accused of undermining public health through alleged links with Russia. Mr Stakhiv has denied all the allegations against him. Ukraine, which has recently seen a rise in vaccination numbers after imposing restrictions in public places, is still struggling to persuade a large number of its citizens who remain hesitant to receive their shots.

Dr Colin Morrison, a co-director at Children's parliament, says there could be a ""legacy of disengagement"" for some pupils who lacked electronic devices to access online learning materials - the consequences of  which might be ""difficult to address"". Speaking to MSPs at the Education, Children and Young People Committee at Holyrood, Dr Morrison says many children the charity works with ""were just gone to the education system"" in the three or four months from March last year. He adds: ""What I also know is many head teachers we knew who love and care for their children were literally scrambling about and delivering devices every day, knocking on doors and making sure people had food, never mind digital devices."" Last year the Scottish government pledged 50,000 devices would be given to children in need - later rising to 70,000 - while the SNP promised an age-appropriate device for every Scottish school student as part of their manifesto ahead of May's election. But Dr Morrison explains that some children are still without what they need, warning the loss of engagement for some of them could have ""long-term consequences"" for their learning. ""If there's a gap in attainment there's certainly a gap in how children are using that digital space to learn. ""For some children that's just taken off and they're blossoming with it, for other children there's a legacy of disengagement that's going to be difficult to address,"" he argues.

The announcement comes as the government launched its vaccination campaign for children aged 5-11 this week. Around 1.2 million children will be inoculated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine over the coming months. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had his nine-year-old son vaccinated in front of media on Tuesday and urged other lawmakers to set a similar example.

"Richard Spencer, who coined the term ""alt-right"", was among the defendants A US jury has awarded $25m (Â£19m) in damages against the organisers of a deadly far-right rally in August 2017. The defendants were found liable in four out of six counts over the bloodshed at the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. The civil lawsuit was filed by nine people who suffered physical or emotional injuries in the rally. A woman was killed and dozens were hurt after an avowed neo-Nazi drove a car into counter-protesters. In court, the jury awarded $500,000 in punitive damages against 12 defendants, and $1m against five white supremacist organisations. Punitive damages are awarded at a court's discretion to punish a defendant for conduct judged to be especially harmful. A total of $12m in punitive damages was also imposed against the driver of the car in the fatal incident. The jury of 11 deliberated for over three days following nearly a month of testimony at the trial in Charlottesville. The two federal conspiracy charges that jurors could not agree on alleged that the defendants had plotted to commit racially motivated violence. Roberta Kaplan, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said they plan to refile the lawsuit so a new jury can decide on those two charges. The legal action alleged that the defendants ""brought with them to Charlottesville the imagery of the Holocaust, of slavery, of Jim Crow and of fascism"". ""They also brought with them semi-automatic weapons, pistols, mace, rods, armour, shields and torches,"" the lawsuit said. This video can not be played The statue of General Robert E Lee was towed away from Market Street Park, Charlottesville The defendants include several prominent figures in America's white nationalist and far-right sphere. Among those found liable in the case were Jason Kessler, the rally's main organiser, and Richard Spencer, who came up with the term ""alt-right"" and spoke at the event. Another defendant, Christopher Cantwell, became famous as ""the crying Nazi"" after an emotional YouTube video he posted once the rally went viral. The lawsuit largely rested on an 1871 law passed after the US Civil War to protect black Americans, following their emancipation from slavery, from the Ku Klux Klan. US white supremacists face a legal reckoning It allows private citizens to sue others believed to have committed civil rights violations - with the condition that the plaintiffs must prove that they conspired to do so. Attorneys for the plaintiffs also collected more than 5.3 terabytes of data to help them make their case, including social media posts and chat exchanges. The rally began as a protest against the removal of a Confederate statue. Then-President Donald Trump came under fire after saying afterwards that there were ""very fine people on both sides"". In the same speech he also said neo-Nazis and white nationalists ""should be condemned totally"". A counter-protester, 32-year-old Heather Heyer, was killed when James Alex Fields drove his car into a crowd. He was sentenced to life in prison in June 2019. The civil case included testimony from survivors of the incident. ""It was a complete terror scene. It was blood everywhere,"" one of the plaintiffs, Marissa Blair, testified. ""I was terrified."" The defendants sought to distance themselves from the violence and maintained that there was no conspiracy. They said none of them knew Fields and so they could not have predicted he would ram a vehicle into a crowd. ""None of these defendants could have foreseen what James Fields did,"" Mr Kessler's attorney said. The defendants argued that their racist views were protected by the First Amendment of the US Constitution, which guarantees free speech, and that their rhetoric before the rally was just bluster. They also said they had acted in self-defence and that the police bore responsibility for failing to keep the two sides from fighting. Court testimony, however, suggested that some of the organisers could have foreseen the violence. Former extremist Samantha Froelich, for example, testified that the idea of using vehicles to target counter-protesters was discussed ahead of the event. Attorneys for the plaintiffs have said they hope the lawsuit acts as a deterrent against further extremist rallies.

"World Health Organization says more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week It warns against a ""false sense of security"" created by vaccines and stresses the need to be cautious Some 1.5 million Covid deaths have already been recorded in the WHO's Europe region of 53 countries The EU's public health agency says European countries should consider vaccine boosters for all adults Poland is warning that restrictions could be reintroduced if its infection rates don't start to fall The danger of a future UK pandemic is as serious as threats to the UK's defences, an ex-vaccines tsar says Netherlands considering new curbs after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus Edited by Paul Gribben Thank you for joining us today. As our live coverage comes to an end, here are some of Thursday's key developments in the pandemic: Today's live page was edited by Paul Gribben, and written by Dulcie Lee, Mal Siret, Adam Durbin and Matt Murphy. NFL star Aaron Rodgers has told US media he has developed a painful case of ""Covid toe"" after a brush with the virus earlier this month. The condition causes discoloration or lesions around the toes and researchers believe that it is caused by excess interferon, a protein which the body uses to fight infection. Rodgers told reporters after Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings that the condition is ""very, very painful"". The Green Bay Packers quarterback prompted controversy over his vaccination status when he tested positive for Covid-19 and entered a 10-day quarantine period - the minimum amount of time an unvaccinated player is asked to quarantine under NFL rules. However, in August he had seemed to indicate that he had received the jab, telling reporters that he was ""immunised"". He later said that he had been referring to his antibody levels and that he was treating his infection using the drug ivermectin, on the advice of podcast host Joe Rogan. Vladimir Putin has said he ""cannot understand"" the levels of vaccine hesitancy among Russians Russian officials say they have started to target people spreading anti-vaccine information online as the country aims to energise its sluggish vaccine rollout. The state healthcare regulator, Roszdravnadzor, said it had instructed its regional branches to report people - including
medical professionals - who ""deliberately spread false
information about the dangers of vaccination"". The agency told Reuters that it had already reported more
than 30 anti-vaccine campaigners, who could face fines of around Â£19,000 and up to five years in prison under ""fake news"" laws passed last year. Russia has struggled with widespread vaccine hesitancy and just 37% of people are fully vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly pleaded with people to take the jab. Last month he told state TV that he ""couldn't understand"" why people were refusing to come forward for the shot. âWe have a reliable and efficient vaccine,"" he said. ""The vaccine really reduces the risks of illness, grave complications and death.""  France is set to announce fresh measures on Thursday to curb the spread of Covid-19, as infection rates surge domestically and across Europe. However, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says there are no plans to introduce a new lockdown as some EU countries have done, the Reuters news agency reports. Speaking at a news conference, Attal says the government is looking to avoid major restrictions on public life. He explains it is instead looking to use other means of suppressing transmission like stricter social distancing, increasing the number and pace of booster jabs and tightening vaccine passport rules. Government spokesman Gabriel Attal says more detail will be announced tomorrow following a meeting of France's cabinet ""We must protect the French people by building on what we have, to save the end-of-year festivities and get through the winter as well as possible,"" the minister says. France's vaccine passport - known as the health pass - allows entry to cafes, restaurants, museums, cinemas and other public places for those who are fully vaccinated or have recently tested negative. The seven-day average of cases exceeded 20,000 for the first time since August on Tuesday, while coronavirus patients in intensive care rose to 1,455. Attal declined to specify what measures may be announced on Thursday, but the government is expected to follow the advice of France's health regulator to allow anyone over-40 to access a third dose of a Covid vaccine. Slovakia will limit
movement as part of a two-week lockdown in an attempt to stem a fast rise in
Covid-19 cases, the government has announced. Slovakians will only be permitted to travel for essential shopping,
work, school or medical visits, government ministers said on Wednesday. They will assess the situation after 10 days, although any easing of restrictions will be limited to those fully vaccinated against the virus. The decision to return to a lockdown comes after the government imposed new restrictions on unvaccinated people earlier this week in an attempt to push up vaccinations. Slovakia has the third-lowest vaccination rate in the EU. Less than 50% of people in the country of 5.5 million have been vaccinated and the vast majority of people in hospital are unvaccinated.  Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent This video can not be played Police fire warning shots at Covid protesters in the Netherlands The first suspects charged in connection with theriots in Rotterdamearlier this week over the partial lockdown called in the Netherlands have been appearing in court. A 26-year-old woman from Spijkenisse (a city that is part of the greater Rotterdam area) was found guilty of throwing stones at police vehicles. She was jailed for five months - two of them conditional - and ordered to pay 1,000 euros (Â£840) for damage to the cars. The second person to appear in court was a 29-year-old man from Delft, who was given a five-month sentence and a one-year restraining order for a large part of Rotterdam. The sentencing comes on the day the Netherlands reports 23,789 new Covid cases - the biggest one-day increase on record. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent in Strasbourg President David-Maria Sassoli (centre) at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Walking
into the European Parliament there are officials standing ready to check your Covid ""status"". People queue, with phone apps open, to prove they've been
double-jabbed. Inside, everyone on the move is wearing masks. Yet it was only
on Friday that the president of the European Parliament David-Maria Sassoli confirmed
the return to ""hybrid"" proceedings. That means members can participate in
debates and votes remotely. As a result, the
parliament continues to be less busy and less buzzy than before. Having said
that, walking the halls and dropping into the cafes, there are still plenty of
face-to-face meetings going on. People chatting over a coffee, lunch or even a
drink in the evening. Sat down, the masks largely come off. One of those
moments where things seem a little more normal. But it's a normality that
people here again think could increasingly evaporate as winter sets in and Covid once again grips large parts of Europe.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin said vaccinations should be voluntary ""on the whole"" Russia is registering a version of the country's Sputnik-V vaccine for children aged between 12 and 17, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. Ms Golikova has told a government meeting on Covid-19 that registration of the new treatment, named Gam-Covid-Vac, would take place later in the day, state news agency Tass reports. She said it was hoped the vaccine would enter civilian circulation in Russia from the end of December. The new vaccine will only be given to children under 15 with the consent of their parents or the child's legal representative, and to children over 15 only with their own consent, Ms Golikova said. Speaking at the same meeting, President Vladimir Putin urged the government to pay attention to the need for vaccines for children, but voiced scepticism about compulsory vaccination. ""On the whole, inoculations should be voluntary - specially for children,"" Tass quoted him as saying. There have been 43,676 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours,according to the latest data,external. This means there have been 303,071 people who have tested positive for the virus in the last seven days, - up by 11.1% on the week before. There have also been 149 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, taking the weekly total to 926 - a 9.4% fall on the previous seven-day period. Around 80.4% of people over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated, while 88.4% have had a single dose of a Covid jab and 27.8% have received a third booster dose. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Europe is once again at the epicentre of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, said more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week. The organisation said the highly infectious Delta variant has increased the risk of transmission among vaccinated people. Dr Tedros warned against a ""false sense of security"" created by the vaccines, stressing that those who are vaccinated can still get and spread the virus. Those who are vaccinated must therefore continue to take precautions, such as mask wearing, social distancing, avoiding crowds, and meeting others outside or in well-ventilated rooms, he said. Dr Tedros stressed, however, that the vaccines do reduce the risk of severe illness and death. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said a decision on further restrictions would be announced on Friday The Dutch government looks set to announce a raft of new coronavirus restrictions after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus. Officials announced on Wednesday that more than 23,700 Covid-19 infections had been recorded in 24 hours, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. It means that cases have jumped by more than 40% over the past week, despite more than 85% of Dutch people being fully vaccinated. Experts have warned that hospitals will reach full capacity in less than a week if new restrictions are not introduced. ""The
infection rate is higher than ever before"", Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said
in a letter to parliament on Wednesday. ""Hospital admissions
keep exceeding expectations and we have not seen the worst
yet."" He
said the government's panel of health experts would provide
fresh policy advice by Thursday and that a decision would
follow on Friday. Plans to restrict
access to many public places to people who have
been vaccinated or have recently recovered from COVID-19 promptedthree nights of riotinglast week and more than 170 people have been arrested. Boris Johnson was criticised earlier this month for not wearing a mask during a visit to a hospital Downing Street has insisted that the prime minister ""follows all Covid rules"" when asked about reports that he attended a performance of Macbeth without wearing a mask. The Guardian said another audience member saw Boris Johnson without his mask on at all times during Tuesday's play at the Almeida Theatre in north London. A different audience member saw him maskless in a public area of the venue, the paper said. Mask-wearing rules were dropped in England in the summer, but some transport networks, shops and venues - including the Almeida - still ask for them to be worn. Earlier this month, Mr Johnson was criticised for not wearing a mask during a hospital tour and while sitting next to 95-year-old environmental campaigner Sir David Attenborough at the COP26 climate summit. Protesters carry a banner reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" through Kyiv Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv to protest against Covid measures and the country's mandatory vaccination programme for some workers. Protesters carried placards reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" and ""say 'no' to lies"". Some were also demanding the release of anti-vaccine activist Ostap Stakhiv, who was arrested in the city of Lviv last week accused of undermining public health through alleged links with Russia. Mr Stakhiv has denied all the allegations against him. Ukraine, which has recently seen a rise in vaccination numbers after imposing restrictions in public places, is still struggling to persuade a large number of its citizens who remain hesitant to receive their shots. The country is experiencing a new surge in coronavirus cases as the highly transmissible Delta variant sweeps across Europe. Ukraine today reported 14,325 new daily Covid cases and 595 coronavirus-related deaths. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent The Greens backed the government on vaccine passports when case numbers were rising As we heard yesterday, the Scottish government has decided not to expand its vaccine passport scheme to more venues. It's been branded a ""U-turn"" by opposition parties. So what was it that changed their minds? Read the full analysishere.  Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Taiwan hasnot recorded any local Covid cases since 4 November,external, according to official data. Also, according to the national news agency CNA, the share of fully vaccinated people in the country is close to reaching 50%. More
than 11.6 million people have received two vaccine doses in Taiwan - 49.8% of
the population. More than 77% have received at least one vaccine dose. The Central Epidemic Command Centre is conditionally relaxing Covid restrictions ""for attending funerals or visiting relatives for people in home isolation/quarantine,external"". On Thursday, it will begin to offer recipients of
the AstraZeneca vaccine second doses of either Pfizer or Moderna.
This was the first vaccine that was made available to residents in Taiwan, and
the Taipei Times says thatpeople can apply online for these ""mix and match bookings"",external. The Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna, and
locally-made Medigen vaccine are available there. The latter has gained some international
recognition â Taiwan News says that Palau now allows visitors to enter if they
have received the Taiwan-made vaccine. However, it reports that a man has
been refused transit to Palau from the US pacific island territory of Guam, asthe vaccine is not yet recognised there,external.

Many Scottish children struggling in education before Covid ""fell off the radar"" in the first few months of the pandemic, a children rights charity has told politicians. Dr Colin Morrison, a co-director at Children's parliament, says there could be a ""legacy of disengagement"" for some pupils who lacked electronic devices to access online learning materials - the consequences of  which might be ""difficult to address"". Speaking to MSPs at the Education, Children and Young People Committee at Holyrood, Dr Morrison says many children the charity works with ""were just gone to the education system"" in the three or four months from March last year. He adds: ""What I also know is many head teachers we knew who love and care for their children were literally scrambling about and delivering devices every day, knocking on doors and making sure people had food, never mind digital devices."" Last year the Scottish government pledged 50,000 devices would be given to children in need - later rising to 70,000 - while the SNP promised an age-appropriate device for every Scottish school student as part of their manifesto ahead of May's election. But Dr Morrison explains that some children are still without what they need, warning the loss of engagement for some of them could have ""long-term consequences"" for their learning. ""If there's a gap in attainment there's certainly a gap in how children are using that digital space to learn. ""For some children that's just taken off and they're blossoming with it, for other children there's a legacy of disengagement that's going to be difficult to address,"" he argues. London Underground workers are being put in potentially dangerous situations as mask-wearing is now being ""openly ignored"" on a large scale, unions are warning. The train drivers' union Aslef says there has been a noticeable dip in travellers wearing masks on the Tube - even though it's a requirement. And Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT), says: ""It's no wonder there's talk of new restrictions and controls if we can't even deliver the basics."" Transport for London - which runs the Tube network - said it has 500 enforcement officers to ask customers to comply with its mask rules. It says it has refused entry to 408 people and asked 126 to leave services since national rules were relaxed in July. Read more:What are the rules on mask wearing now? Prime Minister Naftali Bennett watches as his nine-year-old son is vaccinated Nearly 40% of Israel's Covid-19 patients are below the age of 12, the country's Health Ministry has said. Officials said that of 6,505 Israelis currently infected with the disease, 2,574 of those are children. The announcement comes as the government launched its vaccination campaign for children aged 5-11 this week. Around 1.2 million children will be inoculated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine over the coming months. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had his nine-year-old son vaccinated in front of media on Tuesday and urged other lawmakers to set a similar example. Israel recently emerged from a fourth Covid-19 wave which saw daily infections peak at more than 8,000 cases per day. But daily infections have been relatively low for the last few weeks and million of people have now received a third booster jab. But despite the country's progress, the government has extended ""Green Pass"" regulations meant to restrict access to certain venues to vaccinated or recovered individuals for another two weeks.

Slovakia has the third-lowest vaccination rate in the EU. Less than 50% of people in the country of 5.5 million have been vaccinated and the vast majority of people in hospital are unvaccinated.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin said vaccinations should be voluntary ""on the whole"" Russia is registering a version of the country's Sputnik-V vaccine for children aged between 12 and 17, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. Ms Golikova has told a government meeting on Covid-19 that registration of the new treatment, named Gam-Covid-Vac, would take place later in the day, state news agency Tass reports. She said it was hoped the vaccine would enter civilian circulation in Russia from the end of December. The new vaccine will only be given to children under 15 with the consent of their parents or the child's legal representative, and to children over 15 only with their own consent, Ms Golikova said. Speaking at the same meeting, President Vladimir Putin urged the government to pay attention to the need for vaccines for children, but voiced scepticism about compulsory vaccination. ""On the whole, inoculations should be voluntary - specially for children,"" Tass quoted him as saying. There have been 43,676 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours,according to the latest data,external. This means there have been 303,071 people who have tested positive for the virus in the last seven days, - up by 11.1% on the week before. There have also been 149 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, taking the weekly total to 926 - a 9.4% fall on the previous seven-day period. Around 80.4% of people over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated, while 88.4% have had a single dose of a Covid jab and 27.8% have received a third booster dose. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Europe is once again at the epicentre of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, said more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week. The organisation said the highly infectious Delta variant has increased the risk of transmission among vaccinated people. Dr Tedros warned against a ""false sense of security"" created by the vaccines, stressing that those who are vaccinated can still get and spread the virus. Those who are vaccinated must therefore continue to take precautions, such as mask wearing, social distancing, avoiding crowds, and meeting others outside or in well-ventilated rooms, he said. Dr Tedros stressed, however, that the vaccines do reduce the risk of severe illness and death. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said a decision on further restrictions would be announced on Friday The Dutch government looks set to announce a raft of new coronavirus restrictions after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus. Officials announced on Wednesday that more than 23,700 Covid-19 infections had been recorded in 24 hours, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. It means that cases have jumped by more than 40% over the past week, despite more than 85% of Dutch people being fully vaccinated. Experts have warned that hospitals will reach full capacity in less than a week if new restrictions are not introduced. ""The
infection rate is higher than ever before"", Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said
in a letter to parliament on Wednesday. ""Hospital admissions
keep exceeding expectations and we have not seen the worst
yet."" He
said the government's panel of health experts would provide
fresh policy advice by Thursday and that a decision would
follow on Friday. Plans to restrict
access to many public places to people who have
been vaccinated or have recently recovered from COVID-19 promptedthree nights of riotinglast week and more than 170 people have been arrested. Boris Johnson was criticised earlier this month for not wearing a mask during a visit to a hospital Downing Street has insisted that the prime minister ""follows all Covid rules"" when asked about reports that he attended a performance of Macbeth without wearing a mask. The Guardian said another audience member saw Boris Johnson without his mask on at all times during Tuesday's play at the Almeida Theatre in north London. A different audience member saw him maskless in a public area of the venue, the paper said. Mask-wearing rules were dropped in England in the summer, but some transport networks, shops and venues - including the Almeida - still ask for them to be worn. Earlier this month, Mr Johnson was criticised for not wearing a mask during a hospital tour and while sitting next to 95-year-old environmental campaigner Sir David Attenborough at the COP26 climate summit. Protesters carry a banner reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" through Kyiv Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv to protest against Covid measures and the country's mandatory vaccination programme for some workers. Protesters carried placards reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" and ""say 'no' to lies"". Some were also demanding the release of anti-vaccine activist Ostap Stakhiv, who was arrested in the city of Lviv last week accused of undermining public health through alleged links with Russia. Mr Stakhiv has denied all the allegations against him. Ukraine, which has recently seen a rise in vaccination numbers after imposing restrictions in public places, is still struggling to persuade a large number of its citizens who remain hesitant to receive their shots.

Many Scottish children struggling in education before Covid ""fell off the radar"" in the first few months of the pandemic, a children rights charity has told politicians. Dr Colin Morrison, a co-director at Children's parliament, says there could be a ""legacy of disengagement"" for some pupils who lacked electronic devices to access online learning materials - the consequences of  which might be ""difficult to address"". Speaking to MSPs at the Education, Children and Young People Committee at Holyrood, Dr Morrison says many children the charity works with ""were just gone to the education system"" in the three or four months from March last year. He adds: ""What I also know is many head teachers we knew who love and care for their children were literally scrambling about and delivering devices every day, knocking on doors and making sure people had food, never mind digital devices."" Last year the Scottish government pledged 50,000 devices would be given to children in need - later rising to 70,000 - while the SNP promised an age-appropriate device for every Scottish school student as part of their manifesto ahead of May's election. But Dr Morrison explains that some children are still without what they need, warning the loss of engagement for some of them could have ""long-term consequences"" for their learning. ""If there's a gap in attainment there's certainly a gap in how children are using that digital space to learn. ""For some children that's just taken off and they're blossoming with it, for other children there's a legacy of disengagement that's going to be difficult to address,"" he argues.

Prime Minister Naftali Bennett watches as his nine-year-old son is vaccinated Nearly 40% of Israel's Covid-19 patients are below the age of 12, the country's Health Ministry has said. Officials said that of 6,505 Israelis currently infected with the disease, 2,574 of those are children. The announcement comes as the government launched its vaccination campaign for children aged 5-11 this week. Around 1.2 million children will be inoculated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine over the coming months. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had his nine-year-old son vaccinated in front of media on Tuesday and urged other lawmakers to set a similar example. Israel recently emerged from a fourth Covid-19 wave which saw daily infections peak at more than 8,000 cases per day. But daily infections have been relatively low for the last few weeks and million of people have now received a third booster jab.

NFL star Aaron Rodgers has told US media he has developed a painful case of ""Covid toe"" after a brush with the virus earlier this month. The condition causes discoloration or lesions around the toes and researchers believe that it is caused by excess interferon, a protein which the body uses to fight infection. Rodgers told reporters after Sunday's loss to the Minnesota Vikings that the condition is ""very, very painful"". The Green Bay Packers quarterback prompted controversy over his vaccination status when he tested positive for Covid-19 and entered a 10-day quarantine period - the minimum amount of time an unvaccinated player is asked to quarantine under NFL rules. However, in August he had seemed to indicate that he had received the jab, telling reporters that he was ""immunised"". He later said that he had been referring to his antibody levels and that he was treating his infection using the drug ivermectin, on the advice of podcast host Joe Rogan. Vladimir Putin has said he ""cannot understand"" the levels of vaccine hesitancy among Russians Russian officials say they have started to target people spreading anti-vaccine information online as the country aims to energise its sluggish vaccine rollout. The state healthcare regulator, Roszdravnadzor, said it had instructed its regional branches to report people - including
medical professionals - who ""deliberately spread false
information about the dangers of vaccination"". The agency told Reuters that it had already reported more
than 30 anti-vaccine campaigners, who could face fines of around Â£19,000 and up to five years in prison under ""fake news"" laws passed last year. Russia has struggled with widespread vaccine hesitancy and just 37% of people are fully vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly pleaded with people to take the jab. Last month he told state TV that he ""couldn't understand"" why people were refusing to come forward for the shot. âWe have a reliable and efficient vaccine,"" he said. ""The vaccine really reduces the risks of illness, grave complications and death.""  France is set to announce fresh measures on Thursday to curb the spread of Covid-19, as infection rates surge domestically and across Europe. However, French government spokesman Gabriel Attal says there are no plans to introduce a new lockdown as some EU countries have done, the Reuters news agency reports. Speaking at a news conference, Attal says the government is looking to avoid major restrictions on public life. He explains it is instead looking to use other means of suppressing transmission like stricter social distancing, increasing the number and pace of booster jabs and tightening vaccine passport rules. Government spokesman Gabriel Attal says more detail will be announced tomorrow following a meeting of France's cabinet ""We must protect the French people by building on what we have, to save the end-of-year festivities and get through the winter as well as possible,"" the minister says. France's vaccine passport - known as the health pass - allows entry to cafes, restaurants, museums, cinemas and other public places for those who are fully vaccinated or have recently tested negative. The seven-day average of cases exceeded 20,000 for the first time since August on Tuesday, while coronavirus patients in intensive care rose to 1,455. Attal declined to specify what measures may be announced on Thursday, but the government is expected to follow the advice of France's health regulator to allow anyone over-40 to access a third dose of a Covid vaccine. Slovakia will limit
movement as part of a two-week lockdown in an attempt to stem a fast rise in
Covid-19 cases, the government has announced. Slovakians will only be permitted to travel for essential shopping,
work, school or medical visits, government ministers said on Wednesday. They will assess the situation after 10 days, although any easing of restrictions will be limited to those fully vaccinated against the virus. The decision to return to a lockdown comes after the government imposed new restrictions on unvaccinated people earlier this week in an attempt to push up vaccinations.

He explains it is instead looking to use other means of suppressing transmission like stricter social distancing, increasing the number and pace of booster jabs and tightening vaccine passport rules. Government spokesman Gabriel Attal says more detail will be announced tomorrow following a meeting of France's cabinet ""We must protect the French people by building on what we have, to save the end-of-year festivities and get through the winter as well as possible,"" the minister says. France's vaccine passport - known as the health pass - allows entry to cafes, restaurants, museums, cinemas and other public places for those who are fully vaccinated or have recently tested negative. The seven-day average of cases exceeded 20,000 for the first time since August on Tuesday, while coronavirus patients in intensive care rose to 1,455. Attal declined to specify what measures may be announced on Thursday, but the government is expected to follow the advice of France's health regulator to allow anyone over-40 to access a third dose of a Covid vaccine. Slovakia will limit
movement as part of a two-week lockdown in an attempt to stem a fast rise in
Covid-19 cases, the government has announced. Slovakians will only be permitted to travel for essential shopping,
work, school or medical visits, government ministers said on Wednesday. They will assess the situation after 10 days, although any easing of restrictions will be limited to those fully vaccinated against the virus. The decision to return to a lockdown comes after the government imposed new restrictions on unvaccinated people earlier this week in an attempt to push up vaccinations. Slovakia has the third-lowest vaccination rate in the EU. Less than 50% of people in the country of 5.5 million have been vaccinated and the vast majority of people in hospital are unvaccinated.

A 26-year-old woman from Spijkenisse (a city that is part of the greater Rotterdam area) was found guilty of throwing stones at police vehicles. She was jailed for five months - two of them conditional - and ordered to pay 1,000 euros (Â£840) for damage to the cars. The second person to appear in court was a 29-year-old man from Delft, who was given a five-month sentence and a one-year restraining order for a large part of Rotterdam. The sentencing comes on the day the Netherlands reports 23,789 new Covid cases - the biggest one-day increase on record. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent in Strasbourg President David-Maria Sassoli (centre) at the European Parliament in Strasbourg Walking
into the European Parliament there are officials standing ready to check your Covid ""status"". People queue, with phone apps open, to prove they've been
double-jabbed. Inside, everyone on the move is wearing masks. Yet it was only
on Friday that the president of the European Parliament David-Maria Sassoli confirmed
the return to ""hybrid"" proceedings. That means members can participate in
debates and votes remotely. As a result, the
parliament continues to be less busy and less buzzy than before. Having said
that, walking the halls and dropping into the cafes, there are still plenty of
face-to-face meetings going on. People chatting over a coffee, lunch or even a
drink in the evening. Sat down, the masks largely come off. One of those
moments where things seem a little more normal. But it's a normality that
people here again think could increasingly evaporate as winter sets in and Covid once again grips large parts of Europe.

BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russian President Vladimir Putin said vaccinations should be voluntary ""on the whole"" Russia is registering a version of the country's Sputnik-V vaccine for children aged between 12 and 17, according to Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova. Ms Golikova has told a government meeting on Covid-19 that registration of the new treatment, named Gam-Covid-Vac, would take place later in the day, state news agency Tass reports. She said it was hoped the vaccine would enter civilian circulation in Russia from the end of December. The new vaccine will only be given to children under 15 with the consent of their parents or the child's legal representative, and to children over 15 only with their own consent, Ms Golikova said. Speaking at the same meeting, President Vladimir Putin urged the government to pay attention to the need for vaccines for children, but voiced scepticism about compulsory vaccination. ""On the whole, inoculations should be voluntary - specially for children,"" Tass quoted him as saying. There have been 43,676 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours,according to the latest data,external. This means there have been 303,071 people who have tested positive for the virus in the last seven days, - up by 11.1% on the week before. There have also been 149 deaths of people within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, taking the weekly total to 926 - a 9.4% fall on the previous seven-day period. Around 80.4% of people over the age of 12 are fully vaccinated, while 88.4% have had a single dose of a Covid jab and 27.8% have received a third booster dose. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Europe is once again at the epicentre of the pandemic, the World Health Organization has said. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO's director general, said more than 60% of the world's cases and deaths were in Europe over the last week. The organisation said the highly infectious Delta variant has increased the risk of transmission among vaccinated people. Dr Tedros warned against a ""false sense of security"" created by the vaccines, stressing that those who are vaccinated can still get and spread the virus. Those who are vaccinated must therefore continue to take precautions, such as mask wearing, social distancing, avoiding crowds, and meeting others outside or in well-ventilated rooms, he said. Dr Tedros stressed, however, that the vaccines do reduce the risk of severe illness and death. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said a decision on further restrictions would be announced on Friday The Dutch government looks set to announce a raft of new coronavirus restrictions after the country recorded a record number of cases of the virus. Officials announced on Wednesday that more than 23,700 Covid-19 infections had been recorded in 24 hours, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. It means that cases have jumped by more than 40% over the past week, despite more than 85% of Dutch people being fully vaccinated. Experts have warned that hospitals will reach full capacity in less than a week if new restrictions are not introduced. ""The
infection rate is higher than ever before"", Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said
in a letter to parliament on Wednesday. ""Hospital admissions
keep exceeding expectations and we have not seen the worst
yet."" He
said the government's panel of health experts would provide
fresh policy advice by Thursday and that a decision would
follow on Friday. Plans to restrict
access to many public places to people who have
been vaccinated or have recently recovered from COVID-19 promptedthree nights of riotinglast week and more than 170 people have been arrested. Boris Johnson was criticised earlier this month for not wearing a mask during a visit to a hospital Downing Street has insisted that the prime minister ""follows all Covid rules"" when asked about reports that he attended a performance of Macbeth without wearing a mask. The Guardian said another audience member saw Boris Johnson without his mask on at all times during Tuesday's play at the Almeida Theatre in north London. A different audience member saw him maskless in a public area of the venue, the paper said. Mask-wearing rules were dropped in England in the summer, but some transport networks, shops and venues - including the Almeida - still ask for them to be worn. Earlier this month, Mr Johnson was criticised for not wearing a mask during a hospital tour and while sitting next to 95-year-old environmental campaigner Sir David Attenborough at the COP26 climate summit. Protesters carry a banner reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" through Kyiv Hundreds of demonstrators have taken to the streets of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv to protest against Covid measures and the country's mandatory vaccination programme for some workers. Protesters carried placards reading ""no to genocide of Ukrainians"" and ""say 'no' to lies"". Some were also demanding the release of anti-vaccine activist Ostap Stakhiv, who was arrested in the city of Lviv last week accused of undermining public health through alleged links with Russia. Mr Stakhiv has denied all the allegations against him. Ukraine, which has recently seen a rise in vaccination numbers after imposing restrictions in public places, is still struggling to persuade a large number of its citizens who remain hesitant to receive their shots. The country is experiencing a new surge in coronavirus cases as the highly transmissible Delta variant sweeps across Europe. Ukraine today reported 14,325 new daily Covid cases and 595 coronavirus-related deaths.

Many Scottish children struggling in education before Covid ""fell off the radar"" in the first few months of the pandemic, a children rights charity has told politicians. Dr Colin Morrison, a co-director at Children's parliament, says there could be a ""legacy of disengagement"" for some pupils who lacked electronic devices to access online learning materials - the consequences of  which might be ""difficult to address"". Speaking to MSPs at the Education, Children and Young People Committee at Holyrood, Dr Morrison says many children the charity works with ""were just gone to the education system"" in the three or four months from March last year. He adds: ""What I also know is many head teachers we knew who love and care for their children were literally scrambling about and delivering devices every day, knocking on doors and making sure people had food, never mind digital devices."" Last year the Scottish government pledged 50,000 devices would be given to children in need - later rising to 70,000 - while the SNP promised an age-appropriate device for every Scottish school student as part of their manifesto ahead of May's election. But Dr Morrison explains that some children are still without what they need, warning the loss of engagement for some of them could have ""long-term consequences"" for their learning. ""If there's a gap in attainment there's certainly a gap in how children are using that digital space to learn. ""For some children that's just taken off and they're blossoming with it, for other children there's a legacy of disengagement that's going to be difficult to address,"" he argues. London Underground workers are being put in potentially dangerous situations as mask-wearing is now being ""openly ignored"" on a large scale, unions are warning. The train drivers' union Aslef says there has been a noticeable dip in travellers wearing masks on the Tube - even though it's a requirement. And Mick Lynch, general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT), says: ""It's no wonder there's talk of new restrictions and controls if we can't even deliver the basics."" Transport for London - which runs the Tube network - said it has 500 enforcement officers to ask customers to comply with its mask rules. It says it has refused entry to 408 people and asked 126 to leave services since national rules were relaxed in July. Read more:What are the rules on mask wearing now? Prime Minister Naftali Bennett watches as his nine-year-old son is vaccinated Nearly 40% of Israel's Covid-19 patients are below the age of 12, the country's Health Ministry has said. Officials said that of 6,505 Israelis currently infected with the disease, 2,574 of those are children. The announcement comes as the government launched its vaccination campaign for children aged 5-11 this week. Around 1.2 million children will be inoculated with two doses of the Pfizer vaccine over the coming months. Prime Minister Naftali Bennett had his nine-year-old son vaccinated in front of media on Tuesday and urged other lawmakers to set a similar example. Israel recently emerged from a fourth Covid-19 wave which saw daily infections peak at more than 8,000 cases per day. But daily infections have been relatively low for the last few weeks and million of people have now received a third booster jab. But despite the country's progress, the government has extended ""Green Pass"" regulations meant to restrict access to certain venues to vaccinated or recovered individuals for another two weeks.

"Budget changes that boost the income of some working people on universal credit come into force from now, the government has announced. Workers will now take home 8p more of any extra pound earned, owing to a shift in the so-called taper rate. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said in October's Budget that the change would take effect ""within weeks"" and no later than December 1. The policy was announced amid debate over the benefit's suitability. About two million people will benefit by an average of Â£1,000 following the move, the government said. However, the Resolution Foundation think tank calculated that 3.6 million families will remain worse off because the alterations failed to offset the loss of a Â£20 a week uplift in universal credit provided during the pandemic. Most universal credit claimants lose some of their benefits if they earn more money. The rate at which they lose the benefits is known as the taper rate. From now, the taper rate is 55%, which means that if you earn an extra pound you lose 55p in benefits. Previously, the rate was 63%, so workers will now take home 8p more of an extra Â£1 earned. Workers with responsibility for children or disabilities that limit their ability to work are allowed to earn a certain amount before they start losing their universal credit, which is called a work allowance. The work allowances for eligible claimants has also now gone up by Â£500 a year. Read more:Universal credit: What is the taper rate? They include two million households which are dependant on benefits and have nobody in work. Mr Sunak had been under pressure from MPs, including some Conservatives, about the withdrawal in October of the temporary Â£20-a-week universal credit uplift, and its effect on the finances of financially-stretched families. In the Budget, he announced the move to reward those who worked and earned more, while still on universal credit.

The Department for Work and Pensions is encouraging people to checkonline benefit calculators,externalto work out how their income could be boosted. The changes mean that an extra 600,000 families, all in work, will become entitled to some universal credit payments, according to economists at the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That takes the total to seven million, or 26% of working-age families. Eight ways the Budget affects you and your money Millions of poor families hit, Budget analysis finds The universal credit claimants paying top tax rates The result was that those who were earning a significant income, perhaps even at the level of a higher-rate taxpayer, might still be entitled to some help through universal credit, said Tom Waters, senior research economist at the IFS. For example, a lone parent with two children and monthly rent of Â£750 can now earn up to Â£51,900 a year before losing all of their universal credit entitlement. ""Along with other recent reforms, it means that 2.7 million working households on benefits will be better off than under the 2015 tax and benefit system,"" said Mr Waters. ""However, 2.1 million will still be worse off as will almost all two million benefit dependent working age households with nobody in work."" The changes to universal credit take effect to a backdrop of the rising cost of living - with the inflation rate expected to peak next year - and tax increases in April. That would negate any wage rises experienced particularly by middle-income earners. Low-income households would also feel ""real pain"" as the cost of living is set to increase faster than benefit payments, the IFS has said.

"This video can not be played Covid-19: NI Executive ministers meet to discuss coronavirus measures People in Northern Ireland are being urged by Stormont ministers to work from home ""where possible"" in a bid to curb the spread of Covid-19. Current advicealready states that people should work from home where they can,externalbut ministers said they were ""strengthening"" that message. It follows an executive meeting about how to tackle rising infections. Ministers are also advising the public to limit their social contacts and wear face coverings in indoor settings. Northern Ireland's infection ratehas been climbing over the past week or so- it is the highest in the UK, slightly above Wales, and has just overtaken the Republic of Ireland. In England, since Covid restrictions lifted on 19 July, people have no longer been asked towork at home but businesses still have a legal duty to manage risks to staff and customers. Most Covid restrictions have also been lifted in Wales, but employers are still encouraged to let people work from home where possible. In Scotland, most restrictions have been lifted, but working from home where possible is advised. The government wants employers to consider long-term ""hybrid"" working models. ""Hospital admissions are rising and modelling indicates that admissions will increase further in the coming weeks,"" Stormont executive ministers said. What are the rules as NI's Covid numbers surge? ""The clear advice from public health experts is that an intervention is now required."" In a joint statement after Tuesday's meeting, Northern Ireland ministers said Covid-19 had ""once again taken a firm grip across our society"". Ministers said that if more people worked from home it would help to reduce the risk of infection both inside and outside the workplace. However, they stopped short of ordering employers to facilitate home working, saying they ""recognise that this may present challenges in some work areas"". Instead, ministers said they were asking employees ""to work from home where they can and advise employers to support this where possible"". The health minister has warned that hospitality businesses could be forced to close again over Christmas The statement followed a proposal from Health Minister Robin Swann, of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), who had recently said he believedanyone working from home last year when the pandemic began should do so again. He has warnedhospitality businesses may have to close over Christmasunless coronavirus transmission rates fall. Following Tuesday's meeting, ministers urged the public to take up the offer of vaccines and booster jabs, saying statistics were stark. ""Unvaccinated adults aged under 50 are almost 11 times more likely to need hospitalisation from Covid-19,"" they said. ""Unvaccinated individuals aged 50 and over are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 than those who are fully vaccinated."" Speaking after the meeting, First Minister Paul Givan of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he was aware that restrictions had been ""acutely"" felt by the hospitality industry. ""We have to protect both lives and livelihood so we are working on the basis of having things open and safe,"" he said. ""No-one wants to be faced with a situation where business have to close,"" he added. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said following the guidance was ""our best chance to avoid restrictions down the line"". She appealed to those who can work from home to ""please work from home and for employers to facilitate that"". ""We want to avoid difficult decisions we took this time last year and I understand how difficult it is for the wider public,"" she added. What we're seeing today is an attempt by the executive to reset the messaging and remind people of the basics in tackling the virus. We know the pressures on the health service in Northern Ireland and while we aren't seeing a return to tougher restrictions yet, ministers say it's clear some kind of intervention is required. There was no mention of a return to lockdown from ministers today, but they also can't rule anything out. The health minister has already warned that if we don't get a grip on Covid in the next two to three weeks, hospitality could again face closure at Christmas. That, it must be said, remains the worst, worst case scenario and ministers will be reluctant to go there. They'll hope the vaccination programme and ramping up of the booster programme in the next few weeks will help. Ministers are also conscious of making decisions affecting businesses that might require more financial support - the Treasury stepped in on previous occasions but that seems unlikely this year. The executive clearly hopes people will pay attention in order to avoid a Covid crisis over Christmas. In addition to promoting the vaccine message, ministers urged the public to ""make safer choices"" when coming in to contact with other people. This advices includes meeting people outdoors in preference to indoors, wearing face coverings and ensuring good ventilation of indoor settings. It is understood the Stormont executive has asked its Covid taskforce to examine issues around enforcement of wearing face masks. The taskforce will also look at the potential of setting up a scores-on-the-doors type system to rate businesses on their compliance with rules and mitigations. Mr Givan tweeted that the executive had ""engaged constructively and agreed a number of measures that will step up our collective efforts against the spread of Covid"". Allow Twitter content?

Earlier, Justice Minister Naomi Long said Stormont ministers may have to reintroduce some Covid-19 restrictions if there are ""no alternatives"". She said the executive was ""looking for ways that we can avoid having to take those drastic measures"" by focusing on measures such as the vaccine booster programme and Covid certification ""to make high-risk venues as safe as possible"". Mrs Long, the Alliance Party leader, said on Monday that ministers were ""not planning for Christmas closures"". On Tuesday, she told BBC News NI that there was a ""critical period"" ahead and ""we still have it within our gift"" to avoid the need for restrictions. However, Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster, which represents the hospitality industry, said the ""rhetoric"" coming from Stormont was unhelpful. ""I appreciate that planning has to go on behind closed doors,"" he said, but added that politicians were making ""half statements"" with no promise of support if tighter restrictions are imposed. Naomi Long said she did not have a crystal ball to predict the need for measures ""Those statements say to our workers: 'You might not have a job before Christmas' and it says to customers: 'Stay away'."" The executive met on Tuesday amid a high number of cases of Covid-19. On Tuesday,four Covid-19-related deaths were reported in Northern Irelandand a further 1,476 new cases. Q&A: How do I get a Covid-19 passport in NI? Tough Covid choices return - but what's the data? Last weekministers voted in favour of Covid vaccine passports being introducedin Northern Ireland. The proof of certification scheme will require people to provide a passport or proof of a negative Covid test result to access venues such as nightclubs, pubs and restaurants. BBC News NI understands that a debate on the Covid passport regulations could happen at Stormont on 6 or 7 December. Robin Swann expressed disappointment that some hospitality businesses had not acted responsibly since rules were relaxed The measure is due to take effect from 29 November. But it will not be enforced until 13 December, as a two-week grace period will take place to allow time for businesses and customers to adjust to the change. The DUP - which voted against the plan coming into place - had asked for the assembly to be allowed to debate the regulations. In his paper to executive ministers last Thursday, Mr Swann then recommended allowing a debate in the assembly on the issue. Orla Smyth, who owns a cafe in Belfast, told BBC News NI that speculation about future measures was not ""helpful for public confidence in using services"". She explained it also made it difficult for ""business owners being able to function"". On Tuesday, Mrs Long said she did not have a ""crystal ball"" about how the coming weeks will unfold, but said she believed ""people have become slightly complacent because of the vaccine"". When asked about the number of people who do not wear mandatory face coverings in retail settings, she said it was not the ""primary responsibility"" of the police to enforce this. Rather, she added it was one of a number of agencies who have a role to play. What are Northern Ireland's rules on Covid-19?

"Universities will have to hit hard targets to ensure the poorest students get into high-paid jobs after they graduate, under new government plans. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan is telling vice-chancellors to rewrite their access and participation plans, which they produce every five years. Those that miss their new targets will not be able to charge full fees. It comes as a study shows selective universities do less well in helping poor students earn more. The analysis - by the Institute of Fiscal Studies and the Sutton Trust education charity - compares how many pupils who were on free school meals attended each university, and went on to make it into the top 20% of earners at the age of 30. It found newer universities with lower entry requirements help twice the rate of poor students (2%) to get top jobs later on, than the older, more selective institutions (1%). The report suggests this is because they admit more students from poorer homes than universities with higher entry requirements, and can therefore help more disadvantaged students move into good jobs. Universities 'at risk of mis-selling courses' 'Too few' poor white university students Oxford promises 25% of places to disadvantaged Although less prestigious than the highly selective Russell Group of 24 institutions, these modern post-1992 universities are still turning large numbers of students into top earners. While students from low-income families who go to Russell Group institutions do very well in the labour market, these universities admit very few students who have been on free school meals in the past - this leads to what researchers call a lower ""mobility rate"". Ms Donelan said: ""We need to be making getting on as important as getting in. Gone will be the days where universities were recruiting students onto courses that lead to dropping out, frustration and unemployment. ""A student's outcome after university needs to be as important to providers as a student's grades before university."" In 2017, the public accounts committee suggested the system of loans and fees had left many students with debts, and doubting their degree was ""worth the money paid for it"". The shake-up is being announced as John Blake, a strategic director for academy chain Ark, is appointed The Office For Students' director of fair access and participation. Agreeing these new participation targets with universities will be his first task. It is expected they will be in place for September 2023. Currently, all universities have targets for the proportion of disadvantaged students they must admit. These are tied into their Access and Participation plans, which are approved by the Office for Students every four years, in return for the ability to charge maximum fees of Â£9,250 a year. Ms Donelan is now asking institutions to do more than increase the number of undergraduates from poor backgrounds. They will be required to ensure these students study courses which deliver good outcomes for them, although there is little detail on this. But the Department for Education says this means tackling drop-out rates, and supporting poorer students through university to graduation, and into high-skilled, high-paid jobs. Currently, about one in 10 students from the poorest backgrounds drop out in their first year. Universities will also be required to work more closely with schools and colleges, so that a broader range of students get better qualifications and have more options to choose from. Measures could include running a summer school or offering students and lecturers to tutor pupils, the DfE said. And universities will have to offer more courses linked to skills and flexible learning such as degree apprenticeships, higher technical qualifications and part-time courses. Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group, said the proportion of disadvantaged 18-year-olds joining its universities had increased every year for the last seven. He added: ""Our universities look forward to building on their existing work with schools and colleges, offering a range of options to young people, including degree apprenticeships, and supporting them through university to graduation and beyond.""

"A woman uses her phone outside the offices of NSO Apple is suing Israeli spyware firm NSO Group and its parent company for allegedly targeting iPhone users with a hacking tool. NSO's Pegasus software can infect both iPhones and Android devices, allowing operators to extract messages, photos and emails, record calls and secretly activate microphones and cameras. NSO Group said its tools were made to target terrorists and criminals. But it has allegedly also been used on activists, politicians and journalists. NSO Group says it only supplies Pegasus to military, law enforcement and intelligence agencies from countries with good human-rights records. However earlier this month, US officials placed the company on a trade blacklist, saying the software had ""enabled foreign governments to conduct transnational repression, which is the practice of authoritarian governments targeting dissidents, journalists and activists"". Apple's move follows a lawsuit launched in 2019 by WhatsApp which is still working its way through the US court system. In its initial court filing, WhatsApp said NSO Group ""developed their malware in order to access messages and other communications after they were decrypted on target devices"". Other tech firms, including Microsoft, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Google-owner Alphabet and Cisco Systems have all previously criticised NSO. NSO Group: Israeli spyware company added to US trade blacklist Pegasus spyware seller: Blame our customers, not us, for hacking In a blog post,externalannouncing the California lawsuit, Apple said it wanted to hold NSO Group and its parent company OSY Technologies ""accountable for the surveillance and targeting of Apple users"". ""To prevent further abuse and harm to its users, Apple is also seeking a permanent injunction to ban NSO Group from using any Apple software, services, or devices,"" it said. Apple prides itself on its privacy. It's a major selling point for its devices. So it's not totally surprising that a company that has allegedly sought to bypass Apple security features might antagonise the giant. That's not the only reason Apple is making a stand though. Not all hackers are considered equals. NSO Group has government clients, or as Apple puts it, is ""state-sponsored"". NSO claims it only works with agencies with good human rights records. In that way the company has tried to distinguish itself from underground hackers doing nefarious activities. By suing NSO Group Apple is rejecting that distinction. Apple is making the point that it doesn't matter who you are, if you're a group trying to hack into an Apple product they'll take action - whatever the motives. But there's a bit more depth to it than that. Apple will feel it's easier, and more politically palatable, to sue a private company, rather than the governments who are allegedly using the tech. In its complaint, filed in the US District Court for the Northern District of California, Apple said NSO's tools were used in ""concerted efforts in 2021 to target and attack Apple customers"" and that ""US citizens have been surveilled by NSO's spyware on mobile devices that can and do cross international borders."" Apple alleged that NSO group created more than 100 fake Apple ID user credentials to carry out its attacks. The tech giant said that its servers were not hacked, but that NSO misused and manipulated the servers to deliver the attacks on Apple users. Apple also alleged that NSO Group was directly involved in providing consulting services for the spyware, but NSO maintains that it only sells its tools to clients. Apple said it was forced to engage in a continual arms race with NSO, saying the Israeli firm was ""constantly updating their malware and exploits to overcome Apple's own security upgrades"". The iPhone maker said that it will donate $10m, as well as any damages recovered in the lawsuit, to cybersurveillance research groups including Citizen Lab, the University of Toronto group that first discovered NSO's attacks. NSO Group said in response: ""Thousands of lives were saved around the world thanks to NSO Group's technologies used by its customers"". ""Paedophiles and terrorists can freely operate in technological safe-havens, and we provide governments with the lawful tools to fight [them]. ""NSO group will continue to advocate for the truth.""
