"The spotlight is on Sanders in Iowa: will he shine? The first event that will help decide the candidates for US president is to take place with Monday's Iowa caucuses. Democratic and Republican voters will choose their preferred nominees for the White House race. While victory in Iowa doesn't guarantee anyone the nomination, it can help give them crucial momentum. The path appears clear for Donald Trump to be the Republican nominee, but 11 candidates are running for the Democratic nomination. Many have spent the past few weeks vigorously campaigning in the Midwest state, which is always the first to vote. The primaries contest goes on until early June, and moves on to New Hampshire next Tuesday. Here's the story of what to expect in Iowa, broken down. Polls suggest that Bernie Sanders has risen to be the favourite in Iowa (or - depending where you look - the joint-favourite, with former vice-president Joe Biden). He is one of four senators running for president who have had to stay behind in Washington to attend Mr Trump's impeachment trial, but his supporters, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a well-known congresswoman, have been energetically campaigning on his behalf in Iowa. How do caucuses and primaries work? Is this the start of a Bernie boom? Four years after losing out to Hillary Clinton, could this be the 78-year-old's time? He is backed by a huge pot of donations and a team of hundreds. But if he won the nomination, would moderate Democrats really rally around a candidate for the White House who identifies as a democratic socialist? Some of the other big names including Elizabeth Warren, Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg will be hoping Mr Sanders doesn't have it all his own way in Iowa. This video can not be played How Iowa is like the luge: An unconventional guide to the caucuses There are also Republican caucuses on Monday, and two people are running against Mr Trump, but the president's popularity within his own party is such that his nomination is all but a formality. Iowa, to some extent, provides a glimpse of what went wrong for Democrats in 2016. In the last election, more than 200 US counties flipped from supporting President Barack Obama in 2012 to backing Mr Trump - and 31 of those counties were in Iowa. Democrats will be hoping to lure back those swing voters in 2020. And while we won't know until November whether they have been successful, we may get a glimpse of where the land lies on Monday. Howard County in northern Iowa flipped by 41 percentage points in 2016, the largest change in the US. The BBC's AngÃ©lica Casas and Marianna Brady went there to ask people whether they would vote for a Democrat in 2020. This video can not be played âWe voted for Obama, then Trumpâ Does Iowa actually matter? It depends how you look at it. As the primary season curtain-raiser, Iowa can help shape perceptions among voters. A win here can help give a candidate momentum early in the race (as it did in 1976 with Jimmy Carter) and erase any doubts about their viability. Candidates' secret weapons against Trump Nine odd things about the Iowa caucuses While Iowans have a good record at picking the eventual Democratic nominee, their record when it comes to the Republican candidate is more mixed. When it's an open Republican race (unlike this year, for example), none of the winners of Iowa has become the Republican nominee since 2000. It's worth pointing out that Iowa isn't the most diverse of states either - the rest of America will vote very differently in upcoming primaries and caucuses. So says Ann Anhalt, from Des Moines,who plans to vote for tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang on Monday. But this is exactly what a caucus involves - they are essentially internal party meetings, scattered across the state, that might last a few hours. At some point during the meeting, you have to show your support for a candidate. You do this by standing next to others who also support that candidate, and a count takes place. What's at stake is delegates - 41 Democratic ones in Iowa - distributed according to how well candidates performed in the caucuses. If candidate A is awarded 10 delegates, those delegates would later vote for candidate A as the Democratic nominee at the summer convention - the aim for any candidate is to gain as many delegates as possible over the primary season. Gina Weekley, 36 - Youth advocate from Waterloo, Iowa I'm married to a woman, so my livelihood and happiness is at stake in this election. My family's future is at stake in this election. And our freedom as Americans is at stake. We need a strong leader to emerge as the Democratic nominee. Someone with great passion and energy who can unify the United States. The division and hate messages that we've seen under the Trump presidency needs to end. We don't currently have a leader that works for all Americans. I'm caucusing so that future generations can access quality education. We need a president who helps ""at risk"" youth get the proper services they need so they don't fall victim to the school-to-prison pipeline. At each of the 1,677 locations across the state, a candidate must have the support of at least 15% of voters in order to qualify for a chance to win Iowa delegates to the national convention in July - when the candidate is ultimately picked. After a first round of tabulations, those who support a candidate that doesn't reach ""viability"" have the opportunity to switch sides. Complicating everything is the new reporting system the Democratic Party has instituted for the Iowa caucus results. In the past, the party has only released one number - the final tabulation of support after all the caucus horse-trading and support swapping takes place. This time, however, there will be two sets of numbers - the final tally as well as a count of each candidate's support in the first round of balloting. That means two - or more! - candidates could be on stage declaring victory on Monday night. It has the makings for a long, chaotic night - the first of what could be many for the candidates still standing after the Iowa dust settles.

"Streatham attacker Sudesh Amman was aged 18 when he was jailed for terror offences in 2018 Sudesh Amman, the 20-year-old responsible for the attack in Streatham, south London, on Sunday, pleaded guilty in November 2018 to six charges of possessing documents containing terrorist information and seven of disseminating terrorist publications. Three of the terrorist manuals Amman admitted owning were about knife fighting. In fact, much of Amman's fascination with conducting an attack was said to be focused on using a knife. He was jailed at the Old Bailey the following month for three years and four months. I was there and recall Amman smiling as he was sentenced. Streatham attacker named as Sudesh Amman Streatham attacker under active police surveillance He was automatically released from HMP Belmarsh on 23 January 2020 after serving half of his sentence in custody. It is understood that he had since been living at a bail hostel in south London. He was under a curfew and had to wear a GPS tag, coupled with exclusion zones such as ports and airports. He had to surrender his passport and had limited access to electronic devices and restrictions on his internet use Amman was first arrested in north London in May 2018 by armed officers on suspicion of planning a terrorist attack, although he was not ultimately charged with doing so. Scotland Yard said that, following consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service, ""we did not charge with this offence."" The prosecution of Amman related instead to his ownership and distribution of terrorist propaganda and instructional manuals. Forensic specialists recovered in more than 349,000 media files from Amman's devices At the time, he was living in Harrow and studying science and maths at the nearby North West London College. Prior to that, Amman had studied at Park High School between 2011 and 2016. He came to the attention of counter-terrorism police in April 2018 when a Dutch blogger made officers aware of postings on the Telegram messaging app. The posts included a photo showing an image of a knife along with two firearms on a Shahada flag along with Arabic words meaning: ""Armed and ready April 3"". One of the Telegram posts that led to Amman being identified by police in 2018 The blogger also said the same person had linked to a YouTube video of a pro-gay rights speaker who frequented Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park. The post called on others to ""all unite together to attack one another. He will be there this Sunday at Hyde Park"". Police enquiries showed the user of the relevant Telegram account was Amman and a decision was taken to arrest him. The Dutch blogger, named Azazel van den Berg, told the BBC he was ""shocked"" to have heard that Amman was responsible for the attack. He said: ""I had heard of the attack on Dutch television. When I sat down at my computer I saw that message with his photo late last night."" He added: ""I did everything that was possible, I also did not know that man was already free. I think that jihadists like him should be punished harder with prison sentences and not conditionally free with a single bond. ""If he had just served his whole sentence, what happened now would never have happened. But English law must be applied to that, which is a task for the politicians in your country."" 'There were armed police everywhere' Video shows moments after police shooting Amman had elsewhere written of how he was thinking of conducting a terror attack in north London and that he had conducted reconnaissance. Detectives discovered that the student was using a WhatsApp group to expose young members of his family to violent terrorist material. He used it to share an al-Qaeda magazine and exclaimed ""the Islamic State is here to stay"". A BB gun was recovered when the Met Police searched his home in Harrow The WhatsApp group - entitled La Familia - included images of Amman's younger siblings in poses reminiscent of IS supporters. In messages with one family member Amman claimed that, as Yazidi women were slaves, the Koran made it permissible to rape them. He sent beheadings videos to his girlfriend - whom he said should kill her ""kuffar"" parents - and told her: ""If you can't make a bomb because family, friends or spies are watching or suspecting you, take a knife, molotov, sound bombs or a car at night and attack the tourists (crusaders), police and soldiers of taghut, or Western embassies in every country you are in this planet."" In messages to her, Amman said he had pledged allegiance to Islamic State and wished to carry out acid attacks. Elsewhere, he asked if he could have a knife delivered to her address and told her he considered Isis to be the best thing to happen to Islam. This video can not be played Video shows moments after police shooting He wrote that he preferred the idea of a knife attack over the use of bombs and discussed whether he would stand his ground if police came to arrest him. In a notebook - in which he had written about explosives and detonators - he had listed his ""goals in life"". These included: ""Die as a shuhada"" (martyr) and go to '""jannah"" (paradise). Before he was jailed Amman had previous convictions for possession of an offensive weapon - a broken bottle - and cannabis.

"This video can not be played Video shows moments after police shooting A man shot dead by police after he attacked people in south London had been recently released from prison after serving time for terror offences. He was under active police surveillance at the time of the attack, which police believe to be an Islamist-related terrorist incident. He had a hoax device strapped to his body, police said. Three people were injured, with one person in a life-threatening condition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would announce further plans for ""fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences"" on Monday. Gunshots were heard on Streatham High Road just after 14:00 GMT on Sunday. Reports suggest a man entered a shop and started stabbing people. It appears he then left the shop and stabbed a woman. Witnesses reported hearing three gun shots and seeing a man lying on the ground outside a Boots pharmacy, as armed police approached and shouted at those nearby to move back. As it happened: Streatham 'terrorist-related' incident The attacker had been released from prison at the end of January, after serving half of his three year sentence. The BBC's Daniel Sandford said the events appeared to unfold after witnesses saw an unmarked police car pull in front of another car near Streatham Common, forcing it to stop. He said this could be linked to the subsequent stabbings and police shooting and it was possible somebody was stopped, before being followed by undercover officers. London Ambulance Service said it treated the three people for injuries at the scene and all were taken to hospital. Of the other two, one had minor injuries, believed to have been caused by glass following shots from the police firearm, and the third person's condition was not life-threatening. In a statement, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi said armed officers were in ""immediate attendance"" and shot a male suspect, as part of a ""proactive Counter Terrorism operation"". The situation has been contained and officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command are now leading an investigation into the incident, she said. Streatham High Road remains closed and a cordon is in place, with enhanced police patrols in the area. A police officer was seen pointing a gun at a man, who was seen on the floor outside Boots Eyewitness Gjon Kathegjolli said he was in a barber shop when he heard a woman, who was with a baby in a push chair and two young boys, scream and saw her being stabbed. A man then walked past carrying a knife the size of his forearm, he said. Another eyewitness told the PA news agency: ""I was crossing the road when I saw a man with a machete and silver canisters on his chest being chased by what I assume was an undercover police officer."" The main road through Streatham is cordoned off Daniel Gough said he was out for a run when he heard shots and everyone ran. ""There was panic, people were yelling,"" he said. ""A young girl running alongside me kept asking 'Is this what I'm meant to do?' - she was very distressed. ""I saw a policeman and he yelled, telling everyone to get back. His gun was pointing in the direction of a man on the floor. ""Suddenly, more police appeared. There were [officers] everywhere"". This video can not be played The BBC's Steffan Powell describes the scene in Streatham after a man was shot by armed police Adam Blake, who was walking along Streatham Common, described how he saw two or three cars crash into each other, including an unmarked police car, as the incident unfolded. ""Another police car carried on towards the hill pursuing someone,"" he told the BBC. By BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds Videos shot by eyewitnesses show several plain-clothed police officers pulling on police caps while pointing their weapons at the dying suspect. Another apparent surveillance officer on a motorbike pulls up and colleagues attempt to clear the street. In today's incident, onlooker videos suggest the police only spot the man's hoax device after he has been shot and they approach him. The swift response of these officers has almost certainly saved lives but there will be inevitable questions about the operation. It has not been confirmed they were specifically following the man but they appear to have reacted fast when he started attacking people with a knife. Counter-terrorist police and MI5 have around 3,000 so called ""subjects of interest"" at any one time but a much smaller number are under round-the-clock surveillance because it takes a huge team of specialist officers to watch a suspect covertly. This means that preventing terrorism is all about taking difficult decisions. Which suspects should be watched? What level of risk do they pose and when is the best time to make an arrest, given the need to capture real evidence? Those decisions have become harder in recent years as would be attackers are increasingly likely to act alone and to use low-tech weapons, sometimes on a whim. Forensic officers were seen working at the site into the evening Prime Minister Boris Johnsontweeted,externalthat his thoughts were with the injured and others affected. He thanked emergency services for their response. Streatham's Labour MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy said: ""It is scary, I feel that fear, but Streatham is a very resilient community and we'll be fine."" Armed police were at the sealed-off street on Sunday evening Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said: ""Terrorists seek to divide us and to destroy our way of life - here in London we will never let them succeed."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his thoughts were with those affected and thanked emergency services ""for their dedication and quick response"".

"A man shot dead by police after he stabbed people in south London had been released from prison in January. Sudesh Amman, 20, was released about a week ago after serving half of his sentence of three years and four months for terror offences. He was under active police surveillance at the time of the attack on Streatham High Road, which police believe to be an Islamist-related terrorist incident. Three people were injured but none is in a life-threatening condition. Scotland Yard said officers were searching addresses in south London and Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire. ""No arrests have been made and inquiries continue at pace,"" the Metropolitan Police said. Who was the Streatham attacker? Streatham MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy said: ""He [Amman] was under surveillance quite soon after being released which begs the question, why was he released so soon?"" Treasury minister Rishi Sunak said ""the police are obviously doing absolutely everything they can to keep people safe"". He said new measures to toughen terrorism laws -already announcedby the PM afterlast November's attacknear London Bridge -  will give the police ""more powers and resources to do that as well"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would announce further plans for ""fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences"" on Monday. This video can not be played Video shows moments after police shooting At the time of Amman's release there were concerns about the danger he might pose to the public but there were no legal mechanisms to keep him in prison, BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said. Given November's attack also involved a man convicted of terrorism offences released mid-way through his sentence, our correspondent said there was ""a desperate desire"" within government to be seen to be acting quickly.

"This video can not be played Raab: EU alignment not a red line, it's not even in negotiating room Britain will ""not be aligning with EU rules"" in any post-Brexit trade deal, the foreign secretary  has said. Dominic Raab argued agreeing to stick strongly with EU regulations would ""defeat the point of Brexit"". But Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the UK needed to commit to a level playing field to get a free trade deal. Talks to negotiate a free trade deal between the UK and the EU are due to start next month, following the UK's formal withdrawal from the bloc. On Monday Boris Johnson is expected to set out his position ahead of those talks, where he will tell the EU he is prepared to accept customs checks at Britain's borders if he cannot secure the sort of trade deal he wants. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will also outline his approach to negotiations. Brexit: What happens next? Why does a UK-EU trade deal matter? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? One option the PM could support would be a Canada-style free trade deal which allows tariff-free trade for the majority of goods, but would not cover the UK's service industry - which accounts for more than 80% of UK jobs. Reports in recent days have suggested EU chiefs want the UK to continue to follow EU rules on standards and state subsidies - while accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in any trade disputes. The PM is expected to say that he will accept no alignment and no jurisdiction of the European courts when talks start in March. He is also preparing to say he would rule out relaxing rules on workers' rights, food hygiene standards and environmental protections. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Varadkar said it was possible for the UK to have a ""Canada-style agreement"". However, he added: ""Canada isn't the UK; you're geographically part of the European continent, we share seas and airspace and our economies are very integrated. ""And one thing we feel very strongly in the EU is that if we are going to have tariff-free, quota-free trade with the UK, which is essentially what we have with Canada on almost everything, then that needs to come with a level playing field. ""We, for example would have very strong views on fair competition and state aid."" A level playing field is a trade policy phrase for a set of common rules and standards that prevent businesses in one country undercutting their rivals over those operating in other countries in areas such as workers' rights and environmental protections. He also cautioned against ""setting rigid red lines"" for the post-Brexit trade negotiations arguing ""it makes coming to an agreement more difficult because the other side doesn't feel like it has got a fair deal unless those red lines are turned pink."" Mr Raab said the UK would enter trade talks ""with a spirit of goodwill"" but added ""the legislative alignment - it just ain't happening"". Brexit: What is a level playing field? Varadkar warns election could hit EU trade talks Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit How the UK celebrated joining Europe Labour's John McDonnell said Mr Johnson's desire to diverge from EU rules ""contradict"" what the PM had previously said on protecting environmental, consumer and employment rights. ""On the one hand he said there will be [protections] on the other hand he is sabre-rattling saying that won't happen in the negotiations,"" he said. But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage welcomed the prime minister's approach arguing it was in the UK's ""national interest"" to be ""a competitor on their [the EU's] doorstep."" This video can not be played Leo Varadkar on UK seating advice: ""Surely everyone should be trying to work with everyone"" The government also wants to make progress in striking free trade agreements with countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The EU's own approach to the negotiations needs to be agreed by all 27 member states - which would be unlikely to happen before the end of February. While the UK officially left the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday, it will remain wedded to EU rules during a transition period which ends in December this year.

"The aircraft landed at RAF base Brize Norton shortly after 19:30 GMT More British nationals have been flown back to the UK from Wuhan in China, the centre of a new coronavirus outbreak. Eleven Britons have arrived at RAF base Brize Norton, Oxfordshire, after taking a French flight to Marseille earlier. They are going to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral, where 83 others who were evacuated from Wuhan last week are spending two weeks in quarantine. Joshua Drage, one of those in quarantine, said it was ""unsettling"" when he first arrived back in the UK. ""The first thing you're met with is a bunch of people in hazmat suits, which makes you feel like it's a lot worse,"" said Mr Drage, from Dungannon, County Tyrone, who had been in Wuhan teaching English. Hetold Radio 4's Broadcasting House programmethose in quarantine are wearing masks, adding: ""Since none of us really knows who has and who doesn't have the virus... it's just safer for everyone if everyone follows the precaution."" Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? The first group of evacuated British nationalsarrived in the UK on Friday.Eighty-three Britons are staying in two apartment blocks normally used to house nurses. The nurses have been moved to local hotels. Dr Griffiths had been stranded in this hotel in Wuhan before returning to the UK on Friday Lecturer Yvonne Griffiths, 71, from Cardiff, said she had been put in a shared flat with four separate rooms, a kitchen and a lobby area, where food and drinks were delivered. Speaking on her third day in quarantine, she said she had ""some interaction"" with the others in her flat. ""People go [to the lobby] to collect things and also pick up food and some people will stand having their food together, but all wearing masks,"" she said. ""Obviously you have to put your mask down a little for you to eat."" This video can not be played Matt Raw, who was flown out of Wuhan, shows the BBC his living quarters at Arrowe Park Hospital The 11 Britons who came via the French flight will be kept separately from the 83 already at the Wirral hospital. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raabtold Sky News' Sophy Ridge,externalhe was ""very grateful for the co-operation"" from the French authorities. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme the government believes there may be around 30,000 British citizens still in China and will ""do everything we can"" to ensure those who want to leave have the opportunity to do so. Nurses' accommodation at Arrowe Park Hospital has been re-purposed to house evacuees from Wuhan On Sunday a Public Health England spokeswoman said they were continuing to make good progress in tracing anyone who had close contact withtwo people diagnosedwith the virus in the UK. The two Chinese nationals - who are related - were taken ill at a hotel in York last week and are now being treated at a specialist facility in Newcastle. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus One of the pair was a student at the University of York but was not on campus or in student accommodation before or after their exposure to the virus, the university said. Dr Will Zhuang, president of the York Chinese Association, said he understood the pair had not arrived in York as part of a large tour group, and had only been in contact with one or two other families before falling ill. Sharon Stoltz, City of York Council's director of health, said the risk to people in York remained ""very low"". First death from coronavirus outside China Social media tackles coronavirus fake news UK pharmacies see sanitiser sales spike There have been some reports of racism aimed at Chinese and British Chinese people in the UK following the outbreak. The Chinese Community Centre in Birminghamsaid:,external""Sadly, we're hearing that abuse against Chinese people in the UK has increased since coronavirus has spread."" Paediatric nurse Lucy Li, 35, from Wanstead, east London, said her 11-year-old daughter ""reported last week that children are telling each other to 'stay away from all Chinese people because they are ill due to the virus'."" Ms Li, whose parents came to the UK from China in the 1960s, added: ""Even when I went to the doctors, when I coughed I could see people moving away from me. ""I can't walk down the street without unwanted attention. It's degrading and enough is enough."" Have you experienced abuse since the coronavirus outbreak? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk Chinese businesses have also said they are suffering. One restaurant owner in London's Chinatown said Friday's news that the virus had reached the UK prompted ""immediate cancellations"". Martin Ma, general manager at Jinli, which has two branches in Chinatown, said the restaurants were having ""a hard time"". In his flagship restaurant, he estimated bookings were down by 50% this weekend, with losses of around Â£15,000. ""Normally we have queues going out of the door,"" Mr Ma told BBC News. Businesses in London's Chinatown said the outbreak was having an impact on bookings Some Chinese nationals who are studying in the UK have been unable to return from China because of travel restrictions imposed after the coronavirus outbreak. The University of Derby said 15 of its students remained in China. Three students, who have already returned, have been asked to isolate themselves but are not showing symptoms, the university said. The government has launched a public health campaign urging people to use tissues when they cough or sneeze and to wash their hands regularly. The NHS-branded adverts, aimed at slowing the spread of the new coronavirus, are appearing on social media, radio and in newspapers. The adverts will also appear on outlets and online forums frequented by Chinese nationals in Britain.

"This video can not be played Raab: EU alignment not a red line, it's not even in negotiating room Britain will ""not be aligning with EU rules"" in any post-Brexit trade deal, the foreign secretary  has said. Dominic Raab argued agreeing to stick strongly with EU regulations would ""defeat the point of Brexit"". But Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the UK needed to commit to a level playing field to get a free trade deal. Talks to negotiate a free trade deal between the UK and the EU are due to start next month, following the UK's formal withdrawal from the bloc. On Monday Boris Johnson is expected to set out his position ahead of those talks, where he will tell the EU he is prepared to accept customs checks at Britain's borders if he cannot secure the sort of trade deal he wants. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will also outline his approach to negotiations. Brexit: What happens next? Why does a UK-EU trade deal matter? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? One option the PM could support would be a Canada-style free trade deal which allows tariff-free trade for the majority of goods, but would not cover the UK's service industry - which accounts for more than 80% of UK jobs. Reports in recent days have suggested EU chiefs want the UK to continue to follow EU rules on standards and state subsidies - while accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in any trade disputes. The PM is expected to say that he will accept no alignment and no jurisdiction of the European courts when talks start in March. He is also preparing to say he would rule out relaxing rules on workers' rights, food hygiene standards and environmental protections. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Varadkar said it was possible for the UK to have a ""Canada-style agreement"". However, he added: ""Canada isn't the UK; you're geographically part of the European continent, we share seas and airspace and our economies are very integrated. ""And one thing we feel very strongly in the EU is that if we are going to have tariff-free, quota-free trade with the UK, which is essentially what we have with Canada on almost everything, then that needs to come with a level playing field. ""We, for example would have very strong views on fair competition and state aid."" A level playing field is a trade policy phrase for a set of common rules and standards that prevent businesses in one country undercutting their rivals over those operating in other countries in areas such as workers' rights and environmental protections. He also cautioned against ""setting rigid red lines"" for the post-Brexit trade negotiations arguing ""it makes coming to an agreement more difficult because the other side doesn't feel like it has got a fair deal unless those red lines are turned pink."" Mr Raab said the UK would enter trade talks ""with a spirit of goodwill"" but added ""the legislative alignment - it just ain't happening"". Brexit: What is a level playing field? Varadkar warns election could hit EU trade talks Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit How the UK celebrated joining Europe Labour's John McDonnell said Mr Johnson's desire to diverge from EU rules ""contradict"" what the PM had previously said on protecting environmental, consumer and employment rights. ""On the one hand he said there will be [protections] on the other hand he is sabre-rattling saying that won't happen in the negotiations,"" he said. But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage welcomed the prime minister's approach arguing it was in the UK's ""national interest"" to be ""a competitor on their [the EU's] doorstep.""

"Candidates went head-to-head at a hustings in Cardiff on Sunday People in north Wales do not feel devolution is working for them, a Labour leadership candidate has said. Lisa Nandy joined Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Rebecca Long Bailey at a hustings in Cardiff on Sunday. All four supported boosting devolution, with front-runner Sir Keir arguing for a federal UK. But Ms Nandy said her party may have to fight for devolution in parts of the country ""turning away from Labour"". The leadership contest follows a general election where Labour lost six seats in Wales - all with the exception of one were in the north. Meanwhile Ms Nandy and Ms Long Bailey said they would not stand in the way if a future Welsh Parliament wanted an independence referendum. Who will be Labour's next leader? What do the Labour candidates say about Scotland? Wigan MP Ms Nandy said people in north Wales ""feel very shut out from the centre of power - power in Westminster but also power in Cardiff"". ""I think if we are honest, we are going to have to go out and fight for devolution in many parts of the country that have been turning away from Labour for some time,"" she said. ""In my own constituency in Wigan, people feel that the city mayoral deal where Labour is in power hasn't delivered for them, in the same way it has delivered for Manchester. ""And when I was in Rhyl people were telling me exactly the same thing about devolution for the Welsh nation."" Ms Nandy told BBC Wales she wanted to see power devolved into towns that have not felt the benefits of major cities. ""I think the Welsh Labour government understands this really well, and in the conversations I've had with Mark Drakeford and many AMs, this is exactly what we're trying to do,"" she added. Lisa Nandy said Labour would have to ""fight"" for devolution Welsh Labour leader Mr Drakeford said he believed Ms Nandy was making a ""general point about the way in which people, who live away from where decisions are taken, often feel that those decisions aren't influenced by what matters to them"". ""We know that throughout the whole of devolution that we've had to work hard to make sure that every part of Wales feels that the National Assembly speaks for them, that their interests matter to us,"" he told BBC Wales. Sir Keir, who had won the vast majority of nominations from Welsh Labour MPs, said more powers should be devolved. ""I would not seek to impose anything on Wales - it's about agreement and working together,"" he told the hustings. He said ""radical federalism"" was the way forward, ""where more powers are closer to people"". Sir Keir said Welsh Labour needed to be a ""bigger part of decision making"" in the party. ""We don't hold it close enough,"" Sir Keir, who represents Holborn and St Pancras, said. ""There are examples of what's going on here that we should showcase as the Labour Party and the difference you can make in power."" Rebecca Long Bailey said she would want to talk to members in Wales about what powers should be devolved Ms Long Bailey, the candidate backed by the pro-Jeremy Corbyn group Momentum, said she would want a discussion with Welsh members about devolution. ""It's not a question of what powers would you like to have from Westminster,"" she said. ""It's an assumption that Wales gets all the powers it needs from Westminster and then it decides which ones it wants to share,"" the Salford and Eccles politician added. ""We've got to defend the current settlement that we have, and we've got to make the case against this government which has imposed up to Â£4bn of cuts on the Welsh assembly since 2010."" There was criticism of how the UK party had dealt with Wales, from Emily Thornberry. She said she had not been briefed, when she was due to do a TV interview in Wales, on what the impact ofLabour's promise of free broadbandwould have been for the country. The Islington South and Finsbury MP, who appealed to members to help her get on the final ballot, added: ""I remember coming down on the train with Welsh Labour when we were going to the manifesto meeting and quite frankly they hadn't been involved early enough at all. ""We do need to have a bit more respect for each other and frankly I think London has not had enough respect for Welsh Labour"". Keir Starmer made the case for ""radical federalism"" at the Cardiff hustings With six Westminster seats lost here in December and a Senedd election on the horizon next year, Wales is a priority for the next Labour leader. This was the only Welsh hustings of the three-month leadership contest and the candidates tried to outdo each other today with praise for Welsh Labour and calls for more devolution. Sir Keir Starmer, the frontrunner, has by far the most nominations from Welsh Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs) and was the only candidate with a welcoming committee awaiting him outside City Hall. But Rebecca Long Bailey, seen as the candidate closest to Jeremy Corbyn, got applause when she talked about ""open selections"" for Labour candidates, a theme associated with the Left of the party. It was a point that was rebutted by Lisa Nandy, and amid a warm and apparently friendly atmosphere amongst candidates and members, it was a reminder of the underlying tension that has existed in the party throughout the Corbyn years. A deputy leadership hustings followed the main event at the venue in Cardiff City Hall. Angela Rayner said the National Assembly elections would be ""difficult for us"", referring to a recent poll that suggested Labour could lose seats. The Stockport MP and deputy leadership candidate said: ""I don't think it is irreversible."" ""We need to make sure that our parliamentarians and our leaders in London, in Westminster know what's happening in Wales,"" she added. Who will be Labour's next leader?

"This video can not be played Video shows moments after police shooting A man shot dead by police after he attacked people in south London had been recently released from prison after serving time for terror offences. He was under active police surveillance at the time of the attack, which police believe to be an Islamist-related terrorist incident. He had a hoax device strapped to his body, police said. Three people were injured, with one person in a life-threatening condition. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would announce further plans for ""fundamental changes to the system for dealing with those convicted of terrorism offences"" on Monday. Gunshots were heard on Streatham High Road just after 14:00 GMT on Sunday. Reports suggest a man entered a shop and started stabbing people. It appears he then left the shop and stabbed a woman. Witnesses reported hearing three gun shots and seeing a man lying on the ground outside a Boots pharmacy, as armed police approached and shouted at those nearby to move back. As it happened: Streatham 'terrorist-related' incident The attacker had been released from prison at the end of January, after serving half of his three year sentence. The BBC's Daniel Sandford said the events appeared to unfold after witnesses saw an unmarked police car pull in front of another car near Streatham Common, forcing it to stop. He said this could be linked to the subsequent stabbings and police shooting and it was possible somebody was stopped, before being followed by undercover officers. London Ambulance Service said it treated the three people for injuries at the scene and all were taken to hospital. Of the other two, one had minor injuries, believed to have been caused by glass following shots from the police firearm, and the third person's condition was not life-threatening. In a statement, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Lucy D'Orsi said armed officers were in ""immediate attendance"" and shot a male suspect, as part of a ""proactive Counter Terrorism operation"". The situation has been contained and officers from the Met's Counter Terrorism Command are now leading an investigation into the incident, she said. Streatham High Road remains closed and a cordon is in place, with enhanced police patrols in the area. A police officer was seen pointing a gun at a man, who was seen on the floor outside Boots Eyewitness Gjon Kathegjolli said he was in a barber shop when he heard a woman, who was with a baby in a push chair and two young boys, scream and saw her being stabbed. A man then walked past carrying a knife the size of his forearm, he said. Another eyewitness told the PA news agency: ""I was crossing the road when I saw a man with a machete and silver canisters on his chest being chased by what I assume was an undercover police officer."" The main road through Streatham is cordoned off Daniel Gough said he was out for a run when he heard shots and everyone ran. ""There was panic, people were yelling,"" he said. ""A young girl running alongside me kept asking 'Is this what I'm meant to do?' - she was very distressed. ""I saw a policeman and he yelled, telling everyone to get back. His gun was pointing in the direction of a man on the floor. ""Suddenly, more police appeared. There were [officers] everywhere"". This video can not be played The BBC's Steffan Powell describes the scene in Streatham after a man was shot by armed police Adam Blake, who was walking along Streatham Common, described how he saw two or three cars crash into each other, including an unmarked police car, as the incident unfolded. ""Another police car carried on towards the hill pursuing someone,"" he told the BBC. By BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds Videos shot by eyewitnesses show several plain-clothed police officers pulling on police caps while pointing their weapons at the dying suspect. Another apparent surveillance officer on a motorbike pulls up and colleagues attempt to clear the street. In today's incident, onlooker videos suggest the police only spot the man's hoax device after he has been shot and they approach him. The swift response of these officers has almost certainly saved lives but there will be inevitable questions about the operation. It has not been confirmed they were specifically following the man but they appear to have reacted fast when he started attacking people with a knife. Counter-terrorist police and MI5 have around 3,000 so called ""subjects of interest"" at any one time but a much smaller number are under round-the-clock surveillance because it takes a huge team of specialist officers to watch a suspect covertly. This means that preventing terrorism is all about taking difficult decisions. Which suspects should be watched? What level of risk do they pose and when is the best time to make an arrest, given the need to capture real evidence? Those decisions have become harder in recent years as would be attackers are increasingly likely to act alone and to use low-tech weapons, sometimes on a whim.

"The UK has formally suspended trade talks with Canada despite nearly two years of negotiations, in a row over agricultural products including beef. Following Brexit and the departure from the EU's trading system in 2021, the UK has been trying to strike trade deals with countries around the world. This is the first time the UK has formally suspended talks with a potential trading partner since then. UK halts trade negotiations with Canada over hormones in beef ban It means tariffs - or taxes - may have to be paid on some UK exports to Canada such as cheese, of which the UK exported Â£18.7m worth in 2022,according to the Food and Drink Federation,external. The ability to strike free trade deals was cited by Brexit supporters as one of the benefits of leaving the EU. A free trade deal aims to encourage trade between countries by making it cheaper and simpler. It normally applies to the exchange of goods, but occasionally to services as well. Making trade cheaper is usually achieved by reducing or eliminating tariffs. These are government taxes or charges for trading goods across borders and can help protect a country's manufacturers from cheap imports. A car importer might have to pay a 20% tariff on top of the vehicle's price, for example, to bring it into a country. Trade can also be made simpler if countries have the same rules, such as the colour of wires in plugs or food safety requirements. The closer the rules are, the less likely that goods need to be inspected. The UK-Japan deal was signed in October 2020 Since Brexit, the UK has signed trade deals and agreements in principle with about 70 countries and one with the EU. However, the majority of these are simply ""rollovers"" - meaning they copied the terms of deals the UK previously had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new trading arrangements. And some of them are with countries with which the UK does very little trade. A deal withJapanwas signed in October 2020. It was the first that differed from the existing EU trade deal. TheAustralia dealwas thefirst trade agreementnegotiated from scratch by the UK since it left the EU. UK farmerswarned they could be undercut by cheap imports, which could cost jobs. However, the UK government insists the deal contains protections for the sector. An agreement withNorway, Iceland and Liechtensteinwasannounced in June 2021and builds on the previous agreement the UK had with these countries. British farmers are worried about competing with cheap foreign imports, such as beef The UKsigned a new deal,externalwithNew Zealandon 28 February 2022. New Zealand is a small trading partner, accounting for less than 0.2% of total UK trade. While the deal is unlikely to boost the UK economy by much, it could lead to more New Zealand lamb being sold in the UK. The UK has also agreed to join an existing trade agreement between11 Pacific Rim nations. The governmentexpects to become a member,externalof the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in the second half of 2024. Talks withIndiabegan in early 2022, although no deal has been reached. And there has not been a deal agreed with theUS, although it had been set as a priority in the Conservative 2019 manifesto. Rishi Sunak said in June 2023that a full free trade agreement had not in fact been a priority for either country ""for a while now"", although a more limited economic agreement called the Atlantic Declaration was signed. After Brexit happened on 31 January 2020, the UK and EU needed to decide the rules for their future trading relationship. This was important because the EU was the UK's largest and closest trading partner. After months of negotiation - which went down to the wire - a UK-EU trade deal came into force on 1 January 2021. The deal prevented any tariffs and quotas being introduced, which would have made it more expensive to trade goods between the two partners. The UK-EU trade deal went down to the wire, with fishing proving to be one of the major sticking points But not everything is the same as it was before Brexit. As the UK no longer has to follow EU rules on product standards, new checks have been introduced. The deal also does not completely eliminate the possibility of tariffs in future. Both sides will need to stay close to shared rules in areas such as workers' rights and environmental protection. If either the UK or the EU shift their rules too far, the other side could introduce tariffs. What's in the UK-EU trade deal?

"Harvesting Canadian oats, which used to attract a 54% tariff in Europe Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said when it comes to trade with the EU after Brexit: ""We want a comprehensive free trade agreement, similar to Canada's"". The EU's agreement with Canada is called the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, or Ceta for short. The EU began negotiating with Canada in 2009, and Ceta provisionally came into force in 2017, although it has not yet been signed off by all the EU member states. We've heard a lot about wanting a ""zero-tariff, zero-quota"" deal between the UK and the EU. Ceta does not do that. Ceta gets rid of most, but not all, tariffs (that's taxes on imports) on goods traded between the EU and Canada. Tariffs remain on poultry, meat and eggs. It also increases quotas (that's the amount of a product that can be exported without extra charges) but does not get rid of them altogether. For example, quotas on EU cheese exports to Canada increase from 18,500 tonnes to 31,972 tonnes a year. It does little for the trade in services and in particular almost nothing for the trade in financial services, which is very important for the UK economy. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. It also does not remove border checks, so there is still a possibility that goods have to be examined at ports to make sure they meet regulatory requirements, and their paperwork is in order. European Council President Donald Tusk, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker at the CETA summit in October 2016 Ceta protects EU ""geographical indications"", meaning for example that you can only make Parma ham in Italy and camembert cheese in France, and Canada can't import something that calls itself camembert from any other country. They have also agreed to open up government contracts to each other, so Canadian companies could bid to build French railways, for example. There is also co-operation between the two countries on standards, so a piece of equipment made in an EU country can go through all its safety and quality checks there, without needing to have them repeated in Canada - and vice versa. Ceta also allows professional qualifications to be recognised both in Canada and the EU, making it easier, for example, for architects or accountants to work in both places. And it aligns Canadian rules in some areas of copyright and patents with those of the EU. Countries that are closer to each other tend to trade more, especially in goods, and this is the case with the UK and the EU. The UK exported Â£291bn of goods and services to other EU countries in 2018, which was 45% of all UK exports. It imported Â£357bn of goods and services from the EU, which was 53% of all UK imports. On the other hand,Canada exported,external46.2bn Canadian dollars (Â£26.7bn) of goods and services to the EU in 2017, which was 7.9% of its exports. It imported 63.6bn Canadian dollars of goods and services to the EU, which was 10.5% of its imports. Ceta faced tough opposition over its environmental and civil liberties provisions The prime minister also mentioned having an arrangement with the EU similar to Australia's. The EU does not have a free trade deal with Australia. They are in negotiations for one, but they currently operate mainly on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. Reality Check: Why does a UK-EU trade deal matter? Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? There was an EU-Australia Partnership Framework agreed in 2008, which reduces barriers to trade, but was not a free trade agreement. So, trading on a similar basis to Australia would be largely the same as trading under WTO rules. In other words, it's another way of saying the UK would leave with no trade deal in place.

"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: ""Sometimes I feel very Scottish - especially after Brexit"" Former European Council president Donald Tusk says Brussels feels ""empathy"" towards an independent Scotland joining the European Union. Nicola Sturgeon has said an independent Scotland would seek full EU membership. When asked if this would be looked upon favourably, Mr Tusk said there would be enthusiasm but he warned the country would not be automatically accepted. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab warned the comments could encourage ""separatist tendencies"" in the EU. They were ""rather un-European and rather irresponsible,"" he added. ""I'm not sure European leaders, let alone here in the UK, would actually welcome that comment,"" he said. Mr Tusk, who served as European Council president for five years until November last year, told the BBC'sThe Andrew Marr Showthat he feels ""very Scottish, especially after Brexit"". When asked about the prospect of an independent Scotland joining the EU, the Polish politician said he had to ""respect the internal debate in the United Kingdom"" and it was not his role to intervene. But when pressed on the level of support in the EU towards an independent Scotland joining the union, he said: ""Emotionally I have no doubt that everyone will be enthusiastic here in Brussels, and more generally in Europe. ""If you ask me about our emotions, you will witness I think always empathy."" However he warned that any future entry bid on the part of an independent Scotland would not be automatically accepted - ""formalities"" and treaty agreements would still need to be adhered to. Herman Van Rompuy says Brexit 'has changed EU view of Scotland' Scotland would 'seek a way back in' to EU Johnson rejects Sturgeon's indyref2 demand It came as other European leaders expressed sadness at the UK leaving the EU. French President Emmanuel Macronsaid he was,external""deeply sad"" while the EU's Guy Verhofstadtpledged to tryand ""ensure the EU is a project you'll want to be a part of again"". Mr Tusk's comments come after his predecessor, Herman Van Rompuy, last year said hebelieves Brexit has changed EU attitudes to Scottish independence. Donald Tusk and former prime minister Theresa May were locked in Brexit negotiations for years Britain officially left the European Union on Friday at 23:00 GMT after 47 years of membership, and more than three years after it voted to do so in a referendum. Scotland voted in favour of the UK staying in the EUby 62% to 38% in 2016. The overall UK result backed Leave by 51.9% to 48.1%. In a speech on Brexit day, Nicola Sturgeon said there was""real and profound sadness"" felt by many Scots, also tinged with anger. An independent Scotland would require the backing of all 27 EU members to join the trading bloc and there are a number of countries which have already applied and started accession negotiations. The European Policy Centre think-tank, of which Mr Van Rompuy is president, last year published an analysis on independent Scottish membership of the EU. It concluded that the EU should ""engage positively"" with Scotland in the event of independence, if there had been a properly constituted referendum. But it said Scotland could not expect ""special treatment"" and that the Scottish government would have to accept all the obligations of membership, including agreeing in principle to join the euro.

Founder Hayley Jones said there was ""nothing"" in the city to support families and some were in a desperate position. Stoke-on-Trent City Council has been asked for comment. ""These families are eating baby food because that's the only food they're going to have in the house,"" said Ms Jones. The families have not been identified. The project was set up 18 months ago and initially the volunteers worked with about 20 families. They now help more than 400 across the city, working from a church hall in Hanley. Latest news from the West Midlands Maria Mohammad said it was ""very hard"" to get by after her husband became too ill to work Maria Mohammad, 24, is mother to four-month-old Hassan and said she could not afford to buy him a coat. She said: ""Everything was perfect before, but then my husband was diagnosed with TB so he wasn't able to work properly."" She said sometimes she felt depressed and financial troubles added to the situation. Mrs Mohammad was collecting supplies alongside Chloe Elkes, who is 20, and mother to five-month-old George. Chloe Elkes said her son, George, ""gets through so many"" nappies She came to the Nappy Project after Christmas, when she was struggling to pay the rent, and had to sell her son's old clothes to help pay it. ""I was really, really nervous,"" she said of her first visit. ""There's just so many people in this situation where you can't afford it,"" she said. ""You've got to put your pride to the side and say, 'I need help', and you can get the help here."" Mrs Jones said there was ""nothing for these families when they hit rock bottom"".

"Candidates went head-to-head at a hustings in Cardiff on Sunday People in north Wales do not feel devolution is working for them, a Labour leadership candidate has said. Lisa Nandy joined Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry and Rebecca Long Bailey at a hustings in Cardiff on Sunday. All four supported boosting devolution, with front-runner Sir Keir arguing for a federal UK. But Ms Nandy said her party may have to fight for devolution in parts of the country ""turning away from Labour"". The leadership contest follows a general election where Labour lost six seats in Wales - all with the exception of one were in the north. Meanwhile Ms Nandy and Ms Long Bailey said they would not stand in the way if a future Welsh Parliament wanted an independence referendum. Who will be Labour's next leader? What do the Labour candidates say about Scotland? Wigan MP Ms Nandy said people in north Wales ""feel very shut out from the centre of power - power in Westminster but also power in Cardiff"". ""I think if we are honest, we are going to have to go out and fight for devolution in many parts of the country that have been turning away from Labour for some time,"" she said. ""In my own constituency in Wigan, people feel that the city mayoral deal where Labour is in power hasn't delivered for them, in the same way it has delivered for Manchester. ""And when I was in Rhyl people were telling me exactly the same thing about devolution for the Welsh nation."" Ms Nandy told BBC Wales she wanted to see power devolved into towns that have not felt the benefits of major cities. ""I think the Welsh Labour government understands this really well, and in the conversations I've had with Mark Drakeford and many AMs, this is exactly what we're trying to do,"" she added. Lisa Nandy said Labour would have to ""fight"" for devolution Welsh Labour leader Mr Drakeford said he believed Ms Nandy was making a ""general point about the way in which people, who live away from where decisions are taken, often feel that those decisions aren't influenced by what matters to them"". ""We know that throughout the whole of devolution that we've had to work hard to make sure that every part of Wales feels that the National Assembly speaks for them, that their interests matter to us,"" he told BBC Wales. Sir Keir, who had won the vast majority of nominations from Welsh Labour MPs, said more powers should be devolved. ""I would not seek to impose anything on Wales - it's about agreement and working together,"" he told the hustings. He said ""radical federalism"" was the way forward, ""where more powers are closer to people"". Sir Keir said Welsh Labour needed to be a ""bigger part of decision making"" in the party. ""We don't hold it close enough,"" Sir Keir, who represents Holborn and St Pancras, said. ""There are examples of what's going on here that we should showcase as the Labour Party and the difference you can make in power."" Rebecca Long Bailey said she would want to talk to members in Wales about what powers should be devolved Ms Long Bailey, the candidate backed by the pro-Jeremy Corbyn group Momentum, said she would want a discussion with Welsh members about devolution. ""It's not a question of what powers would you like to have from Westminster,"" she said. ""It's an assumption that Wales gets all the powers it needs from Westminster and then it decides which ones it wants to share,"" the Salford and Eccles politician added. ""We've got to defend the current settlement that we have, and we've got to make the case against this government which has imposed up to Â£4bn of cuts on the Welsh assembly since 2010."" There was criticism of how the UK party had dealt with Wales, from Emily Thornberry. She said she had not been briefed, when she was due to do a TV interview in Wales, on what the impact ofLabour's promise of free broadbandwould have been for the country. The Islington South and Finsbury MP, who appealed to members to help her get on the final ballot, added: ""I remember coming down on the train with Welsh Labour when we were going to the manifesto meeting and quite frankly they hadn't been involved early enough at all. ""We do need to have a bit more respect for each other and frankly I think London has not had enough respect for Welsh Labour"". Keir Starmer made the case for ""radical federalism"" at the Cardiff hustings With six Westminster seats lost here in December and a Senedd election on the horizon next year, Wales is a priority for the next Labour leader. This was the only Welsh hustings of the three-month leadership contest and the candidates tried to outdo each other today with praise for Welsh Labour and calls for more devolution. Sir Keir Starmer, the frontrunner, has by far the most nominations from Welsh Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs) and was the only candidate with a welcoming committee awaiting him outside City Hall. But Rebecca Long Bailey, seen as the candidate closest to Jeremy Corbyn, got applause when she talked about ""open selections"" for Labour candidates, a theme associated with the Left of the party. It was a point that was rebutted by Lisa Nandy, and amid a warm and apparently friendly atmosphere amongst candidates and members, it was a reminder of the underlying tension that has existed in the party throughout the Corbyn years. A deputy leadership hustings followed the main event at the venue in Cardiff City Hall. Angela Rayner said the National Assembly elections would be ""difficult for us"", referring to a recent poll that suggested Labour could lose seats. The Stockport MP and deputy leadership candidate said: ""I don't think it is irreversible."" ""We need to make sure that our parliamentarians and our leaders in London, in Westminster know what's happening in Wales,"" she added. Who will be Labour's next leader?

"China was accused of covering-up the Sars epidemic In March 2003 it became clear a mysterious and previously unknown disease was starting to spread around the world. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) went on to infect more than 8,000 people and kill almost 800. Many of those it infected, including doctors, went from having flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia within days. The virus spread to 26 countries and China was criticised by the UN's global health body for concealing the scale of the outbreak. Now, 17 years later, the spread of a new deadly coronavirus is reviving memories of Sars and putting global scrutiny back on to the Chinese government. China has responded with tough measures, including effectively quarantining millions of residents in cities. But has its response gone far enough? And what lessons did it learn from the deadly Sars outbreak in 2003? Sars posed a huge challenge to China both as a public health crisis and a political one. The World Health Organization (WHO) was first alerted to reports of severe and unusual cases of pneumonia in the country's south in February 2003. Local officials said more than 300 people had become sick. Despite initial openness, other local government officials appeared to play down the risk or suggest the mystery threat was contained. Analysts who studied the Chinese response said the issue soon disappeared from the spotlight. Investigations later showed the first infections appeared in Guangdong Province in November 2002, but it took months for the scale of China's Sars crisis to be exposed. Physician Jiang Yanyong alerted the international media in April that the Chinese government was drastically understating the Sars threat. Dozens died in the Toronto area - with Canada becoming one of the worst- hit nations Advice was circulated to hospitals and the director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) even issued an unprecedented apology over the spread. ""Our medical departments and mass media suffered from poor co-ordination,"" Li Liming told a news conference. Combating Sars was complicated because of uncertainties about how it was spreading. The WHO issued its first global alert on 12 March 2003 after a patient hospitalised in Hanoi, Vietnam led to handfuls of medical staff becoming sick. Hong Kong's Department of Health also confirmed outbreaks of respiratory illness among its hospital workers. ""This was the first time a coronavirus had come to the attention as a pathogen that could spread around the world like this,"" Prof David Heymann, who led the WHO's infectious disease unit at the time of Sars, told the BBC. ""So in the beginning it wasn't known what it was and nobody really looked for coronaviruses such as they are doing now."" Prof Heymann told the BBC that Chinese authorities appeared to have been much more proactive with the new outbreak, including providing the WHO with information on a regular basis. This week, the WHO's director general praised China's response. The lack of transparency over Sars hurt China's standing on the international stage and caused its economic growth to slow. Health experts, including Prof Heymann, stress transparency as a key factor in preventing the spread of viruses, especially unknown ones. Once proper control measures and infection prevention were implemented, Sars was contained within months. This was aided by public health information being shared by the WHO and local governments wherever Sars was a concern. Hong Kong was one of the major hotspots for the virus. People there began to change their routines, with surgical masks becoming the norm in public. Surfaces in public areas with high risks of transmission, like lift buttons, were cleaned hourly and every day the local news carried updated tolls of those infected killed by the virus. Helier Cheung, a BBC journalist who grew up in Hong Kong, remembers she and classmates having their temperatures taken daily. Classes were suspended for several days - right in the run-up to exams - and television adverts reminded the public to wash their hands and bleach surfaces. The spread of Sars was traced to an infected doctor at Hong Kong's Metropole Hotel Her experience contrasts with that of another BBC employee who was working at a university in mainland China at the time of Sars. She remembers relying heavily on rumours and access to foreign news outlets when little official information was available. She also remembers misinformation spreading - with bowls of vinegar set on burners in classrooms in the mistaken belief they could disinfect the air. ""I do remember being worried, but very poorly informed,"" she said. Information and clarity were sparse even when students were quarantined and her campus later locked down. Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens became notorious when hundreds of residents became sick In recent days, Chinese officials have tried to show they are being much more open this time. President Xi Jinping described combating the virus as ""extremely critical"" and there have been public warnings against any attempts at cover-ups. ""Anyone who puts the face of politicians before the interests of the people will be the sinner of a millennium to the party and the people,"" a commentary on a Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission account said on Tuesday. ""Anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of [virus] cases out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity."" However, the Chinese government has strengthened its control over the flow of information since the time of Sars. Some international scientists have estimated the true number of people impacted by the new coronavirus is far higher than has been publicly confirmed. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute in London, told the BBC he became aware of rumours circulating about a new virus in Wuhan several weeks ago - well before the first cases were confirmed on 31 December. Local officials may have been very nervous to be the ones to raise the alarm, he said. ""President Xi Jinping pays a lot more attention to the international image of China than his predecessors, and he has concentrated much more power than his predecessors,"" Mr Tsang said. ""Therefore anything that could potentially have a negative impact on the international image of China becomes sensitive."" Your questions:You asked, we answered The story explained:How worried should we be? Wuhan profiled:The city now in lockdown In detail:Follow all our coverage here Chinese social media is also highly regulated and the New York Times reported that the hashtag #WuhanSARS was blocked locally. Police even questioned eight people about spreading ""rumours"" of the virus online, according to reports. The Sars outbreak was a catalyst for change in China's medical system, with health spending rising afterwards. Health officials used to report infectious diseases by filling in cards by hand and then posting or faxing them to a central office. After Sars, the government created a centralised online system that links up clinics and hospitals across the country and lets them report cases in real time. The global epidemic was eventually contained within months ""China... has developed excellent disease surveillance systems since Sars, including real-time emergency department surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, so this will help with rapid identification of new cases,"" Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research programme at Sydney's Kirby Institute, told Reuters. 'Increased likelihood' of new virus reaching UK ""Spreading at alarming rate"" - one doctor in Wuhan speaks Gabriel Leung, chair of public health at Hong Kong University, said the timescale of ""recognising, characterising, releasing and reporting information"" had been vastly improved from the time of the Sars outbreak. ""What did take months during the time of Sars is now compressed into a matter of weeks or days,"" he told a news conference earlier this week. But not all of the public health reforms suggested after Sars have been implemented. This video can not be played Fears over new coronavirus in China trigger face mask shortgae In 2006, Zhong Nanshan, the doctor who identified Sars and who is leading the Chinese government's efforts in Wuhan, said it was crucial to clean up China's wildlife markets, which were ""poorly managed and insanitary"" and ""a dangerous source of possible new infections"". But reports from Wuhan suggest inter-species transmission is also at the centre of the new outbreak. A market in Wuhan, which was shuttered the day after the first cases were confirmed, is thought to have sold animals including rats, live wolf pups and civets, the last of which have been linked with previous pandemics in the past. Typically, traditional use in local delicacies or medicines has hindered efforts to clean-up the animal trade. But with a market again identified as a source of an outbreak, even official media are mobilising appeals against the wildlife trade in response. Propaganda posts telling people #SupportBanningWildAnimalMarkets have been widely shared on Chinese social media. Whether the radical measures implemented by China, going beyond even WHO recommendations, are enough to avoid a repeat of Sars remains to be seen. Dr W Ian Lipkin, a US-based epidemiologist who worked on Sars, is among the experts who have cast doubt on whether the travel restrictions from cities, including Wuhan, will be enough to stop the global spread.

"This video can not be played Raab: EU alignment not a red line, it's not even in negotiating room Britain will ""not be aligning with EU rules"" in any post-Brexit trade deal, the foreign secretary  has said. Dominic Raab argued agreeing to stick strongly with EU regulations would ""defeat the point of Brexit"". But Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the UK needed to commit to a level playing field to get a free trade deal. Talks to negotiate a free trade deal between the UK and the EU are due to start next month, following the UK's formal withdrawal from the bloc. On Monday Boris Johnson is expected to set out his position ahead of those talks, where he will tell the EU he is prepared to accept customs checks at Britain's borders if he cannot secure the sort of trade deal he wants. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier will also outline his approach to negotiations. Brexit: What happens next? Why does a UK-EU trade deal matter? Seven things Brexit will change and seven it won't What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? One option the PM could support would be a Canada-style free trade deal which allows tariff-free trade for the majority of goods, but would not cover the UK's service industry - which accounts for more than 80% of UK jobs. Reports in recent days have suggested EU chiefs want the UK to continue to follow EU rules on standards and state subsidies - while accepting the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in any trade disputes. The PM is expected to say that he will accept no alignment and no jurisdiction of the European courts when talks start in March. He is also preparing to say he would rule out relaxing rules on workers' rights, food hygiene standards and environmental protections. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Varadkar said it was possible for the UK to have a ""Canada-style agreement"". However, he added: ""Canada isn't the UK; you're geographically part of the European continent, we share seas and airspace and our economies are very integrated. ""And one thing we feel very strongly in the EU is that if we are going to have tariff-free, quota-free trade with the UK, which is essentially what we have with Canada on almost everything, then that needs to come with a level playing field. ""We, for example would have very strong views on fair competition and state aid."" A level playing field is a trade policy phrase for a set of common rules and standards that prevent businesses in one country undercutting their rivals over those operating in other countries in areas such as workers' rights and environmental protections. He also cautioned against ""setting rigid red lines"" for the post-Brexit trade negotiations arguing ""it makes coming to an agreement more difficult because the other side doesn't feel like it has got a fair deal unless those red lines are turned pink."" Mr Raab said the UK would enter trade talks ""with a spirit of goodwill"" but added ""the legislative alignment - it just ain't happening"". Brexit: What is a level playing field? Varadkar warns election could hit EU trade talks Mavericks to mainstream: The long campaign for Brexit How the UK celebrated joining Europe Labour's John McDonnell said Mr Johnson's desire to diverge from EU rules ""contradict"" what the PM had previously said on protecting environmental, consumer and employment rights. ""On the one hand he said there will be [protections] on the other hand he is sabre-rattling saying that won't happen in the negotiations,"" he said. But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage welcomed the prime minister's approach arguing it was in the UK's ""national interest"" to be ""a competitor on their [the EU's] doorstep."" This video can not be played Leo Varadkar on UK seating advice: ""Surely everyone should be trying to work with everyone"" The government also wants to make progress in striking free trade agreements with countries such as the United States, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. The EU's own approach to the negotiations needs to be agreed by all 27 member states - which would be unlikely to happen before the end of February. While the UK officially left the EU at 23:00 GMT on Friday, it will remain wedded to EU rules during a transition period which ends in December this year. The UK can request an extension to this transition period, but Mr Johnson has previously said he will not do so.

"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: ""Sometimes I feel very Scottish - especially after Brexit"" Former European Council president Donald Tusk says Brussels feels ""empathy"" towards an independent Scotland joining the European Union. Nicola Sturgeon has said an independent Scotland would seek full EU membership. When asked if this would be looked upon favourably, Mr Tusk said there would be enthusiasm but he warned the country would not be automatically accepted. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab warned the comments could encourage ""separatist tendencies"" in the EU. They were ""rather un-European and rather irresponsible,"" he added. ""I'm not sure European leaders, let alone here in the UK, would actually welcome that comment,"" he said. Mr Tusk, who served as European Council president for five years until November last year, told the BBC'sThe Andrew Marr Showthat he feels ""very Scottish, especially after Brexit"". When asked about the prospect of an independent Scotland joining the EU, the Polish politician said he had to ""respect the internal debate in the United Kingdom"" and it was not his role to intervene. But when pressed on the level of support in the EU towards an independent Scotland joining the union, he said: ""Emotionally I have no doubt that everyone will be enthusiastic here in Brussels, and more generally in Europe. ""If you ask me about our emotions, you will witness I think always empathy."" However he warned that any future entry bid on the part of an independent Scotland would not be automatically accepted - ""formalities"" and treaty agreements would still need to be adhered to. Herman Van Rompuy says Brexit 'has changed EU view of Scotland' Scotland would 'seek a way back in' to EU Johnson rejects Sturgeon's indyref2 demand It came as other European leaders expressed sadness at the UK leaving the EU. French President Emmanuel Macronsaid he was,external""deeply sad"" while the EU's Guy Verhofstadtpledged to tryand ""ensure the EU is a project you'll want to be a part of again"". Mr Tusk's comments come after his predecessor, Herman Van Rompuy, last year said hebelieves Brexit has changed EU attitudes to Scottish independence. Donald Tusk and former prime minister Theresa May were locked in Brexit negotiations for years Britain officially left the European Union on Friday at 23:00 GMT after 47 years of membership, and more than three years after it voted to do so in a referendum. Scotland voted in favour of the UK staying in the EUby 62% to 38% in 2016. The overall UK result backed Leave by 51.9% to 48.1%. In a speech on Brexit day, Nicola Sturgeon said there was""real and profound sadness"" felt by many Scots, also tinged with anger. An independent Scotland would require the backing of all 27 EU members to join the trading bloc and there are a number of countries which have already applied and started accession negotiations. The European Policy Centre think-tank, of which Mr Van Rompuy is president, last year published an analysis on independent Scottish membership of the EU. It concluded that the EU should ""engage positively"" with Scotland in the event of independence, if there had been a properly constituted referendum. But it said Scotland could not expect ""special treatment"" and that the Scottish government would have to accept all the obligations of membership, including agreeing in principle to join the euro.

"This video can not be played Matt Raw, who was flown out of Wuhan, shows the BBC his living quarters at Arrowe Park Hospital One of the two people to test positive for the new coronavirus in the UK is a student at the University of York. The pair - who are related - were confirmed as having coronavirus after being taken ill at a hotel in York. The university said the student was not on campus or in student accommodation before or after exposure to the virus. Public Health England (PHE) said it was making ""good progress"" in tracing people who have come into close contact with the two Chinese nationals. Social media tackles coronavirus fake news Countries close borders as coronavirus spreads UK pharmacies see sanitiser sales spike Vice-chancellor Prof Charlie Jeffery said the immediate concern was for the student and their family, along with the health and wellbeing of staff, students and visitors. He said the risk of the infection being passed on to other people on campus was low, adding the university is open and continuing to operate as normal. Prof Jeffery added: ""I want to reiterate to students, staff, parents and visitors that we're working with our partners across the city to ensure that York and the university remain a safe and welcoming place to live, work and visit."" The university's Samara Jones and Prof Charlie Jeffery made a statement on Saturday University of York Students' Union president Samara Jones said many students were likely to be worried by the news but would support one another. She encouraged students with any questions to keep an eye on theuniversity website for any developments,externaland key information. The University has set up a dedicated helpline on 01904 809571. UK man in Wuhan worried he will be 'forgotten' Wuhan lockdown: How people are still getting food Meanwhile, the University of Derby confirmed ""a very small number"" of students who came back from Wuhan before travel restrictions were put in place were self-isolating for 14 days. A spokeswoman said all the students were fit and well. The Department of Health said no further positive cases had been confirmed in the UK by 14:00 GMT on Saturday, with 201 people testing negative from 203 tests. PHE said those who have been in close contact - defined as being within two metres for 15 minutes or more - with the York pair would receive health advice. Professor Sharon Peacock, director of its National Infection Service said staff do not currently have ""any idea"" how many people that might be. Translators are on hand to make sure information from the patients about places they have visited and people they have spent time with is as accurate as possible, according to PHE. Those contacts thought to be at high risk are given daily health checks and asked to self-isolate. Anyone who does fall ill will be offered a test to see whether they too have contracted the virus - and, if they have, the process of tracing their close contacts would start again, PHE added. The death toll from the new virus, which is officially called 2019-nCov,now stands at 304. All the deaths occurred within China and the majority - 294 - were in Hubei province, where the virus originated. Hubei recorded 45 more deaths on Saturday. It comes as the 83 Britons evacuated from Wuhan, in Hubei province, on Friday began two weeks in quarantine. The two York patients, whose diagnosis was announced on Friday morning, were staying at the Staycity apartment-hotel when medics were called. The two people with coronavirus stayed at the Staycity apartment-hotel in York Staycity said that the hotel will stay open and the apartment used by the two patients disinfected. They are now being treated at a specialist infectious diseases unit at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle and residents of the city are being reassured they are not at risk. In China, cases of the virus have reached nearly 12,000 - with more than 100 cases reported in 22 other countries. On Friday, the Foreign Office said it would withdraw some non-essential embassy staff and their families from mainland China. The ambassador and staff who needed to continue ""critical work"" would remain, while British nationals in China would continue to have access to 24/7 consular assistance. Some 83 UK nationals and 27 others were flown into the UKon a chartered evacuation flightfrom the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak of coronavirus began. Before boarding the flight, passengers had to sign papers agreeing to an enforced period of isolation. The UK nationals were taken by coach to Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral on Friday evening. Five coaches transported those evacuated from Wuhan to the north west of England on Friday They will spend 14 days in quarantine - but not solitary confinement - in two apartment blocks normally used to house nurses, who have been moved to local hotels. The UK evacuees are being put up in fully-furnished rooms, including kitchens, and provided with food and laundry facilities. Families are being kept together, with toys and baby equipment available. They will have access to a team of medical staff who will closely monitor their condition and any developing symptoms. How the plague taught us to fight coronavirus Coronavirus: How worried should we be? Matt Raw, one of those in quarantine, told BBC News that he and his family ""were extremely glad to be here"". He said he, his wife and his mother were staying in a four-bedroom apartment, along with another woman and her daughter. He stressed they were feeling fine and had ""an army"" of people looking after them. Mr Raw said there was an area outside where they were able to get some fresh air, adding they were ""allowed contact with anybody within the facility, as long as we're wearing face masks"". Horseman Coaches, which transported the evacuees to the hospital, said health officials advised its drivers did not need to wear protective clothing for the journey. Five drivers will enter a two-week period of isolation at home as a precaution and the vehicles used will be subject to a ""military-grade cleansing process"", the company added. Meanwhile, aBritish man staying in Wuhan to be with his family has expressed concernthe UK government will ""forget"" him. On Thursday, the UK's four chief medical officers raised the risk level of the illness from low to moderate and the World Health Organisation (WHO)declared an international public health emergency. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty: ""There is a high chance that people will get better and end up with a relatively minor disease"" Virus experts said they were not surprised to see cases in the UK but there was no reason to panic. Meanwhile, the United States declared a public health emergency on Friday night, with President Donald Trump signing an orderwhich will temporarily bar entry for most foreign nationalswho have travelled in China within the last 14 days. On Saturday, Australia said it too would refuse entry to all non-citizens arriving from China. On Friday, it emerged that the number of new coronavirus cases worldwide had overtaken that of the 2003 Sars epidemic. Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? Wuhan lockdown: How people are still getting food However, the mortality rate is currently low, at 2% - less than Sars, at 10% and Ebola, at 70%, WHO's chief medical officer says.

"The Speedibake factory is near Wakefield's Westgate Retail Park About 140 firefighters are tackling a major fire at an industrial bakery in Wakefield, which is covering the area in thick black smoke. The blaze at the Speedibake factory, close to Westgate Retail Park, started at about 13:30 GMT. Police said there were no reports of injuries but the fire service said the ""building construction may contain asbestos"". People living nearby have been told to shut all doors and windows. The wind is also causing smoke to blow towards the city centre, West Yorkshire Police said. Several roads have been shut and drivers have been told to find alternative routes. Wakefield Counciltweeted,externalanyone ""affected by the fire in Wakefield and unable to get home please make your way to Thornes Park Stadium"", adding it would ""remain open"". Police urged those living nearby to close their windows and doors due to the amount of smoke A spokesperson told BBC News: ""There are 15 to 20 people currently there at the rest centre who are affected."" They said the council was helping people with transport to reach the stadium and it would help them return once the area was declared safe. Wakefield residents who were earlier evacuated from the area can now return home, the council added, but they ""are advised to keep all windows and doors closed as a precaution"". People also reported being evacuated from nearby buildings. Connor Strachan, 19, from Alverthorpe, and Eleanor Goldthorpe, 17, had planned to watch Jumanji at the Cineworld cinema opposite the bakery, but when they arrived they were told they had to wait in the building. Mr Strachan said there were nearly 100 people at the cinema, including some from Mecca Bingo directly opposite the bakery. He said: ""We were eventually let out, a lot of the other buildings were evacuated too."" Cineworld Wakefield tweeted at 18:00 GMT to say it was currently closed. This video can not be played Smoke from the fire in Wakefield is blowing towards the city centre Nicky Harley was going to the B&Q shop on the retail park when the fire broke out. ""As I approached the store I saw police officers in masks telling people to move back,"" she said. ""There was heavy thick black smoke."" She said she then walked over to a nearby supermarket and saw people with their hands over their mouths saying they felt light headed. ""I also felt faint and light headed,"" she said. ""My friend is a nurse and she told me there might be a risk of airborne asbestos."" West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service initially warned of the potential for asbestos in the smoke plume, but later confirmed the substance was not present in the section of building hit by the blaze. Eyewitness Nicky Harley said people reported feeling faint due to the smoke Power cuts were also reported but electricity has since been restored. Northern Powergrid tweeted to thank customers for their patience during the outage. Some people on social media also reported hearing explosions coming from the factory. Andrew Jackson, BBC News Great palls of smoke have been covering much of the city skyline, with people stopping to look in astonishment. The wind has blown the acrid smoke across large parts of the city as firefighters work to contain the blaze and police wearing protective masks have put road blocks around the scene, stopping people from getting too close to the factory. People have been starting to make their way home and the area around the blaze is eerily quiet, disturbed only by the sound of trains passing by on a nearby line. In a statement, West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said: ""As a precautionary measure we are advising people living in the vicinity to remain indoors and keep windows and a doors closed."" The service said it expected to remain at the scene for the next 24 to 48 hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Hayley Jones set up the Nappy Project charity Hard-up mothers have resorted to eating donated baby food, a charity has said. The Nappy Project, in Stoke-on-Trent, supplies nappies, wipes and baby food to families living in poverty. It received more than 100 new referrals for families in need in January alone. Founder Hayley Jones said there was ""nothing"" in the city to support families and some were in a desperate position. Stoke-on-Trent City Council has been asked for comment. ""These families are eating baby food because that's the only food they're going to have in the house,"" said Ms Jones. The families have not been identified. The project was set up 18 months ago and initially the volunteers worked with about 20 families. They now help more than 400 across the city, working from a church hall in Hanley. Latest news from the West Midlands Maria Mohammad said it was ""very hard"" to get by after her husband became too ill to work Maria Mohammad, 24, is mother to four-month-old Hassan and said she could not afford to buy him a coat. She said: ""Everything was perfect before, but then my husband was diagnosed with TB so he wasn't able to work properly."" She said sometimes she felt depressed and financial troubles added to the situation. Mrs Mohammad was collecting supplies alongside Chloe Elkes, who is 20, and mother to five-month-old George. Chloe Elkes said her son, George, ""gets through so many"" nappies She came to the Nappy Project after Christmas, when she was struggling to pay the rent, and had to sell her son's old clothes to help pay it. ""I was really, really nervous,"" she said of her first visit. ""There's just so many people in this situation where you can't afford it,"" she said. ""You've got to put your pride to the side and say, 'I need help', and you can get the help here."" Mrs Jones said there was ""nothing for these families when they hit rock bottom"". ""These women are just emotionally drained, they're broken women,"" she said. If you have been affected by the issues raised in this article, help and support is available viaBBC Action Line.
