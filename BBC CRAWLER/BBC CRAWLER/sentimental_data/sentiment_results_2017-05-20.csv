"Millwall's victory over Bradford sees them return to the Championship following relegation in 2015 Steve Morison volleyed a late winner as Millwall won promotion to the Championship with victory over Bradford in the League One play-off final. Bradford controlled the first half, Jordan Archer saving well to stop Billy Clarke giving them the lead at Wembley. Millwall improved and Jed Wallace dragged a shot wide when put through. But Morison stabbed in Lee Gregory's header to send Millwall to the second tier after two years away, with Lions fans invading the pitch at full-time. Tony McMahon had Bradford's best chance to equalise in stoppage time, but the full-back could only fire wide from a tight angle. Millwall fans flooded on to the pitch at the final whistle, but although a small number of supporters confronted Bradford's dejected players there did not appear to be signs of serious trouble. Those scenes could do nothing to dampen the Lions' players spirits, however, as they laid to rest their demons from play-off final defeat by Barnsley a year ago. READ MORE: McCall 'close to hitting' Millwall fans READ MORE: It was Millwall's time - Harris READ MORE: Millwall promoted to the Championship as it happened Jordan Archer pulled off a fingertip save to deny Billy Clark from Bradford's best chance Bradford were aiming to return to the Championship for the first time since suffering relegation in 2004, and they looked well set to do so after a dominant first-half showing. Clarke and Mark Marshall were particularly influential, regularly finding space in between Millwall's defence and midfield. But the Bantams were punished for poor decisions and the lack of a final ball, with Clarke's chance their only real opportunity. Marshall broke free down the left on a counter-attack, and weighted his through ball perfectly into the path of Clarke. But Archer - who conceded twice in 20 minutes in Millwall's defeat by Barnsley at Wembley last season - made a wonderful save to his left to turn the ball behind. Steve Morison scored Millwall's winner five minutes from time Millwall made a similarly slow start to this year's final, but this time Archer and his defence held firm against waves of pressure. Neil Harris' side emerged a different team after the break, with Wallace inches away from handing his side the lead after being played through by Gregory. Bradford offered less of a threat as the game went on, and Millwall's direct approach finally paid dividends inside the final 10 minutes. Wallace's cross from the left was flicked on brilliantly by Gregory, with Morison holding off James Meredith at the back post to secure his side a place in the Championship.

"Pep Guardiola, Jurgen Klopp and Arsene Wenger are chasing a place in next season's Champions League Manchester City, Liverpool and Arsenal will compete for England's final two Champions League places as the Premier League season finishes on Sunday. City can clinch third spot, and a place in the group stage, by winning at Watford, while Liverpool will secure at least fourth by beating Middlesbrough. But Arsenal can sneak into the top four if one of their rivals slips up and they beat Everton at Emirates Stadium. All 20 teams are in action, with every match kicking off at 15:00 BST. So what are the big issues on the final day - and what is the latest team news? A one-game play-off for Europe? Here's how Select your Premier League team of the season Quiz: How well do you remember this season? Lawro's predictions against Royal Blood Play the Premier League predictor game Manchester City need a point at Watford to guarantee a top-four finish - but winning and finishing third will take them straight into next season's Champions League group stages. The team in fourth place will go into a two-legged play-off in August, while whoever finishes fifth will receive a place in the Europa League. With just six points separating Southampton, in eighth, and 16th-placed Watford, several teams also have the opportunity to improve their league position - and increase their share of Premier League prize money. Burnley, for instance, could finish as low as 17th, earning Â£7.6m in prize money, or as high as 11th, which would be worth Â£19m - a difference of Â£11.4m. Harry Kane looks set to win the Premier League Golden Boot, awarded to the competition's leading scorer, thanks to his four goals in Tottenham's 6-1 victory at Leicester on Thursday. Spurs go to relegated Hull on Sunday with Kane on 26 league goals for the season, two clear of Everton's Romelu Lukaku. Belgium striker Lukaku and Arsenal's Alexis Sanchez, third in the standings on 23 goals, will face each other at Emirates Stadium as they look to catch Kane. No team has ever won 30 league matches in a 38-game top-flight season - but Chelsea will be the first to do so if they beat bottom club Sunderland at Stamford Bridge. Antonio Conte's side secured the Premier League title - the club's fifth in 13 seasons - with a 1-0 victory at West Brom on 12 May, and will receive the trophy after Sunday's game. Chelsea managed 29 league wins in a season, in 2004-05 and 2005-06, twice under Jose Mourinho. Only two teams in the history of the English top division have achieved more - Tottenham won 31 games in 1960-61 and Liverpool 30 in 1978-79 - and they both did it in 42-match seasons. John Terry made his Chelsea debut in October 1998 Sunderland, Middlesbrough and Hull are all leaving the Premier League after finishing in the bottom three, but there will be individual farewells too. Chelsea captain John Terry is set to end his 22-year stay at Stamford Bridge by playing his 717th game for the club. At Watford, manager Walter Mazzarri will take charge for the final time, with his departure having been confirmed on Wednesday. A number of other players may yet be turning out for their clubs for the final time, with the futures of Wayne Rooney, Ross Barkley, Romelu Lukaku, Michael Keane and Gylfi Sigurdsson among those in doubt. One question that will not be answered tomorrow concerns the future of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger - who is out of contract this summer. Asked on Friday if he would extend his 21-year reign, Wenger said only thathis future would be decidedat a board meeting to follow the FA Cup final against Chelsea on 27 May. All games kick-off at 15:00 BST on Sunday Arsenal v Everton Aaron Ramsey is fit for Arsenal despite limping off against Sunderland in midweek with a thigh strain. Defender Laurent Koscielny could again miss out because of a calf problem, while Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is sidelined by a hamstring injury. Everton manager Ronald Koeman has no new injury concerns. It remains to be seen whether the match will mark the final Everton appearance of Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley, whose futures at the club are in doubt. Read more quotes, stats and build-up Burnley v West Ham Burnley could welcome back Michael Keane, who has missed their past two games because of a calf injury. Fellow centre-back Ben Mee is again set to miss out with a shin problem. West Ham are without centre-back Winston Reid, who has had surgery to treat a knee injury, so 18-year-old Declan Rice may deputise. Fellow defender Angelo Ogbonna, who returned to the match-day squad last weekend after three months out, is also available but lacks match fitness. Read more quotes, stats and build-up Chelsea v Sunderland Chelsea captain Gary Cahill and top scorer Diego Costa are among the players likely to be recalled by the champions after Antonio Conte made nine changes for Monday's win over Watford. John Terry could made his 717th appearance for the Blues in his last game at Stamford Bridge as a player. Relegated Sunderland will be without 11 injured players. Defender Lamine Kone and midfielder Didier Ndong are the latest absentees because of dead legs. Read more quotes, stats and build-up Hull City v Tottenham Hull will be without Evandro, Harry Maguire and Abel Hernandez through injury.

Christian Eriksen is likely to be recalled after being rested against Leicester on Thursday, while Filip Lesniak could start. Read more quotes, stats and build-up Leicester City v Bournemouth Leicester are again without defender Robert Huth, who is nursing a foot injury, but Andy King could return from a hamstring problem. Wes Morgan, Danny Drinkwater, Molla Wague and Nampalys Mendy remain out. Bournemouth could welcome back midfielders Dan Gosling and Andrew Surman after their respective calf and knee problems. They are definitely without the injured Benik Afobe, while Lewis Cook is away with the England Under-20 side. Read more quotes, stats and build-up Liverpool v Middlesbrough Liverpool are hopeful forward Roberto Firmino will be fit to play on Sunday despite a muscle problem. If he is unavailable then the Reds could select the same starting line-up that began the 4-0 win at West Ham. Jurgen Klopp's side need a win to guarantee qualification for next season's Champions League. Middlesbrough boss Steve Agnew may again be without Daniel Ayala, Gaston Ramirez and Victor Valdes because of injury. Read more quotes, stats and build-up Manchester United v Crystal Palace Manchester United goalkeeper Joel Pereira is expected to be given his Premier League debut on Sunday. Demi Mitchell, Angel Gomes, Josh Harrop and Scott McTominay could make their senior bows, while Paul Pogba and Timothy Fosu-Mensah will play. Marouane Fellaini and Chris Smalling have minor injuries and may be rested for the Europa League final. James Tomkins should be fit for Crystal Palace after an ankle problem but Yohan Cabaye is a doubt because of a foot injury. Andros Townsend will miss the game because of an Achilles injury, while Scott Dann is expected to be absent with a knee problem.

"Ian Brady's notoriety and significance goes beyond the criminal to the political and the cultural Ian Brady's mug shot has become visual shorthand for psychopathic evil.  With his accomplice Myra Hindley, he occupies an especially ignominious place in our national folklore. Margaret Thatcher described their crimes as ""the most hideous and evil in modern times"".  ABBC News article in 2002,externalsuggested the so-called ""Moors Murderers"" had set ""the benchmark by which other acts of evil are measured"". Moors Murderer Ian Brady dies Obituary: Ian Brady Obituary: Myra Hindley,external But Brady's notoriety goes beyond the criminal to the political and the cultural. He became an important figure in 20th Century British history as a focus for debate about crime and punishment, good and evil, and the permissive society. Brady and Hindley were charged with their crimes 11 days after the Murder (Abolition of the Death Penalty) Act had received royal assent in 1965. They ""cheated the gallows by a year"" according to some, and were placed at the heart of a debate over capital punishment that would rumble on for more than a decade. The horrific detail of their apparently motiveless crimes - the abduction, torture and murder of children and young people and the burying of the bodies on what the tabloids called ""fog-shrouded wild moorlands"" - was a horror story in the Gothic tradition that provided the perfect test of public opinion on ending the death penalty. Ian Brady death: The five victims of the Moors Murderers The boy who escaped Myra Hindley's clutches Police searches of Saddleworth moor began in the 1960s, including this area where the body of Lesley Downey was found Successive home secretaries sought to reassure the public that, for the most heinous crimes, life imprisonment meant just that. But Brady was more than just a debating chip in the argument over the hangman. For many, he became a terrifying symbol of social upheaval. His slicked back rocker-style hair and sociopathic stare chimed with the moral panic over youth culture. Mod and rocker clashes in the mid-60s were described by one newspaper as a symptom of the ""disintegration of a nation's character"". Brady and his crimes were held up as the consequences of moral decay. Writing about the murders, the novelist CP Snow argued that ""permissive attitudes"" were the ""earth out of which the poisonous flower grew"". Brady's depravity was linked to fears about changing morality in the so-called Swinging 60s The novelist Pamela Hansford Johnson - who was married to Snow - made a similar point in her book On Iniquity in 1967. She suggested that Brady and Hindley's crimes had been an indictment of 1960s Britain. ""A wound in the flesh of our society had cracked open,"" she wrote. ""We looked into it, and we smelled the sepsis."" Brady helped shape the age-old argument that permissiveness leads to violent crime. Commentators noted how he had been born ""out of wedlock"" and had begun a life of criminality as a juvenile. In the mid-60s, crime was rising rapidly and the face of the bastard Ian Brady was the backdrop. He personified ""pure evil"" just as his innocent young victims personified ""pure good"". Former BBC News reporter: My letters from Ian Brady For the press and politicians, the Moors Murderers were powerful examples of the clear but simplistic divide between the criminal underclass and the law-abiding majority, at a time when anxiety about law and order was rising. Brady's fascination with Adolf Hitler and the Nazis confirmed the sense that he was the epitome of social depravity. From his arrest until the day he died more than 50 years later, his haunting visage - along with that of Myra Hindley - have been routinely deployed as images of the threat. He is the child snatcher, the bogeyman, the beast. He is the monster. Moors Murderer Ian Brady dies Obituary: Ian Brady Who were Ian Brady's victims?

"President Trump, a reluctant traveller, is facing a nine-day, five-country tour Donald Trump sets foot on foreign soil on Saturday for the first time since he was elected, marking the start of a nine-day trip fraught with pitfalls for a president known to depend on home comforts. An ambitious itinerary will take him from Saudi Arabia to Israel and on to Belgium, Italy, and the Vatican, with Nato and G7 summits towards the tail end of the trip. George W Bush had visited two countries by this point in his first term and Barack Obama nine. But wary of spending as much as a night away from his own bed, Mr Trump has kept even domestic travel to a minimum. Instead he has spent his presidential honeymoon mostly hunkered in the White House or his Mar-a-Lago resort, dogged bya deepening scandal over his campaign's ties to Russia. As a candidate he told reporters he was unlikely to travel abroad much because America required his undivided attention, but the evidence suggests the 45th president has always been a homebody. On the campaign trail he returned to his gilded Manhattan apartment after nearly every rally, by helicopter or private jet, and former business aides say he was always reluctant to sleep anywhere but a Trump-branded property. ""Trump is a man who likes to be on the couch with a good cheeseburger,"" Roger Stone, a long-time friend and former adviser, told Reuters during the campaign. ""He likes being in his own bed, even if it means coming into (New York airports) Teterboro or LaGuardia after midnight."" But it's a long way from the Vatican to the White House. So, unable to bring Trump back to the US, the president's staff has made plans to bring the US to Trump. In Saudi Arabia he will be served steak with tomato ketchup - his favourite meal - alongside the local cuisine prepared by his hosts, the AP reported. Mr Trump is said to dislike spending the night away from his own bed The president passed up a typical first foray to Canada or Mexico - an easy option taken by every president since Reagan - and initial plans for a short trip to Europe ballooned into a nine-day, five-country tour taking in two major summits. ""This is an enormously complex undertaking, there are so many things that will be challenging for Trump it's headspinning,"" said Daniel Benjamin, who travelled extensively on Air Force One as Bill Clinton's foreign policy speechwriter. ""The first thing is simply the pace. If you look at how Trump spends his days in the White House, it seems to be an enormous amount of time watching TV and not much else. But these trips are punishing, he will be meeting an enormous number of people and it requires tremendous energy and focus - not his strong suit."" The president's team has reportedly attempted to build downtime into his schedule wherever possible, and instructed foreign delegations that he prefers short presentations with lots of visual aids. His limited attention span is said to have already affected preparation for the trip. Aides threaded the president's own name through the paragraphs of a two-page briefing memo in order to hold his interest, the New York Times reported on Friday. Preparations will also have been damaged by the Russia inquiries and the firing of FBI director James Comey, as well as a lack of senior leaders in place at the State Department, where the administration has failed to fill gaps under Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. This video can not be played Trump's first trip: What's on the agenda in Saudi Arabia? One of the president's first duties on this trip will be to deliver a speech on religion in Saudi Arabia - reportedly being drafted by Trump adviser Stephen Miller, the man behind the administration's misfired travel ban. ""Going to Saudi Arabia and talking about Islam is like going blindfold into a minefield, on a pogo stick,"" said Mr Benjamin. ""Speeches would normally be worked on for four to six weeks in advance, but this is an understaffed White House that has been focused on a fusillade of bad news. So unless they've discovered a secret for no sleep, they must be seriously distracted."" Mr Trump's team will be expected to respond from the road to breaking news and political developments at home and abroad, as well as shepherd the president around any potential own goals or gaffes in front of his hosts. Presidents past have suffered indignities on foreign trips. George W Bush famously attempted to leave a press conference in China via a locked door, and had a shoe thrown at him at a press conference in Iraq. His father, George HW Bush, vomited into the lap of the Japanese prime minister. Departing from protocol can lead to mishaps. President Obama was criticised for bowing to Japanese Emperor Akihito and Michelle Obama for hugging Queen Elizabeth. George W Bush - who had his fair share - gave German Chancellor Angela Merkel an ill-advised and unwelcome shoulder massage. Mr Trump appeared to decline to shake hands with German chancellor in April, leaving her bemused But if Mr Trump's team can steer him ably around these pitfalls, he does have a couple of things going for him. He is taking the majority of his senior staff and the first lady, which may offer a sense of stability. Mrs Trump, who was born in Slovenia and lived in France and Italy before moving the US, is a more seasoned traveller. Mr Trump visited her home country once, and stayed just one evening. ""At least I can say that I went,"" he later said. He has also chosen to begin in a part of the world that will offer a warm reception. The president's hard line on Iran, along with other overtures, has endeared him to Saudi Arabia and to Israel, and both countries have a vested interest in good relations with the new administration. ""He is going to want it to be successful and they're going to want it to be successful, and my guess is it will be successful,"" said Stephen Hadley, a former national security adviser who travelled widely with George W Bush. ""The truth is that nobody is prepared for being president until they're the president. The flipside with Trump is that this is a guy who's been in the public eye for 30 years, who's very media savvy and who likes to be in the limelight."" Visiting the Pope ""would be hard to get wrong"", said Mr Hadley, but at the two summits the president may face testy exchanges with leaders aggrieved by his anti-EU proselytising, anti-refugee sentiment and high-handed demands for greater Nato payments. Mr Trump had what appeared to be a frosty meeting in Washington in April with Mrs Merkel, who he openly criticised during the campaign. Added to that, this is a long and busy first trip for any president. ""There is real risk that he will tire towards the end,"" said Mr Hadley. ""At these summit meetings you might have 28 heads of state and government and they all want to say something, and the president has to sit and listen to all of them. That will tax any world leader, let alone one who finds it hard to sit still.""

"Princess Sheikha Moza bint Nasser's visit to Sudan did not go down well in Egypt Reports that Hollywood star Angeline Jolie is planning to make a movie about Sudan's history have sparked a row with Egypt, and BBC Africa's Mohanad Hashim says it is about much more than who has the biggest pyramids. The latest twist in a long-running feud between Egyptians and Sudanese is over controversial claims that a film is to be made in Sudan to showcase the country's contribution to human civilization. Various media have reported that a Qatari production company would fund the film, which would apparently feature Hollywood stars Angelina Jolie and Leonardo Di Caprio. It is meant to promote historical tourism in Sudan by narrating the country's ancient Nubian history. ""Angelina Jolie to visit Sudan at the end of the month and Khartoum is the last to know"" The claims were so widespread that even the British ambassador to Sudan was caught up in the fray, tweeting on the story: Sudanese tweeters published memes showing Jolie depicted as a Nubian queen and shared reports of press conferences confirming the Hollywood star and UN ambassador would visit the country in May to scout the film's locations. An Egyptian TV channel eveninterviewed Sudanese designer Samar Darwish,externalwho was reported to be the costume designer for Jolie. However, none of this has been confirmed. The row kicked off in March, when the wife of the former Qatari Emir, Princess Sheikha Moza bint Nasser, visited Sudan as a United Nations ambassador. Egyptians were unhappy with the princess' description of Sudan as the ""mother of the world"" An Egyptian talk-show host said Sudan's pyramids were like cheese triangles Photos of Sheikha Moza's visit to the al-Bajrawyah pyramids, a site that houses several Meroitic pyramids that date from 320 BC - 50 AD, were widely publicised by Qatari-owned Pan-Arab networks. The pictures were widely circulated on social media too. But across Egypt's TV networks, the visit was ridiculed and criticised. Qatar's move to invest $135m (Â£100m) in projects to develop Sudan's archaeological sites is seen by many in Cairo as an attempt to undermine the struggling tourism sector in Egypt and part of ongoing efforts by the Gulf emirate to discredit Egypt and its leadership. Reacting to the pictures of the princess by the Sudanese pyramids, Azmi Mujahid, a talk-show host on Egyptian Al-Assema TV mocked the Sudanese pyramids. ""All the world's stars have had their pictures taken by the [Giza] Pyramid but Sheikha Moza had a picture next to two [cheese triangles] in Sudan,"" he said. The barrage of ridicule aimed at the size of the Sudanese pyramids made the Sudanese minister of information weigh in. Ahmed Osman said: ""Sudan's pyramids were older than Egypt's by 2,000 years"", a claim disputed by archaeologists. Other Sudanese were quick to point out that their country has a much larger collection of pyramids - 230 in total. Egyptians have always prided themselves in claiming that ""Egypt is the mother of the world"". Any visitor to Egypt would recognize the claim made and perpetuated by the official and popular narrative that Egypt is a ""7,000-year-old civilization"". This is why a hand-written note written by the Qatari princess that Sudan was the ""mother of the world"" fell foul of Egyptian commentators and social media users. This war of words between the two neighbours shows increasing tension over conflicting positions on issues such as: the Nile waters the chaos in Libya, which borders both countries ties with Arab Gulf states Sudan's links with Islamists Recently, President Omar al-Bashir accused Egypt of ""stabbing his country in the back when it occupied"" Sudanese territory in the mid-1990s. Sudan's President Bashir has accused Egypt of ""stabbing it in the back"" He was referring to the disputed Halayib triangle, a coastal area on the Red Sea between Sudan and Egypt, which both countries claim. After the row sparked by Sheikha Moza's visit, many Facebook pages sprang up in Sudan, calling for a boycott of Egyptian products, especially fruit and vegetables, claiming they were contaminated by raw sewage. Since March, the Sudanese ministry of trade has suspended imports of several items, including ketchup, tomato and fish. Khartoum's measures follow similar measures taken in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Some in Sudan have called for travel restrictions to be imposed on Egyptians. Although officials from both countries have downplayed the row in public and emphasised the historic ties between the two peoples, Sudan has imposed visa fees on Egyptian men. Cairo is nervous about Khartoum's position on various issues. First is Sudan's close ties with Ethiopia, where the newly constructed Millennium Dam could reduce Egypt's share of the Nile waters, which Egypt's rulers have long considered its biggest existential threat. The River Nile is central to Egypt's identity The second matter is Sudan's ties with Egyptian Islamists and their Qatari backers. Qatar backs Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood, which was banned by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi after he deposed the Brotherhood's Mohammed Morsi as president in 2013. Egyptians often depict Sudan as Egypt's southern province, with Egyptians often recounting that both countries were one during the British colonial presence in the Nile Valley. Sudanese have long complained about racist sentiments displayed by Egyptian commentators ridiculing their country and government. One reaction to the ongoing row has been the launching of the hashtag #KnowSudan and its Arabic translation in an effort by the Sudanese to raise awareness of their country and its heritage.

"This video can not be played Podcast: Why office treats and commenting on peopleâs lunch choices can be unhelpful The Food Altar, the Treat Table, ITUP (In The Usual Place) - call it what you will, sweets and treats have become an engrained part of office life - but what if you have anxieties around food? Eleanor Bowes has had the eating disorder bulimia and says although she's in recovery she'll ""never have a normal relationship with food"". ""When I'm dealing with stuff in my personal life, my problems often flare up again. And at those times, when I'm struggling, I find work a hard place to be."" According to the NHS one in 20 people show signs of an eating disorder so the 30-year-old from Portsmouth and her colleagues at Mind came up with six pointers about how to deal with food and the workplace. Events like this can be really overwhelming. It may be that being around food and physical activity will trigger behaviours they are trying to avoid, or that seeing others enjoying themselves eating, or playing strenuous games, might make them feel like their recovery will never be possible. One colleague told me: ""I definitely found myself avoiding after work drinks all last year - and felt super anti-social and like I missed out on getting close to colleagues - but I just couldn't handle it! ""I also think it would be really helpful to suggest that if a team is going out for lunch, it's decided as far in advance as possible where to go - and to go somewhere with plenty of choice."" It is unavoidable that these sort of events happen, so try to be understanding if your colleague excuses themselves or leaves early. Don't try and pressure them into attending and maybe once in a while organise a different activity, such as mini-golf. You might think you're just making conversation while you wait in the queue for the canteen or microwave, but you have no idea how difficult it may have been for your colleague to put their meal together. They might finally feel they've got it just right and then you say something like, ""Is that all you're having?"" and their meal, and possibly day, is ruined. Lots of people's problems with food, diet, weight and body shape overlap with some mixed up feelings about exercise. So maybe hold off evaluating someone's gym record too, yeah? This is tricky to avoid. It's part of our culture to celebrate with cake and to show our colleagues how much we appreciate them by buying biscuits. Some of my best work has definitely been fuelled by waves of sugar-induced energy, but anyone whose world revolves around food is going to find it really difficult to focus on anything other than the big plate of cake sat in front of them. Perhaps if you're buying a packet of biscuits, because you've got a tough afternoon ahead, you could keep them on your desk or somewhere out of of the way so people don't have to walk past them to get on with their day. If you're expressing gratitude through food, why not cut out the middle man and actually say how you feel. In a world of the 5:2 diet, Fitbits and the Side Bar of Shame, you really can't blame anyone for feeling they should be on a constant upward fitness trajectory. When it's everywhere you look, it can feel like everyone agrees and feels comfortable with the status quo. But by evaluating everything you do and comparing your appearance to others out loud, you are inviting those who hear you to do the same to you, and therefore to themselves. Which leads me to my final point. You might hold up an ideal of eating salad every day and always taking the stairs as your ultimate goal. But for others, fighting thoughts of restricting their diet or losing pounds through exercise might be the goal they are trying to achieve. Taking the lift, or having crisps for lunch, might be a big step in letting go of the strict rules they have been living by and might actually be the ""healthiest"" thing they have done for a while. Don't always say things are ""good"" or ""naughty"" when you talk about food, it isn't always helpful. Eleanor Bowes originally wrote the article forMind,external. Produced by Beth Rose for the BBC.

"Women in munitions factories were tasked with filling shells with explosives The sacrifice of soldiers killed during World Wars One and Two is well-documented. But the efforts of munitions workers stained yellow by toxic chemicals is a story much less told. A campaign now hopes to honour the so-called Canary Girls, who risked life and limb to supply ammunition to the frontline. In 1915, while men were fighting on the battlefields, thousands of women were answering the government's cry for help by joining the war effort. In their droves they signed up to fill the gaps left by those called into service, taking jobs intransport, engineering,external,mills and factories,externalto keep the country moving. But while those who swapped domestic life for the assembly line were spared the trauma of the trenches, their jobs were nonetheless fraught with danger. Munitions workers battling the ""shell crisis"" of 1915 were prime targets for enemy fire, with sites routinely flattened by enemy bombs. Those who were spared such a fate were no less safe, facing daily peril by handling explosive chemicals that carried the risk of them contracting potentially fatal diseases. And for some, the effects of their work were immediately visible; a lurid shade of yellow that stained their skin and hair and earned them a nickname - the Canary Girls. Thousands of women were drafted in to tackle the shell crisis ""Wewerelike a canary,"" said Nancy Evans, recalling her time at the Rotherwas factory in Herefordshire during World War Two. ""We were yellow, it penetrated your skin. Your hair turned blonde and on the top of the crown was the proper colour of your hair."" Though temporary, the affects of packing shells with trinitrotoluene - more commonly known as TNT - ran more than skin-deep. According to Dr Helen McCartney, from King's College London, some workers gave birth to ""bright yellow"" babies. Gladys Sangster, whose mother worked at National Filling Factory Number 9 near Banbury, Oxford, was one of them. ""I was born [during the war] and my skin was yellow,""she told the BBC. ""That's why we were called Canary Babies. ""Nearly every baby was born yellow. It gradually faded away. My mum told me you took it for granted, it happened and that was it."" Life in munitions was ""hot... sweaty... dirty - women did not want the job,"" says Amy Dale As well as suffering the cosmetic consequences of working with TNT, workers risked amputation with every shell that passed through their hands. Amy Dale, who is researching munitions factories for her PhD, said those at Royal Ordnance Filling factories (ROFs) risked losing fingers and hands, burns and blindness. ""In these factories, they would take the casing, fill it with powder, then put a detonator in the top and that had to be tapped down. If they tapped too hard, it would detonate,"" she said. ""It happened to one lady, who was pregnant at the time, and it blinded her and she lost both her hands. ""She saw the pregnancy through, but the only way she could identify the baby was with her lips, which still had feeling."" Rotherwas in Herefordshire employed 4,000 women at its peak Explosions were a common occurrence, with fatal blasts reported at factories inAshton-under-Lyne, Barnbow near Leeds, andChilwell in Nottinghamshire. Such were fears that a rogue spark caused by static might lead to an explosion that women were banned from wearing nylon and silk. Nellie Bagley, whose first shift at Rotherwas in 1940 was on her 18th birthday, remembers having to strip down to her underwear to be inspected. ""You took everything off and you had just your bra and if it had a metal clip on the back you couldn't wear it... and no hair grips of course, because they would caused friction... explosions."" The women operated in a tense atmosphere, heavy with the weight of government fears that information could fall into the wrong hands. Posters papered the walls bearing slogans such as ""Keep Mum She's Not So Dumb"" to deter talk among workers. ""They were everywhere, [the word] 'war' with a big ear on it and 'Gossip Costs Lives',"" remembered Mrs Bagley. ""You were aware all the time of being watched."" But even in the darkest of moments, there remained a sense of workforce camaraderie. ""When we were on nights they used to say 'Come on Lou, get us started singing',"" said Louisa Jacobs, 94. ""We would sing from night to the early hours of the morning. It kept us going because we didn't realise the danger we were working in."" Fellow Rotherwas worker, Amy Hicks, added: ""We would be singing, even when the bombs fell."" And fall they did. In 1942, the Rotherwas factory was attacked by the Luftwaffe, which dropped a pair of 250kg bombs on the 300-acre site. Nancy Billings, who was coming to the end of a night shift, survived the blast. The Rotherwas factory was bombed in 1942 ""It was about 6am and the girl next to me had said, 'I'm so tired I could sleep forever'. Then all of a sudden the siren went off. ""This plane came down so low you could see the big black cross on it and then the bomb dropped.  It had a direct hit. ""There was [numerous] girls killed in there. It always comes to me about the girl working next to me, because she was one that didn't get out."" This video can not be played Nancy Billings describes the moment the bombs fell on Rotherwas Of those who survived life in the factories, many were beset with health problems in later life. Some reported bone disintegration, while others developed throat problems and dermatitis from TNT staining. ""The women suffered all sorts of illnesses and ailments from turning yellow, but turning yellow was probably the least of their problems,"" said Dr McCartney. ""They accepted all sort of terrible working conditions, they knew they were putting themselves in danger - TNT was yellow, they saw what was happening. ""But there's evidence that it was seen as a patriotic actâ¦ as them doing their bit for the war effort."" There remained a sense of camaraderie among workers Others suffered more sinister illnesses - one of the most serious being a liver disease called toxic jaundice. There were 400 cases of the disease during World War One - a quarter of which were fatal, said historian Anne Spurgeon. ""There was the yellow that was the staining of the skin, which while unpleasant, wasn't fatal or a serious disease. ""But there was this liver disease that was a different yellow. ""When they had repeated exposure to TNT, it attacked the liver. It was a poison and caused anaemia and jaundice."" Munitions workers assembled shells in ROFs made by other factories In 1914, it was discovered TNT was poisonous and the following year, toxic jaundice became a notifiable disease. Health and safety measures in factories were stepped up to limit exposure, such as providing protective clothing, but only so much could be done to eradicate the risks. ""[The government] wasn't ignoring it, they were trying to do something about it within the limits of their knowledge at the time,"" said Dr Spurgeon. ""But [TNT] was what had to go into the shells, so they had to use it."" Working in the factories was seen by some as a ""patriotic act"" About a million women worked at thousands of Ministry of Munitions sites during both world wars. But the number of those killed or seriously injured in the line of duty is a mystery - something Ms Dale is trying to find out as part of her research. ""It was a really dangerous job, which I think is why so little is known about it,"" she said. ""Women weren't allowed anywhere near a gun, yet they were filling shells in factories. ""They were actively engaged in an act of war which I think made people uncomfortable."" A campaign led by BBC Hereford and Worcester hopes to see records of how many workers died released, as well as cement the place of munitions workers in war history. The project has already been discussed at Prime Minister's Questions and there are plans to unveil a statue at the National Arboretum in Staffordshire. Though women were spared the trauma of the trenches, their jobs were nonetheless fraught with danger But Ms Billings said she had always felt the sacrifices made by the so-called munitionettes should have been recognised. ""I do think [we] should've got a medal for what [we] did, I've always thought that. And we should've got a letter from the Queen. ""It was a very dangerous job and it affected [our] health."" For the relatives of those who worked at Rotherwas, which had 4,000 woman at its peak, recognition has been a long time coming. ""It was such a dangerous job,"" said Mrs Hicks's daughter, Jenny Swiffield. ""It was as dangerous as going up and flying and dropping bombs. ""I'm [proud] and I think anyone would be if their parents had done something like that.""

"In the White House game of thrones, where senior administration officials fend off adversaries at every turn while vying for power and prominence, Mike Pence has been a relatively quiet player. The vice-president is always in the background, often looking over Donald Trump's shoulder with an approving nod as the president delivers a speech or signs yet another executive order. When it comes to engaging in the bare-knuckle brawling that has played itself out through anonymous sources and well-timed insider leaks, however, the vice-president and his associates have largely stayed out of the fray. Thursday night, then, was quite unusual. Two major US media outlets - CNN and NBC News - ran articles, complete with quotes from anonymous White House sources, distancing the vice-president from the current chaos in the administration and the running controversy over possible Trump campaign ties to the Russian government during the 2016 US presidential election. ""We certainly knew we needed to be prepared for the unconventional,"" an unnamed Pence aide told CNN's Elizabeth Landers, but ""not to this extent"". The proximate cause for the concern among the vice-president's camp was a New York Times article earlier this week reporting that Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's prominent campaign surrogate and short-lived national security adviser, had in early January informed the presidential transition team - then headed by Mr Pence - that he was under investigation for his ties to the Turkish government. In March Mr Pence denied any knowledge of Mr Flynn's Turkish ties before they were made public earlier that month. A ""source close to the administration"" told NBC that Mr Pence stands by his comments and he was not told of Mr Flynn's Turkish connections. ""That's an egregious error - and it has to be intentional,"" the source said. ""It's either malpractice or intentional, and either are unacceptable."" Complicating matters for the vice-president is that this is not the first time he has taken the White House line, only to be undercut by subsequent revelations. Just last week he asserted, repeatedly, that the president decided to fire FBI Director James Comey based on a memo from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. One day later the president himself told an interviewer that he knew he was going to terminate the law enforcement chief before the memo was even written. Mike Pence has been content to look over the president's shoulder - for now Mr Pence wasalso part,externalof the White House efforts in January to push back against reports that Mr Flynn discussed US sanctions on Russia with that nation's ambassador to the US, Sergei Kislyak - allegations that were later proven to be true. Mr Flynn was fired, the White House said, for misleading the vice-president on the matter. If Thursday night's story is any indication, the vice-president may now be trying to put some distance between himself and an administration that has made a habit of leaving him out on a limb. If the Trump presidency is truly in trouble, and this week's appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller is a dark storm cloud on the horizon, this could be evidence that the vice-president is contemplating a future after Mr Trump. He's certainly not abandoning ship, but he's familiarising himself with where the lifeboats are stored. If so, he's not the only one. Politicoran a story,externalearlier this week about conservatives - on the record and off - who were ""hinting"" that a President Pence would be a welcome reprieve from the drama of the Trump presidency. To get there, of course, Mr Trump would have to resign or be removed from office, leaving the vice-president as next in line for the job. Such speculation is decidedly premature, of course, but then there was another tidbit this week that has stoked the flames. Trump-Russia Scandal: How did we get here? FollowAnthony Zurcher,externalon Twitter. Mr Pence, according to Federal Election Commission filings, has started a committee to collect political donations. A source within the vice-president's office told NBC that the ""Great American Committee"", as it's named, will allow Mr Pence to cover travel expenses and support Republican candidates in upcoming elections. It's a move, however, that none of the vice-president's predecessors ever made - and has been a traditional opening step for past presidential candidates. Democrats have also taken note of Mr Pence's manoeuvres and are adjusting their fire accordingly. ""Mike Pence was a major player in the scandals enveloping the Trump administration, and no amount of spinning and leaking to reporters from him and his team can change that fact,""writes,externalOliver Willis of the liberal website Shareblue. There's no telling what Mr Trump, who prizes loyalty above all else, thinks of all this. Reports are he's been angered in the past by aides, such as top White House adviser Steve Bannon, who have stepped too far into the limelight. He famously said of Mr Comey in January that he had ""become more famous than me"" - then later justified sacking him by saying he was a ""showboat"" and a ""grandstander"". There is of course one key difference between Mr Pence and anyone else working in the Trump administration. The vice-president got his job through the will of American voters (or, at least, the Electoral College). Mr Trump can't fire him. Who is Vice-President Mike Pence?

Who wants to join THAT contest?!?! Dead serious. Should I set it up?"" The star spent the rest of the day replying to around 30 begging tweets, promising to pay for fees, loans, debts and equipment, and asked fans to DM her their bank details before promising to ""do some more in a month or two"". Last month, Mercedes Edney started a crowdfunding page to raise the $5,995 (Â£4,600) fees for the Academy of Nail Technology & Esthetics.

So excited to see you fulfill your dream!"" Mercedes later posted,externala picture of her enrolment receipt, saying: ""I have been crying all night and I cried in the office this morning as I paid my downpayment for esthetician school. I haven't been this happy in a very long time."" Taylor is perhaps the queen of good deeds.
