"Protesters gathered outside Kensington Town Hall last week to demand support The chief executive of Kensington and Chelsea council has resigned amid criticism over the borough's response to the Grenfell Tower fire. Nicholas Holgate said Local Government Secretary Sajid Javid asked for him to go - this is denied by the government. Mr Holgate said last week's fire in North Kensington, in which at least 79 people died, was ""heart-breaking"" but his presence would be a ""distraction"". Residents had condemned the initial relief effort as ""absolute chaos"". In astatement,externalissued by the council on Wednesday, Mr Holgate, who has been in post since 2014, said it was the ""highest priority"" of the council to help families affected by the fire. He said the communities and local government secretary had on Tuesday ""required the leader of the council to seek my resignation"". However, a spokesman from the Department for Communities and Local Government denied involvement, saying: ""The appointment of chief executives is entirely the responsibility of the local authority."" Nicholas Holgate became chief executive of the council in December 2014 Mr Holgate said: ""Despite my wish to have continued, in very challenging circumstances, to lead on the executive responsibilities of the council, I have decided that it is better to step down from my role, once an appropriate successor has been appointed. ""There is a huge amount still to do for the victims of the fire, requiring the full attention of this council and many others. If I stayed in post, my presence would be a distraction."" What we know so far Who are the victims? Visual guide to what happened He added: ""Whilst the public inquiry and other investigations will get to the truth of the causes of this tragedy and the management of its aftermath, I strongly believe that councillors and officers have always endeavoured to have the interests of our residents at heart and will continue to do so."" Nicholas Paget-Brown, the leader of the council, said it was with ""regret"" that he had accepted Mr Holgate's resignation. He said: ""The council has been grief stricken by the tragedy of the Grenfell Tower fire and has sought to provide the greatest level of support we can to victims. ""That is a huge challenge and Nicholas has led from the front in seeking to do this."" Shadow housing secretary John Healey told BBC Breakfast that Mr Holgate was ""right to go"". He added: ""He had to go. His council went awol in the days after this terrible fire - at a time when the victims, survivors, those families still looking for their family members who were missing, needed help on the ground and, above all, someone to reassure them and coordinate the relief and help efforts. ""The council were nowhere to be seen when I was down there the day after the fire - he had no option and he was right to go."" Since the fire on 14 June, some Grenfell Tower families have been staying in hotels and B&Bs, and there were concerns that more permanent housing would be offered in other parts of the country. And residents have said that Kensington and Chelsea council provided little support or information. Government staff and other London boroughs weredrafted in to help with relief effortsin the wake of the fire, with humanitarian assistance being provided by the west London borough of Ealing. The Justice4Grenfell campaign group welcomed Mr Holgate's resignation. The group's spokeswoman, Yvette Williams, told the Press Association: ""He wasn't left with any alternative, I think it was the right thing for him to do, the community had been completely abandoned by the local authority."" This video can not be played Theresa May on Grenfell fire: ""As prime minister I've taken responsibility"" The council's Â£8.6m refurbishment of the tower has also faced questions, withsuggestions that new claddingfitted during the refurbishment could have made the blaze worse. The refurbishment will be one issue looked at by afull public inquiry into the fire, ordered by Theresa May last week. The PM, who is among those to have faced criticism after she failed to meet survivors in the immediate aftermath, hasapologised for ""State"" failuresafter the blaze. She is expected to make a statement about the fire in the House of Commons on Thursday. She told MPs on Wednesday: ""People were left without belongings, without roofs over their heads, without even basic information about what had happened, what they should do and where they could seek help."" And the government announced that68 social housing flatsin Kensington Row, about 1.5 miles away from Grenfell Tower, would be made available to survivors. The funeral of 23-year-old Syrian refugee Mohammed Alhajali, who was among the first victims of the fire to be named, also took place on Wednesday. His family, who arrived from war-torn Syria, and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan attended the ceremony, called a Janazat, at an east London mosque. Meanwhile, a number of inquests have been opened and adjourned, with the coroner finding: Retired lorry driver Anthony Disson, 65, died from inhalation of fire fumes Farah Hamdan, a 31-year-old nursery nurse, died from smoke inhalation Her husband, Omar Belkadi, 32, who worked as a courier, died from inhalation from fire fumes Abufars Ibrahim, a 39-year-old shopkeeper, had been visiting his mother in the tower. The coroner said he had been found at the foot of the building and died from multiple injuries Khadija Khalloufi, a 52-year-old married woman, also died from inhalation of fire fumes Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Are you a Grenfell Tower resident?

"The fire service's major incident unit was at the scene Two men have died and another man has been airlifted to hospital after a crane collapsed. A parent and child were taken to hospital as a precaution because the falling crane damaged a home. The airlifted man, believed to be the crane driver, has serious injuries but they are not thought to be life-threatening. An eyewitness said the crane ""slowly started tilting"" before it fell on to the building site in Crewe. Live updates on this and other stories for Staffordshire and Cheshire here Cheshire Fire and Rescue's major incident unit attended and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has been informed. The construction site belonged to Seddon Homes.  Its chief executive said he could not speculate as to the cause of the incident. Cheshire Police confirmed the fatalities at 22:50 BST on Wednesday, after the crane collapsed at a new housing estate on Dunwoody Way, near the Bombardier works, at 16:30. The force said the two people at the house were uninjured. This video can not be played Scene of crane collapse in Crewe A man who lives nearby, who only gave his name as Jason, told BBC Radio Stoke the crane - being used to help build new homes - had been lifting tools before it fell. ""They finished the work, the crane positioned itself facing Bombardier. ""The guys finished their work and they were still up there when all of a sudden, it slowly just started to tilt, tilt tilt. ""Guys started shouting and it completely fell on the floor."" Flowers and written tributes have been left Ch Supt Matt Welsted, of Cheshire Police, has said: ""This is a truly tragic incident, and our deepest condolences go out to the families affected at this extremely difficult time."" Following the collapse, police closed Dunwoody Way at the junction of West Street. Ch Supt Welsted said: ""A residential property has been damaged as a result of the incident, the occupants were not injured and were checked over by medical professionals. ""They have since been relocated while the investigation continues. ""The bodies of those who have sadly lost their lives will shortly be recovered from the scene."" He urged anyone with footage taken from the scene to ""please respect the families involved"" and if any could be of use to the investigation make it available to investigators. The road where a crane collapsed in Crewe is a main route in the centre of the town through a built-up, industrial area. At one end, Dunwoody Way has Phoenix Leisure Park (a site with a cinema, bowling alley and bingo hall), with routes off to housing estates and a Morrisons. It then continues past the Bombardier Transportation factory (Crewe's historical railway works) before heading west out of the town. In a statement Seddon Homes boss Jonathan Seddon said his company was working with the HSE. ""On behalf of everyone at Seddon I'd like to offer my heartfelt condolences to the family and loved ones of those who so tragically lost their lives yesterday. ""At this time I cannot speculate as to the cause of this incident, but needless to say there will be a full investigation and Seddon is working closely with the emergency services and Health and Safety Executive."" Laura Smith, Labour MP for Crewe and Nantwich, said: ""It's going to be very important for me today to find out the people who have been affected and make sure the residents are supported and also sending all my thoughts to the families who have lost members.""

"Clooney (right) and friends say Casamigos was born from tequila-filled nights It's celebration time for George Clooney, after the tequila company he co-founded was sold to drinks giant Diageo in a deal worth $1bn (Â£790m). The deal comes at a busy time for the Hollywood actor, as his wife Amal gave birth to twins earlier this month. The star founded Casamigos in 2013 with friends Rande Gerber and Mike Meldman. They have said that Casamigos - meaning house of friends - was born from tequila-filled nights, and was at first just for private events. The first-time dad may find that newborns Ella and Alexander impinge on his ability to enjoy tequila-filled nights with friends. Buthe told CNBC,externalthat he and his co-founders would ""still be very much a part of Casamigos. Starting with a shot tonight. Maybe two."" Clooneys have twins Ella and Alexander While the Oceans Eleven star is unlikely to be short of cash, the deal should help pay for some early-morning childcare assistance (tequila hangovers plus 5am wake-ups - not good) or more nappies than even newborn twins could possibly get through. George Clooney married human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014 Diageo, a British company, said it plans to expand Casamigos internationally. The company said it would pay $700m initially for the brand, with a further $300m due over 10 years, linked to performance. Casamigos reportedly came about when the distiller making tequila for the friends told them the quantities involved meant they had to get properly licensed. Mr Gerber - who is married to supermodel Cindy Crawford - said Casamigos ""started from a friendship and an idea to create the best tasting, smoothest tequila as our own house tequila"".

"In 1985 Becker became the first unseeded player to win the Wimbledon men's singles Three-time Wimbledon tennis champion Boris Becker has been declared bankrupt by a London bankruptcy court. The 49-year-old owed a firm of private bankers a large sum and the court registrar said there was not enough credible evidence that he could pay. Mr Becker's lawyers asked for a final chance to pay with the funds from remortgaging a property in Majorca. Mr Becker, now a coach and TV pundit for the BBC and other media, was not at the hearing in London. Registrar Miss Christine Derrett said it was ""with regret"" that she came to the conclusion that he could not pay. ""I remember watching him play on Centre Court, which probably shows my age,"" she added. The bankruptcy application was made by Arbuthnot Latham in connection with a debt owed to them for nearly two years. In a statement, Mr Becker said he was ""surprised and disappointed"" that Arbuthnot Latham had chosen to bring the proceedings against him. ""This order relates to one disputed loan which I was due to repay in full in one month's time,"" he said. ""It is disappointing that my request for today's hearing to be postponed until this time was refused. My earnings are well publicised and it is clear that I have the means to repay this debt. ""The value of the asset in question far exceeds the debt owed to Arbuthnot Latham."" Mr Becker's lawyers had asked for another 28-day adjournment after saying that they expected the Majorca property deal to be completed in a month's time. However, the registrar rejected the plea and said: ""It is not often the case that a professional person has a judgment (debt) outstanding against them since October 2015. This is a historic debt. ""One has the impression of a man with his head in the sand."" Mr Becker's advocate, John Briggs, said: ""He is not a sophisticated individual when it comes to finances. I am asking for a real last chance for Mr Becker to come good. It has just taken longer than anticipated."" Wimbledon men's singles champion in 1985, 1986 and 1989 Australian Open champion in 1991 and 1996 US Open champion in 1989 Helped West Germany win the Davis Cup in 1988 and 1989 Since retiring from the game, Mr Becker has worked in business and the media and he also coached former world number one Novak Djokovic for three years from 2013.

"There is plenty of analysis of a Queen's Speech which, according to the Guardian, amounted to an ""empty programme"" from a government that lacks authority. It was so short, says the Daily Mirror, that asking the Queen to delay Ascot to read it felt almost cruel. After all the red pen, Theresa May had barely enough left for a tweet. The Sun finds it ""disheartening"" to seehow many manifesto ideas Mrs May ""has had to junk"",external. But it says she had little choice. According to The Times, theremoval of everything controversial from the Queen's Speech,externalwill leave much of government treading water, with many issues not being addressed. However, the Daily Telegraphstrikes a more upbeat tone,external, seeing many ""opportunities rather than problems"" in Mrs May's predicament. It believes Downing Street could ""seize the initiative, dictate the narrative and make - not be drenched by - the political weather"". The lead in the Guardian claims Grenfell Tower wasvisited 16 times by Kensington and Chelsea council,externalbuildings inspectors during its recent two-year, Â£10m renovation. The paper says they appear not to have spotted that it was being clad in a material effectively banned on tall buildings by the government. The Daily Mirror's main story saystoxic cyanide gas,externalgiven off by the burning insulation may have contributed to deaths at Grenfell Tower. The paper says at least three survivors are being given an antidote in hospital. A school with a no-nonsense approach to discipline has come under fire forseeking to hire a ""director of detentions and isolations"",externalat a salary of up to Â£29,000 a year, the Daily Mail reports.

Critics are said to have described it as ""Dickensian"".

For example, men born in September are almost three times more likely to suffer thyroid complaints than those born in January. Women born in July are more likely to suffer chronic neck pain and asthma.

"The Iraqi military provided this image showing the destruction at the mosque compound So-called Islamic State (IS) has blown up the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul, Iraqi forces say. The ancient landmark with its famous leaning minaret was where IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed a ""caliphate"" in 2014. However, IS claims that US aircraft destroyed the complex, in a statement issued by its news outlet Amaq. Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said blowing up the mosque was ""an official declaration of defeat"" by IS. Aerial photos show that the mosque and minaret has been largely destroyed. The Iraqi commander in charge of the offensive to retake Mosul said troops were within 50 metres of the mosque when IS ""committed another historical crime"". A senior US commander in Iraq said IS had destroyed ""one of Mosul and Iraq's great treasures"". ""This is a crime against the people of Mosul and all of Iraq, and is an example of why this brutal organisation must be annihilated,"" Maj Gen Joseph Martin said. The jihadists have destroyed a string of important heritage sites in Iraq and Syria. The UN has said that IS may be holding more than 100,000 people in Mosul as human shields. The mosque's leaning minaret had been a familiar part of Mosul's skyline Thousands of Iraqi security forces, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, Sunni Arab tribesmen and Shia militiamen, assisted by US-led coalition warplanes and military advisers, are involved in the offensive against IS, which waslaunched on 17 October 2016. The government announced the full ""liberation"" of eastern Mosul in January 2017. But the west of the city has presented a more difficult challenge, with its narrow, winding streets. The Iraqi statement said both the mosque and its distinctive Hadba (hunchback) leaning minaret had been blown up. Construction began on the mosque in 1172. A month after IS forces overran Mosul in June 2014, Baghdadi gave a Friday sermon from the pulpit inside the mosque and proclaimed a caliphate - a state governed in accordance with Islamic law, or Sharia, by God's deputy on Earth, or caliph. It was his first public appearance in many years. Why Mosulâs Great Mosque of al-Nuri matters Battle for Mosul: The story so far WATCH: Mosul from above in 360 video The Old City is the last district under the control of IS within Mosul itself, which was the group's stronghold in Iraq. On Sunday, commanders announced the start of the ""final chapter"" of the offensive, with Iraq's counter-terrorism service, army and federal police attacking the Old City from all directions. West Mosul has seen fierce fighting between IS and Iraqi forces Civilians have been fleeing the Old City as the offensive continues The army said it believed there were no more than 300 militants left in Mosul, compared with almost 6,000 at the start of the offensive in October. Earlier this week aircraft dropped leaflets urging civilians to avoid open spaces and to take any opportunity to escape. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)warned on Tuesday,externalthat the flow of injured civilians out of western Mosul had increased, with victims having wounds from gunshots, shelling and bombs. Why IS militants destroy ancient sites Despair and death in the flight from Mosul It is Mosul's most famous Sunni mosque, named after the Muslim leader, Nur al-Din Mahmoud Zangi, famous for waging jihad against Christian crusaders. And it is where the leader of Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, made his one and only public appearance, shortly after his group declared a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. But IS fighters have shown scant regard for history or culture in the three years since their lightning advance across northern Iraq. Reports that they rigged the Nuri mosque with explosives have been circulating since Iraqi government forces began their effort to take back the city nine months ago. Destruction of the mosque, most observers assumed, would mark the group's final act of angry defiance before finally losing their grip on Mosul. IS claims that the mosque was destroyed by a US airstrike. This seems unlikely but such is the savage nature of the struggle for control of Mosul that it's fair to say that preserving the city's cultural and religious heritage has not been a high priority for anyone involved.

"This video can not be played Not got long? Here's the Queen's Speech in 90 seconds A host of proposed new laws designed to prepare the UK for a ""smooth and orderly"" departure from the EU have been announced in the Queen's Speech. Of 27 bills, eight relate to Brexit and its impact on immigration, trade and sectors such as fisheries and farming. Prime Minister Theresa May urged MPs to ""seize this moment of national change"" to unite and work for a fairer country. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said she had lost authority after axing a raft of manifesto pledges. Proposals to scrap the winter fuel allowance for well-off pensioners, end automatic 2.5% pension rises, expand grammar schools and end free school lunches for all infants have been dropped, while reforms to social care funding will be put out to consultation and a cap on some energy tariffs considered further. Amid continuing talks with the Democratic Unionists about them supporting Theresa May's government, Downing Street said it was confident the Queen's Speech could ""command the confidence"" of the House of Commons when MPs vote on it next week. The DUP said it too was confident a deal would be place by next week's votes. The main non-Brexit proposals of the speech include: A Civil Liability Bill, designed to address the ""compensation culture"" around motoring insurance claims A Domestic Violence and Abuse Bill, establishing a Domestic Violence and Abuse Commissioner to stand up for victims and survivors and monitor the response of the authorities A Tenant's Fees Bill,banning landlords from charging ""letting fees"" A High-Speed Two Bill to authorise the second leg of the rail link from Birmingham to Crewe A Data Protection Bill to strengthen individuals' rightsand introduce a ""right to be forgotten"". An Armed Forces Bill allowing people to serve on a part-time and flexible basis There was no mention of US President Donald Trump's proposed state visit to the UK later this year, appearing to confirm suggestions it has been delayed. Ministers said the reason it was not included was purely because no date had been set. Queen's Speech Live: Rolling text and video updates Bill-by-bill guide: Queen's Speech Corbyn attacks 'threadbare' programme Queen's Speech casts doubt on Trump visit The Queen announcedthe government's legislative programme,externalfor the next two years at the State Opening of Parliament. She was accompanied by the Prince of Wales, rather than the Duke of Edinburgh, after Prince Philip was admitted to hospital on Tuesday night. Buckingham Palace said it was a ""precautionary measure"" for treatment of an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. By political editor Laura Kuenssberg It was meant to be Theresa May's political coronation, but the Queen's Speech has confirmed the reality of her fall from grace. The prime minister's ambitions for significant change at home have been culled, disappearing with her majority. But the complexity of all the work the government has ahead administratively, as the UK prepares to leave the EU, is plain to see. Eight bills on Brexit each requires no less than a redesign of systems that have been in place for decades. Each will require careful political handling, at a time when the government cannot be sure of its majority and a Labour Party with wind in its sails is determined to be a guerrilla opposition.Read more As MPs began debating the government's plans, Mrs May said the country was split ""between red and blue, young and old and Leave and Remain"" and Parliament's challenge was to heal, not reflect those divisions. She promised to work with ""anyone in any party"" in the national interest on Brexit and other issues. ""Not every problem can be solved by an act of Parliament but it is a step forward to building a more compassionate, united and confident nation,"" she said. Grammar school expansion abandoned Ban on agents' lettings fees to go ahead Government aims to secure space sector She also apologised for ""the failure of the state, national and local"" in its response to the Grenfell Tower fire, promising a new role of independent public advocate to represent bereaved families in the aftermath of disasters. With Brexit talks now under way, the government has set out the laws needed to leave the EU - irrespective of the final deal agreed with Brussels. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: Austerity must come to an end At the heart of this is the so-called Repeal Bill - which will repeal the 1972 European Communities Act and end the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. It will also copy over all EU laws into UK law, with Parliament then deciding which bits to retain. The government says ""wherever practical the same rules and laws will apply after exit, therefore maximising certainty for individuals and businesses"". The bill would give the Parliament temporary authority, via secondary legislation, to amend laws that do not ""operate appropriately"" after Brexit while existing decision-making powers devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will be maintained pending further discussion on a permanent solution. As an indication of the scale of change which Brexit will bring, seven other pieces of legislation are proposed to anticipate the end of EU jurisdiction and introduce national policies in key sectors. The Queen was accompanied by the Prince of Wales - with the Duke of Edinburgh in hospital The ceremonial elements were scaled back - as the Queen did not wear the Imperial state crown Party leaders will debate the Queen's Speech over the next week On immigration, a bill will legislate for the end of free movement from the EU and make the status of EU nationals and family members subject to UK law. Although there are no specific details about a new system, ministers say they will be able to ""control"" numbers while attracting the ""brightest and the best"".

"People are trying to cool off in any way they can The UK is basking in its hottest June day in 41 years, with a temperature of 34.5C (94F) recorded at Heathrow. The Met Office reading at the London airport is the highest in June since the mercury hit 35.6 (96F) in 1976 - the all-time high since records began. The heatwave has seen five sizzling days in a row during which temperatures in parts of the UK have topped 30C. But weather warnings have also been issued for rain, with thunderstorms expected in some areas. BBC weather presenter Chris Fawkes said: ""To have these really prolonged spells, you need a block of high pressure that directs other weather fronts away. Then we get the hot weather coming up from Europe."" Storms are forecast for some areas later in the day, and yellow weather warnings for rain in parts of England, Wales and Scotland are in place until the early hours of Thursday. Our presenter added: ""It is all going to go bang tonight. ""The hot air from the surface will meet with colder air coming in from the Atlantic and we will have some big thunderstorms, gusty winds, heavy rain and, in some places, even hail. In pictures: How Britain is keeping cool Glastonbury crowds suffer on hottest day A man sunbathing in Kensington Gardens in the summer of 1976 The record-breaking summer of 1976 saw nine weeks of blazing sunshine. Between June and August, blue skies were a daily occurrence and, for two weeks, temperatures were 32C or above consistently. Five days saw temperatures exceed 35C. The hottest day of all was 3 July, with temperatures hitting 35.9C in Cheltenham. A downside was the worst drought in recorded history for the UK, building up from a warm summer in 1975 and incredibly dry months after. Rainfall in the winter of 1975 was half of what it normally would be, and by the summer of 1976 crops were affected and there were forest fires in the south of England. But once the summer had come to a close, autumn saw intense rainfall and natural balance was restored. The crowd heading to Royal Ascot were hoping for a similar relaxation of dress code to the one race-goers experienced on Tuesday. Normally men attending the horse racing event in the Royal Enclosure must wear black or grey morning dress with a waistcoat, tie and a top hat. But the jacket rulewas not enforced for the first time in its history, as organisers took a ""common sense approach"". Some racegoers were keeping it glitzy at Ascot; others cool and shady. Whilst some are taking to the parks or the beach to lap up the sunshine, people on the daily commute have been faced with travel disruption. Greater Anglia Trains hascancelled a number of its services,externalbetween London and Essex, saying the heat has led to speed restrictions on the lines to stop them from buckling. For those in more congested areas, the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs has also warned there may be pockets of high pollution during the exceptionally hot weather, especially in the East Midlands. It was hot and dusty work for the revellers arriving at Glastonbury Emergency services have warned people to keep safe in open water after three people died in separate incidents around the country. A 15-year-old boy diedafter getting into difficulty when swimming in a lake with friendsin Walsall, West Midlands. This follows the deaths of a teenager who drowned in a reservoir near Rochdale and an elderly woman who rescue teams tried to save off the coast of Sussex. A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ""Although it is very hot at the moment, the dangers of going into open water cannot be underestimated."" This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool Shut windows and pull down the shades when it is hotter outside. You can open the windows for ventilation when it is cooler. Stay out of the sun and don't go out between 11:00 and 15:00 (the hottest part of the day) if you're vulnerable to the effects of heat. Have cool baths or showers, and splash yourself with cool water. Drink cold drinks regularly, such as water and diluted fruit juice. Avoid excess alcohol, caffeine (tea, coffee and cola) or drinks high in sugar. Wear loose, cool clothing, and a hat and sunglasses if you go outdoors. Check up on friends, relatives and neighbours who may be less able to look after themselves. SOURCE: NHS How have you been experiencing the recent hot weather in the UK?

"This video can not be played Nato jet 'approaches' Russian minister's plane A Nato fighter jet has approached a Russian plane carrying the defence minister but was chased away by a Russian escort jet, Russian media say. They say the incident happened in international airspace over the Baltic when Sergei Shoigu was flying to the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. Nato says it tracked three Russian jets as they did not identify themselves. It says the Nato jet was not chased away. Dozens of similar incidents have been reported in the past few years. Nato and Russia have blamed each other for aggressive intercepts in the strategically important region. The US said a Russian jet had flown within 5ft (1.5m) ofa US spy plane earlier this week.American officials blamed Russia for the ""unsafe"" encounter on Monday - again over the Baltic. But Moscow responded by saying that the reconnaissance plane had made a ""provocative"" move. Nato's F-16 fighter jet flew close to Mr Shoigu's plane on Wednesday, according to Russian news agencies, who had their reporters on board the ministerial flight. They said that a Russian Su-27 fighter jet then intervened, demonstrating to a Nato pilot that it was armed by dipping its wings. The Nato jet then flew off, according to footage that was aired later. A Nato official later said in a statement that the alliance ""can confirm that three Russian aircraft, including two fighters, were tracked over the Baltic Sea earlier today (Wednesday)"". ""As the aircraft did not identify themselves or respond to air traffic control, Nato fighter jets scrambled to identify them, according to standard procedures. Nato has no information as to who was on board. We assess the Russian pilots' behaviour as safe and professional."" The official added that the Nato jet had not been chased away by the Russian aircraft. Kaliningrad, Mr Shoigu's destination, is a highly militarised Russian enclave on the Baltic. At a meeting with local military commanders later on Wednesday, the minister accused Nato of intensifying its military activities near Russia's western borders. Mr Shoigu pointed to recent exercises by the military alliance, which involved 10,000 troops, 70 vessels and the same number of warplanes. He added that the drills illustrated the West's reluctance to give up its anti-Russian course. Nato has beefed up its military presence in Poland, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, in the wake of Russia's seizure and annexation Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. Russia deploys nuclear-capable missiles in Kaliningrad The latest incidents involving Nato and Russian planes come amid renewed tensions between Washington and Moscow, sparked by the US downing of a Syrian jet after it targeted American-allied rebels last week. In response, Russia, an ally of the Syrian government, warned that US jets flying in Syria west of the Euphrates River would be treated as targets. On Tuesday, the US military shot down an armed Iranian-made drone in Syria. Syria conflict: US jet 'downs Iranian-made drone' Why are air combat kills so rare? What happened on Monday is only the latest incident in a continuing pattern where Russian and Nato aircraft have come into close proximity. The two sides' narratives are very different but independent studies have tended to support Nato's case that more aggressive Russian behaviour is in large part to blame - this a response to Nato's stepped up military deployments in central Europe in the wake of Russia's seizure and annexation of Crimea. These tensions risk accident and injury but are very different to the situation in Syrian airspace where the US, its coalition allies and Russian and Syrian warplanes are all engaged in combat sorties. Unlike in Europe, there is a direct link between Russian and US commanders to avoid dangerous incidents - and although Russia is saying that this has been suspended in the wake of theUS shooting down of a Syrian jet- the US side insists that the channel remains open.

"Sixty-eight social housing flats in Kensington, London, are to be made available to survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire, the government has said. The one, two and three-bedroom flats are located in two blocks that stand alongside a large luxury development, where private homes go for up to Â£8.5m. At least 79 people died and many more were left homeless after fire engulfed the North Kensington tower a week ago. PM Theresa May has apologised for ""State"" failures after the blaze. ""People were left without belongings, without roofs over their heads, without even basic information about what had happened, what they should do and where they could seek help,"" she told MPs in the Commons. ""That was a failure of the State - local and national - to help people when they needed it most. ""As prime minister, I apologise for that failure."" This video can not be played Theresa May on Grenfell fire: ""As prime minister I've taken responsibility"" Mrs May is expected to make a statement about the fire in the Commons on Thursday. There has been widespread anger from Grenfell Tower residents at the slow and chaotic response from authorities after last Wednesday's devastating blaze. On Wednesday, protesters demanding ""justice for Grenfell"" marched with anti-government protesters through London. But Justice4Grenfell, a group which supports Grenfell residents, stressed it had not organised any of the events and urged protesters to have the victims and bereaved ""foremost in their minds"". A spokesman for the ClementJames Centre, another support group, accused protesters of hijacking residents' grief for political purposes. Meanwhile, the funeral of 23-year-old Syrian refugee Mohammed Alhajali, who was among the first victims of the fire to be named, has taken place. His family, who arrived from war-torn Syria, and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan attended the ceremony, called a Janazat, at an east London mosque. His family said: ""His very last words to us were how much he missed us. ""Ever since he moved away from us, we tried to be united with him and his brothers, and now, instead, we have been united by his body."" Mr Alhajali became separated from his brother as they tried to escape A number of inquests were opened and adjourned on Wednesday, with the coroner finding: Retired lorry driver Anthony Disson, 65, died from inhalation of fire fumes Farah Hamdan, a 31-year-old nursery nurse, died from smoke inhalation Her husband, Omar Belkadi, 32, who worked as a courier, died from inhalation from fire fumes Abufars Ibrahim, a 39-year-old shopkeeper, had been visiting his mother in the tower. The coroner said he had been found at the foot of the building and died from multiple injuries Khadija Khalloufi, a 52-year-old married woman, also died from inhalation of fire fumes Grenfell residents heading to Kensington Row Work on the private homes is already complete By Jennifer Scott, BBC News Nestled off Kensington High Street, and a short distance from Westfield shopping centre, Kensington Row is the perfect example of London's booming real estate market. It's Â£700 a week to rent a one-bedroom flat - for that price you get to live in the same borough as Prince William and Simon Cowell. Builders are beavering away to finish the new blocks for the incoming residents, whilst placards that surround the site promise you can ""find yourself in the clouds"" after you move in. You get a true feel for the development from the flats already completed. On the hottest day of the year so far, the sun reflects off balconies and glass panels onto the tree-lined street and busy main road. The flats all have the luxury finish you would expect of this area - but of course the social housing blocks won't have the same trimmings. George, a Kensington resident for 30 years, said his new neighbours would be welcome. ""In times of disaster, the communities in both the north and south of this borough come together,"" he said. ""The survivors and their families will be looked after."" Since the fire, some Grenfell Tower families have been staying in hotels and B&Bs, and there were concerns that more permanent housing would be offered in other parts of the country. But Kensington Row complex is just over 1.5 miles from Grenfell Tower. It includes a 24-hour concierge service and a private cinema, the website of developer St Edward says, but it is thought unlikely the new tenants from Grenfell will have access to such facilities. Each new home in the two blocks set aside for social housing will be fully furnished and completed to a high-specification, the government said. St Edward has taken on extra builders to speed up completion of the work to the social housing blocks The flats are expected to be ready by the end of July. Yvette Williams, from Justice4Grenfell, said the promise of new flats was a good thing if it gave residents a permanent home but it had come ""very late"". A small number of Grenfell residents were still sleeping in rest centres set up in the aftermath of the fire, one week on, she said. The Department for Communities and Local Government said extra public money had been found so the flats could be fitted out more quickly, and more builders had been taken on. It said the ""expectation was that these new properties would be offered as one of the options to permanently rehouse residents from Grenfell Tower"". Some Grenfell residents will be housed in the brick-clad building on the right, seen in this artist's impression The homes will be bought and managed by the City of London Corporation, and handed over to Kensington and Chelsea Council. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said Grenfell residents had been through ""some of the most harrowing and traumatic experiences imaginable"". ""Our priority is to get everyone who has lost their home permanently rehoused locally as soon as possible, so that they can begin to rebuild their lives,"" he added.

"The Duke of Edinburgh was with the Queen at Trooping the Colour on Saturday The Duke of Edinburgh is to spend a second night in hospital after being admitted as ""a precautionary measure"". Prince Philip is being treated at King Edward VII hospital in central London for an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said the 96-year-old would stay in the private hospital overnight, but continued to be in good spirits. The BBC understands his hospital stay is ""not a cause for serious concern"". The duke was with the Queen at Trooping the Colour on Saturday and the opening day of Royal Ascot on Tuesday. However, after being admitted to hospital on Tuesday evening, he missed Wednesday's State Opening of Parliament, where his place was taken by the Prince of Wales, and a second day at Ascot. Prince Charles, on a visit to Finsbury Park following Monday's terror attack, said his father was ""getting better"". It is understood the duke was not admitted to hospital as an emergency but, on a doctor's advice, was driven from Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening. Earlier, BBC royal correspondent Peter Hunt said that, given the duke is being treated for a pre-existing condition, it is safe to assume that he is suffering from the recurrence of the bladder infection he suffered twice in 2012. He is not bedridden, according to officials, but up and about inside the private hospital. Prince Philip has spent much of his life in good health, but he was treated for a blocked coronary artery in 2011 and the bladder infection the following year. The latter saw him miss much of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. The duke backs healthy eating and exercise. He drinks moderately, takes the stairs and says he still fits into the uniform he wore on the day he married the Queen, almost 70 years ago. Prince Philip said in May that he would retire from royal duties this autumn, a move supported by the Queen.

"Natalie Bollen and William Jelly had not shown ""any remorse"", according to the judge A father and daughter who launched a fatal attack on a neighbour who punctured a child's football have each been jailed for seven years. Natalie Bollen and William Jelly assaulted Kelly Machin, 34, on the day she deflated the ball using a knife. Ms Machin, who had been fed up with balls landing in her back garden in Leicester, died two weeks after the attack, which happened on 23 August. Bollen, 28, and Jelly, 48, were convicted of manslaughter last month. Live updates from the East Midlands Sentencing them at Leicester Crown Court, Judge Nicholas Dean QC said that neither had shown ""any remorse"" for having caused Ms Machin's death. ""After these events you, Natalie Bollen, sought to protect your father knowing he had been responsible for pushing over Kelly Machin - you denied he had been present,"" said the judge. ""You also seemed to have been pleased with what you and your father had done, boasting in messages that you had assaulted Kelly Machin. ""After Kelly Machin's death you, Natalie Bollen, responded to a text message in an almost triumphant way; 'Yep, dead and gone'."" Kelly Machin died about two weeks after the attack The court heard that Ms Machin had been concerned about the excessive noise made by Bollen's children, and bothered by them regularly kicking balls into her garden. On 23 August, she punctured a ball with a knife, which led to a confrontation in which she was punched by Bollen and pushed or punched to the ground by Jelly. The court heard how they barged their way into Ms Machin's house uninvited. Her injuries were assessed by paramedics, but she was not admitted to hospital. She continued experiencing severe pain and was eventually taken to hospital on 28 August, but her injuries were regarded as not requiring emergency treatment. But Ms Machin, who lived two doors down from Bollen in Waldwick Close, was found dead at her home on 5 September, having died ""alone and in pain"" either on 3 or 4 September. The court heard that rib injuries had caused 1.9 litres of blood to gradually accumulate around her heart, which stopped working. Judge Dean described it as an ""unusual case"" and said that Ms Machin was a ""vulnerable individual"". He said the impact of her death had been ""profound"" and would be enduring for her family. Det Ch Insp Martin Smalley said: ""A seemingly minor incident resulted in a person losing their life. ""The defendants' actions on that day were excessive and they attacked Kelly without regard for the consequences."" On 23 August 2016, Natalie Bollen pounded on Kelly Machin's door along, with several other people, shouting: ""You might not come out now Kelly, but I'm gonna kill ya."" About 20 minutes later, Bollen barged into the house along with her father William Jelly They punched and hit Kelly in her living room - causing her to fall and hit the coffee table which resulted in her breaking five ribs She called 999 after the attack and complained of pain in her back She was seen by paramedics but did not go to hospital She called for an ambulance several times in the next few days and eventually went to hospital on 29 August where she had a CT scan Doctors were not able to discuss the results with her as she had already left the hospital They wanted to perform a small operation to stop internal bleeding but Kelly seemed worried about that option She died on her sofa two weeks after the attack from a build-up of blood in her chest cavity caused by the broken ribs and damage to her arteries Pair killed neighbour over burst football 'Violent gang of wildlife abusers': Chris Packham livestreams Rutlandâs Cottesmore Hunt to expose illegal foxhunting Leicestershire entrepreneur named one of 2025âs most impressive female founders Dambusters memorabilia goes under the hammer for Â£24,000 MP Alicia Kearns criticises Rutland County Council for working too slowly on their review on flooding Coalville area residents urged to have their say on Leicestershire County Council's budget plan Leicestershire Police issue appeal to help find missing Coalville woman At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter Liam Payne cause of death confirmed as UK inquest opens Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

"The fire service's major incident unit was at the scene Two men have died and another man has been airlifted to hospital after a crane collapsed. A parent and child were taken to hospital as a precaution because the falling crane damaged a home. The airlifted man, believed to be the crane driver, has serious injuries but they are not thought to be life-threatening. An eyewitness said the crane ""slowly started tilting"" before it fell on to the building site in Crewe. Live updates on this and other stories for Staffordshire and Cheshire here Cheshire Fire and Rescue's major incident unit attended and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has been informed. The construction site belonged to Seddon Homes.  Its chief executive said he could not speculate as to the cause of the incident. Cheshire Police confirmed the fatalities at 22:50 BST on Wednesday, after the crane collapsed at a new housing estate on Dunwoody Way, near the Bombardier works, at 16:30. The force said the two people at the house were uninjured. This video can not be played Scene of crane collapse in Crewe A man who lives nearby, who only gave his name as Jason, told BBC Radio Stoke the crane - being used to help build new homes - had been lifting tools before it fell. ""They finished the work, the crane positioned itself facing Bombardier. ""The guys finished their work and they were still up there when all of a sudden, it slowly just started to tilt, tilt tilt. ""Guys started shouting and it completely fell on the floor."" Flowers and written tributes have been left Ch Supt Matt Welsted, of Cheshire Police, has said: ""This is a truly tragic incident, and our deepest condolences go out to the families affected at this extremely difficult time."" Following the collapse, police closed Dunwoody Way at the junction of West Street. Ch Supt Welsted said: ""A residential property has been damaged as a result of the incident, the occupants were not injured and were checked over by medical professionals. ""They have since been relocated while the investigation continues. ""The bodies of those who have sadly lost their lives will shortly be recovered from the scene."" He urged anyone with footage taken from the scene to ""please respect the families involved"" and if any could be of use to the investigation make it available to investigators. The road where a crane collapsed in Crewe is a main route in the centre of the town through a built-up, industrial area. At one end, Dunwoody Way has Phoenix Leisure Park (a site with a cinema, bowling alley and bingo hall), with routes off to housing estates and a Morrisons. It then continues past the Bombardier Transportation factory (Crewe's historical railway works) before heading west out of the town.

"The fire service's major incident unit was at the scene Two men have died and another man has been airlifted to hospital after a crane collapsed. A parent and child were taken to hospital as a precaution because the falling crane damaged a home. The airlifted man, believed to be the crane driver, has serious injuries but they are not thought to be life-threatening. An eyewitness said the crane ""slowly started tilting"" before it fell on to the building site in Crewe. Live updates on this and other stories for Staffordshire and Cheshire here Cheshire Fire and Rescue's major incident unit attended and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has been informed. The construction site belonged to Seddon Homes.  Its chief executive said he could not speculate as to the cause of the incident. Cheshire Police confirmed the fatalities at 22:50 BST on Wednesday, after the crane collapsed at a new housing estate on Dunwoody Way, near the Bombardier works, at 16:30. The force said the two people at the house were uninjured. This video can not be played Scene of crane collapse in Crewe A man who lives nearby, who only gave his name as Jason, told BBC Radio Stoke the crane - being used to help build new homes - had been lifting tools before it fell. ""They finished the work, the crane positioned itself facing Bombardier. ""The guys finished their work and they were still up there when all of a sudden, it slowly just started to tilt, tilt tilt. ""Guys started shouting and it completely fell on the floor."" Flowers and written tributes have been left Ch Supt Matt Welsted, of Cheshire Police, has said: ""This is a truly tragic incident, and our deepest condolences go out to the families affected at this extremely difficult time."" Following the collapse, police closed Dunwoody Way at the junction of West Street. Ch Supt Welsted said: ""A residential property has been damaged as a result of the incident, the occupants were not injured and were checked over by medical professionals. ""They have since been relocated while the investigation continues. ""The bodies of those who have sadly lost their lives will shortly be recovered from the scene."" He urged anyone with footage taken from the scene to ""please respect the families involved"" and if any could be of use to the investigation make it available to investigators. The road where a crane collapsed in Crewe is a main route in the centre of the town through a built-up, industrial area. At one end, Dunwoody Way has Phoenix Leisure Park (a site with a cinema, bowling alley and bingo hall), with routes off to housing estates and a Morrisons. It then continues past the Bombardier Transportation factory (Crewe's historical railway works) before heading west out of the town.

"More than six months after first suggesting the idea, the government has announced plans to ban fees to lettings agents in England. A new Tenants' Fees Bill was announced in the Queen's Speech, which will stop tenants having to pay money to agents. The commitment was announced by the Conservatives in the 2016 Autumn Statement. ARLA Propertymark, which represents letting agents, said the new rules would cost 4,000 jobs. However the measure is likely to pass into law, as all the main parties had it in their election manifestos. The average amount paid in fees is currently Â£223, according to government figures. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, previously said that 4.3m households pay such fees every year. Queen's Speech: Brexit bills dominate Bill-by-bill guide: Queen's Speech Laura Kuenssberg: Speech reflects weaker May However, the housing charity Shelter found that one in seven renters pays more than Â£500, and tenants in Londonhave complainedabout fees of up to Â£2,000. The fees are for taking references, getting credit checks, or investigating immigration status. When the bill becomes law, landlords will have to find the money to pay for such fees themselves. Tenants in Scotland do not pay fees to letting agents ARLA Propertymark said that as a result landlords would lose Â£300m, and would be likely to increase rents. ""A ban on letting agent fees will cost the sector jobs, make buy-to-let investment even less attractive, and ultimately result in the costs being passed on to tenants,"" said David Cox, the organisation's chief executive. Letting agents' fees are already banned in Scotland. The new bill will also allow tenants to recover any fees that have been charged unlawfully. In addition the government said it will make the process more transparent, as renters are currently charged varying amounts. However, lettings agents in England and Wales are already legally required to publicise their rates. Research by Citizens' Advice found that 42% of people paying letting agents' fees had to borrow money to pay them. A government spokesperson said a draft bill will be published ""later this year"".

"Donald Trump's state visit to the UK is in fresh doubt after there was no mention of it in the Queen's Speech. The US president accepted the Queen's invitation for him to travel to Britain when Prime Minister Theresa May visited Washington in January. There have been reports that Mr Trump haschanged his mind and does not want to visitwhile there is potential for protests against him. But a Trump official told the BBC: ""The two governments are discussing dates."" Number 10 said the Queen had not mentioned the visit because no date had been set. Wednesday's Queen's Speech at the State Opening of Parliament saw the monarch announce the government's legislative programme for the next two years. The Queen also uses the speech to set out her official plans for the year. She said she looked forward to welcoming King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain for their state visit in July, and hosting the Commonwealth summit in April next year. But there was no word about Mr Trump's state visit. October had been suggested as a possible date. Brexit bills at heart of Queen's Speech Bill-by-bill guide: Queen's Speech Queen's Speech reflects weaker May A Downing Street spokesman said: ""An invitation has been extended and accepted. ""The visit wasn't mentioned in the Queen's Speech because a date hasn't been fixed yet."" In his last statement on the issue, White House spokesman Sean Spicer had said: ""Her Majesty extended an invitation to the president. He's accepted that invitation. And we look forward to scheduling that trip. ""There is nothing that was scheduled and we look forward to working out a mutually acceptable date with the United Kingdom, and look forward to sharing that date."" There is a very good reason for that date not being set. That is because there are concerns within the White House that if Donald Trump came to the UK, there would be some substantial protests. There is also a concern within the British government that it would not help US-UK relations if the US president was embarrassed. It is very unlikely he will be coming this year. This government has only so much bandwidth, that trying to work out precisely when they are going to have a visit from the US president, particularly if he is having cold feet, is something I imagine they will say to put on the back burner for a bit. When the invitation was first made by Theresa May on behalf of the Queen, there was a lot of concern that she had jumped the gun and gone too fast on this - to give a new US president the offer of a full state visit was a little premature. Normally that kind of offer does not come until well into the presidency. It quite often happens in a president's second term - if re-elected - and not all US presidents get full state visits. So the fact that it is going to be delayed will not come as a huge disappointment to many people who thought it was a little bit too much, too early.

"The Duke of Edinburgh was seen alongside the Queen at Trooping the Colour on Saturday The Duke of Edinburgh was admitted to hospital on Tuesday as ""a precautionary measure"", Buckingham Palace has said. He is being treated at the King Edward VII Hospital, London, for an infection arising from a pre-existing condition. The BBC understands his hospital stay is ""not a cause for serious concern"" and the palace said the duke was ""up and about and in good spirits"". The duke, 96,said in May that he would retirefrom royal duties this autumn - a move supported by the Queen. She is still carrying out her official engagements andon Wednesday delivered the Queen's Speech to Parliamentbefore heading to the racing at Ascot. Royal Family enjoy the sun on day one at Ascot Prince Philip: Decades of duty Watch: Prince Philip's jokey moments In a statement,,externalBuckingham Palace said the Prince of Wales would accompany the Queen to Parliament and Prince Philip was ""disappointed"" to miss the event. Prince Charles was asked about the duke while on a visit to the scene of the Finsbury Park mosque attack. ""He's getting better. He's getting better,"" he told reporters. Prince Philip was at the races with the Queen on Tuesday The duke was at the Queen's side on Tuesday afternoon for the opening day of the four-day Ascot race meeting. It is understood he was not admitted to hospital as an emergency but, on a doctor's advice, was driven from Windsor Castle to the central London hospital on Tuesday evening. How long he will remain there is not yet known. By Peter Hunt, royal correspondent The palace statement about Prince Philip's health has been designed to reassure. This is a 96-year-old who is reported to be in ""good spirits"" and who is in hospital as a ""precautionary measure"". He was driven there in a car, not an ambulance, from Windsor, where he was said to have been on great form when he attended the first day of the Ascot races.  In sweltering heat yesterday, he was dressed in a morning suit. The prince, like his wife and countless other people, isn't overly keen on publicising the precise nature of what ails him. Given that he is being treated for a pre-existing condition, it is safe to assume that he is suffering from a reoccurrence of a bladder infection that laid him low on two occasions in 2012. He is not bedridden, according to officials, but up and about inside the private hospital. Philip's current good mood may be tested if, as was the case five years ago, he remains an in-patient for several days. Read more from Peter here: Prince Philip has spent much of his life in good health, but he was treated for a blocked coronary artery in 2011 and a bladder infection in 2012. That saw him miss much of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations. He backs healthy eating and exercise. He drinks moderately, takes the stairs and says he still fits into the uniform he wore on the day he married the Queen, almost 70 years ago.

"The Queen sets out government's plans Because of short notice, less pomp than usual Duke of Edinburgh unwell so does not attend Prince Charles steps in for the occasion Brexit dominates with 8 of 27 bills This year's event follows snap election Jackie Storer and Alex Hunt Theresa May urges the UK to ""seize this moment"" but Labour's Jeremy Corbyn says she has ""no mandate"" and has lost her authority. This video can not be played Queen's Speech in 90 seconds The roads around Parliament are still closed off, but the (slightly reduced) pomp and ceremony of the Queen's Speech has mostly left Westminster. MPs are back doing what they're used to - arguing with each other in the House of Commons. Here's a recap of the day so far:  Here's abill-by-bill guide- and here'sLaura Kuenssberg's verdict. The BBC political editor says the speech ""confirmed the reality of Theresa May's fall from grace"".  Thanks for joining us today - there are a few days of debate on the Queen's Speech ahead in the Commons before the crunch vote next Thursday - you can follow it as it happens thanks to our colleagues fromBBC Parliament. House of LordsParliament Leader of the House Baroness Evans of Bowes Park, who held the Cap of Maintenance aloft earlier today during the Queen's Speech, now responds to the brief debate from the government benches. She begins by saying that she looks forward to the House of Lords playing its important constitutional role in the issues that the country faces. The legislative process outlined in the Queen's Speech ""recognises and grasps"" the opportunities that lie ahead for the UK outside the EU, she says. Baroness Evans tells peers that although the election result was not the one the Conservatives had hoped for - they would show ""humility and resolve"" in the face of the message sent by the British people. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Mr Blackford goes on to call for renewed talks with Scotland over Brexit and for the single market to be ""back on the table"". He also says the SNP will make the case for a ""credible alternative to austerity"". House of LordsParliament The Liberal Democrat leader in the House of Lords Lord Newby, responds to the speech on behalf of his over 100 Lib Dem colleagues in the chamber with the red seats. After joining Baroness Smith in praising the proposer and seconder of the proceedings today and praising the emergency services, he launches into an attack on the government. He says the Conservative manifesto treated the electorate like children over money - ""not to worry our pretty little heads about it"" - and called the election a cynical attempt to exploit a brief window of opportunity to shore up the Conservative's own position. The result has left a ""weakened prime minister and squabbling ministers"" which has made the UK an object of pity across Europe, he says. This video can not be played First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones says Brexit legislation in the Queen's Speech could impinge on devolution. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Mr Blackford says contrary to what the government promised, many are now feeling ""uncertainty and instability"". ""A strong and stable approach might have involved the prime minister seeking consensus on Brexit,"" he argues. He says they have ""no plan, no mandate and no credible government"". ""Scotland voted clearly and decisively to remain... I had hoped a compromise might be found that would work for all nations of the UK"", he continues, but instead the government is pursuing a ""power grab"". House of LordsParliament Baroness Smith raises the election and one of the primary reasons that Theresa May gave for it - that of unelected peers frustrating the Brexit process. She says that there was nothing extraordinary about the amendments peers voted for on the Brexit process, saying ""It is what we do"". She also promises a ""strong, challenging
and robust"" opposition but says peers will always recognise the primacy of the
Commons. But she reminds peers that the House of Commons has
primacy - not the executive or government. ""They are not the same,"" she says. House of LordsParliament Labour's leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon, rises to respond to the debate in the House of Lords. She says that the proposer and seconder of the motion for the Queen's speech should be a ""wise experienced sage and a young up and coming peer"" - which prompts an eye-roll from Lord Forsyth. ""It's remarkable how quickly you can move from one to the other,"" she says. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's new Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, pays tribute to his predecessor Angus Robertson and former first minister Alex Salmond. He promises Nicola Sturgeon will continue to be ""a thorn in the government's side"". He joins tributes to the victims of recent terrorist attacks and the fatal fire in Kensington. House of CommonsParliament Towards the end of her speech in the Commons Theresa May said the government would respect the will of the British people and ""see Brexit through"". She said she wanted to see a Brexit deal ""that will work for every part of the country"". ""If we're going to grasp the opportunities as we leave the EU we need to build a stronger economy,"" she said. Tough decisions taken after the financial crash ""have paid off"" with the deficit down by three quarters, employment up by 2.9m and four million of the lowest paid out of income tax, she says. ""Inequality has been reduced to its lowest level for 30 years,"" she added. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Theresa May concludes by saying ""this has been a difficult time for our country - many parents are worried"" about the world their children are growing up in. But, she adds, ""we are a resilient country"" and will show ""compassion, unity and resolve"". There's some disquiet as she notes ""not every problem can be solved by an act of Parliament - but it is a step forward"". House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Baroness Bertin, who was David Cameron's press secretary, seconds the Queen's speech. She recalls a moment when she was a new peer when the doorkeepers tried to usher her from the chamber by mistake - remarking that they should remember that peers, like policemen, are getting younger. The peer says she has written her speech today on paper rather than on goatskin parchment, as she thought she should, because she is meant to be a moderniser. She speaks with passion about those in the emergency services who have risked and lost their lives during recent attacks and tragedies. This shows that ""this country has courage and decency at its core"", she says. House of CommonsParliament Theresa May says the government wants to put in place a new Mental Health Act and ensure every primary and secondary school has a member of staff who is trained and knows how to deal with mental health issues. ""The earlier we can address these issues, then the better we can deal with them and the better life we can ensure these people with mental health have,"" she says. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Kevin Brennan refers to Mrs May as ""the interim PM"", asking how she is going to negotiate Brexit with 27 countries if she cannot reach a deal with 10 DUP MPs. The prime minister thanks David Davis for his work so far in Brussels on Brexit talks. House of LordsParliament Lord Forsyth of Drumlean spends a few moments poking fun at his political rivals - most notably the SNP who do not take seats in the House of Lords and seek its abolition. He says that whilst the election campaign was not the Tory Party's finest hour, it had some unexpected highlights. ""Alex Salmond,"" he says simply, which causes laughter in the chamber. ""I knew I could unite this House,"" he says. On Labour, Lord Forsyth remarks that the the new ""rapturous enthusiasm"" on the opposite benches for Jeremy Corbyn ""is matched only by their relief that he isn't running the country"". ""Oh yes Labour now have momentum but sadly for them, Momentum now have Labour."" (Lord Forsyth is referring to thegrassroots organisation,externalwhich supports Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.)

House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Forsyth of Drumlean proposes the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords, calling it a ""singular and unexpected honour"" and telling the chamber that he suspects his selection is part of a campaign by the chief whip to woo the youth vote. He says that the Queen has never missed a day at Royal Ascot since her coronation - and says that he wishes her to be rewarded for her public service by her horse winning this afternoon. Lord Forsyth speaks of Theresa May in the wake of the election, saying that she does not deserve the attacks she has received. ""It is not in our country's interest to trash our prime minister in a time of uncertainty,"" he says. House of CommonsParliament The prime minister has paid tribute to Brendan Cox, the husband of murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, ""for the extraordinary courage and strength he has in dealing with such personal tragedy and for honouring her memory in such an inspring way"". She says that the best way to honour Mrs Cox is to ""show that in our United Kingdom, hope will always triumph over hate"". BBC South political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

" In the closing days of the election campaign, a senior minister whispered to me in the crush of a rally that the Conservatives were on for a comfortable majority or “our voters are being deceitful”. On the day of the election itself, multiple conversations with Labour and Tory politicians reported the same thing. The evidence on the ground pointed to a clear Tory win. Labour MPs talked of being “battered” outside London. During the campaign one senior Labour figure described it vividly: “We have to grit our teeth and watch the car crash happen.” The leader’s office was expecting a Conservative majority of 40 or so, sources suggest. Jeremy Corbyn’s team deny they were focusing on any particular number, but it was suggested that a hung parliament was, although at the upper end of their expectation, one of the scenarios they had under consideration. Then again,a leaked copyof Labour’s prepared script for MPs doing interviews on election night suggested they were prepared for losses, trying to focus on their vote share, and the mistakes of the Tory campaign. The script included tell-tale lines such as “this was always going to be a challenging election” and “the collapse of UKIP has clearly been a boost to the Conservatives since the referendum, but Labour has closed the gap”. Over at Tory HQ, they were preparing for an increased majority. The blue balloons were tied outside the windows of the party’s smart Westminster office. But voters weren’t having a bit of it, denying the Conservatives their victory, crashing Mrs May’s political authority, delighting Mr Corbyn’s supporters by overwhelming their expectations, and robbing his internal enemies in the Labour party of their excuse to move against him. If only 50 people across just four seats had voted Conservative... the Tories would have effectively won a majority What the atmosphere in politics now obscures is that Mrs May was, technically, the winner. The Tories had more seats, more votes, and increased their overall share. And if only 50 people across just four seats had voted Conservative, instead of voting for the winning candidate, the Tories would have effectively won a majority. Yes, you read that right. If 50 people in four decisive constituencies, a crowd that would fit easily on a school bus, had voted for Theresa May’s party, she would have suffered a reputational hit by falling back, but still have been able to operate in parliament without help from other parties (because the seven Sinn Fein MPs won’t take up their seats 322 is an effective majority). At the next level, she would have reached an absolute majority of 326 if the Conservatives had achieved a grand total of 794 extra votes in the right places. Yes, our politics changed overnight, but if only a tiny number of votes had gone the other way, the outcome would have been so different. What the political parties are now trying to understand is how we ended up here, why their expectations were wrong. At the start of the campaign the Tories looked like they would romp home. MPs from both of the main parties had that reinforced on the doorstep, time and again. Those voters weren’t of course, telling porkie pies to political canvassers. But neither Tories nor Labour in their individual constituencies could do much more than talk to their own “promises” – households where they had had support before, or they could theoretically pick it up. Especially in a brief campaign, candidates, short of time, and short of resources, were talking to voters whose track record they knew – they knocked on doors where it might have been worthwhile. Traditional canvassing doesn’t therefore pick up what’s going on with people who haven’t voted before. So as Labour were becoming more buoyant, appealing to young voters and new voters,  it was possible to sense a change, but very hard to pick up the scale. While everyone saw the response to Mr Corbyn at the rallies he attended around the country, the record of previous elections prompted scepticism about the impact that that would have on turnout. Labour increased their appeal to new and young voters “No-one picked up the surge in young people,” one senior minister now believes. “To my eternal frustration people are always fighting the election we’ve just had – we should have known after the referendum this was the election that young people would be switched on.” Labour did a much, much better job of using technology to motivate those new voters too. The prime minister was not completely convincing when she insisted she was taking nothing for granted If private reflexes were wrong too, what makes the Tories’ metaphorical defeat so crushing is the almost total failure to manage public expectations. From the start Downing Street insiders believed they might be in line for a majority of only about 50. Anything less than that would “be a disappointment”, I recall being told, but “still much better than what we’ve got”. But early polls, and the local election results that pointed to a Labour wipeout, were arguably not stamped on hard enough by Conservative HQ. The prime minister was not completely convincing when she insisted she was taking nothing for granted. It wasn’t totally credible because she only called the election believing that she would increase the majority by some margin. Labour’s experience was almost the precise opposite of the Tories'. After a tumultuous two years in Westminster, seeming often not to be able to control his party, let alone events, expectations of Mr Corbyn were low from the start, both in terms of the polling, and the perception of his potential to win. I remember when he first became the Labour leader, talking to senior members of his team about whether they believed they could turn him into a credible national figure, rather than a campaigner who had undoubtedly had huge success in mobilising the left. Their view was always that the building blocks were there – when people saw him on his own terms they liked him. In the context of a general election campaign where he could be himself, rather than in the constraints of Westminster, the opportunity would be there for him to build much bigger levels of support. The test was always whether the “Corbyn effect” that changed the Labour Party could be replicated to create a coalition of anti-Tory sentiment – whether Labour, former Lib Dems, Green voters or new voters – big enough to win. During the campaign, by appearing surrounded by his fans, giving more or less the same passionate stump speech time after time, Mr Corbyn was simply exposed to more and more people on his own terms, and pictured surrounded by people hugely enthused by him, creating more of the same energy. He is fundamentally a happy campaigner and thrived in the closing weeks, comfortable among the crowds. I remember hearing him after a couple of interviews, turn to an aide and enthusiastically ask: “Is it selfie time?” The “big mo” - the enthusiasm and energy in the campaign - was certainly on his side, not the Conservatives’. That is not, however, always what actually determines the result.  Despite Labour joy that they did better than they expected, one senior figure said this week “remember it was Dunkirk, not D-Day”. Arguably Labour’s advances now present as much of a risk as an opportunity. There is another story in what happens to Labour next. It’s still divided on many issues, and on Jeremy Corbyn’s real capabilities. Remember that some of the MPs who increased their majorities unashamedly promised their constituents on the doorsteps that he would be gone after the election and, more to the point, that they’d help remove him. And as the party ponders its future, it might be wise to consider the advice of a Labour Party sage who argues: “This was the worst Tory campaign in 50 years, and we still lost.” The Conservative effort was a bad campaign. In truth, the verdict on any election machine is really the result - a dire few weeks followed by a victory scrubs memories of poor performance. But this time, the campaign really was poor, and this time, it really mattered.  At the manifesto launch I asked Mrs May if she was not setting out a bleak picture of the country. One Conservative MP now describes [the party manifesto] as “more gloomy than the Book of Revelations” Her team had set a lot of store in her ability to take the tough decisions, to “make the hard choices”. I’d been told by senior insiders their private polling ratings for her as a leader were “off the charts”. This gave them the confidence to sketch out a manifesto that was more hard graft and gruel than milk and honey. One Conservative MP now describes it as “more gloomy than the Book of Revelations”. Philip Hammond and David Davis at a campaign event: Fear of Corbyn was a key plank of Conservative strategy The theme of hard choices was meant to play into their chosen campaign focus of leadership. Could it have worked? Until the manifesto was launched, voters we met were offering opinions on her that seemed nearly always favourable. We heard time and again different versions of “I’m normally Labour but I like Theresa May”. She wasn’t slick, “didn’t seem like those other Tories”, was less posh than David Cameron, and was straight. The kind of character, perhaps like your child’s headteacher, who made voters want to stand up properly, pay attention, and not protest too much. But her plans for social care in England were a hard choice too far for many voters. The idea had been in the works, along with some other considerations, across government for many months. But the final version in the manifesto, swiftly branded the “dementia tax”, was a political disaster. Lib Dem campaigners try to draw attention to Conservative care policy proposals Within days, unlike any other previous leader, she had publicly redrafted one of her main manifesto promises. That was problem enough. But the perception of her being straight, unlike other politicians, was trashed by her insistence in front of the cameras, when asked again and again, that nothing had changed about her policy. Plainly, there had been a significant move. In contrast to Jeremy Corbyn's rallies, May's public appearances were carefully controlled While Westminster is extremely unforgiving of the dreaded political U-turn, I’ve often felt voters are more understanding. We all change our minds in normal life, but that tolerance has to meet one vital condition, that the politician admits they have shifted. For Mrs May to try to front out the change, pretending the policy was exactly the same, killed off one of the most valuable aspects of her brand as a politician. She suddenly was, in some voters’ minds, just as slippery as the rest. Refusing to give details on how many people would be hit by changes to winter fuel allowance, failing to explain why and how millions of primary school children would lose their free school meals while the most in need kept theirs, suggesting the Conservatives might revisit the vote on fox hunting - the difficulties began to pile-up. 29 May: Anti-hunting protesters demonstrate against Theresa May's plans to hold a vote on the subject Beyond the problems with the grim manifesto, as one of her now departed chiefs of staff has accepted, the Tory party simply ran the wrong campaign for her. Their polling numbers suggested the best plan was to make it all about the leader. To run a presidential-style campaign in the UK - as the Tories did around David Cameron, and Labour did around Tony Blair - you need the candidate to be willing, and comfortable with what that requires. While Mrs May answered hundreds of press questions, and attended dozens of events, she is simply not the type of politician who is comfortable in situations that are unpredictable, that might go wrong. I suspect, strangely for someone in her position, she is fundamentally rather shy when it comes to her own image. Aides told me after we carried out her only interview during the referendum campaign last year that she asked her husband to watch it, rather than look at it herself, as she was so nervous about how she had come across. At campaign events, as at political summits, she nearly always builds in 20-30 minutes of preparation time once at the venue before appearing in front of the cameras – the only politician I have covered who takes that kind of time. Theresa May “didn't look like she was enjoying the campaign” This desire for preparation  may be laudable. Government officials have previously talked flatteringly of this as an attribute. She wants to read everything, study everything, reflect and prepare. But the combustible atmosphere of a campaign requires something else – a nimbleness, a lightness of touch, a willingness to busk it sometimes, and take the odd public risk. Privately, the prime minister is known to have a sense of humour. But on the road with Theresa May, allowing herself to eat a single chip in front of cameras felt like a truly daring act. Her team were not particularly more controlling than those of other prime ministers that I have trekked around the country with. But the taut public atmosphere that surrounded her was tangible. She didn’t look like she was enjoying the campaign, so why would her efforts appeal to anyone else? Mrs May did not take part in the televised leaders' debate Her decision not to take part in the televised leaders’ debate led to complaints from opponents that she lacked “guts”. If elections really are a tactical game, Jeremy Corbyn took the points by turning up. There was no big breakthrough moment that night but what impact did her non-appearance have on voters? I spoke to some members of the audience right after the debate had wrapped up. Even some Tory voters said they were pretty fed up that the prime minister hadn’t “bothered” to turn up. The calculation was based on the traditional notion that in a campaign, the frontrunner has no incentive to debate the underdog. The Tories believed it was the right call that night – Theresa May wasn’t part of what some described as a ""rabble"". But it did make an impression on the electorate, not least because the Labour campaign brought it up again and again. The hoped for “strong and stable” image morphed into accusations that Theresa May was simply a robot, unable to respond to changing situations, to rise to political challenges. Since the election that perception has been intensified by her response to the Grenfell Tower disaster. No 10 considered carefully whether she should visit the scene on the day after. She did, but only privately met the emergency services and some volunteers. In contrast, Mr Corbyn was filmed meeting residents and locals caught up in the disaster. Grenfell Tower, west London, scene of a devastating fire which left dozens dead There was obvious caution in Number 10 about what was a very fast moving situation. They were well aware that it left them open to accusations she looked uncaring. But on balance, cautious of being vulnerable to accusations of making political capital, distracting from the emergency effort, or being there, and unable to answer families’ questions, they decided not to, and not to alert the media to her visit. This meant all that emerged were stilted photographs from a distance of the prime minister with uniformed emergency services. In the following days she met victims of the disaster but faced cries of ""coward"" from an angry crowd when she left a local church. She also met families at Downing Street. Mrs May drew criticism for an initial visit to Grenfell Tower where she did not meet stricken residents Politics can call for empathy as well as leadership - the initial inability to visit more directly was a mistake. With Mrs May on the scene the afternoon after the terror attack at Finsbury Park, it’s a lesson No 10 seems now to have learnt. The other awful terror attacks that slammed the brakes on the election campaign not once, but twice, had rammed Mrs May’s rigidity home to voters, and in the process overturned years of political assumptions. As the terrible truth of the Manchester, and then the London Bridge attacks sank in, the prime minister was tested like never before, and her record as home secretary was called into question. Police form a cordon across London Bridge, shortly after the 3 June attack there Although there was enormous praise for the emergency services at both events, before too long warnings made to her about police cuts during her time as home secretary began to surface. It is true that there is no consensus about the impact that the loss of 20,000 police officers in England has had. Some experts, like the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, Lord Carlile, believe it has had no effect on Britain’s ability to deal with terrorism. Overall crime has fallen during that period too. An armed officer on patrol near the site of the Manchester attack On the other side, there is a very appealing logic to the argument that suggests that of course it has had an impact. How can you possibly make a case that the loss of that number of officers has had no effect? In the bewildering, upsetting aftermaths of those terrible two events, it was entirely predictable that voters would start asking more questions about public protection. Mrs May’s political rivals began to pile on pressure about the levels of policing. It took the political fight straight to her record as home secretary, shoving the Conservatives on to the defensive in the final phases of the campaign, pushing at the bruise that the manifesto had left. Theresa May was quizzed on police cuts following the London Bridge attack In one speech, which was designed to get the campaign back on track, even held in the same room where Mrs May launched her bid for the leadership, she was asked seven times in a row by journalists, myself included, about police cuts. Seven times she gave almost exactly the same answer, more or less denying there was a problem, and not really appearing to understand the public’s concerns. There is still a complicated argument about the effect of police numbers. But elections are painted with bold brush strokes, and for Labour, the issue was the perfect political opportunity to marry up contemporary events that had shaken the country with one of their central political objectives, the argument against austerity. Whereas the 2015 campaign was sometimes an arms race to see which party could sound tougher on the deficit, the issue more or less disappeared this time round. Sorting out the deficit is still important to the Tories, but far from the central selling point it was in the Cameron-Osborne project. During this campaign the Conservatives had chosen not to put the justifications for spending cuts centre stage in their campaign, leaving them doubly vulnerable to the attack. Tory and Labour MPs soon reported back that the attack on police cuts was playing on the public’s minds on the doorstep. Labour had found a policy criticism that damaged Mrs May in particular. It was a specific and meaningful real life example of the practical consequences of the cuts with the Conservative leader unwilling, or unable, to defend her case deftly or with much conviction. For Mr Corbyn and Labour it was a perfect mash-up of austerity and security. He was vulnerable on security, criticised frequently by the Tories for his views on the nuclear deterrent, his attitude to foreign policy. But by zeroing in on police cuts, it was an issue that didn’t just put Mrs May under pressure on his favoured topic of austerity, but also went some way to neutralise one of his perceived negatives. The Conservatives had long been considered the party of law and order – but perhaps not in this election. And the issue allied a tangible statistic to a general sense that, Tory ministers acknowledge themselves, was perhaps already stirring. For year after year since 2010, the public sector has been under real pressure. The coalition’s first layer of cuts gave rise to assumptions in some political quarters that you could keep slicing at public sector budgets and not feel much political pain. March 2017: A march against NHS cuts. Labour was able to benefit from public unease at continued austerity Overall, public sector spending has continued to increase in cash terms. But taking inflation into consideration, it’s roughly the same - and there’s much stronger demand for the health service, and an increasing population. There’s no question some parts of the public sector have experienced seven years of tightening budgets, and the consequences could no longer be ignored. Labour was able to benefit not just from growing public unease, but also from a number of parallel campaigns that were not necessarily party political. On school cuts for example, the unions drove a significant campaign - headteachers even wrote home to families warning of the impact of school funding changes. That was not of course a direct instruction to parents round the country to vote Labour, but another component in developing a sense of unease about the Conservative government. The Labour campaign was more open tousing technology to its maximum effect. Whether on Whatsapp, Twitter or Facebook, the Tories had the bigger chequebook, but it was Labour that exploited technology to a much more significant advantage. They repeated some of the techniques used by Mr Corbyn’s supporters in his first and second leadership elections and that effectively spread the word around new voters or others who hadn’t voted for years. New left-of-centre news sites have developed rapidly in the last couple of years, ready to spread Mr Corbyn’s message, not just with a less than traditional consideration for facts, but also with a knack of creating content that’s easily and entertainingly shared online. Labour did a much better job of finding new voters, and speaking to undecided voters, in the places they spend much of their time - online. And an ethos that was less controlling allowed other organisations and activists in to share the load of campaigning. Without question this was a significant factor that pulled in and excited first-time voters, including the critical drive to get them to register to vote to start with. In complete contrast, the Tories super-centralised campaign left little space for friendly sympathisers, and while they had the spending power, they didn’t have the sentiment. Ironically, in 2015 the Tories did have a relatively extensive campaign drive for young activists - a “road trip” that flooded constituencies with activists and had a sizeable online presence. But the stories of bullying and controversial behaviour that emerged after the election, as well as the investigation over election expenses, put paid to that project. To the frustration of some inside Conservative HQ, it was never replaced. And in the last seven weeks, it showed. Near the start of the campaign, one senior Tory told me they wanted the campaign to be as “traditional as it can be”. In 2017, that proved to be a naïve and bad call. In these volatile days there are all sorts of attempts to reach sweeping conclusions about what the public was trying to say. For me, it’s just not that simple, but a gloriously tangled web of reasons and rationales. There was effectively a different underlying question on the ballot paper in Scotland for example - whether to have a second independence referendum. That drove the decisions for many voters, taking the shine from Nicola Sturgeon’s now wonky crown. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon - her party lost seats... It would have been unthinkable a few years ago, but it was the Scottish Conservatives that saved Mrs May, introducing a new Tory power, in its leader Ruth Davidson, to a broader national stage. Labour in Scotland didn’t collapse either, putting on seats. ...to the Scottish Conservatives, led by Ruth Davidson But the referendum has indeed seemed to remove UKIP’s reason for being – the party has travelled some distance now from national relevance. Their voters did not move overwhelmingly to the Tories, but split out between them and the Labour Party. Former UKIP leader Paul Nuttall - the party lost votes both to the Conservatives and Labour For the Lib Dems, there was no grand resurgence, but they did pick up a few more seats. And the wallpaper of the election - Brexit - motivated different voters in different ways. In some seats, certainly, Labour held off Conservative opposition because of the prime minister’s stance on Brexit. But that happened in reverse too. Former Lib Dem leader Tim Farron - his party ended up with 12 MPs And for millions of voters, of course, day-to-day considerations helped make their minds up too. Again, the Tory calculation that made this campaign all about the leadership required for a political process proved a mistake. What, dear voter, are you more affected by? The form of the British negotiating team in Brussels during a 20-month session of political hard bargaining? Or the letter that came home in your child’s school bag from the headteacher warning they might have to sack two teachers because of their shrinking budget? What this election notably did feature was a bigger difference between the two main political parties than we have seen for some time. And when that was on offer, voters returned to those two traditional tribes in a way we haven’t seen for years. It’s impossible to conclude purely that this election was a wholesale rejection of the prime minister’s view on Brexit, or a general howl of pain against austerity, or an electoral slam dunk for Mr Corbyn’s different vision and more radical manifesto. Voters are too complex, too wonderfully varied, too differently motivated to have their views stuffed into pigeonholes in such straightforward ways. This election result leaves the country now in the most unstable political state for years. What it stunningly and decisively was not, was the election that Theresa May had expected. She is now stuck with the most painful irony. The prime minister called this election, at least in part to insulate herself from the demands of her own party, to achieve a mandate that would free her to stand up to her backbenches, and give her breathing space in Brussels. In contrast, the result damned her with faint praise. Her own reputation crashed, arguably faster than any other in modern British political times. She now looks set to be dependent on support from a tiny party, the DUP, that only represents one part of the United Kingdom, whose past views and record have alarmed some Conservatives. Only four weeks after a set of local elections where she swept all before her, the general election humbled her, weakened her, leaving Theresa May a “wounded antelope” in the words of one of her senior colleagues. An election called to show who was in charge ended with politicians being given a striking reminder. It is not them, but the public who is the boss. Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.9936196
"In the years after the creation of the Israeli state hundreds of babies went missing. Their parents, mostly Jewish immigrants from Yemen, were told their children had died, but suspicions linger that they were secretly given away to childless families - and newly released documents have revealed some disturbing evidence. When Leah Aharoni remembers losing her baby daughter five decades ago, she bursts into tears. ""I just saw her for a short time. She was pretty with fair skin. She opened her eyes and looked at me, as if she was saying: 'Don't let me go,'"" she says. Leah had given birth to premature twins in a hospital near her home in Kiryat Ekron, in central Israel, but the little girls were sent away to be cared for. She was told they were being taken to a special clinic in Tel Aviv. But when Leah's husband visited soon afterwards, only one of the twins was there. The other, Hanna, had died, he was informed. Leah was shocked not to be shown a body or a grave - a common feature of such stories - but she and her husband did not doubt the heart-breaking news. It was only years later that she began asking questions, when her surviving daughter, Hagit, turned 18 and was called for national military service. Two draft notices arrived in the post simultaneously. One for Hagit - and one for Hanna. This is another hallmark of missing baby stories. This video can not be played 'I want to know where my daughter went' ""It started to bother me. Something was not right. I couldn't sleep at night. I decided I had to know what happened,"" Leah says. Leah had experienced many calamities long before the loss of her baby. As a child, she and her family had joined thousands of Jews fleeing violence in Yemen. They were robbed as they trekked from one end of the country to the other and Leah was reduced to begging for food. Then they were rescued in an airlift known as Operation Magic Carpet. ""It was the land I had always dreamed about,"" the 78-year-old recalls, remembering the flight to Israel. ""When we got off the plane everyone kissed the holy ground. ""Then we heard the bombs and grenades and saw the smoke."" They had arrived, malnourished and penniless, during the first Arab-Israeli war. Leahâs family (she is second from the left) before they left Aden Many Yemenite Jews spent periods in transit camps before being settled in homes, and stories of babies going missing began to arise immediately. Some reports talk of children disappearing after visits to the camps by wealthy American Jews. In other cases children appeared to be recovering in hospitals from relatively minor ailments when the parents were suddenly told they had died. On kibbutzes, where some of the Yemenites settled, it was typical for youngsters to be separated from their parents and looked after together, and here too it's said that some children vanished. Children were routinely separated from their parents on kibbutzes Estimates of the number of missing children range from hundreds to thousands. In many cases the parents believe their children were really kidnapped and given or sold to families of European Jews - occasionally Holocaust survivors who had lost their children - or Americans. Over time, Leah, like many other parents, ceased to believe in the story of her child's death. ""I went to my father and told him, but he said I should never suspect another Jew stole my child,"" she says. She went in search of documents that would reveal the truth about what happened to Hanna, and was deeply disturbed by what she found. Leah shows a death certificate for her daughter from 1969 - she was also given one dated 1966 One document she obtained said the babies were moved to Tel Aviv after the date on Hanna's death certificate. Another was a second death certificate, dated three years later than the first - long after Leah and her husband had been told their daughter had died. Like Leah, most parents received no information about their child's grave. When they did, in some cases it transpired that the grave was empty, or DNA tests showed that the body was not theirs. Three government inquiries have looked into the Yemenite Children Affair, as it is known, since the 1960s, and all have concluded that most children died of diseases and were buried without their parents being informed or involved. But many of the families involved suspect a cover-up and continue to believe that there was an organised operation to snatch children, involving health workers and government officials. So last year the government of Benjamin Netanyahu decided to open up most of the archives of the public inquiries andput them online,external. Netanyahu said this marked a new era of transparency and would ""right an historic wrong"". Last week it led to shocking revelations in a Knesset committee about medical experiments on Yemenite children. Testimony given under oath at one of the earlier inquiries revealed that four undernourished babies died after being given an experimental protein injection, and that many children died as a result of medical negligence. Disturbing photographs of malnourished children in hospital with the word ""spleen"" marked on their body were shown in evidence to the Knesset special committee Post-mortem examinations were carried out on children, who were then buried in mass graves in violation of Jewish tradition, the special Knesset committee on the disappearance of children heard. In some cases the children's hearts were removed for US doctors, who were studying why there was almost no heart disease in Yemen. ""It's a big scandal that the doctors didn't tell the parents they were doing experiments and research on their children,"" says Nurit Koren, the chair of the committee. ""And even worse there are healthy babies who died from an experimental treatment.  It's a crime, it was on purpose, and it let to their death."" Koren is herself the child of parents from Yemen. One of her cousins and her mother-in-law's sister were among the children who disappeared. So one of her objectives, on being elected, was to reopen the subject, which she describes as ""an open wound in the heart of the Israeli nation"". One of the disturbing aspects of the Yemenite Children Affair is the way the darker-skinned immigrants appear to have been treated as second-class citizens. The founders of Israel were mostly Ashkenazi Jews, of European descent, some of whom expressed fears that Mizrahi (literally ""Eastern"") Jews brought with them a backwards ""Oriental"" culture that might damage the new state. ""Zionism - what is it really about?"" asks Rafi Shubeli, a Yemenite-Israeli historian and activist from the group Our Brothers Do Exist. ""What were its intentions towards Mediterranean Jews, the Jews of the Islamic world? ""There are very many elements in Israeli society who want to avoid this kind of discussion."" Rafi Shubeli, Yemenite-Israeli historian and activist from the group Our Brothers Exist, giving evidence in the Knesset Whether there was an organised conspiracy to snatch Yemenite babies and give them away for adoption remains unproven though, according to historian Tom Segev, who has written books on Israel's early years and served as an expert witness for one government inquiry. He points out that hundreds of thousands of immigrants arrived in Israel at a time of war, and in the years immediately afterwards, when the country was still reeling. ""All these people came in very, very difficult conditions and it's a story of chaos,"" Segev says. This video can not be played Tom Segev: ""I don't think there was a conspiracy"" Yemenites were housed in tents and had to endure heavy winters. There were child mortality rates of 50%, he points out. Some children may have been given away, he accepts. ""In some cases this might have happened: one, two, three, four, 10 - I don't know how many,"" he says. But in most cases the children just died, he believes. ""It's probably the most tragic story of the return of Jews to Israel."" Working with Nurit Koren, MyHeritage, a company that researches family ancestry, recently began offering help to Yemenite Jews who have a missing child, or who think they were secretly adopted. Leah Aharoni, who has long been convinced that her daughter, Hanna, could be alive and searching for her biological family, gave a DNA sample - samples of cells from the inside of her cheek - to be checked against others in a new database for Yemenite-Israelis. ""I want to find out where my daughter went. I want her to know that I didn't abandon her, that I love her,"" Leah says. ""I was tricked."" She is encouraged by a few cases in which adults in Israel and abroad found out they had been adopted, and managed to trace their Yemenite parents. She is still waiting to find out if there is a match for her. At a beachside cafe in Haifa, I meet a physicist who is philosophical about how his life was shaped by this time of turmoil. Yehuda Kantor found his biological family through DNA testing A few months ago, Yehuda Kantor became the first person to be reunited with his biological family through the MyHeritage testing programme. He had spent more than 20 years searching for his biological mother - making regular appearances in the media to publicise his case. ""I got hundreds of telephone numbers and lots of information but none quite fitted my story.  I tried some DNA tests but it was in vain,"" Yehuda says. Yehuda had a happy childhood, raised in nearby Afula by Batia and Asher Kantor, an Ashkenazi Jewish couple originally from Eastern Europe. Yehuda as a child with his adoptive family Photographs show he had a darker complexion than his relatives and school friends. However, it was not until he reached his twenties that he discovered what much of his close-knit community already knew: he was adopted. His mother, who had been unable to conceive, revealed she had brought him home from a small orphanage, aged three. She always feared losing him and so, out of respect for his adoptive parents, it was only after they died that Yehuda opened his adoption file. This showed no signature of consent from his Yemenite biological mother and gave only her first name, Zahara. MyHeritage was able to use that to trace a grave for a woman who had died 17 years ago. They then approached her five children asking them to do DNA tests. These showed they are the half-brother and half-sisters of Yehuda. ""Wow, there are a lot,"" remarked Yehuda, as he was told the news ahead of an emotional first meeting filmed by Israeli television. His biological siblings had never been told of the existence of an older brother and were unable to explain the circumstances of his adoption. However, they were able to give some information on his roots and Yehuda is delighted to be getting to know them better.

"The claim:The Metropolitan Police is facing cuts of Â£400m by 2021. Reality Check verdict:The Metropolitan Police's budget will be flat in cash terms, so there is not going to be a cut in that sense, but the Mayor of London's team calculates that rising costs will mean savings of Â£400m will need to be found between 2017-18 and 2020-21. Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair told Tuesday's Today Programme that police cuts need to be reconsidered. Later, a spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: ""It is simply not true to say that the Met's budget has been protected... the Met now has to find a further Â£400m."" But on Wednesday's programme, First Secretary of State Damian Green said: ""There are no police cuts. We have protected police budgets in this parliament."" So who is right? The Met is getting the same amount of cash each year, so it is not being cut in that sense, but its costs are rising. Reality Check has looked at theoverall funding of policing in England and Wales before. Overall the police budget in England and Wales has been protected in real terms, but not every individual force will feel the benefit because the money is being targeted at specialist areas of policing. The relatively small funding boost comes off the back of five years of deep cuts. The calculation that rising costs will mean that the Met needs to find savings of more than Â£400m by 2020-21 comes from the Mayor of London's Office for Policing and Crime (MOPAC)budget submission from December last year,external. It says the extra costs cover ""a range of items"" including: Rises in pay and general inflation Pension costs Spending on firearms Investment in modern IT and mobility. The Home Office said: ""Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has been clear that there remain significant efficiencies in policing to be delivered from digitisation, collaboration and improving workforce capability,"" so it seems confident that efficiencies can be used to cover the extra money needed. Speaking to the London Assembly on Wednesday, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick outlined some of the areas where savings could be made and said that despite those: ""If we don't get any further money it will be very difficult for us to provide some of the services we currently provide."" Deputy Commissioner Craig Mackey said: ""It's like saying you take home Â£1000 a month and in four years time you'll still be taking home Â£1000 a month. Will you still feel as well off? No you won't."" There is increased security in London There are two other issues surrounding the Met's funding. The first is that the government has been considering a review of the police funding formula, which dictates how money is shared out between police forces. There was concern that this might leave the Met with less money. There were reports on Tuesday that those plans had been scrapped, but the Home Office has stressed no decisions have yet been taken on that. The Â£400m calculation was based on the old funding formula, so any changes to funding would be on top of that. The other issue is that the Met gets a National, International and Capital City (NICC) grant, to cover the extra work it needs to do as a result of operating in a major city. The tightened security in London means it is likely to have to spend more on these sorts of functions, but MOPAC says there is a Â£170m a year shortfall between what the Met is currently spending on such functions and how much it receives from the Home Office.

"Glastonbury has opened its gates and fans have started to trickle in. The early birds will all be vying for the prime camping spots next to the main stages where Foo Fighters, Radiohead, Stormzy and Lorde will perform over the weekend. They'll be joined by 177,000 other revellers, musicians, stall holders and volunteers, who make the annual pilgrimage to Worthy Farm to drink in the proceedings before proceeding to the drink. And while the only thing you can predict about Glastonbury is its unpredictability, here are 12 things we're 99% certain will happen over the next five days. Yes, the UK is in the middle of a heat wave. Yes, the forecast says it will be dry. But if you turn up to Glastonbury with nothing but a pair of flip-flops and a floaty dress, you only have yourself to blame. Playing the Pyramid Stage is a huge honour and a terrifying prospect, all rolled into one globally-televised gift box. We've seen experienced bands like U2 and Gorillaz come unstuck and walk away humbled. But we've also seen underdogs like Pulp and Florence + The Machine triumph after being bumped into headline slots at the last minute. Who's going to get it right - and wrong - this year? Like these ones. Every year, festival founder Michael Eavis holds a press conference. And every year he claims the latest Glastonbury festival is better than every other Glastonbury festival ever, full stop, no comebacks. He will also drop a hint about next year's headliners (""they have six legs and they're from Cardiff""), prompting at least seven speculative articles on the NME website. BBC Glastonbury - How to watch and listen BBC Weather - latest forecast Who is Glastonbury's greatest headliner? Full Glastonbury line-up In 2014, we stumbled across a Korean funk band calledSultans of Disco,externalplaying in The Rabbit Hole at two in the morning. Wearing matching dogtooth suits and playing an exuberant cover of the Ghostbusters theme, they were literally the best thing we saw all weekend. And yes, we were sober. That's the magic of Glastonbury: at any given moment your new favourite band could be around the next corner. (It could equally be a doughnut van - there seem to be a lot of those too.) If we had to single out a few rising acts, we'd say Norwegian pop singerSigrid, gravel-voiced soul singerJosh Barryand folk trioWildwood Kinwill be among the acts winning people's hearts this year. This video can not be played Folk trio Wildwood Kin perform Steady My Heart for BBC Introducing Every year, thousands of mangled tents and sleeping bags are discarded by campers who can't be bothered to clean up after themselves. It costs the organisers Â£780,000 to clean up the mess, money that would otherwise be going to charity. So have some respect and bring your rubbish home with you. This video can not be played Ed Sheeran plays The A Team at his Glastonbury debut in 2011 OK, so Galway Girl is essentially an insult to the people and music of Ireland. But Ed Sheeran just about makes up for it with his impressively charismatic and likeable stage shows. With years of incessant gigging under his belt, he's adept at working a big crowd - armed with just a microphone and his teeny, child-sized guitar. Eschewing a backing band, he builds his songs from scratch on stage, using a sampler and a foot pedal to build inventive layers of loops. The fact the technology could fail at any moment gives his gigs a sense of peril that more polished headline acts lack. Expect him to convert a few sceptics when he closes the festival on Sunday night. Where does it come from? How does it stay upright? What if someone gets trapped under it? Bonus points if it's taller than the bus. This always precedes a video of someone juggling. Which is the perfect time to put the kettle on and be thankful you're not at Glastonbury, being forced to watch someone juggling. Our mate heard it from the security guy on the Avalon Stage, who saw the setlist and swears it's true. Also, Rihanna is doing guest vocals on Get Lucky and we saw Bryan Ferry having a kebab in the Stone Circle. Don't try to retrieve it, whatever you do. 2017 has been almost uniformly rubbish, but standing in a field with 100,000 strangers, drinking sambuca from a plastic cup while Katy Perry belts out Firework in a spangly leotard will leave you with an enormous sense of well-being.

"Daniel Day-Lewis picked up Oscars in 1990, 2008 and 2013 Daniel Day-Lewis has announced he is to retire from acting. It's a surprise - and yet not all that surprising - for an actor who made history as the first man to win three best actor Oscars, but who is also famous for leaving years between roles. The acclaimed actor won his first Academy Award in 1990 for My Left Foot, his second in 2008 for There Will Be Blood and third for Lincoln in 2013. That tally is bettered only by the inimitable Katharine Hepburn, who secured four best actress Oscars. Having starred in just five films over the past 20 years, Day-Lewis is famous for being choosy with his roles and for the huge amount of preparation he puts into his characters, both on screen and off. Daniel Day-Lewis retires from acting He notably confined himself to a wheelchair for his role in My Left Foot and became an apprentice butcher for his part in Gangs of New York. He also made cast and crew refer to him as Mr Lincoln while filming the movie about the US president, and he refused to step out of the role off-set. The actortold the BBCjust before his third Oscar win that his immersive acting method made ""complete sense"" to him. ""All you're trying to do is lay the groundwork, which might allow the imagination to free itself,"" he said. This video can not be played Daniel-Day Lewis speaks to the Andrew Marr Show ""When the imagination frees itself, you have no goddamn idea what's going to happen. So it's not a constrictive or restrictive way of working - quite the opposite."" He added that he found it far easier to stay in character during the filming process, saying: ""What would drain me much more, in my case, is jumping in and out of that world that we've gone to such an inordinate length to create for ourselves."" But this also isn't the first time Day-Lewis has stepped out of the limelight, usually leaving long stretches of years between roles. He appeared to quit the business at the end of the 1990s and reportedly worked as a cobbler until Martin Scorsese convinced him to return to acting in Gangs of New York - so he may still be tempted back in the future. So what was the secret of his success? A selection of film experts give their opinion: ""His unique selling point, as far as the hype around his films is concerned, is the enormous amount of preparation he puts into every role and his commitment to staying in that role when filming begins. ""There's a mystique around his craftsmanship - there are anecdotes of him being addressed as Mr President on the set of Lincoln, and he got an apprenticeship in butchery after he was cast as a butcher in Gangs of New York. ""But what matters is how that intensity and preparation translates onto the big screen. He is a presence that's totally cinematic and the sheer size of his character is impressive. When you think of There Will Be Blood, there was an enormous, empty landscape, but he filled it with his personality. ""He did something similar with Lincoln - in preparing and inhabiting it, he's not just giving a performance as president, he embodies Lincoln and pushes through the iconic quality of the role."" ""The seriousness in which he takes his profession is beyond imagining - we know how dedicated he is. He's the perfect mix of English classical acting and American method acting, he merges the two perfectly. ""His dilemma is - how do you become somebody who observes nature when you're as famous as he is? He's notorious for finding reasons not to do films and combs every project for reasons not to do it. ""He has an extraordinary ability to mimic people and his chameleon ability is staggering. There's an extreme contrast between his role in There Will Be Blood and the role in Lincoln - you couldn't get two more different characters. ""There are lengthy gaps in between his films, so when you see him, you're not bored because you've not seen him for a while. ""He's got a perfect 'mid-Atlanticness', which makes it easy for him to be trans-Atlantic than someone like Hugh Grant, who's very much English."" The star won his first Oscar in 1990 for My Left Foot, based on the true story of Christy Brown who was born with cerebral palsy and could only control his left foot ""The choice of who he works with is clearly a significant factor when it comes to recognition that those roles get. ""He's very discerning - for Lincoln, it was Steven Spielberg trying to convince him as he had turned it down. So just because Spielberg comes knocking, it doesn't mean he'll take the role. It has to be pretty special. ""As a result, after six months of research and method work, he delivers the goods. A role like Lincoln is the kind Oscar voters respond to because they're a bit older and this kind of prestige project is something that speaks to them. ""He takes it to a level that others aren't prepared to do, where it's a much larger-than-life performance that would be corny if done by lesser actors. But he brings a truth to these roles through that method and that makes them convincing and worthy of awards. ""In terms of other roles, [2009 film] Nine was a rare misfire. I think that's a case of him pushing himself in a different direction to bring a certain prestige to a musical role that hadn't been attempted before and it's association with a great film-maker like Fellini. But he's got a pretty strong hit rate."" ""He can play heroic characters. Even when he was starring in My Beautiful Laundrette, he turned it into a heroic character and that's not a very English quality. ""Dan was always known as being top of the 'crumpet list' - he was very good looking and very sexy. He was also a good actor, but he was a dazzling fellow. ""If you ask me to analyse what it is about him, about his character, I have no idea. We didn't think 'this bloke is about to become a huge star', just as we didn't think this film was going to be successful and change our lives. He was just Dan.""

"Sunburnt apples are typically juiced and bring in little money for farmers Everyone knows that too much sun is bad for them, but it's not just people who need to worry about sunburn. Too much heat is becoming a big problem for South African apple farmers. ""If just 10% of the fruit in your package has sunburn, it automatically becomes a third-grade fruit,"" says Andre Cloete, Managing Director of Klein Ezeljacht farm, ""you can send it to the pack house, but you won't get any money for it."" Typically this fruit ends up being juiced, the least profitable result for a farmer. Mr Cloete estimates that about a fifth of his traditional red apples have been downgraded this year due to sunburn, while for his green granny apples it's much higher at 60%. There's nothing wrong with the taste of these apples. In fact, a sunburnt apple typically tastes sweeter because the sun increases the sugar, and gives the fruit a stronger flavour. The problem is the apples' appearance. In the same way that supermarkets often reject wonky vegetables on aesthetics alone, the apples' unappealing appearance means they are unlikely to sell and are therefore rejected by wholesalers. Andre Cloete sends the majority of the apples he produces overseas. To solve the issue, Mr Cloete has invested in extra netting and irrigation, but it's not cheap. He estimates protecting the fruit properly can increase costs by as much as half. Nonetheless, he believes it's a price worth paying particularly because he expects climate change to exacerbate the issue. ""Sunburn is a big problem and it'll become a bigger problem in future so you have to adapt and you have to choose varieties more suitable to the conditions so you get less sunburn,"" he says. He says it's a particular concern for farmers in the Elgin Valley area, which is one of the country's largest apple producing regions. Like most South African farmers, Mr Cloete sends about half of the apples he produces overseas. Apples have long been one of the country's top agricultural exports, and fruit from local orchards is exported to over a hundred countries including the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia and Germany. In Asia people prefer a bigger, redder apple Africa's largest apple exporter Tru-Cape currently sends its fruit to 104 countries, but is mainly focused on South East Asian countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, as well as the Middle East. But meeting the often very exacting requirements of overseas buyers can be tough. ""Most customers buy with their eyes first,"" he says. In Africa, he says that buyers want a ""green coloured golden delicious rather than a yellow-coloured one"". In contrast, in China and the Far East they prefer a bigger, red full coloured fruit which crucially has to be blemish free. The different markets also have different size requirements. ""In general, the Chinese market demands larger fruit,"" he says. ""Most customers buy with their eyes first,"" says Rolf Pienaar This of course increases the costs of transporting them, meaning if they're subsequently rejected on arrival it can be an expensive mistake. ""It's a high risk market, if the quality is not right,"" he says. Nonetheless, Mr Pienaar says the firm is now exploring ""ad hoc opportunities"" in the country. ""It can be a very lucrative market if you get the quality and timing right. We are cautiously optimistic about developing trade once export protocols are in place."" This kind of expansion into new markets is crucial for the firm which currently sells around half of its produce to local markets.

The fall in the price of oil - which has more than halved over the past three years - has made such sales tougher because countries simply have less cash to pay for it, says Mr Pienaar. But economic factors which are harder to mitigate against are also impacting South African exports. The weakness South Africa's rand currency against the US dollar has helped the apple industry by making their produce comparative cheaper to many overseas buyers. But now the rand is strengthening, reversing this advantage. Mr Pienaar says that as well as putting pressure on the amount of profit farmers are able to make, it also makes it tougher for them to reinvest. ""We need to get used to the uncertainty, it may be the new norm going forward,"" he says. It's not just economic factors making it tough for apple farmers. The majority of South Africa's apples are cultivated in the country's Western Cape province, which is currently in the grip of a drought. Professor Wiehann Steyn, crop production manger at fruit industry body Hortgro says this kind of drought is expected to become more frequent with ""serious implications"" for fruit farmers. ""Young trees grow less and mature trees carry fewer and smaller fruit. Fruit quality is also reduced,"" he says. It's a fear echoed by conservation organisation The World Wildlife Fund, which says climate change could also lead to outbreaks of pests and diseases. ""The increasingly strict non-tariff barriers to exporting apples, including checking the health of export fruits could represent a significant risk to the industry,"" it warned in a recent report. Farmers have started to trial newer varieties of apples Yet, despite the economic and climatic challenges, the South African industry has been performing well over the past few years. Between 2006 and 2014, production rocketed by a healthy 41% thanks largely to technology developments which helped improve the number of apples produced by a each tree. Farmers have also started to trial newer varieties of apples which are more suited to changing, and warmer, conditions - an experiment which has helped boost the number of apples produced per tree. The report concludes that while climate change will add an element of uncertainty, projected increases in local and global demand will mean, ""future apple production in South Africa is expected to grow gradually and keep its position as an important export product"". Mr Cloete says he is also optimistic about the future. ""You have to farm smarter, and you have to adapt for itâ¦ we can definitely overcome the obstacles that we're facing now.""

"The Big Merino is one of many ""big"" monuments in Australia In the low-budget 1987 Australian horror film Dark Age, a ranger, played by Wolf Creek star John Jarratt, tracks a rogue saltwater crocodile. Four decades on and the film, or more particularly one of its props, continues to scare and enthral. At a whopping 9m (30ft) long, Ron the giant fibreglass croc sits proudly at Hartley's Crocodile Adventures at Wangetti Beach in Far North Queensland, which bought the mould for the large reptile from the makers of the movie. Ron is part of the quirky Australian tradition of building big models and monuments, from the Big Banana to the Big Merino and Big Prawn. Ron has a few metres on the largest real crocodile ever caught in Australia - a 5.48m giant dubbed Cassius. But Angela Freeman, co-owner of Hartley's, says tourists ""absolutely love it"". ""The little darling has recently been repainted and refurbished, and has brand new glass eyes bought for him,"" she says. ""He's a great attraction."" Ron, a former film prop, is popular among tourists in Far North Queensland There are dozens of large statues in every Australian state and territory that celebrate a beguiling array of mushrooms, guitars, ants, mosquitoes, worms and the outlaw Ned Kelly, and much more. A Christian organisation recently announced plans to build a huge illuminated cross on top of a hill in a remote corner of central Australia. It would be about 22m high and be illuminated on land near the Aboriginal community of Ikuntji, 230km (143 miles) west of Alice Springs. Other monuments salute local produce or industries, such as the 6m Big Miner in Ballarat, while others are marketing gimmicks for shops and motels. ""They pop up all over the place. You're driving along and suddenly you see this 6m-high lobster,"" says Patti McCarthy, who runs Cultural Chemistry, a company providing cross-cultural training for expatriates either moving to or leaving Australia. ""The tourists love them and they all flock to see them, and have their photographs taken with them."" She says the monuments reflect Australia's often mischievous - or larrikin - spirit. ""Anyone would think it was a bit cheap and nasty and in bad taste, but we like it,"" she says. ""Australians have got a great sense of humour and a very laid-back self-deprecating style."" The Big Banana, a New South Wales attraction, is also an amusement park The Big Prawn, built in 1989, was spared from demolition in 2009 after a protest But not everyone is so warmly appreciative. Kent Watson, from Monument Australia, which studies the historical value of the nation's public memorials and statues, believes the likes of the Big Kangaroo, Big Lamb and Big Potato can be a nuisance. ""I find many of them to be unattractive and often a blight on the landscape,"" he says. ""Some communities erect some 'big' structures to emphasise something about their place, such as its agricultural or pastoral produce. I am sure communities had good reasons to build them, and that they serve some purpose, but just as a personal opinion I think they are as intrusive as roadside advertising signs."" Provocative 'tourism ad' stirs mixed feelings Tourist's photo resembles 'map of Australia' Activewear: An Australian obsession Oversized tributes to fruit, wine bottles and dinosaurs are, however, not unique to Australia. Mr Watson points to the Golden Buddha in Ang Thong, Thailand, the Lord Shiva monument in Karnataka, India and Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, while his favourite is the towering The Motherland Calls in Volgograd, Russia. The Big Racquet in Barellan in New South Wales might seem rather prosaic in comparison, but it celebrates one of Australia's greatest Aboriginal sporting success stories. The 14m statue, unveiled in 2009, is arguably the world's largest tennis racquet and is a replica of one used by Evonne Goolagong Cawley, a former Wimbledon champion, who was born in the agricultural town 520km from Sydney. The Motherland Calls is a popular big monument in Volgograd, Russia So where, when and why did a country's obsession with extravagant monuments begin? We can't be sure, but we're led to believe the tradition may well have been born after two bottles of whisky were consumed by a Scottish migrant and his family in South Australia in the early 1960s. The result was the 5m-high Big Scotsman, also known as Scotty, in the Adelaide suburb of Medindie. He is, appropriately enough, found outside Scotty's Motel. It is owned by Yanka Shopov, a former Bulgarian refugee who came to Australia more than 60 years ago. ""People love it,"" she says of her lofty piper. ""Years ago I remember little kids used to cry if we were booked out and they wanted to sleep under the Scotsman. But the thing is he is very expensive. He is exposed to the weather day and night (and) it costs between A$7,000 (Â£4,300; $5,400) to A$9,000 to have him painted. It's not cheap but he draws attention to the business here."" Wombats, winches and windmills are also honoured in splendid fashion, along with dead fish, cigars and strawberries.

"Jim Entwistle with his new mug An English football fan who tweeted that his 21-year-old Bayern Munich mug was ""faded and cracked"" has been sent a new one - by the club itself. Jim Entwistle, 33, from North Yorkshire, wrote that he was ""retiring the mug after thousands of brews"". The German club noticed the message and asked for his postal address. The free, replacement mug arrived on Tuesday - with a letter from the club saying: ""We are really proud to have fans as loyal as yourself."" Jim, from Tunstall near Richmond, was given his first Bayern Munich mug as a birthday present in 1996. His uncle - who lives in Germany - sent him the gift after Bayern beat Jim's team, Nottingham Forest, in the Uefa Cup. Jim's old Bayern Munich mug, bought in 1996 Bayern Munich's response to Jim's tweet Jim said: ""I think he (the uncle) thought he was being funny, but over the years the mug and I became quite attached. ""It followed me around the country, through uni and work. Others have come and gone but it's always been there. ""I must have had thousands of brews out of it, but it's starting to show its age so I thought I'd retire it. ""I just threw out a tweet before work one morning (on 8 June). By lunchtime, my phone was going berserk. ""I'd been followed by Bayern and all their fans were tweeting me. One wanted my old mug. What a world we live in. ""So they offered to send me a new one, which was a lovely gesture. I'm giving it to my baby son - I'm hoping he won't be a Forest fan. ""I work in social media (for theGreat North Air Ambulance,external) so it's easy to be cynical about these things. But sometimes it's just nice to be nice, isn't it?""

"Over the last five years, Imagine Dragons have become one of the biggest bands on the planet. Their emotionally-charged, radio-friendly rock anthems likeRadioactive,externalandSucker For Pain,externalhave won Grammy Awards, number one albums and a scarily loyal fanbase. But behind closed doors, the band's frontman Dan Reynolds was struggling with severe depression. Things came to a head on their last world tour. Playing 110 dates in 42 countries on five continents left the singer ""numb"". ""It came to a point where I didn't have an option,"" he tells the BBC. ""It was lose my family and lose my life or seek help."" After the band's final concert of the tour in Amsterdam last February, the star told his bandmates he was taking a year off to tackle the condition, which has plagued him since childhood. ""When I was younger, in school, I would just let it pass, and ride out the valleys and the peaks and the ups and downs,"" he says. ""Then I tried medication and it was too scary for me, because I felt like it was going to change the music."" So last year, he ""went to a therapist and sat down and basically faced it head on for the first time"". Imagine Dragons (left to right): Wayne Sermon, Daniel Platzman, Dan Reynolds and Ben McKee Having decided not to take antidepressants, his treatment took ""a more holistic route"" than before - changing his diet, cutting out sugar and practicing yoga and meditation. The latter, in particular, ""has been huge"" for the singer, who says he has trouble ""quieting"" his brain. Reynolds was supported through the last year by his wife, fellow musician Aja Volkman, and bandmate Wayne Sermon, whom he's known since childhood. ""We're brothers, so if he's not in a good place, then none of us are,"" says Sermon. The guitarist admits everyone in the band has ""demons that came out"" after their ascent to fame - including his own issues with trust and ""questioning people's motives"". ""When you're under a microscope, it's going to magnify all the problems you had before,"" he says, ""But I don't want to be to be down about it, because I feel like we've come out better people. All of us."" Those changes are the foundation of Imagine Dragons' new album Evolve. The artwork shows a human form ascending from a place of eternal darkness to one of light and colour, while the music is inventive and vibrant - especially when compared to the claustrophobic onslaught of their last record. ""Smoke + Mirrors was super-angsty"" admits Reynolds. ""This album is a celebration of opening the blinds and the light shining through."" On the lead single,Believer,external, he writes about his personal transformation while acknowledging: ""My life, my love, my drive, it came from pain."" ""I was raised in a really conservative household and carried a heavy guilty conscience with me because of religion,"" he explains. ""Letting go of that was really freeing and wonderful. But I've also learned to be happy for the things I learned from it and grateful for the love that I found. ""If it wasn't for all of those things working in the exact way they did, Imagine Dragons would cease to exist."" Imagine Dragons have become a muscular live act, their percussion-heavy hits particularly suited for giant arena gigs The seventh of nine children, Reynolds was raised in a strict Mormon household. Aged 19, he volunteered to become a missionary in Nebraska for two years, proselytizing for the church and helping drug addicts. On his return, he enrolled to study music at the Mormon-run Brigham Young University in Utah, but dropped out to form Imagine Dragons with Sermon and two of his classmates from the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston. In the beginning, they took any gig they could get, even opening for a mime at a nearby shopping centre. One regular booking at a local casino saw them playing six-hour sets three times a week, mixing original material with crowd-pleasing covers. Their big break came in 2010 when roots rock band Train pulled out of a local festival. With just half an hour's notice, Imagine Dragons were promoted to the main stage and played for 26,000 people. Within a year, they had signed to Interscope Records and started work on their debut album, Night Visions. Like fellow Las Vegas rock band The Killers (who are managed by Reynolds' older brother, Robert), the group straddle the divide between rock and pop, embellishing their fist-pumping choruses with the sleek textures and throbbing rhythms of dance music. It's no surprise, then, that they're one of the few rock acts to score commercial success at a time when pop and hip-hop dominate the charts. ""One of the reasons we called our band Imagine Dragons is so we had no boundaries,"" says Reynolds. ""We created music that was all over the map because we didn't want people to expect power chords on my guitar or a simple pop song every time. ""We wanted the leash to be gone and for us to be able to run wild in the field."" The band's new album is more reflective than before The band's eager eclecticism has irritated purists (""pop deserves better, rock deserves better,"" sniffed one review) but it makes perfect sense in the streaming era, when fans flit between genres on a whim. On Evolve, their sound has also become leaner - free from the sonic, as well as the emotional, baggage of their last record. A song called Yesterday is particularly eye-opening, with Reynolds singing like a bluesman wandering through the dustbowl, over a gregarious piano stomp. ""We really reached into our roots of being inspired by the more eccentric songs from the Beatles and Queen,"" says Reynolds. The band were propelled out of their comfort zone by recruiting an array of top-shelf producers, including Lorde's right-hand man Joel Little, and Swedish duo Mattman & Robin, who have worked for Britney Spears and Taylor Swift. They even got some help from Justin Tranter, one of pop's most in-demand writers, whose credits include Justin Bieber'sSorry,externaland DNCE'sCake by the Ocean,external. ""He understood my trepidation at working with another writer,"" says Reynolds. ""I've never done it before - but he knew that I had to write all my own lyrics and he was a wonderful sounding board, melodically."" The band are on tour for the rest of the year The singer is excited for fans to hear the record (""it feels like Christmas is coming""), especially after the group's year-long hiatus. ""A lot of our fans really invest their life into this band,"" he says. ""They come to every show, they get tattoos, their whole wall is lined in Imagine Dragons things. ""And I get it, because Iwasthat kid, you know? That's what Nirvana was to me when I was a little kid. Kurt was everything to me. ""So I feel a responsibility to all of the people who invest their time into Imagine Dragons... an obligation to be honest and tell them what my heart says."" That's why he decided to write about his depression and to address it in interviews. ""I was really shy about speaking out,"" he says. ""Humanity doesn't like to acknowledge their frailty. We like to only acknowledge our strengths. But I think it's important to talk about it."" ""It's like the song Believer,"" adds Sermon. ""Of course, every human wants to avoid pain at all cost - but the truth is, that's one time we really grow."" Imagine Dragons' third album, Evolve, is released on Friday 23 June.

"People are trying to cool off in any way they can The UK is basking in its hottest June day in 41 years, with a temperature of 34.5C (94F) recorded at Heathrow. The Met Office reading at the London airport is the highest in June since the mercury hit 35.6 (96F) in 1976 - the all-time high since records began. The heatwave has seen five sizzling days in a row during which temperatures in parts of the UK have topped 30C. But weather warnings have also been issued for rain, with thunderstorms expected in some areas. BBC weather presenter Chris Fawkes said: ""To have these really prolonged spells, you need a block of high pressure that directs other weather fronts away. Then we get the hot weather coming up from Europe."" Storms are forecast for some areas later in the day, and yellow weather warnings for rain in parts of England, Wales and Scotland are in place until the early hours of Thursday. Our presenter added: ""It is all going to go bang tonight. ""The hot air from the surface will meet with colder air coming in from the Atlantic and we will have some big thunderstorms, gusty winds, heavy rain and, in some places, even hail. In pictures: How Britain is keeping cool Glastonbury crowds suffer on hottest day A man sunbathing in Kensington Gardens in the summer of 1976 The record-breaking summer of 1976 saw nine weeks of blazing sunshine. Between June and August, blue skies were a daily occurrence and, for two weeks, temperatures were 32C or above consistently. Five days saw temperatures exceed 35C. The hottest day of all was 3 July, with temperatures hitting 35.9C in Cheltenham. A downside was the worst drought in recorded history for the UK, building up from a warm summer in 1975 and incredibly dry months after. Rainfall in the winter of 1975 was half of what it normally would be, and by the summer of 1976 crops were affected and there were forest fires in the south of England. But once the summer had come to a close, autumn saw intense rainfall and natural balance was restored. The crowd heading to Royal Ascot were hoping for a similar relaxation of dress code to the one race-goers experienced on Tuesday. Normally men attending the horse racing event in the Royal Enclosure must wear black or grey morning dress with a waistcoat, tie and a top hat. But the jacket rulewas not enforced for the first time in its history, as organisers took a ""common sense approach"". Some racegoers were keeping it glitzy at Ascot; others cool and shady. Whilst some are taking to the parks or the beach to lap up the sunshine, people on the daily commute have been faced with travel disruption. Greater Anglia Trains hascancelled a number of its services,externalbetween London and Essex, saying the heat has led to speed restrictions on the lines to stop them from buckling. For those in more congested areas, the Department for Environment and Rural Affairs has also warned there may be pockets of high pollution during the exceptionally hot weather, especially in the East Midlands. It was hot and dusty work for the revellers arriving at Glastonbury Emergency services have warned people to keep safe in open water after three people died in separate incidents around the country. A 15-year-old boy diedafter getting into difficulty when swimming in a lake with friendsin Walsall, West Midlands. This follows the deaths of a teenager who drowned in a reservoir near Rochdale and an elderly woman who rescue teams tried to save off the coast of Sussex. A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ""Although it is very hot at the moment, the dangers of going into open water cannot be underestimated."" This video can not be played BBC colleagues from hot countries give their tips for staying cool Shut windows and pull down the shades when it is hotter outside. You can open the windows for ventilation when it is cooler. Stay out of the sun and don't go out between 11:00 and 15:00 (the hottest part of the day) if you're vulnerable to the effects of heat. Have cool baths or showers, and splash yourself with cool water. Drink cold drinks regularly, such as water and diluted fruit juice. Avoid excess alcohol, caffeine (tea, coffee and cola) or drinks high in sugar. Wear loose, cool clothing, and a hat and sunglasses if you go outdoors. Check up on friends, relatives and neighbours who may be less able to look after themselves. SOURCE: NHS How have you been experiencing the recent hot weather in the UK?

"Theresa May leaves No 10 for the state opening of Parliament It was meant to be Theresa May's political coronation, but the Queen's Speech has confirmed the reality of her fall from grace. The prime minister's ambitions for significant change at home have been culled, disappearing with her majority. But the complexity of all the work the government has ahead administratively, as the UK prepares to leave the EU, is plain to see. Eight bills on Brexit - whether on customs, agriculture, fisheries, or immigration - and each requires no less than a redesign of systems that have been in place for decades. BBC Politics Live: Rolling text and video updates PM pledges 'humility' before Queen's Speech Each will require careful political handling, at a time when the government cannot be sure of its majority and a Labour Party with wind in its sails is determined to be a guerrilla opposition, putting down amendments wherever it can, stirring political trouble because it believes power could be in reach. It is not, though, the headache-inducing complexity of those administrative tasks that is even Theresa May's priority. First, she has to show that she can actually govern after such a loss of political authority. For her party, that means she has to show that she can change. There is, on the record, a promise to govern with ""humility"", to be a ""government that consults and listens"". Whether that change is made real or is just rhetoric for today will determine how long Theresa May can stay.

"What makes a good school? It's a question every parent faces as they get given the glossy version on a tour of a potential secondary school. Are you worried most about exam results, or how they help your teenager prepare for real life? That debate has taken a whole new turn in the past year, with plans for what Prime Minister Theresa May described as ""new grammars of the future"". Now, her authority diminished and damaged, that promise has little political substance. Grammar schools get good results, from pupils already doing well academically, but does that make them a good school? The academics at the National Centre for Social Research -  NatCen - turned to the public to probe views further, using a representative panel of people. It's a more subtle tool than the kind of polling you might usually read about. Grammar schools are a small part of the system in England, but the idea of them remains popular with a minority. NatCen found 39% of people thought children should go to a different kind of secondary school according to how well they did at primary school. It's worth bearing in mind that grammar schools rely not on end-of-primary tests, or Sats as they are called, but entrance exams for which many children are tutored. But none the less it shows the enduring emotional appeal of the grammar brand for some. This appears to be based on a belief from 54% of NatCen's panel that grammar schools help level the playing field some of the time. Of course a school can only make a difference if your child gets a place. Overall in England, grammar schools take more than half of their pupils from the wealthier half of society, according to a recent government analysis, and very few from families getting by on very low incomes. There's a generation gap too, with older people more likely to think grammar schools have an impact on how children do academically. Slightly more than half overall said they would support the idea of expanding grammar schools. But Emily Tanner from NatCen points out that in many respects this still doesn't answer the question of whether people think grammar schools are good schools. So what did they find people associate with a good school? ""One that helps prepare pupils for getting a fulfilling job, that helps develop confidence and assurance, and they put some emphasis on the social side of pupils being well behaved and presented."" Almost 80% said pupils mixing with others from different backgrounds was important. It's not that parents don't care about exam results, they clearly do, and this research confirms that. But they also care about their children being supported into becoming well-rounded adults. One reason perhaps why there was overwhelming support for grammar schools to have quotas for giving places to children from poorer families who pass the academic test. It could be the sting in the tail of the recent grammar debate. There has been a renewed focus on who gets into grammar schools, with many looking at revising their admission policies. Mrs May's vision for a whole new generation of selective schools may disappear into the dustbin of political history. But with the unexpected consequence of making some of the existing grammar schools move more quickly to make sure they are more socially inclusive.

"This year's Queen's Speech comes in the wake of a general election that left the Conservatives without a majority.Legislation to deliver Brexit dominated the government's plans.

"Sixty-eight social housing flats in Kensington, London, are to be made available to survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire, the government has said. The one, two and three-bedroom flats are located in two blocks that stand alongside a large luxury development, where private homes go for up to Â£8.5m. At least 79 people died and many more were left homeless after fire engulfed the North Kensington tower a week ago. PM Theresa May has apologised for ""State"" failures after the blaze. ""People were left without belongings, without roofs over their heads, without even basic information about what had happened, what they should do and where they could seek help,"" she told MPs in the Commons. ""That was a failure of the State - local and national - to help people when they needed it most. ""As prime minister, I apologise for that failure."" This video can not be played Theresa May on Grenfell fire: ""As prime minister I've taken responsibility"" Mrs May is expected to make a statement about the fire in the Commons on Thursday. There has been widespread anger from Grenfell Tower residents at the slow and chaotic response from authorities after last Wednesday's devastating blaze. On Wednesday, protesters demanding ""justice for Grenfell"" marched with anti-government protesters through London. But Justice4Grenfell, a group which supports Grenfell residents, stressed it had not organised any of the events and urged protesters to have the victims and bereaved ""foremost in their minds"". A spokesman for the ClementJames Centre, another support group, accused protesters of hijacking residents' grief for political purposes. Meanwhile, the funeral of 23-year-old Syrian refugee Mohammed Alhajali, who was among the first victims of the fire to be named, has taken place. His family, who arrived from war-torn Syria, and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan attended the ceremony, called a Janazat, at an east London mosque. His family said: ""His very last words to us were how much he missed us. ""Ever since he moved away from us, we tried to be united with him and his brothers, and now, instead, we have been united by his body."" Mr Alhajali became separated from his brother as they tried to escape A number of inquests were opened and adjourned on Wednesday, with the coroner finding: Retired lorry driver Anthony Disson, 65, died from inhalation of fire fumes Farah Hamdan, a 31-year-old nursery nurse, died from smoke inhalation Her husband, Omar Belkadi, 32, who worked as a courier, died from inhalation from fire fumes Abufars Ibrahim, a 39-year-old shopkeeper, had been visiting his mother in the tower. The coroner said he had been found at the foot of the building and died from multiple injuries Khadija Khalloufi, a 52-year-old married woman, also died from inhalation of fire fumes Grenfell residents heading to Kensington Row Work on the private homes is already complete By Jennifer Scott, BBC News Nestled off Kensington High Street, and a short distance from Westfield shopping centre, Kensington Row is the perfect example of London's booming real estate market. It's Â£700 a week to rent a one-bedroom flat - for that price you get to live in the same borough as Prince William and Simon Cowell. Builders are beavering away to finish the new blocks for the incoming residents, whilst placards that surround the site promise you can ""find yourself in the clouds"" after you move in. You get a true feel for the development from the flats already completed. On the hottest day of the year so far, the sun reflects off balconies and glass panels onto the tree-lined street and busy main road. The flats all have the luxury finish you would expect of this area - but of course the social housing blocks won't have the same trimmings. George, a Kensington resident for 30 years, said his new neighbours would be welcome. ""In times of disaster, the communities in both the north and south of this borough come together,"" he said. ""The survivors and their families will be looked after."" Since the fire, some Grenfell Tower families have been staying in hotels and B&Bs, and there were concerns that more permanent housing would be offered in other parts of the country. But Kensington Row complex is just over 1.5 miles from Grenfell Tower. It includes a 24-hour concierge service and a private cinema, the website of developer St Edward says, but it is thought unlikely the new tenants from Grenfell will have access to such facilities. Each new home in the two blocks set aside for social housing will be fully furnished and completed to a high-specification, the government said. St Edward has taken on extra builders to speed up completion of the work to the social housing blocks The flats are expected to be ready by the end of July. Yvette Williams, from Justice4Grenfell, said the promise of new flats was a good thing if it gave residents a permanent home but it had come ""very late"". A small number of Grenfell residents were still sleeping in rest centres set up in the aftermath of the fire, one week on, she said. The Department for Communities and Local Government said extra public money had been found so the flats could be fitted out more quickly, and more builders had been taken on. It said the ""expectation was that these new properties would be offered as one of the options to permanently rehouse residents from Grenfell Tower"". Some Grenfell residents will be housed in the brick-clad building on the right, seen in this artist's impression The homes will be bought and managed by the City of London Corporation, and handed over to Kensington and Chelsea Council. Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said Grenfell residents had been through ""some of the most harrowing and traumatic experiences imaginable"". ""Our priority is to get everyone who has lost their home permanently rehoused locally as soon as possible, so that they can begin to rebuild their lives,"" he added.

"The Queen sets out government's plans Because of short notice, less pomp than usual Duke of Edinburgh unwell so does not attend Prince Charles steps in for the occasion Brexit dominates with 8 of 27 bills This year's event follows snap election Jackie Storer and Alex Hunt Theresa May urges the UK to ""seize this moment"" but Labour's Jeremy Corbyn says she has ""no mandate"" and has lost her authority. This video can not be played Queen's Speech in 90 seconds The roads around Parliament are still closed off, but the (slightly reduced) pomp and ceremony of the Queen's Speech has mostly left Westminster. MPs are back doing what they're used to - arguing with each other in the House of Commons. Here's a recap of the day so far:  Here's abill-by-bill guide- and here'sLaura Kuenssberg's verdict. The BBC political editor says the speech ""confirmed the reality of Theresa May's fall from grace"".  Thanks for joining us today - there are a few days of debate on the Queen's Speech ahead in the Commons before the crunch vote next Thursday - you can follow it as it happens thanks to our colleagues fromBBC Parliament. House of LordsParliament Leader of the House Baroness Evans of Bowes Park, who held the Cap of Maintenance aloft earlier today during the Queen's Speech, now responds to the brief debate from the government benches. She begins by saying that she looks forward to the House of Lords playing its important constitutional role in the issues that the country faces. The legislative process outlined in the Queen's Speech ""recognises and grasps"" the opportunities that lie ahead for the UK outside the EU, she says. Baroness Evans tells peers that although the election result was not the one the Conservatives had hoped for - they would show ""humility and resolve"" in the face of the message sent by the British people. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Mr Blackford goes on to call for renewed talks with Scotland over Brexit and for the single market to be ""back on the table"". He also says the SNP will make the case for a ""credible alternative to austerity"". House of LordsParliament The Liberal Democrat leader in the House of Lords Lord Newby, responds to the speech on behalf of his over 100 Lib Dem colleagues in the chamber with the red seats. After joining Baroness Smith in praising the proposer and seconder of the proceedings today and praising the emergency services, he launches into an attack on the government. He says the Conservative manifesto treated the electorate like children over money - ""not to worry our pretty little heads about it"" - and called the election a cynical attempt to exploit a brief window of opportunity to shore up the Conservative's own position. The result has left a ""weakened prime minister and squabbling ministers"" which has made the UK an object of pity across Europe, he says. This video can not be played First Minister of Wales Carwyn Jones says Brexit legislation in the Queen's Speech could impinge on devolution. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Mr Blackford says contrary to what the government promised, many are now feeling ""uncertainty and instability"". ""A strong and stable approach might have involved the prime minister seeking consensus on Brexit,"" he argues. He says they have ""no plan, no mandate and no credible government"". ""Scotland voted clearly and decisively to remain... I had hoped a compromise might be found that would work for all nations of the UK"", he continues, but instead the government is pursuing a ""power grab"". House of LordsParliament Baroness Smith raises the election and one of the primary reasons that Theresa May gave for it - that of unelected peers frustrating the Brexit process. She says that there was nothing extraordinary about the amendments peers voted for on the Brexit process, saying ""It is what we do"". She also promises a ""strong, challenging
and robust"" opposition but says peers will always recognise the primacy of the
Commons. But she reminds peers that the House of Commons has
primacy - not the executive or government. ""They are not the same,"" she says. House of LordsParliament Labour's leader in the House of Lords, Baroness Smith of Basildon, rises to respond to the debate in the House of Lords. She says that the proposer and seconder of the motion for the Queen's speech should be a ""wise experienced sage and a young up and coming peer"" - which prompts an eye-roll from Lord Forsyth. ""It's remarkable how quickly you can move from one to the other,"" she says. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament The SNP's new Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, pays tribute to his predecessor Angus Robertson and former first minister Alex Salmond. He promises Nicola Sturgeon will continue to be ""a thorn in the government's side"". He joins tributes to the victims of recent terrorist attacks and the fatal fire in Kensington. House of CommonsParliament Towards the end of her speech in the Commons Theresa May said the government would respect the will of the British people and ""see Brexit through"". She said she wanted to see a Brexit deal ""that will work for every part of the country"". ""If we're going to grasp the opportunities as we leave the EU we need to build a stronger economy,"" she said. Tough decisions taken after the financial crash ""have paid off"" with the deficit down by three quarters, employment up by 2.9m and four million of the lowest paid out of income tax, she says. ""Inequality has been reduced to its lowest level for 30 years,"" she added. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Theresa May concludes by saying ""this has been a difficult time for our country - many parents are worried"" about the world their children are growing up in. But, she adds, ""we are a resilient country"" and will show ""compassion, unity and resolve"". There's some disquiet as she notes ""not every problem can be solved by an act of Parliament - but it is a step forward"". House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Baroness Bertin, who was David Cameron's press secretary, seconds the Queen's speech. She recalls a moment when she was a new peer when the doorkeepers tried to usher her from the chamber by mistake - remarking that they should remember that peers, like policemen, are getting younger. The peer says she has written her speech today on paper rather than on goatskin parchment, as she thought she should, because she is meant to be a moderniser. She speaks with passion about those in the emergency services who have risked and lost their lives during recent attacks and tragedies. This shows that ""this country has courage and decency at its core"", she says. House of CommonsParliament Theresa May says the government wants to put in place a new Mental Health Act and ensure every primary and secondary school has a member of staff who is trained and knows how to deal with mental health issues. ""The earlier we can address these issues, then the better we can deal with them and the better life we can ensure these people with mental health have,"" she says. Queen's Speech debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Kevin Brennan refers to Mrs May as ""the interim PM"", asking how she is going to negotiate Brexit with 27 countries if she cannot reach a deal with 10 DUP MPs. The prime minister thanks David Davis for his work so far in Brussels on Brexit talks. House of LordsParliament Lord Forsyth of Drumlean spends a few moments poking fun at his political rivals - most notably the SNP who do not take seats in the House of Lords and seek its abolition. He says that whilst the election campaign was not the Tory Party's finest hour, it had some unexpected highlights. ""Alex Salmond,"" he says simply, which causes laughter in the chamber. ""I knew I could unite this House,"" he says. On Labour, Lord Forsyth remarks that the the new ""rapturous enthusiasm"" on the opposite benches for Jeremy Corbyn ""is matched only by their relief that he isn't running the country"". ""Oh yes Labour now have momentum but sadly for them, Momentum now have Labour."" (Lord Forsyth is referring to thegrassroots organisation,externalwhich supports Jeremy Corbyn's leadership.)

House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Forsyth of Drumlean proposes the Queen's Speech in the House of Lords, calling it a ""singular and unexpected honour"" and telling the chamber that he suspects his selection is part of a campaign by the chief whip to woo the youth vote. He says that the Queen has never missed a day at Royal Ascot since her coronation - and says that he wishes her to be rewarded for her public service by her horse winning this afternoon. Lord Forsyth speaks of Theresa May in the wake of the election, saying that she does not deserve the attacks she has received. ""It is not in our country's interest to trash our prime minister in a time of uncertainty,"" he says. House of CommonsParliament The prime minister has paid tribute to Brendan Cox, the husband of murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, ""for the extraordinary courage and strength he has in dealing with such personal tragedy and for honouring her memory in such an inspring way"". She says that the best way to honour Mrs Cox is to ""show that in our United Kingdom, hope will always triumph over hate"". BBC South political editor tweets... Allow Twitter content?

"The US RC-135 reconnaissance plane is roughly the size of a civilian commercial aircraft A Russian jet flew within 5ft (1.5m) of a US reconnaissance plane's wing tip over the Baltic Sea on Monday, US officials say. The encounter was deemed ""unsafe"" due to the Russian pilot's ""high rate of closure speed and poor control of the aircraft,"" officials said. But Russia disputes this, saying the US plane made a ""provocative"" move. Meanwhile, a Nato jet flew close to a Russian plane carrying the defence minister, Russian media reports say. The F-16 fighter jet was chased away by a Russian Su-27 military jet over the Baltic, according to the state-owned Tass news agency, which had a reporter on the plane. It said minister Sergei Shoigu was en route to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad, over international waters, but it did not give further details. The incidents come amid renewed tensions between Washington and Moscow, sparked by the US downing of a Syrian jet after it targeted American-allied rebels. In response, Russia, an ally of the Syrian government, warned on Monday that US jets flying in Syria would be treated as targets. On Tuesday, the US military shot down an armed Iranian-made drone in Syria. Syria conflict: US jet 'downs Iranian-made drone' Why are air combat kills so rare? The first incident over the Baltic, on Monday, occurred 25 miles (40 km) from Kaliningrad, also over international waters. Pentagon spokesman Captain Jeff Davis told reporters: ""We were flying in international airspace and did nothing to provoke this behaviour."" What happened on Monday is only the latest incident in a continuing pattern of near-misses where Russian and Nato aircraft have come into close proximity. The two sides' narratives are very different but independent studies have tended to support Nato's case that more aggressive Russian behaviour is in large part to blame - this a response to Nato's stepped up military deployments in central Europe in the wake of Russia's seizure and annexation of Crimea. These tensions risk accident and injury but are very different to the situation in Syrian airspace where the US, its coalition allies and Russian and Syrian warplanes are all engaged in combat sorties. Unlike in Europe, there is a direct link between Russian and US commanders to avoid dangerous incidents - and although Russia is saying that this has been suspended in the wake of theUS shooting down of a Syrian jet- the US side insists that the channel remains open. The US RC-135 reconnaissance aircraft had been flying with its transponder on, making it visible to other aircraft, he added. But Russia's defence ministry said it was the US plane that had behaved dangerously after it was already intercepted and was being escorted by a Russian Su-27 fighter jet. ""During the escorting, the RC-135 crew made an attempt of closing with the Russian fighter, performing a provocative turnaround toward the Su-27,"" the Tass news agency quoted the Russian ministry as saying. About 10 minutes later, another US surveillance plane arrived, and it too was intercepted by a Su-27 jet, the ministry said. Earlier this month, the US Air Force deployed 800 troops and long range B-52 bombers to the United Kingdom to take part in joint Nato exercises. There have been more than 30 interactions between US and Russian planes and ships in the Baltic Sea since the beginning of June, US officials tell CNN. The majority have been deemed safe, US officials say.

"Prince Mohammed bin Salman (left) replaces prince Mohammed bin Nayef (right) as crown prince Saudi Arabia's king has appointed his son Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince - replacing his nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef, as first in line to the throne. King Salman's decree also means Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 31, will become deputy prime minister while continuing as defence minister. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, has been removed from his role as head of domestic security, state media say. He has pledged allegiance to the new crown prince, his younger cousin. Saudi Arabia has typically been ruled by kings in their 70s or 80s. Prince Mohammed bin Salman's rapid ascent is seen by the younger generation as a sign that things are changing. Before his latest promotion, he was responsible for leading Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, overseeing the kingdom's energy policy and economic reform. He must have already ruffled a lot of feathers in a royal family that was used to being presided over by a succession of elderly men, the BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen reports. Mohammed bin Salman's rise marks climax of leadership revolution Saudis welcome 'prince of youth' His father King Salman is 81 and reportedly not in the best of health, our correspondent adds. Prince Mohammed bin Salman could, potentially, lead Saudi Arabia for decades, heralding a long period of internal stability. However, the new crown prince is close to US President Donald Trump, and could ratchet up pressure against Iran - which would raise tensions in the region. The rise of Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been meteoric. When I met him in Jeddah in 2013 he described himself as simply ""a lawyer"". Today he is a heartbeat away from ruling the most powerful country in the Arab world. Despite being the driving force behind Saudi Arabia's damaging and inconclusive military campaign in Yemen, he is largely popular at home, especially with younger Saudis. He has swept away many of the ineffective timeservers in government offices and replaced them with young, Western-educated technocrats. He has set out a possibly over-ambitious development plan, ""Vision 2030"", and announced plans to sell off part of the vast state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. He has also forged ties with Washington and the Trump administration. But his biggest and most risky move may yet prove to be his bid to curb the power of the conservative religious establishment. Washington likes this move, but others closer to home do not. Who is Mohammed bin Salman? The founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud), had dozens of sons, and there are as many as 15,000 princes and princesses in the royal family. In 2006, a decree was passed setting up a committee responsible for electing the king and crown prince. The committee is made up of senior princes of the Al Saud royal family and is known as the Allegiance Council. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Nayef (R) pledged allegiance to Mohammed bin Salman (L), who knelt and kissed his older cousin's hand Mohammed bin Salman'snew promotion,externalto crown prince was approved by 31 out of 34 members of the council. Analysts say those in power tend to appoint their sons to roles that will enhance their chances of being promoted - so when monarchs and crown princes change, sons can come into and out of favour. King Salman, a son of King Abdulaziz, acceded to the throne in January 2015 after the death of his half-brother Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz. He launched his first major cabinet reshuffle a few months later, promoting Mohammed bin Nayef to crown prince and Mohammed bin Salman, who was relatively unknown at that time, to deputy crown prince. Experts say the second reshuffle has reduced uncertainty over the line of succession, and means the king has averted a potential power struggle between his son and his nephew. The decree promoting Mohammed bin Salman includesa clause,externalpreventing him from appointing one of his own sons as his heir. It is the most influential Arab country - and a key ally of Western powers including the US and the UK. The kingdom is also the world's second largest oil producer - and the Saudi royal family is thought to be one of the richest ruling families in the world. It is guardian of the two most holy sites in Islam, and regards itself as leader of the Sunni community worldwide. The kingdom is a key player in Sunni attempts to block Shia Iranian influence in the Middle East. It has launched air strikes on Yemen to fight Houthi rebels, who Saudi Arabia believes are backed by Iran. However, the campaign has been criticised for human rights violations - including the killing many civilians. Recently, Saudi Arabia also joined efforts to impose a blockade on Qatar. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was the kingdom's security chief for many years and was known for his strong stance against jihadist militants. As deputy prime minister and interior minister, he headed up the counter-terrorism portfolio, and also had good relations with Saudi Arabia's Western allies. State media broadcast footage showing Mohammed bin Nayef meeting Mohammed bin Salman after the succession was announced. The former crown prince said ""I am content"" and ""I am going to rest now. May God help you"", while the new heir replied ""May God help you. I will never do without your advice"". King Salman has told Saudis to pledge allegiance to his son Reaction to the appointment of the new crown prince was largely (and unsurprisingly) celebratory, although Saudi Arabia's regional rivals took the opportunity to criticise the kingdom. Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya TV ran blanket coverage and emphasised the positive effect the appointment had on the country's stock exchange.  Similar reports appeared in other friendly Arab states. But in Iran - Saudi Arabia's bitter rival - several news outlets described the appointment as a ""soft coup"". Similar language was used by the Pro-Qatari HuffPost Arabi, which called the appointment ""a coup in the royal palace"". Syrian state media's largely neutral report came with a considerable sting in the tail. Coverage ended with a reminder to viewers of a ""tyrannical regime"" which ""lacks the most basic democratic principles"" and ""supports terrorism"". Jihadists on social media celebrated the reshuffle, anticipating that the changes would pave the way for internal strife within the House of Saud and eventually bring about its downfall.

"UK holidaymakers who make bogus food poisoning claims could go to prison, warns travel trade organisation Abta. A huge rise in false claims has left travel bosses ""embarrassed"" by a trend which they say is a ""British problem"". Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said the fraud is ""one of the biggest issues that has hit the travel industry for many years"". He added that tourists chasing false or exaggerated claims ""risk ending up in jail either in the UK or abroad"". Tens of thousands of UK tourists have put in for compensation in the past year, even though sickness levels in resorts have remained stable. Young people ""most likely to go abroad without insurance"" UK tourists hit by booking scams up by nearly a fifth Abta website: Holidaymakers hit by cyber-attack Abta,externalsays the cases usually involve holidaymakers who have been abroad on all-inclusive deals, who argue that because they only ate in their hotel, that must have been the source of their alleged food poisoning. It has launched a campaign called Stop Sickness Scams, asking the government to clamp down on the issue. It says laws designed to stop fraudulent claims for whiplash have instead pushed the problem of false insurance submissions on to overseas holidays instead. This is because of a cap on the legal fees that can be charged by law firms pursuing personal injury cases at home. Mr Tanzer added: ""The government must urgently address this issue. The legal loophole that is allowing firms to unduly profit from these claims must be closed. ""This would allow people with genuine claims access to justice but make this area less attractive to claims firms."" Travel firm Tui said it had experienced a 15-fold rise in holiday sickness claims in the past year, costing between Â£3,000 and Â£5,000 a time, which was often more than the value of the holiday itself. Tui's UK managing director Nick Longman and Thomas Cook UK's managing director Chris Mottershead both warned that if the problem continued, it could spell the end of the all-inclusive holiday for UK travellers. Mr Mottershead said: ""It has the potential of putting hoteliers out of business. They will stop British customers coming into their hotels."" Joel Brandon-Bravo, managing director of Travelzoo UK, toldBBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up To Moneythat the upward trend was being driven by claims management companies. ""People are being called when they get back from holiday and encouraged to make claims and we've also seen evidence of them employing touts outside resorts encouraging people to make a claim and walking them through the process to make it easy for them,"" he said. Mr Brandon-Bravo added that he felt people who were trying to cheat the system were not aware of the consequences if they were caught. ""Generally it is not made clear that if a claim is found to be fraudulent the individual could have a criminal record. ""In fact, there is one case going through right now with a Greek hotel, who is counter-suing a couple who made a claim for sickness three years ago for Â£10,000 and the hotel is counter-suing them for Â£170,000. ""They tried to withdraw their claim but they are seriously worried they could lose their house."" Package holiday operator Jet2 has decidedto hire private detectives,externalto tackle the issue. It says it is using the private eyes for ""one purpose and one purpose only - to prevent this dishonest behaviour from ruining the holidays of our customers"". It added: ""The net really is tightening on this dishonest and deceitful practice, and we will not relent until these touts stop trying to take advantage of British holidaymakers."" The Foreign Office has also advised touristsagainst making any fraudulent claims.,external ""If you make a false or fraudulent claim, you may face legal proceedings in the UK or Spain,"" the FCO warns. ""There have been reports of an increase in holidaymakers being encouraged to submit a claim for personal injury if they have experienced gastric illness during their stay,"" says the FCO website. ""You should only consider pursuing a complaint or claim if you have genuinely suffered from injury or illness."" The Alliance of Claims Companies told the BBC it was hoping to establish industry best practice principles that would help drive out rogue companies. It wants to work with the travel industry to ensure genuine claims are dealt with effectively.

"About 13,000 people watched the sunrise at Stonehenge on Wednesday morning, on the longest day of the year. The sun rose at the historic monument in Wiltshire at 04:52 BST. English Heritage opens the site up every year for the solstice, giving people a rare chance to get up close to the monument. Armed police were on patrol, and extra security measures were put in place following the recent terrorist attacks in London and Manchester. Wiltshire Police said the event passed peacefully, but that there were seven ""mostly drug-related"" arrests. ""This was a successful policing operation with only seven arrests, and we are glad that attendees were able to enjoy the celebrations in a friendly and positive manner as they waited for the sunrise,"" said Supt Dave Minty. Those visiting were not allowed access if they had brought pets, sleeping bags and duvets, barbecues or camping equipment. The flying of drones and remote-controlled aircraft was also banned around the monument. The site's general manager, Jennifer Davies, said she was ""delighted"" so many people celebrated the longest day of the year at Stonehenge. ""This year we had extra security arrangements in place and we'd like to thank everyone for their patience and understanding with these,"" she added. More than a million people each year flock to the neolithic site, built more than 4,000 years ago. It is thought ancient Britons built the massive monument as a religious site, to study and celebrate the movements of the sun and moon, or as a place of burial or healing. The summer and winter solstices hold particular significance for Pagans. The summer solstice is celebrated as a ""time of plenty and celebration"", according to the Pagan Federation, while the winter solstice is deemed even more important because it marks the ""re-birth"" of the sun for the new year. This year, armed police were on patrol near to the site, to ""reassure"" visitors in the wake of the recent terror attacks. The Pagan Federation said it ""sadly accepted"" the need for such security measures. David Spofforth from the organisation said it was ""very sad"" that armed police were necessary. ""I am not saying I am welcoming this, I sadly accept it,"" he said. English Heritage said it hoped this year's solstice festival would be the ""greenest solstice yet"", by encouraging people to either car share or travel by public transport. Parking charges of Â£15 have caused controversy after a senior druid lost a court battle against ""pay to pray"" charges which he said breached his human rights. Pictures from the Press Association.

"This video can not be played Not got long? Here's the Queen's Speech in 90 seconds A host of proposed new laws designed to prepare the UK for a ""smooth and orderly"" departure from the EU have been announced in the Queen's Speech. Of 27 bills, eight relate to Brexit and its impact on immigration, trade and sectors such as fisheries and farming. Prime Minister Theresa May urged MPs to ""seize this moment of national change"" to unite and work for a fairer country. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said she had lost authority after axing a raft of manifesto pledges. Proposals to scrap the winter fuel allowance for well-off pensioners, end automatic 2.5% pension rises, expand grammar schools and end free school lunches for all infants have been dropped, while reforms to social care funding will be put out to consultation and a cap on some energy tariffs considered further. Amid continuing talks with the Democratic Unionists about them supporting Theresa May's government, Downing Street said it was confident the Queen's Speech could ""command the confidence"" of the House of Commons when MPs vote on it next week. The DUP said it too was confident a deal would be place by next week's votes. The main non-Brexit proposals of the speech include: A Civil Liability Bill, designed to address the ""compensation culture"" around motoring insurance claims A Domestic Violence and Abuse Bill, establishing a Domestic Violence and Abuse Commissioner to stand up for victims and survivors and monitor the response of the authorities A Tenant's Fees Bill,banning landlords from charging ""letting fees"" A High-Speed Two Bill to authorise the second leg of the rail link from Birmingham to Crewe A Data Protection Bill to strengthen individuals' rightsand introduce a ""right to be forgotten"". An Armed Forces Bill allowing people to serve on a part-time and flexible basis There was no mention of US President Donald Trump's proposed state visit to the UK later this year, appearing to confirm suggestions it has been delayed.

A Fisheries bill will allow the UK to take on responsibility for ""access to fisheries and management of its waters"" while an Agriculture Bill will ""provide stability"" for farmers and ensure an ""effective system"" of support to replace the Common Agricultural Policy. A new nuclear safeguards regime will be required after the UK leaves the EU and its nuclear agency Euratom, with new powers for the Office for Nuclear regulation. Other measures will allow for a standalone domestic customs regime, giving the UK the scope to make changes to VAT and excise rates currently determined by the EU, to pave the way for an ""independent trade policy"" and to enable the UK to implement non-UN sanctions on its own or in conjunction with allies.

"The boy has been named locally as Spencer Hurst A teenage boy died after getting into difficulty while swimming in a lake with friends. Spencer Hurst, 15, was found after emergency services went to Ryders Hayes Mere near Walsall, West Midlands. He got into trouble at about 19:00 BST on Tuesday and his body was recovered just over an hour later. His death follows that of another teenager, Paul Lawson, 16,who died at a reservoir in Rochdaleon Monday. Paul's mother Natalie Lawson told the BBC she had ""begged"" him not to go into the water, and urged others to learn from her son's death. Elsewhere in England, a woman in her 80s died after being pulled from the sea at East Wittering, Sussex, on Monday. More updates on this story 'I begged him not to go in the water' This video can not be played Teenage boy dies while swimming in lake in Walsall Spencer's death happened on the fourth day of a heatwave across parts of England - and duringDrowning Prevention Week,external. Head teacher David Mountney said the year 10 pupil had only joined Aldridge School this year, but ""had already established a strong friendship group"". He said: ""When someone so young dies, it obviously impacts heavily on their family but also on the wider community especially their school. ""We have provided counselling services and have spoken to pupils about the importance of caring for each other. ""Ours is a community which prides itself on such support, even at times of challenge."" Spencer's sister said she was still in shock at his death Ben Brook, West Midlands Fire Service's area commander, said both teenagers' deaths ""serve as tragic reminders of the dangers of swimming in open water"". ""We absolutely understand the temptation to swim, have fun and cool down during the heatwave, but we are asking people not to,"" he said. ""It simply isn't worth the risk nor the heartbreak for all involved when things go wrong."" It is thought Spencer had swum out to an island in the lake and was returning to the shore when he got into difficulties. His sister Hollie and his friends went to the lake on Wednesday to pay tribute to him. She said: ""I'm still in shock. It just doesn't seem real. Everyone said we were like twins."" Emergency services at the scene in Walsall One woman, who gave her name as Tanya, told BBC WM that emergency crews had struggled to get access to the lake and locals helped open a gate at the bottom of Ryders Hayes Lane. Paramedics then ran to the lake, arriving about 20 minutes after the boy had first become distressed. ""When I got there, his friends were all crying and saying he just said he felt out of breath and tried to grab him but he went under,"" she said. In June 2007, a 17-year-old boy died the same lake Terry Leonard, a coach at Pleck Boxing Club, which Spencer had been a member of since junior school, said all boxers and coaches were ""broken hearted"" by the news of his death. ""There is no doubt in our minds this lad was destined for major honours in the boxing world. Brilliant boxer. Brilliant personality. Brilliant lad,"" he said. People have been leaving tributes by the lake A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said staff on the ground searched the area for the 15-year-old on Tuesday evening, with assistance from crews in the air ambulance and police helicopter. He said: ""Although it is very hot at the moment, the dangers of going into open water cannot be underestimated.""

"Some of Britain's youngest new MPs have been telling Newsbeat what it feels like to be elected in their 20s. ""The first few days here have been manic, so much to take in,"" says one. Another says entering parliament feels a bit like ""being Harry Potter"". The House of Commons hasproduced a guidebookfor its older members to help them understand ""millennials"". The election on 8 June saw these four young MPs win power. Ben (pictured above) is the first Conservative ever elected in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, after winning the seat from Labour's Sir Alan Meale, who had held it since 1987. This video can not be played Everyone at the Mansfield count in Nottinghamshire seemed surprised by the Conservative candidate Ben Bradley's shock win ""People were quite pleased to see somebody a bit more lively,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""My frustration has always been with, you know, some 60-year-old grey bloke talking about things that are going to affect people who are 18 to 24. ""Actually they've got no idea. They've not been that age for an awfully long time."" Ben says he plans to spend as much time as he can in Mansfield, where he lives with his wife and two children. ""I think it's quite easy to get sucked into this [Westminster] bubble. ""The whole thing's surreal.  I sat in the chamber [last week], with the prime minister speaking and Jeremy Corbyn speaking, thinking, 'Am I here?' ""It's like being sucked into an alternate universe, like being Harry Potter and you've fallen into the Pensieve."" Labour politician Danielle won the Midlothian seat from a Scottish National Party politician. She is the daughter of Alex Rowley, Deputy Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, and grew up in Midlothian. She says she faced some prejudice during campaigning because she is young. Labour's new Midlothian MP Danielle Rowley ""I did get comments on that, but a lot of people were saying, 'Oh wow, a young woman standing. That's really great.' ""It's different to what people think about when they think of a politician. ""But it's not about age, it's about what you've done with your time. ""I've always wanted to make things better and to represent people. When I was a teenager I was on my local youth platform, and the Scottish Youth Parliament. Danielle Rowley being sworn in as an MP at the House of Commons ""I hope that being a young woman who has come from a council estate, managing to achieve something that I've always wanted to achieve, I hope that's something people can look up to."" She's had a few surreal moments since taking office, like meeting former Labour leader Ed Milliband, who she really admires. ""I was trying not to be too uncool, although I did tell him that I've got a Rubik's Cube that he signed in my dining room, that I won at a Labour Party raffle once,"" she laughs. She says the first week was a ""whirlwind"". ""But everyone's so friendly and welcoming, pointing us in the right direction, giving tips. I didn't expect that, to be honest."" Ben Lake won the last Welsh seat to be declared - Ceredigion Ben became Plaid Cymru's youngest ever MP when he took the Ceredigion seat from Liberal Democrat MP Mark Williams. He was working in the Welsh National Assembly before being elected and says moving to the House of Commons has already been a massive change. ""The first few days here have been manic, so much to take in,"" he tells us. ""The place is massive. It's a rabbit warren of different corridors and rooms."" As well as starting to build his team of staff, Ben's been getting to grips with the traditions of parliament. ""A lot of the older [MPs] have been giving me advice... like on when do I bow? When do I not bow? What do I do?"" he says. Ben says he's already getting emails from constituents asking for his help. ""One of the biggest challenges we have is making sure young people are able to stay in Ceredigion and make their lives there,"" he says. This video can not be played Ben Lake said the campaign had a ""young jolt of energy"". The constituency might have the lowest unemployment rate in Wales for 18 to 24-year-olds, at 1.1%, but Ben says that's because many feel forced to move away. ""At the moment it's very difficult because of housing issues, and the very limited choice of careers. ""That's what I'm actually looking forward to most, proving to people that they were right to trust me, because it's a huge honour to be elected."" Scottish Conservative Kirstene took the Angus seat with a majority of more than 2,000, removing the SNP from the seat for the first time since 1997. ""It's an incredible honour to represent the community I was born and brought up in. ""I'm under no illusion that I have to work incredibly hard to retain that seat."" New Scottish Conservative MP for Angus Kirstene Hair She says she'll represent her younger constituents. ""One issue that came up over the course of the campaign was jobs. ""For example, there were a number of people who'd been to university and found it extremely difficult to get jobs, so I think we need to ensure that they have support.""

"Policing in England and Wales could be at ""significant"" risk if resources are diverted to fight terrorism, the UK's top counter-terrorism officer has said. Counter-terrorism policing has been placed on an ""emergency footing"" after recent attacks, the BBC understands. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley has asked ministers to reassure officers that funding will not be diverted from mainstream policing as a result. The Home Office said counter-terrorism funding would increase by 30% by 2022. The BBC understands that Mr Rowley has written to Home Secretary Amber Rudd, warning that the counter-terrorism policing network was not able to operate at ""full strength"". ""The demand for increasing numbers of detectives in areas such as child abuse has prevented this,"" he wrote. He suggested that prioritising counter-terrorism work would involve ""difficult choices"" about where to put resources. ""It will inevitably push risk to other areas of policing, potentially with significant impact,"" he said. The letter, which was sent a week ago, before the Finsbury Park attack, included a plea to avoid ""uncertainty over funding"" so chief constables did not ""shy away"" from important operational changes. The Met has said that it is discussing funding issues with the government. There are no formal talks,just regular dialogue over a range of issues, including funding. The three-month emergency plan, known as Operation Roset, was put in place after the first three attacks this year - at Westminster, Manchester Arena and London Bridge. The operation is designed to intensify counter-terrorism activity - in particular the capacity of police to investigate plots - following a four-fold increase in the number of leads they were following up with security service MI5. But with more than 700 officers and staff dealing with inquiries relating to the London and Manchester attacks, police must find resources for counter-terrorism work from elsewhere. It is understood some staff will be temporarily removed from the ongoingpublic inquiry into undercover policing. This year's terror attacks, including the bomb at Manchester Arena, have put police on an emergency footing Various war crimes investigations will also be suspended and officers will be transferred from regional organised crime units. Staff will be diverted from other counter-terrorism functions, which BBC News has decided not to specify to avoid compromising national security. In the letter, Mr Rowley said police and crime commissioners, though supportive of Operation Roset, were concerned about the implications for other policing areas. ""They want reassurance that financial resources will not be diverted from mainstream policing,"" he wrote. The UK has had an ""exceptional"" style of policing at a local level for almost 200 years, but a former head of the national counter terrorism office said this had changed. Speaking on Radio 4's Today, Chris Phillips said: ""I don't remember anyone telling us that that style of policing was going to disappear. ""Well I can tell you in reality it has pretty much already disappeared and I don't think the public are really happy with thatâ¦ they won't be happy with that if they knew."" Mr Phillips told the programme every day hundreds of officers were being deployed to deal with different inquiries and policing was ""absolutely at breaking point"". ""Those officers have not just come from some magic police tree with officers available for deployment, they've come from the boroughs, they're coming from local policing."" The National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) confirmed that plans were being implemented to deal with the heightened terror risk. It said the service was facing an ""extremely challenging period"", with some officers having to work overtime to fill gaps. A spokeswoman said: ""We are facing an unprecedented terror threat and it is no surprise that our resources are currently tested against what is now four terrorist attacks and five thwarted plots in very short succession."" Mr Rowley suggested measures to bolster security, but said they were in themselves ""unsustainable"" Mr Rowley's letter, which was copied to leading figures in security and law enforcement, also contains a list of measures to bolster physical security, make more use of de-radicalisation programmes and improve preparedness for an attack. But he said these measures were ""no more than an immediate patch"". He added: ""In themselves they will not be enough. They are also unsustainable."" The BBC understands that a second letter with more detailed points was sent to Ms Rudd - this time signed by Mr Rowley, Cressida Dick, the Met Police Commissioner, Lynne Owens, head of the National Crime Agency, and Sara Thornton, who leads the NPCC. Speaking to the London Assembly on Wednesday, Ms Dick confirmed that resources were being shifted to counter-terrorism work from other policing areas because of the workload created by the terror attacks in London and Manchester. The commissioner said there was an ""impact"" on other investigations, with some having to ""pause"" while others have had to ""slow down"", echoing concerns raised in the letter to the home secretary, The commissioner said the attacks at Westminster, Manchester Arena, London Bridge and Finsbury Park had left the counter-terrorism police network ""stretched"". She said they involved a lot of ""backward-looking resource"" which had taken away resources from pro-active inquiries. Asked about the way police had handled calls to the anti-terrorist hotline, amid claims that concerns about one of the London Bridge attackers had not been acted on, she said her information was that the calls had been ""logged, assessed and dealt with properly"". She said there would be reviews of the incidents and suggested that there might have to be greater regulation of van hire. Ms Dick said the terror attacks had taken place against a background of increasing demand on policing in London, with emergency calls on the rise, a surge in knife crime and, over the past two months, a ""higher than average"" number of murders. Jack Dromey MP, Labour's shadow police minister for three years, said: ""Britain is facing the most serious threat of terrorism in a generation and revelations from Britain's top police officers show that the thin blue line is being stretched to breaking point."" He added that police did not have the ""numbers and resources necessary to keep the public safe"". The Home Office said it had agreed in 2015 that overall police funding would be protected in real terms - and that cross-government spending on counter-terrorism would rise from Â£11.7bn to Â£15.1bn. A spokesperson said: ""Keeping families, communities and our country safe is this government's priority. ""After the recent horrific attacks, the government and police are in complete agreement that we must review our counter-terrorism strategy to tackle the changing threat.""

"This video can not be played Police arrive after explosion in Brussels central train station Belgian soldiers have shot a man suspected of being a would-be suicide bomber at Brussels Central Station, officials say. He was shot after reportedly setting off a small explosion and no-one else is believed to have been injured. Prosecutors later said the man had died. They are treating the incident as a terrorist attack. In March 2016, 32 people were killed in attacks on Brussels claimed by the Islamic State (IS) group. According to Belgian newspaper La Libre Belgique, quoting prosecutors, the man who was shot was wearing a rucksack and a bomb belt. A photograph taken inside the station showed flames He detonated a device when he attracted the attention of soldiers in the station, the paper says. Brussels marks bomb attacks anniversary Spain links arrests to Brussels attacks Belgium country profile Nicolas Van Herrewegen, a railway sorting agent, said he had gone down to the station's mezzanine level when he heard someone shouting. This video can not be played Nicolas Van Herrewegen saw a man with a suicide belt shout ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is great"" in Arabic) ""Then he cried 'Allahu Akbar' and he blew up a wheeled suitcase,"" he told AFP news agency. ""I was behind a wall when it exploded. I went down and alerted my colleagues to evacuate everyone. He [the suspect] was still around but after that we didn't see him."" ""It wasn't exactly a big explosion but the impact was pretty big,"" he added. ""People were running away."" Armed Belgian police have sealed off the scene Mr Van Herrewegen described the suspect as well-built and tanned with short hair, wearing a white shirt and jeans. ""I saw that he had something on him because I could see wires emerging, so it may have been a suicide vest,"" he said. Lawyer Remy Bonnaffe, 23, was waiting for a train and took a photograph of flames seconds after the explosion. He told Reuters news agency that people close to the explosion appeared unhurt and he saw no obvious damage to nearby walls. ""I'm happy that no-one was injured and that this was basically a failed attempt,"" he said. Arash Aazami arrived at the station just after the explosion. He told the BBC: ""As we entered into the station, we were evacuated loudly by some security personnel. ""Looked around, saw people running in the streets, trying to seek refuge and decided to do the same ourselves."" Police and soldiers guided people to safety outside the station As the station and Grand Place were evacuated, businesses and restaurants were ordered to close and draw down their shutters, RTL radio reports. Metro lines running through the station were also briefly suspended on orders of the police, according to the radio. On 22 March of last year, three suicide bombers mounted twin attacks on the city's Zaventem airport and Maelbeek underground station. The same Brussels-based IS cell was also behind the gun and bomb attacks in Paris in November 2015, that killed 130 people. The French capital was jolted again on Monday whena man with an Islamist background died after ramming his car into a police vanon the Avenue des Champs-ÃlysÃ©e. London has also been on edge sincea van was driven into Muslim worshippers outside a mosqueon Sunday night, with one man dying and nine people injured. It followed IS-claimed attacks onLondon's Borough Marketin June and apop concert in Manchesterin May that together left some 30 people dead and more than 100 injured.

"Prince Mohammed bin Salman (left) replaces prince Mohammed bin Nayef (right) as crown prince Saudi Arabia's king has appointed his son Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince - replacing his nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef, as first in line to the throne. King Salman's decree also means Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 31, will become deputy prime minister while continuing as defence minister. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, has been removed from his role as head of domestic security, state media say. He has pledged allegiance to the new crown prince, his younger cousin. Saudi Arabia has typically been ruled by kings in their 70s or 80s. Prince Mohammed bin Salman's rapid ascent is seen by the younger generation as a sign that things are changing. Before his latest promotion, he was responsible for leading Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, overseeing the kingdom's energy policy and economic reform. He must have already ruffled a lot of feathers in a royal family that was used to being presided over by a succession of elderly men, the BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen reports. Mohammed bin Salman's rise marks climax of leadership revolution Saudis welcome 'prince of youth' His father King Salman is 81 and reportedly not in the best of health, our correspondent adds. Prince Mohammed bin Salman could, potentially, lead Saudi Arabia for decades, heralding a long period of internal stability. However, the new crown prince is close to US President Donald Trump, and could ratchet up pressure against Iran - which would raise tensions in the region. The rise of Prince Mohammed bin Salman has been meteoric. When I met him in Jeddah in 2013 he described himself as simply ""a lawyer"". Today he is a heartbeat away from ruling the most powerful country in the Arab world. Despite being the driving force behind Saudi Arabia's damaging and inconclusive military campaign in Yemen, he is largely popular at home, especially with younger Saudis. He has swept away many of the ineffective timeservers in government offices and replaced them with young, Western-educated technocrats. He has set out a possibly over-ambitious development plan, ""Vision 2030"", and announced plans to sell off part of the vast state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco. He has also forged ties with Washington and the Trump administration. But his biggest and most risky move may yet prove to be his bid to curb the power of the conservative religious establishment. Washington likes this move, but others closer to home do not. Who is Mohammed bin Salman? The founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud), had dozens of sons, and there are as many as 15,000 princes and princesses in the royal family. In 2006, a decree was passed setting up a committee responsible for electing the king and crown prince. The committee is made up of senior princes of the Al Saud royal family and is known as the Allegiance Council. This video can not be played Mohammed bin Nayef (R) pledged allegiance to Mohammed bin Salman (L), who knelt and kissed his older cousin's hand Mohammed bin Salman'snew promotion,externalto crown prince was approved by 31 out of 34 members of the council. Analysts say those in power tend to appoint their sons to roles that will enhance their chances of being promoted - so when monarchs and crown princes change, sons can come into and out of favour. King Salman, a son of King Abdulaziz, acceded to the throne in January 2015 after the death of his half-brother Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz. He launched his first major cabinet reshuffle a few months later, promoting Mohammed bin Nayef to crown prince and Mohammed bin Salman, who was relatively unknown at that time, to deputy crown prince. Experts say the second reshuffle has reduced uncertainty over the line of succession, and means the king has averted a potential power struggle between his son and his nephew. The decree promoting Mohammed bin Salman includesa clause,externalpreventing him from appointing one of his own sons as his heir. It is the most influential Arab country - and a key ally of Western powers including the US and the UK. The kingdom is also the world's second largest oil producer - and the Saudi royal family is thought to be one of the richest ruling families in the world. It is guardian of the two most holy sites in Islam, and regards itself as leader of the Sunni community worldwide. The kingdom is a key player in Sunni attempts to block Shia Iranian influence in the Middle East. It has launched air strikes on Yemen to fight Houthi rebels, who Saudi Arabia believes are backed by Iran. However, the campaign has been criticised for human rights violations - including the killing many civilians. Recently, Saudi Arabia also joined efforts to impose a blockade on Qatar. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef was the kingdom's security chief for many years and was known for his strong stance against jihadist militants. As deputy prime minister and interior minister, he headed up the counter-terrorism portfolio, and also had good relations with Saudi Arabia's Western allies. State media broadcast footage showing Mohammed bin Nayef meeting Mohammed bin Salman after the succession was announced. The former crown prince said ""I am content"" and ""I am going to rest now. May God help you"", while the new heir replied ""May God help you. I will never do without your advice"". King Salman has told Saudis to pledge allegiance to his son Reaction to the appointment of the new crown prince was largely (and unsurprisingly) celebratory, although Saudi Arabia's regional rivals took the opportunity to criticise the kingdom. Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya TV ran blanket coverage and emphasised the positive effect the appointment had on the country's stock exchange.  Similar reports appeared in other friendly Arab states. But in Iran - Saudi Arabia's bitter rival - several news outlets described the appointment as a ""soft coup"". Similar language was used by the Pro-Qatari HuffPost Arabi, which called the appointment ""a coup in the royal palace"". Syrian state media's largely neutral report came with a considerable sting in the tail. Coverage ended with a reminder to viewers of a ""tyrannical regime"" which ""lacks the most basic democratic principles"" and ""supports terrorism"". Jihadists on social media celebrated the reshuffle, anticipating that the changes would pave the way for internal strife within the House of Saud and eventually bring about its downfall.

"Prince Mohammed bin Salman (left) replaces prince Mohammed bin Nayef (right) as crown prince Saudi Arabia's king has appointed his son Mohammed bin Salman as crown prince - replacing his nephew, Mohammed bin Nayef, as first in line to the throne. King Salman's decree also means Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 31, will become deputy prime minister while continuing as defence minister. Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, has been removed from his role as head of domestic security, state media say. He has pledged allegiance to the new crown prince, his younger cousin. Saudi Arabia has typically been ruled by kings in their 70s or 80s. Prince Mohammed bin Salman's rapid ascent is seen by the younger generation as a sign that things are changing. Before his latest promotion, he was responsible for leading Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, overseeing the kingdom's energy policy and economic reform. He must have already ruffled a lot of feathers in a royal family that was used to being presided over by a succession of elderly men, the BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen reports.

"A man has been Tasered by police after reports people were being attacked at a London mosque just before 01:30 BST. Officers said they acted after finding a man waving an ""item"" around near the London Central Mosque in Regent's Park. There were no reports of any injuries and the suspect is being held at a central London police station on suspicion of affray. The force said it was not treating the incident as terrorism-related and said the item being waved was a shoehorn. ""Officers are keeping an open mind regarding any motivation for the incident"", the force said in a statement. The incident comes after a van was driven at worshippers near the Muslim Welfare House mosque and community centre, in Finsbury Park, in the early hours of Monday. Nine people were taken to three London hospitals and two were treated at the scene. Those who were injured had been helping a man who had collapsed. He later died but it is not clear if that was because of the attack. Darren Osborne, 47, from Cardiff, has been held on suspicion of attempted murder and alleged terror offences.

"Over the last five years, Imagine Dragons have become one of the biggest bands on the planet. Their emotionally-charged, radio-friendly rock anthems likeRadioactive,externalandSucker For Pain,externalhave won Grammy Awards, number one albums and a scarily loyal fanbase. But behind closed doors, the band's frontman Dan Reynolds was struggling with severe depression. Things came to a head on their last world tour. Playing 110 dates in 42 countries on five continents left the singer ""numb"". ""It came to a point where I didn't have an option,"" he tells the BBC. ""It was lose my family and lose my life or seek help."" After the band's final concert of the tour in Amsterdam last February, the star told his bandmates he was taking a year off to tackle the condition, which has plagued him since childhood. ""When I was younger, in school, I would just let it pass, and ride out the valleys and the peaks and the ups and downs,"" he says. ""Then I tried medication and it was too scary for me, because I felt like it was going to change the music."" So last year, he ""went to a therapist and sat down and basically faced it head on for the first time"". Imagine Dragons (left to right): Wayne Sermon, Daniel Platzman, Dan Reynolds and Ben McKee Having decided not to take antidepressants, his treatment took ""a more holistic route"" than before - changing his diet, cutting out sugar and practicing yoga and meditation. The latter, in particular, ""has been huge"" for the singer, who says he has trouble ""quieting"" his brain. Reynolds was supported through the last year by his wife, fellow musician Aja Volkman, and bandmate Wayne Sermon, whom he's known since childhood. ""We're brothers, so if he's not in a good place, then none of us are,"" says Sermon. The guitarist admits everyone in the band has ""demons that came out"" after their ascent to fame - including his own issues with trust and ""questioning people's motives"". ""When you're under a microscope, it's going to magnify all the problems you had before,"" he says, ""But I don't want to be to be down about it, because I feel like we've come out better people. All of us."" Those changes are the foundation of Imagine Dragons' new album Evolve. The artwork shows a human form ascending from a place of eternal darkness to one of light and colour, while the music is inventive and vibrant - especially when compared to the claustrophobic onslaught of their last record. ""Smoke + Mirrors was super-angsty"" admits Reynolds. ""This album is a celebration of opening the blinds and the light shining through."" On the lead single,Believer,external, he writes about his personal transformation while acknowledging: ""My life, my love, my drive, it came from pain."" ""I was raised in a really conservative household and carried a heavy guilty conscience with me because of religion,"" he explains. ""Letting go of that was really freeing and wonderful. But I've also learned to be happy for the things I learned from it and grateful for the love that I found. ""If it wasn't for all of those things working in the exact way they did, Imagine Dragons would cease to exist."" Imagine Dragons have become a muscular live act, their percussion-heavy hits particularly suited for giant arena gigs The seventh of nine children, Reynolds was raised in a strict Mormon household. Aged 19, he volunteered to become a missionary in Nebraska for two years, proselytizing for the church and helping drug addicts. On his return, he enrolled to study music at the Mormon-run Brigham Young University in Utah, but dropped out to form Imagine Dragons with Sermon and two of his classmates from the prestigious Berklee College of Music in Boston. In the beginning, they took any gig they could get, even opening for a mime at a nearby shopping centre. One regular booking at a local casino saw them playing six-hour sets three times a week, mixing original material with crowd-pleasing covers. Their big break came in 2010 when roots rock band Train pulled out of a local festival. With just half an hour's notice, Imagine Dragons were promoted to the main stage and played for 26,000 people. Within a year, they had signed to Interscope Records and started work on their debut album, Night Visions. Like fellow Las Vegas rock band The Killers (who are managed by Reynolds' older brother, Robert), the group straddle the divide between rock and pop, embellishing their fist-pumping choruses with the sleek textures and throbbing rhythms of dance music. It's no surprise, then, that they're one of the few rock acts to score commercial success at a time when pop and hip-hop dominate the charts. ""One of the reasons we called our band Imagine Dragons is so we had no boundaries,"" says Reynolds. ""We created music that was all over the map because we didn't want people to expect power chords on my guitar or a simple pop song every time. ""We wanted the leash to be gone and for us to be able to run wild in the field."" The band's new album is more reflective than before The band's eager eclecticism has irritated purists (""pop deserves better, rock deserves better,"" sniffed one review) but it makes perfect sense in the streaming era, when fans flit between genres on a whim. On Evolve, their sound has also become leaner - free from the sonic, as well as the emotional, baggage of their last record. A song called Yesterday is particularly eye-opening, with Reynolds singing like a bluesman wandering through the dustbowl, over a gregarious piano stomp. ""We really reached into our roots of being inspired by the more eccentric songs from the Beatles and Queen,"" says Reynolds. The band were propelled out of their comfort zone by recruiting an array of top-shelf producers, including Lorde's right-hand man Joel Little, and Swedish duo Mattman & Robin, who have worked for Britney Spears and Taylor Swift. They even got some help from Justin Tranter, one of pop's most in-demand writers, whose credits include Justin Bieber'sSorry,externaland DNCE'sCake by the Ocean,external. ""He understood my trepidation at working with another writer,"" says Reynolds. ""I've never done it before - but he knew that I had to write all my own lyrics and he was a wonderful sounding board, melodically."" The band are on tour for the rest of the year The singer is excited for fans to hear the record (""it feels like Christmas is coming""), especially after the group's year-long hiatus. ""A lot of our fans really invest their life into this band,"" he says. ""They come to every show, they get tattoos, their whole wall is lined in Imagine Dragons things. ""And I get it, because Iwasthat kid, you know? That's what Nirvana was to me when I was a little kid. Kurt was everything to me. ""So I feel a responsibility to all of the people who invest their time into Imagine Dragons... an obligation to be honest and tell them what my heart says."" That's why he decided to write about his depression and to address it in interviews. ""I was really shy about speaking out,"" he says. ""Humanity doesn't like to acknowledge their frailty. We like to only acknowledge our strengths. But I think it's important to talk about it."" ""It's like the song Believer,"" adds Sermon. ""Of course, every human wants to avoid pain at all cost - but the truth is, that's one time we really grow."" Imagine Dragons' third album, Evolve, is released on Friday 23 June.

Five major Uber investors demanded Mr Kalanick's immediate resignation as chief executive,the New York Times said,external.

Uber is in tatters, engulfed by its own aggression. Mr Kalanick embodied his company's prevailing attitude: success at all costs. It saw Uber dominate the ride-sharing world, his chutzpah enabling the company to attract investment so effectively that last year Uber alone raised more money than the entire UK start-up scene.

Mr Primack said a group of investors, but particularly Bill Gurley of venture capitalist firm Benchmark, had put pressure on Mr Kalanick to resign. ""It's important to note: Travis controlled the board in terms of votes, so really, it was a vey big uphill climb for [Mr] Gurley and the other investors to get this done,"" Mr Primack said.

The ride-hailing company has had a series of recent controversies, including the departure of other high-level executives. Eric Alexander, the former head of Uber's Asia-Pacific business, left after a report that he had obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in 2014. Mr Alexander reportedly shared them with Mr Kalanick, senior vice-president Emil Michael and others. Mr Alexander was fired earlier this month, andMr Michael later left Uber. Board member David Bonderman made a sexist remark at a meeting about workplace practice recommendations last week and then resigned as a director. In February Uber said it was investigating ""abhorrent""sexual harassment claimsmade by former Uber engineer Susan Fowler.

"Republican Karen Handel praised Donald Trump in her victory speech US Republicans have won a closely contested congressional election in Georgia seen by many as a referendum on Donald Trump's presidency. Karen Handel retained the Atlanta seat with 53% of the vote, against 47% for her Democratic rival Jon Ossoff. The vacancy arose when Tom Price left to become health secretary. He had won the seat with a 23 point lead. In South Carolina, Republican Ralph Norman beat Democrat Archie Parnell in a solidly conservative area. President Trump congratulated both candidates. On the victory in suburban Atlanta, hetweeted,external: ""Congratulations to Karen Handel on her big win in Georgia 6th. Fantastic job, we are all very proud of you!"" Democrats were desperate to mark Tuesday's race as the moment the political tide began to turn in their favour. Instead, they woke up on Thursday to a president crowing about ""his"" triumph on Twitter. One race is of little consequence in determining who controls the House of Representatives, but the Georgia election - with its record-breaking cost and red-hot spotlight - matters. A lot. Democrats will surely be discouraged. They may be less willing to pour money into future races. The party's Bernie Sanders populist wing is second-guessing Mr Ossoff's decision to campaign as a moderate - heralding the possibility of more intra-party warfare in the days ahead. Republicans, on the other hand, can exhale. They'll feel more confident in pushing through their legislative agenda without ballot-box consequences. Nervous incumbents considering retirement in the face of a coming electoral wave may stick around. And, at least for now, their president gets a welcome bit of good news after weeks of Russia-related headaches. November will bring another round of electoral tests - including key governors races in Virginia and New Jersey - that will be on friendlier terrain for Democrats. Until then, it's going to be a long few months for those on the left. Jon Ossoff was a political newcomer Georgia's sixth district is a traditionally safe Republican seat but Democrats had hoped to capitalise on the president's low approval ratings. Spending on candidates was put at $56m (Â£44m), making it the costliest congressional election in US history. Democrats have already suffered narrow defeats in Kansas and Montana this year. Addressing jubilant supporters, Ms Handel thanked key Republican figures, including President Trump. ""I need to also thank Speaker Ryan and the House leadership and so many of the members across this country. And a special thanks to the President of the United States of America,"" she said. Mr Ossoff told his supporters they had provided ""a beacon of hope for people here in Georgia, for people across the country, and for people around the world"". This video can not be played The Georgia vote is the most expensive congressional election in history He also said they should celebrate having turned a conservative stronghold into a competitive district. ""We showed the world that in places where no-one thought it was even possible we could fight,"" Mr Ossoff said. In April, he narrowly failed to win the 50% needed to secure outright victory in a first round, forcing the run-off against Ms Handel. She had come a distant second in the first round, but the Republican vote had been split among 11 candidates. Republicans believed the run-off would favour them in an affluent seat they have held since 1979. They also believed thatlast week's shooting of Republicans on a Virginia baseball fieldwould count in their favour at the polls. The suspected gunman was a Democratic supporter and a Republican advert that sought to politicise the attack was condemned by Ms Handel. The South Carolina fifth-district seat, vacated when Mick Mulvaney became Mr Trump's budget director, had been expected to be an easy win for Republicans. The Republicans have so far staved off defeats by the Democrats this year. In April theynarrowly defended a deeply conservative Kansas seatvacated when Mr Trump appointed Congressman Mike Pompeo to lead the CIA. Last month,Republican Greg Gianforte won a special congressional election in Montana, despite being charged with assaulting a UK reporter.

"An F15E fighter plane shot down the drone near Tanf, in southern Syria, the US military said A US jet has shot down an Iranian-made drone operated by forces backing the Syrian government in the south of the country, American officials say. The drone was thought to be armed and threatening US-led coalition troops on the ground, officials said. But Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said the action amounted to ""complicity with terrorism"". The incident comes after the US shot down a Syrian fighter plane on Sunday and another drone earlier this month. The F-15 plane downed the drone around 00:30 on Tuesday (21:30 GMT Monday) north-east of Tanf, an outpost of the US-led coalition, according to a US military statement. The incident underscores the growing tensions in the region as a battle develops for the control of eastern Syria, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. In another development, the US military announced officially that coalition forces had killed the top cleric of so-called Islamic State (IS), Turki al-Binali, in an air strike in Syria last month. IS supporters have also reported his death. Trump and the battle for eastern Syria Why is there a war in Syria? Why are air combat kills so rare? Military officials who spoke to CNN described it as a Shahed 129,a model unveiled by Iran in 2012. Iranian state TV broadcast footage of the Shahed 129 two years ago It is said by the Iranians to have a range of 2,000km (1,240 miles) and be capable of carrying bombs and missiles. ""They were threatening our forces on the ground,"" the US official quoted by AFP said. ""Their course was on a run toward our folks to drop a munition on them."" The last drone the US says it shot down was alsoreportedly destroyed near Tanfafter firing on coalition forces. Tanf has been used by Western special forces as well as Syrian rebel forces. The Syrian plane destroyed on Sunday, a Su-22 fighter bomber, washit after reportedly dropping bombs near the town of Tabqain Raqqa province. In response, Russia, one of Syria's main allies, announced that US-led coalition warplanes flying west of the River Euphrates would be tracked by Russian anti-aircraft forces in the sky and on the ground and treated as targets It suspended a hotline set up to avoid clashes between US and Russian aircraft in the region. With IS under growing pressure in Raqqa the fight is on for who controls the territory after its demise, our correspondent says. Iranian-backed pro-Syrian regime forces are pushing forward on a number of fronts, and the US is equally eager to resist what it sees as a widening of  Iranian influence. Iran says it attacked IS fighters in eastern Syria with long-range missiles on Sunday. This video can not be played Iranian TV footage of missiles being launched (no sound) So the tensions locally are mounting between the US and pro-regime forces; between the US and the Russians; and more broadly between Washington and Tehran. By accident or design, any one of these sources of friction could prompt a much more significant military encounter, our correspondent adds. Originally from Bahrain, Binali joined IS in 2014 and played a key role within the group acting as its top religious official and offering guidance to its leaders and militants alike, BBC Monitoring reports. US Central Command says he was killed by an air strike on 31 May in the eastern town of Mayadin. IS supporters went online to announce his death.

"Republican Karen Handel praised Donald Trump in her victory speech US Republicans have won a closely contested congressional election in Georgia seen by many as a referendum on Donald Trump's presidency. Karen Handel retained the Atlanta seat with 53% of the vote, against 47% for her Democratic rival Jon Ossoff. The vacancy arose when Tom Price left to become health secretary. He had won the seat with a 23 point lead. In South Carolina, Republican Ralph Norman beat Democrat Archie Parnell in a solidly conservative area. President Trump congratulated both candidates. On the victory in suburban Atlanta, hetweeted,external: ""Congratulations to Karen Handel on her big win in Georgia 6th. Fantastic job, we are all very proud of you!"" Democrats were desperate to mark Tuesday's race as the moment the political tide began to turn in their favour. Instead, they woke up on Thursday to a president crowing about ""his"" triumph on Twitter. One race is of little consequence in determining who controls the House of Representatives, but the Georgia election - with its record-breaking cost and red-hot spotlight - matters. A lot. Democrats will surely be discouraged. They may be less willing to pour money into future races. The party's Bernie Sanders populist wing is second-guessing Mr Ossoff's decision to campaign as a moderate - heralding the possibility of more intra-party warfare in the days ahead. Republicans, on the other hand, can exhale. They'll feel more confident in pushing through their legislative agenda without ballot-box consequences. Nervous incumbents considering retirement in the face of a coming electoral wave may stick around. And, at least for now, their president gets a welcome bit of good news after weeks of Russia-related headaches. November will bring another round of electoral tests - including key governors races in Virginia and New Jersey - that will be on friendlier terrain for Democrats. Until then, it's going to be a long few months for those on the left. Jon Ossoff was a political newcomer Georgia's sixth district is a traditionally safe Republican seat but Democrats had hoped to capitalise on the president's low approval ratings. Spending on candidates was put at $56m (Â£44m), making it the costliest congressional election in US history. Democrats have already suffered narrow defeats in Kansas and Montana this year. Addressing jubilant supporters, Ms Handel thanked key Republican figures, including President Trump. ""I need to also thank Speaker Ryan and the House leadership and so many of the members across this country. And a special thanks to the President of the United States of America,"" she said. Mr Ossoff told his supporters they had provided ""a beacon of hope for people here in Georgia, for people across the country, and for people around the world"". This video can not be played The Georgia vote is the most expensive congressional election in history He also said they should celebrate having turned a conservative stronghold into a competitive district. ""We showed the world that in places where no-one thought it was even possible we could fight,"" Mr Ossoff said. In April, he narrowly failed to win the 50% needed to secure outright victory in a first round, forcing the run-off against Ms Handel. She had come a distant second in the first round, but the Republican vote had been split among 11 candidates. Republicans believed the run-off would favour them in an affluent seat they have held since 1979. They also believed thatlast week's shooting of Republicans on a Virginia baseball fieldwould count in their favour at the polls. The suspected gunman was a Democratic supporter and a Republican advert that sought to politicise the attack was condemned by Ms Handel. The South Carolina fifth-district seat, vacated when Mick Mulvaney became Mr Trump's budget director, had been expected to be an easy win for Republicans. The Republicans have so far staved off defeats by the Democrats this year. In April theynarrowly defended a deeply conservative Kansas seatvacated when Mr Trump appointed Congressman Mike Pompeo to lead the CIA.
