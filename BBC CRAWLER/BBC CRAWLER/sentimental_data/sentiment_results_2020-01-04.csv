"Wang Zhimin served a little over two years as director of the liaison office China has sacked the official in charge of relations with Hong Kong, Chinese state media reports. Wang Zhimin was director of Beijing's liaison office for the territory. The Xinhua news agency said Mr Wang had been replaced by Luo Huining, the Communist Party secretary for the northern province of Shanxi. The sacking follows six months of often violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that have tested Beijing's patience with top officials there. Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, remains in office with the public support of the mainland leadership, despite being the face of a proposed bill which initially sparked unrest in March 2019. The bill would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China, raising fears that the new law would be abused to detain dissidents and remove them from the territory. Anti-government protesters were detained on New Year's Day in Hong Kong Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions The protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong's protesters welcomed the new decade on Wednesday with a New Year's Day rally, which saw tens of thousands of people join a pro-democracy march. The gathering was largely peaceful, save for some small pockets of violence. Police used water cannon to clear the Mong Kok market district and fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters. Some 40 parliamentarians and dignitaries from 18 countries sent an open letter to Ms Carrie Lam on New Year's Eve, urging her to ""seek genuine ways forward out of this crisis by addressing the grievances of Hong Kong people"". Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997, when it was returned to Chinese control under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". While it is technically part of China, the territory has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected.

Sir Keir, who backed Remain in the EU referendum and was one of the leading figures in the party advocating for a new referendum, will kick off his leadership bid by visiting Brexit-backing Stevenage on Sunday. Some of Mr Corbyn's allies have blamed Sir Keir's Brexit stance for the party's disastrous election performance last month, where much of its traditional, Leave-backing Northern strongholds fell to the Conservatives. ""We cannot bury our head in the sand: Labour must rebuild and fast. We have to restore trust in our party as a force for change and a force for good,"" Sir Keir wrote in the paper. ""The millions of people who needed change at the last election still need change. The moral fight against poverty, inequality and injustice must continue."" Before Sir Keir, Lisa Nandy and Jess Philips were the latest MPs to enter the contest However, Sir Keir said Labour could not ""lose sight of our values or retreat from the radicalism of the past few years"". Among other things, he said the party should push for a ""Green New Deal"" to fight climate change and make the case for a ""radically transformed economy that empowers trade unions and communities that have been left behind"". And he also called for a ""human rights approach"" to foreign policy and international relations, accusing ministers of ""failing to hold an irresponsible US president to account"" over the situation in Iran. The human rights lawyer, who was made Queen's Counsel in 2002, served as head of the Crown Prosecution Service and accepted a knighthood in 2014, and has struggled to shake-off perceptions of privilege. The 57-year-old was named after Labour Party founder Keir Hardie and has emphasised his upbringing by a toolmaker father and nurse mother in London's Southwark when dismissing allegations he is too middle-class to speak to the party's historic heartlands. His CV includes co-founding the renowned Doughty Street Chambers and advising the Policing Board to ensure the Police Service of Northern Ireland complied with human rights laws. He entered Parliament as the MP for Holborn and St Pancras in 2015. A timetable for the leadership election - and any rule changes - is set to be decided by the party's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) on Monday. Under current rules, would-be candidates for both the leader and deputy leader roles must first be nominated by more than 20 MPs. They must also secure nominations from at least 5% of Labour's constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. Who will be Labour's next leader?

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The friends of Harry Dunn have protested outside the RAF base where he died to ""get their feelings across"" to the US Government. Mr Dunn, 19, died in a road crash in Northamptonshire in August that led to suspect Anne Sacoolas leaving for the US under diplomatic immunity. Last month, the CPS announced she would becharged with causing death by dangerous driving. But US officials said it was not ""a helpful development"". Mrs Sacoolas' lawyer said she would not return to the UK ""to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident"". Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car driven by Mrs Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, where her husband worked as an intelligence officer. Friends gathered outside the RAF base on Saturday to take part in the protest The spokesman for Mr Dunn's family, Radd Seiger, said the teenager's friends wanted to protest outside the base because they were ""being asked to forget their friend had been killed"". He said they felt a demonstration was ""the only way we can get our feelings across to Washington"". ""Ultimately if they don't send [Mrs Sacoolas] back we will not accept [RAF Croughton] being in our community,"" he added. The CPS said extradition proceedings had started when it charged Mrs Sacoolas. Last month the Home Secretary Priti Patelmet Mr Dunn's father Tim Dunn to explain the process. A 'Justice4Harry' banner was placed on the sign for RAF Croughton A statement from Amy Jeffress, Mrs Sacoolas's lawyer, said she had ""co-operated fully with the investigation and accepted responsibility"". It added: ""This was an accident, and a criminal prosecution with a potential penalty of 14 years' imprisonment is simply not a proportionate response. ""We have been in contact with the UK authorities about ways in which Anne could assist with preventing accidents like this from happening in the future, as well as her desire to honour Harry's memory. ""We will continue that dialogue in an effort to move forward from this terrible tragedy."" Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mr Seiger said the Christmas period had been a ""difficult time"" for the family. He said Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles and father Tim Dunn were ""desperately sad"". ""What they've been through has been frankly unimaginable,"" he added.

"Cairney and Jones spent years pretending that Ms Fleming was still alive The police officer who first knocked on Avril Jones and Edward Cairney's door looking for missing woman Margaret Fleming has told how he knew ""something wasn't right"". Sgt Chris McKay returned to the house in Inverkip during filming for a BBC Scotland documentary on the murder case. He described the behaviour of those who were supposed to be caring for the vulnerable woman as ""very strange"". Jones and Cairney were last year convicted of murdering Margaret whose disappearance went unnoticed for 17 years. Carers jailed for murdering teenager Police make body appeal to killer carers The two-part documentary, Murder Trial: The Disappearance of Margaret Fleming, follows their trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Filmed by BAFTA Scotland award-winning director Matt Pinder, it features police officers, lawyers, witnesses and school friends of the victim. Margaret Fleming had moderate learning difficulties Margaret Fleming was a vulnerable teenager with learning difficulties. Entrusted by her dying father into the care of his friends Eddie Cairney and Avril Jones, it was believed she was living in a remote coastal property in the village of Inverkip, on the west coast of Scotland. But an application for a Personal Independence Payment changed everything. Social workers could not get in contact with the applicant, Margaret. Police were called and it was discovered that Margaret, who would have been 35, had seemingly vanished. Sgt Chris McKay revisited the house where Margaret shared with her two carers Sgt Chris McKay came on shift on 28 October 2016 and took a call from the concerned social worker. It was then decided he would visit the house. When he arrived Eddie Cairney claimed Margaret had just left by the back door. Sgt McKay said: ""The one thing he said that stuck with me was that if we went away Margaret Fleming would come back, because authority figures had it drilled into her that she would be taken into care. ""From the outset it was very strange."" Re-visiting the derelict house, he recalled the conversation he had there. This video can not be played Sgt Chris McKay returns to the house where he first met Edward Cairney and Avril Jones. ""I still remember standing here on that night in question. Avril sitting here, Eddie sitting there. Asking him questions and he would control the conversation. ""He wouldn't allow Avril to speak. You could tell she was extremely nervous, just very fidgety with her hands and looked a bag of nerves. ""That's when we were thinking wait a minute, something's not right here."" Suzanne Allan's interview with Eddie Cairney led to her becoming a witness in court BBC Scotland's Suzanne Allan was invited into ""Seacroft"", Cairney and Jones' home during the investigation into Margaret's disappearance. The extraordinary interview she conducted was later used as evidence, with the reporter herself a witness in court. She said the story was unlike any other she had worked on. 'My incredible encounter with Margaret Fleming's killers' The teenager who was forgotten for 17 years ""It still shocks me when I see the condition of that house, to this day,"" she recalls. ""It was just bizarre from the word go."" Police described the house as ""uninhabitable"" ""I came back from that to the newsroom and everyone was asking what's the story - it was so unusual."" In the interview, conducted in October 2017, Cairney claimed Margaret was in Poland working as a gangmaster.  Avril Jones looked blank when asked if she had a message for Margaret. The documentary also hears from Alison Nugent, a friend of Avril Jones who was called to give evidence for the prosecution during the trial. She said: ""I looked over at Avril and Avril was staring straight ahead. I was there as a friend and it was almost as if that had been erased. I was now the enemy."" ""My head doesn't want to say that there was a murder involved. Maybe something happened and they just had to cover it up. That would be the lesser of two evils. ""But they are covering up something huge."" Iain McSporran QC (L) prosecuted the case and Thomas Ross QC represented Edward Cairney ""No one said it would be easy - but no one warned me it would be this difficult."" In April 2019, Iain McSporran QC prosecuted one of the most difficult cases of his career. He tells the documentary:  ""There is no smoking gun in this case, we don't have an eyewitness to Margaret being killed, we don't have the discovery of her  body. ""It would be idle to speculate as to whether a weapon was used.  I don't and I am not sure that anyone does have a theory as to the circumstances that Margaret met her death. ""We say that all the evidence points to that having been a criminal act motivated by greed."" He says: ""My first impressions were of something bad having happened to Margaret but something which would be very difficult to prove.""

"Callum has travelled to Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital six times since July ""I need to go on a car, a boat, another car, a plane and a bus to get my scan"". The words of eight-year-old Callum Taylor, who travels from Shetland to Aberdeen for MRI scans, after being diagnosed with epilepsy. At the moment, more than 600 patients a year do this - at a cost of more than Â£200,000 to the local health board in travel tickets alone. An MRI machine costs Â£1.6m and NHS Shetland says it cannot afford one. So the community is raising funds instead. Magnetic resonance imaging uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the inside of the body. It can be used to detect many - sometimes life-threatening - conditions such as cancer, heart defects and internal bleeding. Volunteers needed for new MRI scanner The life-saving machine developed in Aberdeen People living in Shetland have to make the long return trip totalling about 400 miles by plane or ferry to Aberdeen to get a scan. However, unpredictable weather conditions can cause travel delays and even cancellations at times - and locals claim the situation cannot continue. Callum has travelled to Royal Aberdeen Children's Hospital (RACH) six times since July for MRI scans, after being diagnosed with two different types of epilepsy. His mother, Shona McNab said it can be difficult to keep his spirits up. Etta Hannah was diagnosed with tumours in her brain and spinal cord Shetold BBC Scotland's The Nine: ""Sometimes Callum is glad to be in Aberdeen, but he is sometimes a bit emotional. ""We try and play down his hospital appointments so as to not worry him but that can be harder to do if it's such a big deal. ""It is taking time off work and time out of school - it is kind of hard to play it down"". Callum's story is not unique in Shetland. Six-year-old Etta Hannah was diagnosed with tumours in her brain and spinal cord before she started school last year, after a routine optometry appointment picked up swelling on her optic nerve. Since then, she has had to travel to the mainland regularly for chemotherapy and MRI scans. Jennifer Murray says her daughter has a lot to cope with Etta's mother Jennifer Murray said her daughter has nerve pain in her legs, so she tires very easily in comparison to other six-year-olds. ""I have actually stopped counting the number of times we have had to travel to Aberdeen in the last year because we have gone about sixty flights and some air ambulances because we have a lot of emergencies,"" she said. ""People think, it's only an hour's flight to get from Sumburgh to Aberdeen, but actually it is about four hours from walking out your house to setting foot in the hospital. ""For Etta when she is so poorly and sometimes when she is chemo-sick or very sore, it is a lot."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She added: ""If you miss your slot, they can't just put you in the next day - it doesn't work like that. But when Etta's tumours rely on being monitored regularly, you have to get there so sometimes it means we have to go a couple of days before just to make sure we get there. ""A day trip that is meant to be an overnight turns into two weeks - that happens quite a lot."" The community began fundraising for the MRI machine on the 70th anniversary of the NHS in July 2018. Harriet Middleton and fellow ""MRI Maakers,external"" knit hats, gloves and accessories and sell them locally and online (""maarkin and yaarkin"" is a local term for knitting and chatting). They put all the money raised towards the Shetland MRI Scanner Appeal, and have so far raised more than Â£70,000. Harriet has her own experience travelling to Aberdeen for regular MRI scans. Harriet Middleton and the ""MRI Maakers"" have been raising funds She said: ""I started doing this because I had a cancerous polyp that had to be removed. I had it removed and as a result of that I had to go to Aberdeen once every three months for two years. ""It can be quite tiring and I was very fit an able to do it but it would be a horrible long journey for anybody who wasn't quite so fit."" The fundraiser said she thought it was a shame that money had to be found for it - but that Shetlanders were ""very, very, very good at raising money and when push comes to shove"". She added: ""We can't stress strongly enough how important it would be to have it here, in the end I think it could probably be a lifesaver"". The Scottish government said in a statement: ""In 2019-20, NHS Shetland received increased investment of Â£1.2m, taking total board funding to Â£50.6m. ""While the Scottish government provides funding for equipment including MRI scanners, NHS Shetland is responsible for its own financial management and NHS Scotland estimated there would only be enough activity for the MRI scanner to be used one day a week"". The scanner could be situated at Gilbert Bain Hospital in Lerwick At Gilbert Bain Hospital in Lerwick, consultant surgeon Gordon McFarlane believes the scanner would be in use more than that. He said: ""I think it will be used two or three days a week. The list might not be quite as long as they have in Aberdeen, but also having it here and able to be used at least Monday to Friday is going make a big difference."" NHS Shetland's interim chief executive Simon Bokor-Ingram said: ""We have rising cost pressures so we need to be more efficient in what we do. ""The reality is that up and down the country there are donated assets in every hospital and it is absolutely right that for Shetland, the community has identified this as a potential project to put their efforts in to. ""This is about reinvesting the money that we are not spending on patient travel back into the service"".

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The friends of Harry Dunn have protested outside the RAF base where he died to ""get their feelings across"" to the US Government. Mr Dunn, 19, died in a road crash in Northamptonshire in August that led to suspect Anne Sacoolas leaving for the US under diplomatic immunity. Last month, the CPS announced she would becharged with causing death by dangerous driving. But US officials said it was not ""a helpful development"". Mrs Sacoolas' lawyer said she would not return to the UK ""to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident"". Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car driven by Mrs Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, where her husband worked as an intelligence officer. Friends gathered outside the RAF base on Saturday to take part in the protest The spokesman for Mr Dunn's family, Radd Seiger, said the teenager's friends wanted to protest outside the base because they were ""being asked to forget their friend had been killed"". He said they felt a demonstration was ""the only way we can get our feelings across to Washington"". ""Ultimately if they don't send [Mrs Sacoolas] back we will not accept [RAF Croughton] being in our community,"" he added. The CPS said extradition proceedings had started when it charged Mrs Sacoolas. Last month the Home Secretary Priti Patelmet Mr Dunn's father Tim Dunn to explain the process. A 'Justice4Harry' banner was placed on the sign for RAF Croughton A statement from Amy Jeffress, Mrs Sacoolas's lawyer, said she had ""co-operated fully with the investigation and accepted responsibility"". It added: ""This was an accident, and a criminal prosecution with a potential penalty of 14 years' imprisonment is simply not a proportionate response. ""We have been in contact with the UK authorities about ways in which Anne could assist with preventing accidents like this from happening in the future, as well as her desire to honour Harry's memory. ""We will continue that dialogue in an effort to move forward from this terrible tragedy."" Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mr Seiger said the Christmas period had been a ""difficult time"" for the family. He said Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles and father Tim Dunn were ""desperately sad"". ""What they've been through has been frankly unimaginable,"" he added.

"Wang Zhimin served a little over two years as director of the liaison office China has sacked the official in charge of relations with Hong Kong, Chinese state media reports. Wang Zhimin was director of Beijing's liaison office for the territory. The Xinhua news agency said Mr Wang had been replaced by Luo Huining, the Communist Party secretary for the northern province of Shanxi. The sacking follows six months of often violent pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong that have tested Beijing's patience with top officials there. Carrie Lam, the chief executive of Hong Kong, remains in office with the public support of the mainland leadership, despite being the face of a proposed bill which initially sparked unrest in March 2019. The bill would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited from Hong Kong to mainland China, raising fears that the new law would be abused to detain dissidents and remove them from the territory. Anti-government protesters were detained on New Year's Day in Hong Kong Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions The protests explained in 100 and 500 words Hong Kong's protesters welcomed the new decade on Wednesday with a New Year's Day rally, which saw tens of thousands of people join a pro-democracy march. The gathering was largely peaceful, save for some small pockets of violence. Police used water cannon to clear the Mong Kok market district and fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters. Some 40 parliamentarians and dignitaries from 18 countries sent an open letter to Ms Carrie Lam on New Year's Eve, urging her to ""seek genuine ways forward out of this crisis by addressing the grievances of Hong Kong people"". Hong Kong was a British colony until 1997, when it was returned to Chinese control under the principle of ""one country, two systems"". While it is technically part of China, the territory has its own legal system and borders, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech are protected.

"The rise in the number of deaths in the UK is being driven by fentanyl being added to heroin, a report says Deaths caused by the drug fentanyl are on the rise in the UK, a report warns. Deaths related to Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid considered to be 50 times more potent than heroin, rose from eight in 2008 to 135 in 2017,the report said,external. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) said the government should introduce controls to tackle the ""emerging threat"" the painkiller poses. The ACMD said a rise in the number of deaths in the UK is being driven by fentanyl being added to heroin. The drug was originally designed as a painkiller but has entered the illegal drug market. Synthetic opioids have been linked tothousands of US deaths. Its potency means that even small doses can be deadly. The ACMD, which advises ministers on drugs policy, said fentanyl-related deaths have risen in the UK despite the fact it is an illegal Class A substance. Fentanyl is an extremely strong painkiller, prescribed for severe chronic pain, or breakthrough pain which does not respond to regular painkillers. It is an opioid painkiller which means it works by mimicking the body's natural painkillers, called endorphins, which block pain messages to the brain. The risk of harm is higher if the wrong dose or strength is used. Typical symptoms of a fentanyl overdose include slow and difficult breathing, nausea and vomiting, dizziness and increased blood pressure. China to curb fentanyl after US plea Fentanyl bust 'enough to kill 26 million people' Opioid addiction mail-ordered to your door Dr Bowden-Jones said the introduction of fentanyl and other new opioid drugs into illegal UK markets was ""of great concern"". ""To respond to this emerging threat, we must carefully examine the lessons learnt in other countries, particularly the US and Canada, to understand and implement effective interventions,"" he added. The advisory group urged ministers to commission further research into strong opioids. The Home Office, which commissioned the ACMD report, said it would ""carefully consider"" the recommendations. A spokesperson said the Home Office has commissioned a major review of all drugs policy in an attempt to reduce the harm they cause.

" Emma’s long wait for alife-saving call By Dominic Hughes and Rachael Buchanan It is the small hours of the morning in the depths of winter, and Emma Watson is sitting in a dimly lit room in Ward 10 of the transplant unit in the Manchester Royal Infirmary. She looks drawn and tired. It has been a long night. The previous evening, Emma received a phone call at home to say the moment had come. She has been waiting for a kidney and pancreas transplant for more than a year, and donor organs are on their way to Manchester.   She’s been here before - not once, but a dozen times. It’s nearly always the same - a phone call, a hurried goodbye to her husband who mostly stays at home to look after their 10-year-old daughter, the dash to the hospital. And then the wait, knowing that she could be just hours away from an operation that has the potential to change her life. Or, if things go wrong, end it. But Emma is not the only one on the ward waiting - across the corridor another patient is going through the same process of blood tests, ECGs and health checks. For each transplant operation, two people on the transplant list are called in. One is a primary recipient, the other a backup. Both are evaluated to establish the best match for the precious organs. Staff do their best to ensure the patients don’t meet. A transplant could be derailed for many reasons. The donated organs may be in poor condition, they may not suit the recipient, or the patient might have an underlying illness. Something as innocent as a mild cold could be enough to halt the process.     It’s the tail end of 2018, and the last time Emma was on the ward was August. That time, she was carrying too much weight for the operation to go ahead safely. As on previous occasions, hopes had been raised, only to be dashed. When we meet her, she is downbeat, exhausted, her eyes puffy and smudged with dark rings. Emotionally, she seems flat - wrung-out and resigned. “When you know you’ve got to go home and carry on living the life you’re living, it’s hard,” she says. “How long can I carry on like this for? You go home and have a little cry out loud, and then you have one to yourself. You build your hopes up, and then nothing comes out of it.” Coming to the hospital full of hope, only to be sent home after hours of waiting, disappointed and frustrated, is taking its toll. Emma is on tenterhooks every day, hoping for the call. “After a year and a half, everyone else gets excited for you. ‘Oh yeah, you’ll get it this time,’ they say. But the more excited you get, the more of a fall you are going to have.” After all this waiting, will this finally be Emma’s time?     Shortly after 05:00, it is decided who will receive the organs. Once again, it will not be Emma. Her weight is fine, but surgeons have looked at the organs and feel they are a better match for the other patient. By this time, Emma is dozing on a bed on the ward. Staff decide it is kinder to let her sleep a little while longer, before gently breaking the news to her. Despite the counselling patients receive, and the compassion of the staff who have to break the bad news, it’s tough to take. “You just think, ‘Back to square one, start all over again.’ And then you think, ‘Can I do this again? Can I keep doing this?’” Emma’s wait for a suitable donor continues, but the strain is becoming unbearable. And all the time the 38-year-old’s health is slowly failing. Her kidney function - a measure of how her organs are coping - is about just 7%. Time is running out.         It’s the tail end of 2018, and the last time Emma was on the ward was August. That time, she was carrying too much weight for the operation to go ahead safely. As on previous occasions, hopes had been raised - only to be dashed.

Can I keep doing this?’” Emma’s wait for a suitable donor continues but the strain is becoming unbearable. And all the time the 38-year-old’s health is slowly failing. Her kidney function - a measure of how her organs are coping - is about just 7%. Time is running out.      Emma has type 1 diabetes. About 8% of people in the UK with diabetes have type 1. She was first diagnosed at the age of 10, the age her daughter is now. Emma had been feeling unwell but when her mother phoned the family doctor, she was told it was probably just a bug. “It got to the third day and I was very poorly.” Emma’s blood-sugar levels had soared, and when the doctor came out to see her, he said she needed to go to hospital straight away. “In the space of a couple of weeks, I lost a couple of stone in hospital and the doctor said I was close to being in a coma.”   That was the beginning of a life that would eventually be dominated by type 1 diabetes. It’s a condition that is not caused by diet or lifestyle, and despite years of research, it is still not clear why it happens. But it has a profound effect on the lives of those who have it. After being diagnosed, Emma needed to take insulin and to be very careful about what she ate, and when. And like many of those diagnosed not far off their teenage years, it was a real struggle. “You want to do what everyone else is doing. You want to go out, you want to enjoy life. You don’t tend to think, ‘I need to get up, I need to take my insulin, I need to eat the right food.’ That’s the last thing on your mind. You want to fit in.” With type 1, the body attacks the cells in the pancreas that produce insulin, the hormone that allows glucose in our blood to enter our body’s cells and provide us with fuel. The body still breaks down the carbohydrates in food and drink to glucose - or sugars - which enter the bloodstream, but in the absence of insulin these sugars have nowhere to go. The glucose builds up and over a prolonged period can damage the heart, eyes, feet and kidneys. By the time she reached her 20s, Emma was struggling. Her eyesight was affected and her weight had shot up to about 19 stone (121kg). Perhaps most seriously, her kidneys were under pressure, compounded by a series of infections. A gastric bypass helped get her weight under control and eased the strain on her kidneys, but gradually their performance started to deteriorate once again. Emma’s kidneys were in a bad way by the time she was in her late 30s. But with type 1 diabetes, simply having a kidney transplant would be only a temporary measure. She needed a new pancreas as well, so that her body could start producing the insulin it needed on its own. Without the pancreas, any new kidneys would just become damaged in the same way. Emma manages to hold down a 40-hour-a-week job as an office administrator,  despite the gruelling process of dialysis that now dominates her life. She started doing what is known as peritoneal dialysis in May 2017. It’s a process that helps her failing kidneys flush out the waste products from her body.   It involves her attaching a tube to a valve fitted in her stomach wall. The tube is then attached to a machine that pumps fluid into her stomach, causing it to swell up. “You feel your stomach getting bigger and bigger, because your peritoneal cavity is at the front of your stomach.” It makes moving around uncomfortable and sleeping difficult, she says. “It’s like you’ve eaten too much and you can’t move. You’ve got to try to sleep with that feeling. [Then] it drains out and starts again. You’ll have that feeling all night.” The fluid is then flushed out through another hose that trails across her bedroom floor and into the bathroom, where it empties into the toilet. The process is repeated four or five times a night - 10 litres of fluid altogether.      There is also a lot of infection control that needs to be done. Everything has to be cleaned with anti-bacterial wipes to make sure no germs get introduced. The machine makes a swooshing sound as it flushes the fluid in and out of Emma’s body. It will often sound an alarm during the night - if the hose gets a kink when Emma rolls over in her sleep, for example. It is an exhausting process. “I can’t remember the last time I had a decent night’s sleep,” says Emma.    “And then sometimes you just sit down and shout. And you’re like, ‘I’m shouting at a machine.’ You just get so annoyed with it. It just goes on and on.” There are also significant logistical challenges to carrying out dialysis at home. Emma must make sure she has adequate stocks of all the fluid packs, sterile wipes and other bits of kit that she uses every night. In her new-build house on a modern estate in Cheshire, an entire room is given over to storing the things she needs. But without dialysis, her kidneys will fail.   Emma relies heavily on her husband Lee to do the washing, cleaning and cooking. Her brother and sister are also available to help out. She does, however, try to do the school run in the morning before going to work - even though it means waking up really early to allow the fluid to drain from her body first. “My daughter’s been late a couple of times because I’ve just been stuck on my machine.” After a day at work, fighting off exhaustion, Emma struggles to fit in any family time. “I pick my daughter up, come back home and then go to bed for about four hours. Then I’ll get up for about an hour. I’ll prepare my machine and then I will plug up and I’ll go back to sleep. Some nights I may sit up for a couple of hours.”   Emma worries that managing her condition means that her daughter is missing out on things. But there is a deeper, nagging anxiety - that her daughter might have inherited diabetes. “My niece got it when she was 10, so it seems to be hereditary. You do think, ‘Is my child going to get this?’ I’ve always tried to keep her active. And you do try to push [the message], ‘Treat your body well, so you don’t end up like your mum.’” The dialysis, the phone calls, the waiting, the gnawing worry over her daughter. There is no escape. “I think I’m just existing. I’m not living. And it does get soul destroying, doing it day in and day out.” Dialysis will keep Emma going, but she is running out of road. Kidneys that are functioning at just 7% are not a long-term option. On average, a 35-year-old with diabetes and kidney failure stands to see their life shortened by about 25 years. Emma needs that transplant.   We first met Emma on a bright autumn afternoon in November 2017, when she had been on the organ transplant waiting list for just three months. At the time, she was one of 175 people in the UK waiting for both a pancreas and kidney. But they are just a small element of the wider UK organ waiting list. Each year about 6,000 people have their lives put on hold for want of a replacement heart, kidney, liver, lungs or bowel. Patients like Emma - who need a simultaneous kidney and pancreas transplant - have an average wait of just under a year. For those needing other organs, it can be much longer - an average of 706 days for a kidney and 1,085 for a non-urgent heart transplant - and many don’t make it. About 400 people die each year while waiting for an organ, with more than 700 a year taken off the list because they are no longer well enough for a transplant. So with more patients in need than organs on offer, how is the decision made to give those life-saving donations? It’s not just the people who have waited the longest. A range of complex medical and biological factors weigh in, most notably regarding the body’s immune system. Its job is to seek out and destroy foreign organisms - a welcome function when talking about bacteria or other pathogens, but a problem when an organ is being transferred from one person into another. The key to a successful transplant is finding a donor who is as biologically similar to the recipient as possible. Crucial to that match is a collection of markers on the outside of nearly all of our cells - HLAs (Human Leukocyte Antigens). They are like little flags that tell our immune systems which cells belong in our bodies and which don’t. An identical line-up of HLAs is extremely unlikely, but in kidney transplants, for example, doctors like to match at least a third of the key HLAs to be more confident of success. When Emma joined the transplant list, her blood group and HLA profile were put on file. Since then, every time a kidney and pancreas was donated, the blood group and HLA profile of the donor were compared to Emma’s. This and other factors - such as time on the waiting list, age difference between the donor and recipient, the rarity of HLA profile, and whether a patient’s immune system has developed antibodies to certain tissue types - all form part of the regularly revised algorithm that is used to match donor to recipient. When a new organ becomes available, the UK transplant computer system, rather than a human, combs through all those data points to produce the closest, and fairest, match. That search takes in the whole of the UK, which means organs could be matched to patients anywhere in the four nations, even though there are differences in the way donation systems operate. Wales and Jersey have moved to an opt-out system, which means everyone is presumed to be a donor unless they state on the register that they don’t want to donate. Elsewhere, there is an opt-in system – people need to sign the organ donor register if they want to donate. But England and Scotland will also switch this year, and Guernsey and the Isle of Man have plans to follow later. Northern Ireland is sticking to opt-in. The jury is still out on whether this move to what is sometimes called “presumed consent” will increase the number of organs available for transplant, as families will still have the last word on whether donation goes ahead. But the disparity in the maths is clear - with about 6,000 patients on the waiting list and just 3,941 transplants from UK deceased donors going ahead in 2018, there are not enough donors to meet the need.     A key factor is whether a person dies in circumstances suitable for donation. It is a common misconception that someone can be a donor regardless of how they die, for example at the side of the road in a traffic accident. Because of the fragility of our organs, death needs to have occurred in a controlled environment. As soon as a heart stops beating, blood and oxygen cease circulating around the body and its organs begin to deteriorate. For a kidney, ideally there is a window of up to 18 hours to remove the organ from the donor, transport it and transplant it into the recipient. For the heart it is just four hours. So, every donor will have been on an intensive care unit. For about 40% of patients, death will come when their heart has stopped beating - following either cardiac arrest or a planned withdrawal of life support. But most donations are from patients who are “brain-dead” - having suffered such a severe injury to their brain that they have permanently lost the potential for consciousness and the capacity to breathe on their own. A series of tests is carried out over 30 minutes - often in front of the family - to confirm the diagnosis. They include shining a light in the donor’s eyes, trying to induce a gag reflex, and seeing whether they are able to breathe unaided. Brain death is confirmed if the patient fails to respond to all of these tests. Only about 1% of the 600,000 people who die each year in the UK do so under conditions that would enable the organs to be used. The pool is already small, but if you add in lack of awareness about the dying patient’s wishes, the numbers shrink further.  Donating a loved one’s organs - NHS intensive care staff show the BBC the test for brain stem death and how families are approached for organ donation  Under all UK laws, families have the final say on donation. Fewer than half consent if they are unaware of their deceased relative’s views. Nine in 10 agree to donate when they know it was what the person wanted. There are concerns among medics and patient groups that the change to the new system, where a patient is presumed to have consented, could foster the belief that there is no need to sign the organ donation register, leaving even more families uncertain of their relative’s wishes. The organisation in charge of organ donation - NHS Blood and Transplant - is clear that if you want to donate, it is vital you sign the register and share your wishes with your family.       The renal transplant unit at the Manchester Royal Infirmary is the busiest in the country, with more operations than any other hospital in the UK. At the heart of the process is a relatively small team of transplant co-ordinators. All are experienced nurses and they act as the bridge between the patients and the hospital. One of them is Brian Kelly, a 42-year-old softly spoken Irishman who radiates a kind of calm compassion. It is he, or one of his colleagues, who will phone patients like Emma and let them know that a potential donor has been identified and that they should come into hospital. They are also often the ones who have to tell them when a transplant is not going ahead. But Brian says it helps that each patient is given counselling when they go on the transplant list. “It’s actually OK, because we’ve pre-empted everything. When I call somebody on the phone, I always say there’s a ‘potential’ offer, and this may be a dry run.” Brian says that when a patient is called in and then sent home, it increases their chances of getting another call soon.    The MRI has about 900 people on its transplant list, most of whom are waiting for a single kidney rather than the dual transplant Emma needs. Only 500 or so are what is called “active”. Some patients may be on holiday, others may need a break for personal or health reasons. But every day there are fresh cases to manage. It may come as a surprise to know that some patients will receive more than one transplant over the course of a lifetime. Brian, who has been working with the team for more than a decade, says that while some patients have kidneys that have lasted 30 years or more, the average is only 10 to 12 years. So he is beginning to see patients who he cared for when he first started on the post-operative ward.    For Brian, what matters even more than all the logistics that he carries out every day, is that human contact with patients. But there is always the knowledge that some may not make it. “It’s very depressing sometimes. A couple of young people recently passed away while waiting on the list. And someone came around for another transplant - a woman in her 30s. We knew the family, we saw her here for her first transplant, and unfortunately she passed away. “But [there have been] more highs than lows, without a doubt. Over the past 10 years, I have seen many people who have done so, so well, and who recognise and appreciate what we’ve done. “I think about the donors, as well. They’re not all people that have led very full lives. A lot of them are very young, and you are just very grateful.”      It’s a curious thing but most transplants seem to take place at night, or at least in the early hours of the morning. We are told this is when the operating theatres are most likely to be free for what can be long and complicated procedures. Just 10 days after Emma was last called in, only to be sent home again, she is back at the MRI on another cold, dark winter’s night. Once more she has packed a bag, said goodbye to Lee and her daughter, and headed off alone, unsure of what lies ahead. This is the 14th time she has been called with news of a potential donor. In contrast to the last time she was here, she is brighter and definitely more upbeat. Blood tests are under way to make sure she is in good health. There is a feeling that this time, things may be moving in the right direction. And soon the news Emma has been waiting for comes. Out there in the darkness, an ambulance is making its way through the rain towards Manchester, carrying with it a precious cargo of donor organs. At about 04:20 they arrive, the flashing blue light of the ambulance illuminating an otherwise deserted, rainswept hospital forecourt. The organs are taken quickly up to the transplant unit in what looks like a cool box. Forms are signed and the organs officially checked in at 04:26.   There are still a few hurdles to clear. The surgical team needs to be sure that the organs are a good match for Emma. Doctors also want to have a good look at the state they are in. Nearly two hours are spent delicately examining and repairing the kidney and pancreas. Extracting them from the donor can cause some damage. This time, there is intricate stitching to be done. Each organ sits in fluid in a shallow bowl, bathed by a pool of light from the bright surgical lamps that hang from the ceiling. Three doctors are hunched over them, talking to each other in low, controlled voices.         The whole procedure is overseen by consultant surgeon Raman Dhanda, who has been working for more than 15 years in transplant surgery. He feels the pancreas is the biggest cause for concern.      “It has quite a complex blood supply and we have to ensure that there’s no damage, and the blood vessels are properly reconstructed,” he says. “It’s a delicate organ by nature, so the main risk with the pancreas is the development of inflammation, a condition called pancreatitis. The more you touch it, the more likely the patient is going to get pancreatitis. “So we try not to touch it, but at the same time prepare it in a way that there are the fewest risk factors associated with the organs themselves.” There is less demand for the pancreas than other organs. The waiting list is one of the shorter ones, with just 250 people as of April 2019.  So with nearly 500 pancreases donated each year, you would expect the list to be cleared pretty quickly. But given how easily damaged it can become, more than half never make it into a patient. This means just 204 organs were transplanted in 2018, while about the same number of new patients joined the queue. Most people know what to expect when they see a kidney. Human kidneys are not that different, at least in external appearance, from those you might see in a butcher’s window. The pancreas resembles what you might imagine an alien from another world could look like – vaguely triangular, sort of ruffled around the edges, slightly bobbly, a creamy grey colour as it sits in its bowl of fluid. Eventually Dhanda is satisfied and the news is good. The organs look healthy. Emma is prepped for surgery.    It’s just after 06:00 when she goes into the operating theatre. Two anaesthetists check Emma’s vital signs to make sure she is unconscious but stable. Dhanda is there with two surgeon colleagues. Emma has been warned there is a risk she may not survive the surgery if something goes wrong. But the team is confident, calm, efficient. Surgeons begin what will turn out to be an operation lasting more than four and a half hours. The first incision into Emma’s abdomen is made at about 07:45.

The first incision into Emma’s abdomen is made at about 07:45.              “It’s a complex operation,” says Dhanda. “But it’s enjoyable because it needs a lot of surgical skills. Most of the time whilst you’re doing the operation, you’re just thinking about the benefit the patient is going to get straight away. “I’m very passionate about it. This operation is one of the most beautiful operations we can actually perform because it’s very different from other surgeries. You are giving something to the patient, rather than removing abnormal or pathological organs from a patient. At the time you’re just concentrating on getting the pancreas in right, as quickly as possible.”         The new organs will sit in the body alongside Emma’s existing ones. It takes a few hours to get to the point when they can be transplanted. First, the pancreas goes in, lifted carefully from its bed of ice. The tension in the room rises. This is a crucial moment. If the pancreas retains its creamy grey colour, something has gone wrong. There is palpable relief when, at about 09:20, the pancreas quickly turns a rosy pink, showing that blood is flowing through the organ as it should.       “It’s a complex operation,” says Dhanda. “But it’s quite an enjoyable because it needs a lot of surgical skills.

There is palpable relief when, at about 09:20, the pancreas quickly turns a rosy pink, showing that blood is flowing through the organ as it should.        Dhanda is pleased. “The patient is not requiring any insulin. The blood sugars are already falling. We would like [the pancreas] to be salmon pink, which you can see it is, so you can see it is functioning really well.”  The kidney is transplanted next. It will be a few hours before the operation is complete and Emma is taken to the intensive care unit, where she will spend several days recovering.   While the operation itself was a success, Emma experiences some complications. The new kidney is a bit reluctant to start working properly and there is a suspected bleed in her abdomen that involves a second investigative operation. She spends much longer in hospital than was originally expected and her recovery is long and slow. But essentially she has been cured - at least for the moment - of the type 1 diabetes that has plagued her life for nearly 20 years.   We catch up with Emma in the spring of 2019 in a park near her house. Although she is still recovering and is moving a little gingerly, the change in her is immediately obvious. “It’s been a long recovery,” she says. “But every day it has got better. Like any big operation, it’s a shock to the system. But in the long term, it’s going to be worth it.” And the diabetes is now a thing of the past, although it has left her with a legacy of poor eyesight and problems with her feet. As long as her new pancreas lasts, Emma can live a much more normal life. “I do feel like somebody that isn’t diabetic. Obviously, I’ve got complications that are hard because of the diabetes. Hopefully, I should get at least 10 years out of it. But sometimes things do last longer, sometimes shorter.”       Emma will have to take immunosuppressants - drugs to ensure her body doesn’t reject the transplanted organs - for the rest of her life. But so far, things are going well. She is gradually picking up the threads of her life and has been thinking about doing some of the things that her condition had made impossible. When we first met in 2017, one of the things that obviously weighed heavily on Emma was the impact on her family. So what about now? “I’ve got plans. I’d like to go on holiday and just live my life, instead of just existing. So now there’s nothing to stop me doing anything that I want to do - holidays, further my career, do something that I’ve not been able to do. “I want more time with my daughter. I can take her for her dance exams and things like that, which I wasn’t doing before.” Emma still needs to be careful about what she eats. Her body is relying on one new kidney, and it is possible that her kidney function will start to decline again. Her gratitude to the team in Manchester is genuine and heartfelt. “They’ve definitely done a fantastic job. They’ve been there for me. I can’t fault them at all. They are such a lovely team. And very, very supportive.” But there is also the selfless decision by one donor and their family. That person’s death gave Emma the gift of a new life. She doesn’t know who that person was, but the hospital provides support to transplant patients so they can write to the donors’ families to express their gratitude. So does she think about them? “Oh God, of course I do. It’s a grieving process, obviously, for the donor’s family. When you’re in that situation and you’ve lost somebody, it’s hard to think about organ donation.” Emma will be living with the consequences of the transplant for years to come. But if it wasn’t for the donor whose life ended prematurely, Emma’s story would also have been over far too soon.

"The rise in the number of deaths in the UK is being driven by fentanyl being added to heroin, a report says Deaths caused by the drug fentanyl are on the rise in the UK, a report warns. Deaths related to Fentanyl, a synthetic opioid considered to be 50 times more potent than heroin, rose from eight in 2008 to 135 in 2017,the report said,external. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) said the government should introduce controls to tackle the ""emerging threat"" the painkiller poses. The ACMD said a rise in the number of deaths in the UK is being driven by fentanyl being added to heroin. The drug was originally designed as a painkiller but has entered the illegal drug market. Synthetic opioids have been linked tothousands of US deaths. Its potency means that even small doses can be deadly. The ACMD, which advises ministers on drugs policy, said fentanyl-related deaths have risen in the UK despite the fact it is an illegal Class A substance. Fentanyl is an extremely strong painkiller, prescribed for severe chronic pain, or breakthrough pain which does not respond to regular painkillers. It is an opioid painkiller which means it works by mimicking the body's natural painkillers, called endorphins, which block pain messages to the brain. The risk of harm is higher if the wrong dose or strength is used. Typical symptoms of a fentanyl overdose include slow and difficult breathing, nausea and vomiting, dizziness and increased blood pressure. China to curb fentanyl after US plea Fentanyl bust 'enough to kill 26 million people' Opioid addiction mail-ordered to your door Dr Bowden-Jones said the introduction of fentanyl and other new opioid drugs into illegal UK markets was ""of great concern"". ""To respond to this emerging threat, we must carefully examine the lessons learnt in other countries, particularly the US and Canada, to understand and implement effective interventions,"" he added. The advisory group urged ministers to commission further research into strong opioids. The Home Office, which commissioned the ACMD report, said it would ""carefully consider"" the recommendations. A spokesperson said the Home Office has commissioned a major review of all drugs policy in an attempt to reduce the harm they cause.

"Boris Johnson was not warned about the US airstrike in Iraq that killed a top Iranian general, the BBC understands. The UK has 400 troops based in the Middle East and works alongside US forces in the region. But President Donald Trump did not tell the UK PM about the attack he orderedthat killed Qasem Soleimani on Friday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has asked Mr Johnson to confirm what the UK was told before the airstrike. In a letter to the prime minister, he asked whether, if it had been informed in advance, the government had expressed its opposition to the attack. He also requested an urgent meeting of theprivy councilto discuss the airstrike's consequences, and asked what the government was doing to ensure the safety of UK nationals.

Meanwhile Tory MP Tom Tugendhat said there was a ""pattern"" from the current White House not to share details with its allies, which was a ""matter of concern"". The former chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee added: ""I have long believed the purpose of having allies is so we can surprise our enemies, not each other."" The death of Gen Soleimani ""will certainly be a huge blow to the Iranian regime"", but will ""doubtless have consequences"" elsewhere, Mr Tugendhat told BBC News. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab did speak to US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday, although the time of the call is not known. Mr Pompeotweeted,externalthat he was ""thankful that our allies recognise the continuing aggressive threats posed by the Iranian Quds Force"". Mr Raab also issued a statement, urging ""all parties to de-escalate"" after the killing of Gen Soleimani. He said the UK ""recognised the aggressive threat"" Gen Soleimani posed, but ""further conflict is in none of our interests"". The Foreign and Commonwealth Office,externalhas warned British nationals to avoid any rallies, marches, or processions in Iran over the three days of national mourning the country has called for Gen Soleimani. As well as troops, there are around 400 British personnel based in Iraq - where the strike took place. The troops are there to train Iraqi forces tackling an Islamic State insurgency. BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner earlier said he did not think anyone in the UK was given an indication the air strike was going to take place, adding: ""My sense is this has caught the British government largely by surprise."" The killing of Gen Soleimani marks a major escalation in tensions between Washington and Tehran. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said ""severe revenge awaits the criminals"" behind the attack, but a statement from the Pentagon said Gen Soleimani ""was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said earlier that the ""US assassination"" was an ""extremely serious and dangerous escalation"". Mr Corbyn said the UK ""should urge restraint"" from both Iran and the US - and called for the government to ""stand up to the belligerent actions and rhetoric coming from the United States"". He added: ""All countries in the region and beyond should seek to ratchet down the tensions to avoid deepening conflict, which can only bring further misery to the region, 17 years on from the disastrous invasion of Iraq."" The acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, said Iran was governed by ""a brutal regime"", but accused President Trump of ""yet again radically and recklessly escalated tensions in an area where peace-keeping was already on a knife edge"". He called for an immediate statement from Boris Johnson about the UK's position, adding: ""The UK should not automatically follow whatever position the Trump administration takes, but work with a broader group of concerned states at the United Nations."" Other UK MPs have been reacting to the incident on Twitter. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said: ""For two years, I've warned about Trump's reckless lurch towards war with Iran. Last night's attack takes us even closer to the brink. ""Those of us who marched against the Iraq War must be ready to march again, and ensure we are not dragged into this morass."" Green Party MP Caroline Lucas called for the UK government to condemn the killing and ""work with colleagues in the US to counter Trump's reckless and dangerous foreign policy"". And the deputy leader of Northern Ireland's Alliance Party, Stephen Farry, said it was ""time for cooler heads"".

"This video can not be played Jordi Casamitjana says he's ""really really satisfied"" with the judge's ruling Ethical veganism is a ""philosophical belief"" and so is protected in law, a tribunal has ruled for the first time. The landmark legal case was brought by vegan Jordi Casamitjana, who claims he was sacked by the League Against Cruel Sports because of his ethical veganism. His former employer says he was dismissed for gross misconduct. The judge ruled that ethical vegans should be entitled to similar legal protections in British workplaces as those who hold religious beliefs. He is yet to rule on Mr Casamitjana's dismissal - which is due at a later date. Mr Casamitjana, 55, who lives in London, said he was ""extremely happy"" with the ruling - which is ongoing - adding that he hopes fellow vegans ""will benefit"". The tribunal centres on his claim that he was sacked by the animal welfare charity League Against Cruel Sports after disclosing it invested pension funds in firms involved in animal testing. Mr Casamitjana says when he drew his bosses' attention to the pension fund investments, they did nothing so he informed colleagues and was sacked as a result. The League Against Cruel Sports says it is ""factually wrong"" to link Mr Casamitjana's dismissal to his veganism. The charity did not contest that ethical veganism should be protected. A vegan is someone who does not eat or use animal products. Some people choose to simply follow a vegan diet - that is, a plant-based diet avoiding all animal products such as dairy, eggs, honey, meat and fish. But ethical vegans try to exclude all forms of animal exploitation from their lifestyle. For instance, they avoid wearing or buying clothing made from wool or leather, or toiletries from companies that carry out animal testing. Why are more people going vegan? ""Religion or belief"" is one of nine ""protected characteristics"" covered by the Equality Act 2010. The judge Robin Postle ruled that ethical veganism qualifies as a philosophical belief under the Equality Act 2010 by satisfying several tests - including that it is worthy of respect in a democratic society, not incompatible with human dignity and not conflicting with the fundamental rights of others. At the tribunal in Norwich on Friday, the judge said in his ruling that ethical veganism was ""important"" and ""worthy"" of respect in a democratic society. He said: ""I am satisfied overwhelmingly that ethical veganism does constitute a philosophical belief."" By BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman Though a ruling from an employment tribunal does not amount to binding legal precedent, this one will have important and far-reaching effects. Employers will have to respect ethical veganism and make sure they do not discriminate against employees for their beliefs. So, for example, could a worker on a supermarket checkout refuse to put a meat product through the till? The implications are considerable, not least because the legal protection will apply beyond employment, in areas such as education and the supply of goods and services. It could also encourage others to seek similar protection for their philosophical beliefs. While this is the first case concerning ethical veganism, a previous tribunal ruled that a strongly held belief in climate change amounted to a philosophical belief capable of protecting someone against discrimination in their employment. Speaking to the BBC outside the tribunal, Mr Casamitjana said he was ""extremely happy"". ""I'm really, really satisfied and I hope all the vegans out there that have been supporting me - there have been many helping me in my crowdfunding - I hope they now feel their little donation has been properly used and all the vegans will benefit."" He added: ""Veganism is a philosophical belief and when you look at my life and anybody else's life who is an ethical vegan, you will see it. ""This is a positive belief, it's not a negative belief. And therefore a positive belief is bound to be protected."" Mr Casamitjana supports a range of ethical and animal rights causes He added that he is ""passionate"" about veganism, which ""gives you hope"". Mr Casamitjana also said he was feeling ""optimistic"" for the ruling on his dismissal. Mr Casamitjana describes himself as an ethical vegan and campaigns to get his message to others. His beliefs affect much of his everyday life. He will, for instance, walk rather than take a bus to avoid accidental crashes with insects or birds. Peter Daly, the solicitor for Mr Casamitjana, said the ramifications of this judgement for companies that employ vegan staff are ""potentially significant"". He said any abuse directed at ethical vegans ""might be seen to be harassment in the same way a racist or sexist slur might be discriminatory action"". Acting for the League Against Cruel Sports, Rhys Wyborn, from the law firm Shakespeare Martineau, said: ""Although an interesting point of law, this hearing was preparation for the real crux of the matter: why Jordi Casamitjana was dismissed. ""In view of its animal welfare value, the League did not contest the issue of whether ethical veganism itself should be a protected belief, with the League maintaining that it's irrelevant to the core reason for the dismissal."" The tribunal will next consider whether Mr Casamitjana was treated less favourably because of his ethical veganism belief. Religion and belief is one of nine protected characteristics under the Equality Act. The others are age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity, race, sex and sexual orientation.

"Iran's missile capabilities are a key part of its military prowess Iran has launched more than a dozen missiles at two bases in Iraq housing US forces. It had vowed to retaliate after its most powerful military commander, General Qasem Soleimani, was killed by a US drone strike at Baghdad airport. So what do we know about Iran's military capabilities? Iran's missile systems are a key part of its military arsenal given its relative lack of air power. Regional rivals such as Israel and Saudi Arabia have the technology to carry out precision air strikes. Iran largely lacks this capability and so relies on launching missiles. A US Defense Department report describes the country's missile forces as the largest in the Middle East. It's not possible to give precise figures but the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies says Iran has thousands of missiles of more than a dozen different types. An Iranian media outlet reported that Fateh and Qiam missiles were used in the attack on the US base. Military analysts have also pointed to the use of these types based on images of the attack sites. The Qiam-1 missile has been widely produced since 2011, has a range of up 700km and a payload (an indication of how much explosive material it can carry) of 750kg.  It was used by Iran against IS fighters in June 2017. The Fateh class of missiles, which first went into service in the early 2000s, have a slightly lower payload. The variations of theShahab-3,externalintermediate range ballistic missile have payloads of more than 750kg and ranges upwards of 1,500km. For comparison, a US-built F35 fighter jet has a payload of up to 10,000kg. Iran has up to 50 medium range ballistic missile launchers and up to 100 short range ballistic missile launchers, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a UK-based think tank. Iran is also testing space technology to allow it to develop longer range inter-continental missiles, according to the US report. ""Iran has a highly developed missile force with weapons of a variety of ranges"" says Jonathan Marcus, the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. ""They are reasonably accurate - but not as accurate or as reliable as advanced western systems."" What is the Patriot missile defence system? The long-range missile programme was put on hold by Iran following the 2015 nuclear deal, according to the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), but this may now have resumedgiven the uncertainty surrounding that deal. In any case, many targets in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf would be within range of Iran's current short and medium-range missiles, and possibly targets in Israel as well. In May last year, the US deployed a Patriot anti-missile defence system to the Middle East as tensions with Iran increased. This is meant to counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. There are an estimated 523,000 active Iranian personnel, according to the IISS. This includes 350,000 in the regular army, and at least 150,000 in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). There are a further 20,000 service personnel in the IRGC's naval forces. This group operates a number of armed patrol boats in the Strait of Hormuz, the site of several confrontations involving foreign-flagged tankers in 2019. Seized British-flagged tanker leaves Iran The IRGC also controls the Basij unit, a volunteer force which has helped suppress internal dissent. This unit can potentially mobilise many hundreds of thousands of personnel. The IRGC has its own navy and air force, and oversees Iran's strategic weapons The IRGC was set up 40 years ago to defend the Islamic system in Iran and has become a major military, political and economic force in its own right. Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Top Iranian general killed by US in Iraq Despite having fewer troops than the regular army, it is considered the most authoritative military force in Iran. The Quds Force, which was led by General Soleimani, conducts secret operations abroad for the IRGC and reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It's believed to be about 5,000 strong. The unit has been deployed to Syria, where it advised military elements loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and armed Shia militias fighting with them. In Iraq, it has supported a Shia-dominated paramilitary force which assisted in the defeat of IS. However, the US says the Quds force has a wider role by providing funding, training, weapons and equipment to organisations that Washington has designated as terrorist groups in the Middle East. These include Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran's IRGC detained the British-flagged tanker the Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz in 2019 Economic problems and sanctions have hampered Iran's arms imports, which are relatively small compared to those of other countries in the region. The value of Iran's defence imports between 2009 and 2018 was equivalent to just 3.5% of Saudi Arabia's imports over the same period, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Most Iranian imports come from Russia, and the rest from China. Iran does not currently have a nuclear weapons programme, and has previously said it does not want one. But it does have many of the elements required and the knowledge to create a military nuclear capability. In 2015, the US government under President Obama estimated that Iran only needed two to three months to produce enough nuclear material to make a weapon. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Why do uranium enrichment limits matter? Is the Iran nuclear deal dead? The nuclear agreement that year between Tehran and six world powers - from which President Trump withdrew in 2018 -  introduced limits and international checks on Iran's nuclear activities. It aimed to make it more difficult and time consuming to develop weapons-grade material. Following the killing of General Soleimani by US forces, Iran has said it will not be bound by these restrictions. But it also says it will continue to co-operate with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. The US has accused Iran of supplying Houthi rebels with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Despite years of sanctions, Iran has also been able to develop drone capabilities. In Iraq, Iranian drones have been used since 2016 in the fight against IS. Iran has also entered Israeli airspace with armed drones operated from bases in Syria, according to Rusi. In June 2019, Iran shot down a US surveillance drone, claiming it had violated Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. The other aspect of Iran's drone programme is its willingness to sell or transfer its drone technology to its allies and proxies in the region, says Jonathan Marcus,the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. In 2019, drone and missile attacks damaged two key Saudi oil facilities. Both the US and Saudi Arabia linked these attacks to Iran, although Tehran denied any involvement and pointed to a claim of responsibility by rebels in Yemen. Following a major cyber-attack in 2010 on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran ramped up its own cyber-space capability. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) is believed to have its own cyber-command, working on commercial and military espionage. In 2012, US officials blamed Iran for a series of cyber attacks on US banks intended to disrupt traffic to their websites. A US military report in 2019 said Iran had also targeted aerospace companies, defence contractors, energy and natural resource companies and telecommunications firms for cyber-espionage operations around the world. Also in 2019, Microsoft said a hacker group that ""originates from Iran and is linked to the Iranian government""targeted a US presidential campaign and tried to break into the accounts of American government officials.,external Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.
