"The 27-year-old was arrested at a property in Selly Oak in the early hours of Monday A man has been charged with murder and seven counts of attempted murder, after a series of stabbings across Birmingham city centre. Zephaniah McLeod, aged 27, of Nately Grove, Selly Oak, is due in court on Wednesday, West Midlands Police said. Jacob Billington, 23, was killed and seven others injured at four locations over a period of 90 minutes on Sunday. Mr Billington, from Crosby, Merseyside, was stabbed in Irving Street while enjoying a night out with friends. A post-mortem examination concluded he died of a stab wound to the neck. Mr Billington had been working as a library intern at Sheffield Hallam University and was also a drummer in a band. A university spokesman said: ""Jacob was a Sheffield Hallam graduate and had joined the library as a graduate intern, where his warmth and enthusiasm made him a greatly valued member of our team. ""Our thoughts and condolences are with his family, friends and colleagues."" His friend, Michael Callaghan, also 23 and a fellow band-mate, was seriously injured in the attack in Irving Street and remains in hospital in a critical condition. Both men had previously attended Sacred Heart Catholic College in Crosby, where prayers were said on Monday evening for their families. In a statement, the school said: ""We are saddened at the events in Birmingham which took Jacob's life and left Michael critically injured. ""We are praying for Michael's recovery and will never forget Jacob, his life touched so many in our school."" Jacob Billington, who was out with friends, was stabbed to death in Birmingham A 22-year-old woman, attacked in Hurst Street, remains critical but stable in hospital. Another man, aged 30, remains in a serious condition in hospital, while four others have been discharged. Det Ch Insp Jim Munro said: ""Since these tragic events unfolded in the early hours of Sunday morning we've had a team of officers working non-stop on the investigation. ""Our driving focus is to secure justice for the victims, their family and friends. Our sympathies remain with everyone who's been impacted by these terrible crimes."" Three people arrested early on Monday at an address in Selly Oak on suspicion of assisting an offender have all been released pending investigation, police said.

"Final clinical trials for a coronavirus vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University, have been put on hold after a participant had a suspected adverse reaction in the UK. AstraZeneca described it as a ""routine"" pause in the case of ""an unexplained illness"". The outcome of vaccine trials is being closely watched around the world. The AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine is seen as a strong contender among dozens being developed globally. Oxford coronavirus vaccine triggers immune response How close to developing a vaccine are we? What drugs can help treat coronavirus? Hopes have been high that the vaccine might be one of the first to come on the market, followingsuccessful phase 1 and 2 testing,external. Its move to Phase 3 testing in recent weeks has involved some 30,000 participants in the US as well as in the UK, Brazil and South Africa. Phase 3 trials in vaccines often involve thousands of participants and can last several years. The New York Times is reporting a volunteer in the UK trial has been diagnosed with transverse myelitis,external, an inflammatory syndrome that affects the spinal cord and can be caused by viral infections. However, the cause of the illness has not been confirmed and an independent investigation will now work out if there was any link to the vaccine. At first glance this may seem alarming.  A vaccine trial - and not just any vaccine, but one receiving massive global attention - is put on hold due to a suspected serious adverse reaction.  But such events are not unheard of.  Indeed the Oxford team describe it as ""routine"".  Any time a volunteer is admitted to hospital and the cause of their illness is not immediately apparent it triggers a study to be put on hold. This is actually the second time it has happened with the Oxford University/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine trial since the first volunteers were immunised in April.  An Oxford University spokesperson said: ""In large trials, illnesses will happen by chance but must be independently reviewed to check this carefully."" A final decision on restarting the trial will be taken by the medical regulator the MHRA, which could take only days.  But until then all international vaccination sites, in the UK, Brazil, South Africa and the USA are on hold. The Oxford University team believe this process illustrates that they are committed to the safety of their volunteers and the highest standards of conduct in their studies. Wellcome Trust director Sir Jeremy Farrar, an expert in infectious disease control, said there were often pauses in vaccine trials and it was important any adverse reactions were taken seriously. ""It is crucial that all that data is shared openly and transparently because the public must have absolute trust that these vaccines are safe and effective and, in the end, will hopefully bring the pandemic to a close,"" Sir Jeremy added. UK experts have said a temporary pause could be seen as a good thing because it showed the researchers are prioritising the safety of vaccine above everything else. People can develop side-effects from taking any drug but they can also fall ill naturally. US President Donald Trump has said he wants a vaccine available in the US before 3 November's election, but his comments have raised fears that politics may be prioritised over safety in the rush for a vaccine. On Tuesday, a group of nine Covid-19 vaccine developers sought to reassure the public by announcing a ""historic pledge"" to uphold scientific and ethical standards in the search for a vaccine. AstraZeneca is among the nine firms who signed up to the pledge to only apply for regulatory approval after vaccines have gone through three phases of clinical study. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? Industry giants Johnson & Johnson, BioNTech, GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Merck, Moderna, Sanofi and Novavax are the other signatories. They pledged to ""always make the safety and well-being of vaccinated individuals our top priority"". Short cuts and 'dirty tricks' in the scramble for a vaccine How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? The World Health Organization (WHO) says nearly 180 vaccine candidates are being tested around the world but none has yet completed clinical trials. The organisation has said it does not expect a vaccine to meet its efficacy and safety guidelines in order to be approved this year because of the time it takes to test them safely. Similar sentiments have been shared by Thomas Cueni, director-general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers. The industry body represents the companies that signed the pledge. Despite this, China and Russia have begun inoculating some key workers with domestically developed vaccines. All of them are still listed by the WHO as being in clinical trials. Meanwhile, the US national regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has suggested that coronavirus vaccines may be approved before completing a third phase of clinical trials. Last week it also emerged that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had urged states to consider waiving certain requirements in order to be ready to distribute a potential vaccine by 1 November - two days before the 3 November presidential election. Although President Trump has hinted that a vaccine might be available before the election, his Democratic rival Joe Biden has expressed scepticism that Mr Trump will listen to scientists and implement a transparent process.

"The boy was shot at about 08:40 BST on the Grange Farm estate in Kesgrave A teenager has been charged with attempted murder and firearms offences after a schoolboy was shot. The victim was shot at about 08:40 BST on the Grange Farm estate in Kesgrave, Suffolk, on Monday. The Year 11 Kesgrave High School pupil is in a critical condition. A 15-year-old boy from the Woodbridge area, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has been charged with attempted murder and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life. He has also been charged with possession of a firearm with intent to cause fear of injury. The boy has been remanded in custody and will appear via video link before Norwich Magistrates' Court on Wednesday. Officers conducted a thorough search of the area around Friends Walk The victim sustained serious injuries and was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. Friends Walk was reopened earlier on Tuesday following the completion of police searches in the area. Police said a ""long-barrelled gun"" had been recovered. Police said a large police presence would remain in the area A police spokesman said officers would ""continue to engage with school children, teachers, parents and local residents to provide reassurance"". ""The constabulary will also have a police pod located in Through Jollys that will provide a strong visible presence to local people,"" the spokesman added. Supt Kerry Cutler said: ""Everybody is shocked, Kesgrave is on the outskirts of Ipswich, it is almost a semi-rural area, it's very much a residential area, this is not something we've seen in that area before and people will be impacted by it.

"This video can not be played Brandon Lewis says Northern Ireland customs rules legislation do âbreak international law in a very specific and limited wayâ A government minister has said a new bill to amend the UK's Brexit deal with the EU will ""break international law"". Concerns had been raised about legislation being brought forward which could change parts of the withdrawal agreement, negotiated last year. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis conceded it would go against the treaty in a ""specific and limited way"". Former PM Theresa May warned the change could damage ""trust"" in the UK over future trade deals with other states. The permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department, Sir Jonathan Jones, has announcedhe is resigning from government in light of the bill, making him the sixth senior civil servant to leave Whitehall this year. Sir Jonathan, who is the government's most senior lawyer, is understood to have believed the plans went too far in breaching the government's obligations under international law. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer condemned the bill and accused No 10 of ""reopening old arguments that had been settled"", saying the ""focus should be on getting a [trade] deal done"" with the EU. Brexit is back - and likely to get louder 'One train of thought in DUP' on NI Protocol What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? No 10 revealed on Monday that it would be introducing anew UK Internal Market Billthat could affect post-Brexit customs and trade rules in Northern Ireland. Downing Street said it would only make ""minor clarifications in extremely specific areas"" - but it worried some in Brussels and Westminster that it could see the government try to change the withdrawal agreement, which became international law when the UK left the EU in January. The row also comes at the start of the eighth round of post-Brexit trade deal talks between the UK and the EU. The two sides are trying to secure a deal before the end of the transition period on 31 December, which will see the UK going onto World Trade Organisation rules if no agreement is reached. Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Coveney, called Mr Lewis' comments ""gravely concerning"", adding: ""Any unilateral departure from the terms of the withdrawal agreement would be a matter of considerable concern and a very serious step."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says planned government legislation over Northern Ireland is âwrongâ The UK's chief Brexit negotiator, Lord David Frost,called for ""realism"" from his EU counterparts, saying he would ""drive home our clear message that we must make progress this week if we are to reach an agreement in time"". The EU said it would ""do everything in [its] power to reach an agreement"" with the UK, but ""will be ready"" for a no-deal scenario. On Monday, Boris Johnson said if a deal hadn't been done by the time the European Council meets on 15 October, the two sides should ""move on"" and accept the UK's exit without one. Shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, said it was ""deeply concerning"" that the prime minister ""appeared to be undermining the legal obligations of his own deal"" with the introduction of the new law while the negotiations are taking place. The text of the new bill will not be published until Wednesday, although the government has confirmed it will deal with the issue of the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol - an element of the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland after Brexit. The practicalities of the protocol - which will deal with issues of state aid (financial support given to businesses by governments) and whether there needs to be customs checks on goods - is still being negotiated by a joint UK and EU committee. But Mr Lewis said the bill would take ""limited and reasonable steps to create a safety net"" if the negotiations failed. Speaking during an urgent question on the bill, chair of the Justice Committee and Tory MP Bob Neill said the ""adherence to the rule of law is not negotiable"". He asked Mr Lewis: ""Will he assure us that nothing proposed in this legislation does or potentially might breach international obligations or international legal arrangements?"" The Northern Ireland secretary replied: ""Yes. This does break international law in a very specific and limited way."" He said the government was still working ""in good faith"" with the EU joint committee to overcome its concerns for the future of trade in Northern Ireland, but said there was ""clear precedence for UK and indeed other countries needing to consider their obligations if circumstances change"". Sir Bob later told BBC Radio 4's PM the decision was ""troubling"", adding: ""Britain is a country which prides itself on standing by the rule of law... whether it is inconvenient or convenient for us. ""Whatever we seek to do, if we find something we signed up to 'inconvenient', I am afraid this doesn't mean we can renege on our contract... as that would damage our reputation long term."" This was an extremely unusual statement - a minister standing up in Parliament to say the government is planning to break international law. Brandon Lewis told the House of Commons that ""there are clear precedents for the UK and other countries needing to consider their international obligations as circumstances change"". That may suggest, says Catherine Barnard, professor of law at the University of Cambridge, that the government is looking at Article 62 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which enables a state to get out of its treaty obligations when circumstances change radically. But those changed circumstances have to be pretty dramatic - something like the dissolution of Yugoslavia, when a recognised country ceases to exist. In the case of the Northern Ireland Protocol, it is less than a year since the government negotiated the treaty in full knowledge of the sensitivity of the situation. And if the government does go ahead with legislation which appears to contradict the withdrawal agreement? ""There is a chance,"" says Prof Barnard, ""that the EU will decide to trigger the dispute resolution mechanism in the withdrawal agreement, which could lead to arbitration and a case before the European Court of Justice."" Theresa May - who stood down as prime minister last year after her own Brexit deal failed to get the support of Parliament - said: ""The United Kingdom government signed the withdrawal agreement with the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""This Parliament voted that withdrawal agreement into UK legislation. The government is now changing the operation of that agreement."" ""How can the government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs?"" The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, also called it a ""sad and shocking state of affairs for our country"". This video can not be played BBC Reality Checkâs Chris Morris looks at where the UK and EU are struggling to agree on their future relationship Sammy Wilson, who acts as Brexit spokesman for the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, said he was ""pleased"" to have the new bill that could deal with some of the issues that could affect his constituents - such as state aid and customs checks. But he said the DUP had ""warned ministers of the impact of the withdrawal agreement"" early on, saying it was a ""union splitting, economy destroying and border creating agreement that has to be changed and replaced"". He added: ""We will judge this bill on whether it delivers on these kind of issues."" However, Claire Hanna, a Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MP for Belfast South, said the protocol was ""a symptomâ¦ of four years of terrible political decision making"". She added: ""It is now the law. This government is obliged to implement it in full."" She also ""cautioned"" Mr Lewis ""not to use the threat of a border on the island of Ireland or the hard won impartiality of the Good Friday Agreement as a cat's paw in this or any other negotiation."" But former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, said the act that brought the withdrawal agreement into law in the UK allowed the government to ""reserve the right to make clarifications under the sovereignty clause"". Mr Lewis agreed, saying the law would ""clarify... the points about what will apply in January if we are not able to get satisfactory and mutually suitable conclusions"" in negotiations. He added: ""It is reasonable and sensible to give that certainty and clarity to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland.""

"The government's most senior lawyer is to quit his post over plans which could modify the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It is understood Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department, was unhappy with a new bill to be unveiled on Wednesday. He has resigned and will leave his post before his five-year term was due to end next April. He is the sixth senior civil servant to announce his exit this year. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Sir Jonathan believed the plans went too far in breaching the government's obligations under international law. A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office confirmed Sir Jonathan had resigned but did not comment further. Minister: New bill will 'break international law' Chief civil servant sacked after exams row No 10 must honour NI protocol, say Remain parties The Financial Times, whichfirst reported the story,external, linked his departure to ""suggestions that Boris Johnson is trying to row back on parts of last year's Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland"". The newspaper added people ""close to Sir Jonathan said he was 'very unhappy' about the decision to overwrite parts of the Northern Ireland protocol"". The resignation comes as the UK government is due to unveil an Internal Market Bill that could affect post-Brexit customs and trade rules in Northern Ireland. Under the UK's exit deal, Northern Ireland is due to stay part of the EU's single market for goods in a bid to avoid creating a hard border with the Irish Republic. In parallel with talks over a post-Brexit trade deal, the UK and EU are negotiating the precise nature of new customs checks that will be required. On Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the bill would provide the UK with a ""safety net"" in case the talks to iron out border arrangements fail. He told MPsthe bill would break international law in a ""very specific and limited way"" by giving UK ministers the power to override EU law in ""tightly defined circumstances"" if border negotiations broke down. But he insisted the UK's ""leading priority"" was to try to work out the application of the protocol through negotiation with the EU. Whether you loathe the government's abrasive style or love its ruthlessness, far from seeking a peaceful conclusion to Brexit, for No 10 there are plenty of fights still to have. And that may mean accelerating the number of top civil servants who are cleared out - or clear off of their own volition. Six permanent secretaries - who head government departments - have gone now. Given the importance of the principle of the rule of law, one former permanent secretary told me Jonathan Jones' departure is ""absolutely massive, by far the most important yet"". And few at Westminster believe there won't be more to come. Read more from Laura here. Sir Jonathan is the latest permanent secretary - a senior civil servant leading a government department - to leave office this year. Rowena Collins Rice, director general at the Attorney General's Office, will also be leaving her post, the government confirmed earlier on Tuesday. This video can not be played Sir Kim Darroch: ""The idea that you could unilaterally rewrite part of the agreement is just unacceptable"" She is expected to take up a new public role. Her departure was the result of a ""process dating back several months,"" officials said. At the beginning of September, Simon Case was appointed as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service,after his predecessor Sir Mark Sedwill stood down. Sir Mark's exit followedreports of tensions between him and senior members of Mr Johnson's team. Sir Jonathan, who is a QC, was knighted in December 2019 for his legal services to the government. The honour recognised his work on constitutional issues and the EU Withdrawal Agreement. In response to Sir Jonathan's resignation, the shadow attorney general, Lord Charlie Falconer, said he was ""an impressive lawyer and a loyal civil servant"". He added: ""If he can't stay in public service, there must be something very rotten about this government. This resignation indicates that senior government lawyers think that the government is about to break the law."" Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson Christine Jardine said it was ""unsurprising"" Sir Jonathan has resigned, given the government's approach. ""Any government figure of any integrity would be appalled at these plans,"" she added. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union - which represents senior civil servants - said both ministers and officials were obliged to uphold the rule of law. ""It's extraordinary that the government's most senior legal adviser has decided he has no choice but to resign over an issue that he presumably believes conflicts with his own and ministerial obligations,"" he added.

"This video can not be played A resident and a shopkeeper share their thoughts on how new lockdown measures will affect them Caerphilly has gone into lockdown, becoming the first county in Wales to face tougher restrictions following a spike in Covid-19 cases. No-one is allowed to leave the countywithout good reason, with stricter measures brought in from 18:00 BST. Family and friends living apart are no longer able to meet indoors, stay overnight, or form extended households. A senior police officer said Gwent Police was not planning to introduce roadblocks or cordons during lockdown. Ch Supt Mark Hobrough said neighbourhood officers would talk to motorists and visit shops and businesses to ensure everyone was aware of the new rules, with enforcement the ""last objective"". ""We really do want the community to work with us in relation to this to be able to combat this infection and fight it off as soon as possible,"" he said. The health minister said the restrictions would last until at least October, with a review in a fortnight. Vaughan Gething said the case rate had risen to 72.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people - the highest rate in Wales and one of the highest in the UK. The county, which has a population of 181,000, has had 132 people test positive in the last week. Meanwhile, he said a UK-wide testing programme being used in Waleswas facing ""challenges"" in meeting demand. What does the lockdown mean for Caerphilly? What do the stats tell us in Wales? 'Horrific' queues in Caerphilly as people 'rush' for Covid tests Mr Gething said he had been forced to act due to the increase in cases, after ""social distancing had broken down in large parts"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that testing in Caerphilly found 4% of people were positive for coronavirus: ""If we had testing positivity rates of 4% [across Wales], I think we would be into national lockdown."" This video can not be played Mixed reaction as Caerphilly placed under lockdown Ahead of the latest figures, analysis by the BBC suggested Caerphilly had moved into the top 10 of hardest-hit local areas in the UK over the past week. It was ranked at about the same level as Birmingham, Burnley, Rochdale and Salford. Bolton was top (122 cases per 100,000), followed by Bradford, Blackburn and Oldham. Caerphilly has also seen one of the largest jumps in its case rate, compared to the previous week. It has had more new cases in the past week - 132 - than anywhere else in Wales and more than the area has seen since the end of April. Mr Gething said: ""If we don't address the issue in Caerphilly, we'll see wider community transmission within the Caerphilly area but that will spread to other areas as well. ""We're in this position largely because social distancing has broken down and in particular people are socialising in each other's households in larger numbers."" He said not addressing the problem now could have ""national consequences"" and appealed for people to follow the rules: ""It's for you, your family and the whole community."" The changes come into effect throughout the county borough at 18:00 BST on Tuesday Mr Gething said significant transmission ""isn't taking place in pubs"" but an element of it was people coming back from European travel, along with mixing with others in their homes, including house parties of up to 30 people. People with reasonable causes, like needing to move house, could still leave the borough, he said, ""but going from Caerphilly to Cardiff for a night out or to go to the gym isn't covered"". ""If things deteriorate faster we may have to take more measures,"" he added, saying he ""won't hesitate"" to make it mandatory to wear face-coverings across Wales if necessary. ""We're in it for several weeks at least in Caerphilly. We expect the rate to rise in the next few days because community transmission has already taken place."" The lockdown would be reviewed in two weeks, the Welsh Government said. Addressing the weekly coronavirus briefing at lunchtime, Mr Gething expressed fears coronavirus in younger people could ""leap into"" more vulnerable and older groups of people. ""Over the summer, we've seen an increase in the number of cases in people under 40 in Wales."" ""At the moment it appears coronavirus is likely to be a milder illness for most people in this age group,"" he added, saying there is usually a lag of a couple of weeks before people are admitted to hospital. Targeted testing had been carried out in Caerphilly and would be starting in the lower Rhondda valley where there was also a rise in cases, he said. Mr Gething outlined how 13 cases of the virus were connected to a single trip to Ibiza taken by a group of friends last month: ""Three of them came home with coronavirus. When they came home, one of the group passed the virus on to their partner and his father. ""Another person in the group had a party the day after coming home and four people caught coronavirus. ""One of these then passed the virus on to their brother who then passed it to a friend by sharing a car.

The high street is busy, shops are open and town centre car parks are full as people continue to go about their business. There is a visible rise in the wearing of masks. Many shoppers are choosing to wear face coverings ahead of them being implemented in certain situations.

""There's more people wearing masks here than there has been in a long, long time"" he says. ""I can see the difference here,"" he said.

""I think the town will probably collapse unless the government give businesses more help again she says"". Sarah Bruton says people have been anxious about going out post-lockdown in her experience Sarah Bruton, manager of Captiva Spa, said the spike showed Covid-19 was going to be ""part of our lives for a very long time"".

We've started to make plans to see family, to book holidays, in my case to rebuild our business and that's going to be taken away again,"" she added. Michael Roberts stopped allowing customers inside his restaurant last week Michael Roberts, who runs Urban Bar BQ in Caerphilly town centre, closed his restaurant for indoor service on Thursday and is just offering takeaway.

More than 1,600 people have been tested in Caerphilly county in the past week Caerphilly Labour Member of the Senedd Hefin David said more than 600 people messaged him on Monday asking for clarity on what the lockdown meant for things like gyms, leisure centres and hairdressers and moving to halls of residence. ""I am just trying to answer as many people's questions as I can,"" he told BBC Wales, adding that students would be fine to go off to university as it was classed as moving out of the borough.

"The government's most senior lawyer is to quit his post over plans which could modify the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It is understood Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department, was unhappy with a new bill to be unveiled on Wednesday. He has resigned and will leave his post before his five-year term was due to end next April. He is the sixth senior civil servant to announce his exit this year. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Sir Jonathan believed the plans went too far in breaching the government's obligations under international law. A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office confirmed Sir Jonathan had resigned but did not comment further. Minister: New bill will 'break international law' Chief civil servant sacked after exams row No 10 must honour NI protocol, say Remain parties The Financial Times, whichfirst reported the story,external, linked his departure to ""suggestions that Boris Johnson is trying to row back on parts of last year's Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland"". The newspaper added people ""close to Sir Jonathan said he was 'very unhappy' about the decision to overwrite parts of the Northern Ireland protocol"". The resignation comes as the UK government is due to unveil an Internal Market Bill that could affect post-Brexit customs and trade rules in Northern Ireland. Under the UK's exit deal, Northern Ireland is due to stay part of the EU's single market for goods in a bid to avoid creating a hard border with the Irish Republic. In parallel with talks over a post-Brexit trade deal, the UK and EU are negotiating the precise nature of new customs checks that will be required. On Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the bill would provide the UK with a ""safety net"" in case the talks to iron out border arrangements fail. He told MPsthe bill would break international law in a ""very specific and limited way"" by giving UK ministers the power to override EU law in ""tightly defined circumstances"" if border negotiations broke down. But he insisted the UK's ""leading priority"" was to try to work out the application of the protocol through negotiation with the EU. Whether you loathe the government's abrasive style or love its ruthlessness, far from seeking a peaceful conclusion to Brexit, for No 10 there are plenty of fights still to have. And that may mean accelerating the number of top civil servants who are cleared out - or clear off of their own volition. Six permanent secretaries - who head government departments - have gone now. Given the importance of the principle of the rule of law, one former permanent secretary told me Jonathan Jones' departure is ""absolutely massive, by far the most important yet"". And few at Westminster believe there won't be more to come. Read more from Laura here. Sir Jonathan is the latest permanent secretary - a senior civil servant leading a government department - to leave office this year. Rowena Collins Rice, director general at the Attorney General's Office, will also be leaving her post, the government confirmed earlier on Tuesday. This video can not be played Sir Kim Darroch: ""The idea that you could unilaterally rewrite part of the agreement is just unacceptable"" She is expected to take up a new public role. Her departure was the result of a ""process dating back several months,"" officials said. At the beginning of September, Simon Case was appointed as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service,after his predecessor Sir Mark Sedwill stood down. Sir Mark's exit followedreports of tensions between him and senior members of Mr Johnson's team. Sir Jonathan, who is a QC, was knighted in December 2019 for his legal services to the government. The honour recognised his work on constitutional issues and the EU Withdrawal Agreement. In response to Sir Jonathan's resignation, the shadow attorney general, Lord Charlie Falconer, said he was ""an impressive lawyer and a loyal civil servant"". He added: ""If he can't stay in public service, there must be something very rotten about this government. This resignation indicates that senior government lawyers think that the government is about to break the law."" Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson Christine Jardine said it was ""unsurprising"" Sir Jonathan has resigned, given the government's approach. ""Any government figure of any integrity would be appalled at these plans,"" she added. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union - which represents senior civil servants - said both ministers and officials were obliged to uphold the rule of law. ""It's extraordinary that the government's most senior legal adviser has decided he has no choice but to resign over an issue that he presumably believes conflicts with his own and ministerial obligations,"" he added.

"The legislation would give the UK government powers to spend cash on infrastructure in Wales Plans for a new law giving the UK government more powers to spend in Wales have been published. TheInternal Market Bill,externalwould transfer powers from the EU to the UK government to spend on areas such as economic development, infrastructure and sport. The Welsh Government accused its UK counterpart of ""stealing powers"" from devolved governments. But UK ministers said the law would allow them to replace existing EU funding programmes. From next year, powers which had been held by the EU will be transferred to the governments around the UK. Q&A: Could UK government build an M4 relief road? Welsh Tory quits frontbench over PM's union stance Minister: New bill will 'break international law' The UK government says the draft law is aimed at ensuring trade within the United Kingdom can continue ""unhindered"" under these new arrangements. Much attention has been focused on the fact that the legislation could override key elements of UK ministers' Brexit deal with Brussels,in breach of international law. In addition, the legislation will give ministers in Whitehall powers to spend money to replace EU funding programmes on areas that would otherwise be devolved to the Welsh Government. The new spending powers include infrastructure, economic development, culture, sport, and support for educational, training and exchange opportunities. A senior UK government cabinet minister insisted the powers would ""drive our economic recovery from Covid-19 and support businesses and communities right across the UK"". Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, said: ""These new spending powers will mean that these decisions will now be made in the UK, focus on UK priorities and be accountable to the UK Parliament and people of the UK."" Michael Gove said the powers would ""drive our economic recovery from Covid-19"" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said it was ""vital"" that seamless trade continued between the four nations, and that ""investment must continue to flow unhindered"". But the Welsh Government Minister for European Transition Jeremy Miles said the powers would ""sacrifice the future of the union by stealing powers from devolved administrations."" First Minister Mark Drakeford said the bill ""provides ammunition to those people who would favour the breakup of the United Kingdom"". ""I'm in favour of a UK Common Market and I'm in favour of a UK-wide state aid regime, but the proposals in the white paper are absolutely not the right way to go about it,"" he told Sky News. Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said: ""This bill is the single biggest assault on devolution since its creation."" Speaking to the BBC later on Wednesday, Mr Hart said he found it ""pretty strange"" that Labour Welsh ministers and Plaid Cymru objected to UK government plans to spend money in Wales. ""Seems to me they're more anxious about protecting their little political clique in Cardiff than they are actually doing something about economies we tried to recover from Covid and move on from Brexit,"" he said.

"Harry Harvey, an experienced walker, has now been reunited with family and friends An 80-year-old hiker who went missing for three days in the Yorkshire Dales has spoken at a press conference arranged in a bid to track him down. Harry Harvey spent three nights wild camping after becoming separated from a walking group between Gunnerside and Tan Hill, North Yorkshire, on Saturday. A major search took placeincluding police, the RAF and rescue dogs. He was spotted by a wildlife photographer on Tuesday morning, who saw him waving at her near Keld. Mr Harvey was about six miles (10km) from where he was last seen. He was then taken by Land Rover to the nearby Tan Hill Inn, where he was reunited with family and friends at the press conference. This video can not be played The moment Mr Harvey was reunited with family at the Tan Hill Inn Speaking to journalists Mr Harvey, from Tynemouth in Tyne and Wear, said: ""I just got separated by getting caught in a really heavy hailstorm, a howling gale of wind. ""By the time I got my kit on it was getting really dark, so I missed what I would say was a turning. I had a plan B straight away, find somewhere safe to camp, put my tent up, keep warm, and that was it. ""The biggest problem I had was getting to Tynemouth from Keld, because I only had Â£21.05 in my pocket."" More stories from around Yorkshire Mr Harvey said he had ""three good nights wild camping"". ""The place where we got separated was absolutely desolate, there was no chance of putting a tent up that's for sure, so I had to find somewhere safe, which is what I did."" Mr Harvey said he was never worried as he had ""all the kit and all the training"", adding he would rather not have the attention which he said was ""not my scene at all"". The experienced hiker, who was reported missing on Sunday afternoon, said he could see search teams but did not realise they were looking for him. Mr Harvey went missing in an area between Gunnerside Gill (pictured) and Tan Hill His family said the past three days had been ""torture"" and they could not put the worry they had into words. ""We know he is experienced, but not three nights, that's taking it a little bit to the extreme,"" they said. Insp Mark Gee, from North Yorkshire Police, said: ""This is fantastic news. I want to thank all the search volunteers for their time, as well as gamekeepers, estate owners, farmers and local residents for their help and understanding. ""Thanks also to the Tan Hill, who looked after the volunteers and Mr Harvey's family."" Annette Pyrah, the photographer who found him, said she cried when she realised it was Mr Harvey. ""I was out taking photographs of grouse and instead of grouse I found Harry,"" she said. ""I had passed Tan Hill with a very heavy heart because I knew he hadn't been found and I thought after three days he's not going to be found. It was quite upsetting to see the police and sniffer dogs. ""I just looked up at the fell and this gentleman waved at me. I got out of my car and I said, 'Are you Harry? Have you been missing for three days?' And he said yes. And I started crying."" Ms Pyrah said he had a nasty bump on the head where he had fallen into a stream, but apart from that he was fit and well. ""I got him some help for his head and he rang his wife, which was the main thing,"" she said. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Hundreds were injured in the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert Only one paramedic was at the scene of the Manchester Arena bombing for the first 40 minutes after the explosion, an inquiry into the attack was told. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a suicide bomb as 14,000 fans left the arena in May 2017. The inquiry heard the sole paramedic had arrived in the arena foyer 18 minutes after the bomb went off. But at least eight ambulances had arrived nearby after 40 minutes. Lead counsel Paul Greaney QC said the public inquiry would have to consider whether lives were lost as a result of a failure to co-ordinate the response of emergency services. Within 10 minutes of the bomb exploding at 22:31 BST, 12 British Transport Police (BTP) officers had run into the arena foyer carrying first aid. Casualties were carried out on makeshift stretchers and only one actual stretcher was used on the night of the attack. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? The final person was evacuated from the City Room - where the bombing happened - at 23:40 on a stretcher ""made of cardboard and a crowd control barrier"". The bombing after an Ariana Grande concert killed 22 people and injured hundreds more The inquiry also heard how John Atkinson, who was killed in the bombing, was only evacuated from the scene 46 minutes after the blast on a makeshift stretcher to a triage area nearby. He remained there for another 24 minutes but chest compressions were only started on him one hour and 15 minutes after he was first injured in the blast. ""The issue of John Atkinson's survivability is, as we shall explore, a significant issue for the inquiry to consider,"" Mr Greaney added. The inquiry was told BTP had primary responsibility for policing in the arena foyer and Greater Manchester Police (GMP) was not aware ""at an organisational level"" of the Ariana Grande concert. ""On the face of it that may seem surprising,"" Mr Greaney added. He said BTP had ""primacy"" in this area due to the proximity of Victoria Station and the inquiry must consider whether that affected preparedness for any terror attack. The inquiry will, among other things, look at the emergency response to the attack ""There is a legitimate question about whether it was appropriate that BTP, who specialise in the railways, should take the lead,"" he added. Following the blast, BTP declared a major incident at 22:39 but they did not communicate this to GMP and there was no attempt to integrate communications at the arena. The inquiry heard the BTP officer, who thought he was acting as operational commander, was in Blackpool when the bomb went off. He took a taxi to Manchester but ""by the time he arrived the need for an immediate response had long since passed"". Mr Greaney said it appeared ""no one acted as a BTP operational commander for the policing response to the bombing"". GMP did not declare a major incident until 01:00 on 23 May, the inquiry heard. Arena bomber drew suspicion ahead of blast The second day of the hearing was told there had been multi-agency exercises rehearsing for a terror attack, including one in 2016 for an incident at the Trafford Centre. Mr Greaney said ""experts have expressed serious concerns about whether the necessary lessons were learned from it"". The hearings will take place in a room specially converted from two courtrooms at Manchester Magistrates' Court Another exercise, held in July 2016, rehearsed for an attack in the City Room at the arena - the exact scene of the attack in May 2017. The inquiry is seeking to establish whether BTP took part in that exercise. The first fire engine, which had stretchers, arrived at Manchester Arena two hours and six minutes after the explosion. ""An important issue for the inquiry to investigate will be how that came to pass and whether it made any difference,"" Mr Greaney added. But he told the inquiry it was ""important we acknowledge the pressure that those who responded were under"". ""The inquiry process must not be used to vilify those who did their best on the night but made mistakes and could have done better,"" he added. CCTV caught Salman Abedi in the arena foyer just seconds before he blew himself up BTP officer Jessica Bullough, who was first to enter the foyer, described the scene of the attack as like a ""war zone"". Two minutes after the explosion, PC Bullough radioed through, saying ""it's definitely a bomb - people are injured - at least 20 casualties"". She then ""made the first of a number of requests for ambulances"". The inquiry was told that 24 minutes later another officer radioed to control, saying ""you're going to hate me - where's our ambulances please?"". Control replied, saying ""we don't know. We're calling them again"". The public inquiry follows a trial in which a jury found Hashem Abedi guilty of helping his older sibling to plan the atrocity. He wasjailed for at least 55 yearson 20 August for the 22 murders. The chairman of the inquiry Sir John Saunders will make a report and recommendations once all the evidence has been heard, which is expected to take up to six months.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran, has been told she has to face another trial. The charity worker is nearing the end of her five-year sentence for spying charges, which she has always denied. Iranian state media said she was brought before a revolutionary court in the country's capital Tehran on Tuesday morning. The Foreign Office said the new charge, which has not been made public, was ""indefensible and unacceptable"". Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 while travelling to visit her parents with her young British-born daughter, Gabriella. The dual national was sentenced to five years in prison over allegations of plotting to overthrow the Iranian government, which she denies. What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Earlier this year,she was given temporary leave from prisonbecause of the coronavirus outbreak and has been living at her parents' house with an ankle tag. Before her arrest, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe lived in London with her husband Richard. Her MP, Tulip Siddiq, said she had spoken to Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe. ""I've been in touch with Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and can confirm that she was taken to court this morning and told she will face another trial on Sunday,"" she said. ""I know many people are concerned about her welfare and I'll keep everyone updated when we have more information. ""This is an extremely worrying development, and I know many people are concerned about Nazanin's welfare."" This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffeâs husband describes how his daughter Gabriella is coping without her mother The MP added: ""The last four years have been excruciating for her husband Richard and her daughter Gabriella, who is growing up without a mother. ""The United Nations have recognised Nazanin's imprisonment as arbitrary and unlawful, and any further court case is clearly unacceptable."" Mr Ratcliffe has previously expressed fears that she could face a second court case when her sentence ends. He said she and other dual nationals are being held hostage because Iran wants the UK to pay a decades-old debt over an arms deal that was never fulfilled. This video can not be played Why one mother's personal plight is part of a complicated history between Iran and the UK (video published August 2019 and last updated in October 2019) The human rights group, Amnesty International, said it appeared Iranian authorities were ""playing cruel political games with Nazanin"". ""Nazanin has already been convicted once after a deeply unfair trial, and there should be no question of her being put through that ordeal again,"" the charity's UK director Kate Allen said. ""As a matter of absolute urgency the UK government should make fresh representations on Nazanin's behalf, seeking to have any suggestion of a second trial removed."" Nazanin's prison leave extended Be tougher with Iran, Nazanin's husband urges PM Nazanin's daughter returns to UK Iran country profile The Foreign Office said in a statement: ""Iran bringing new charges against Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe is indefensible and unacceptable. We have been consistently clear that she must not be returned to prison."" Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt tweeted: ""Nazanin has already served most of her sentence for a crime she didn't commit. ""This is hostage diplomacy and Iran needs to know that Britain will not stand for it."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family and the UK government have always maintained her innocence and she has beengiven diplomatic protection by the Foreign Office- meaning the case is treated as a formal, legal dispute between Britain and Iran.

"Supermarket chain Morrisons is to make thousands of temporary staff permanent as a surge in demand for online deliveries fuelled by the coronavirus pandemic continues. Iceland also says that it has taken on thousands of staff. Rivals such as Tesco are hiring more staff to support internet shopping after the lockdown accelerated the shift from visiting stores to online. Morrisons' decision coincides with a rise incoronavirus cases in the UK. The UK's fourth-biggest supermarket chain is expected to announce the move on Thursday. Morrisons had about 97,000 workers before the pandemic and took on 45,000 extra temporary staff during the coronavirus crisis. About 25,000 of those staff are still working for the supermarket, and more than 6,000 have already been given permanent jobs. Tesco's 16,000 jobs drive to reward lockdown temps Amazon to create 7,000 UK jobs Coronavirus: 300,000 redundancies planned in June and July Morrisons is expected to announce on Thursday - when it publishes its interim results - that it plans to make thousands more temporary positions permanent in the coming weeks. A spokesperson said: ""Morrisons has been playing its full part in feeding the nation and that has required the largest recruitment drive our company has ever seen."" Since March, supermarkets have seen a huge increase in demand, especially for online deliveries. Out of those 25,000 extra staff, Morrisons uses 9,000 to pick and deliver to deal with the surge in online demand. As well as its own delivery service, Morrisons also partners Amazon and Deliveroo, and recently announced that customers could do a full Morrisons food shop on Amazon UK. Extra staff have also been needed in Morrisons supermarkets to keep them running properly, and to make sure the supermarkets conform to coronavirus safety guidelines. Supermarket chain Iceland said on Tuesday that it will have created more than 3,000 jobs between March this year and Christmas to cope with demand for home deliveries. It said that lockdown in particular had boosted online orders, and that demand ""shows no sign of slowing down as the weather shifts over the coming weeks and months"". It is also increasing its delivery fleet by just under a third. Iceland added that it was partnering with UberEats in London to make deliveries from its Hackney store. The closure of many High Street shops during the pandemic helped to drive up online sales, and for some firms that demand has continued. Tesco said in August that it would create 16,000 new permanent jobs after ""exceptional growth"" in its online business. Amazon said last week that it would create a further 7,000 jobs this year to meet growing demand. In June, delivery firm DPD and B&Q owner Kingfishersaid they would be hiring thousands more staff. However, many more thousands of people have lost their jobs in the UK. Data obtained by the BBC showed that British employers planned more than 300,000 redundancies in June and July, And the government's Job Retention Scheme, which has protected 9.6 million jobs throughout the coronavirus lockdown, is due to come to an end in October.

"Fortnite and Apple have been locked in legal battle since August Apple has fired back against claims by the maker of the Fortnite game that its control of the App Store gives it a monopoly. In a response to the August lawsuit filed by Epic Games, Apple called those arguments ""self-righteous"" and ""self-interested"". It denied that its 30% commission was anti-competitive and said the fight was ""a basic disagreement over money"". Apple also said Epic Games had violated its contract and asked for damages. The filing is the latest in a legal battle that started last month, after Fortnite offered a discount on its virtual currency for purchases made outside of the app, from which Apple receives a 30% cut. In response, Apple blocked Epic's ability to distribute updates or new apps through the App Store, and Epic sued, alleging that Apple's App Store practices violate antitrust laws. The court allowed Apple's ban on updates to continue as the case plays out, but the existing version of Fortnite still works, as does Epic's payment system. Apple had said it would allow Fortnite back into the store if Epic removed the direct payment feature to comply with its developer agreement. But Epic has refused, saying complying with Apple's request would be ""to collude with Apple to maintain their monopoly over in-app payments on iOS."" Microsoft backs Epic in Apple row Apple faces two EU anti-competition probes In its filing, Apple said Epic has benefited from Apple's promotion and developer tools, earning more than $600m (Â£462m) through the App Store. Apple accused the firm, which it noted is backed by Chinese tech giant Tencent, of seeking a special deal before ultimately breaching its contract with the update. ""Although Epic portrays itself as a modern corporate Robin Hood, in reality it is a multi-billion dollar enterprise that simply wants to pay nothing for the tremendous value it derives from the App Store,"" it said in the filing. The legal battle between the two companies comes as Apple faces increased scrutiny of its practices running the App Store. At a hearing in Washington over the summer, politicians also raised concerns that Apple's control of the app store hurt competition. The European Union is also investigating,externalwhether Apple's App Store practices violate competition rules. Apple has denied those claims, arguing that its App Store has made it easier and cheaper for developers to distribute products.

"Shoppers in Caerphilly, which is subject to a local lockdown Expect to see the prime minister back at the lectern, possibly with one of his top scientific advisers, once again, urging the population to take care. It won't mark the beginning of another national lockdown. Nor will it be the start of a new draconian regime. But do expect to hear the prime minister emphasising the need for the public to follow the existing rules - being careful about social contact with people, isolating if ill, and (what seemed in the early days almost quaint advice in the face of a distant threat), to wash your hands. And there will be a reduction in the numbers of people who are allowed to gather in groups indoors and outdoors in England from 30 down to six. The reason for what may seem like a change of tone from the PM? Simple, the government is worried. Bolton restrictions tightened amid rise in cases What are the local lockdown rules? UK faces 'impossible balancing act' In the last four or five days there has been a significant rise in the number of coronavirus cases. It's not a gradual gentle drift upwards, but a sharp and obvious spike. The rate of positive tests is going up particularly among the 17-21s, but noticeable too among people in their 40s. And rather than appearing to be only a problem in particular areas, the increase is relatively consistent across the country - 79 local authorities in England, for example, reported weekly case rates above 20 per 100,000. Those factors mean there is deep concern in Number 10 that the statistics could be flagging the beginning of a generalised second wave of the pandemic. It's important to say, the death rate is still very low. This could be the beginnings of a surge that has very different outcomes to the last terrible toll. But in the early stages of the pandemic, the government had precious little information about what was going on. Since the early spring, a lot of effort has gone across government to gathering data to monitor how the disease is spreading. An early warning system was created, and it is flashing red. There is a huge amount of guesswork about why the increase might be occurring, but there is no settled view on the specific factors. There is some evidence that some people who test positive are not always isolating. And as we can all see in daily life, there is a gradual but noticeable increase in people being out and about. And simply, more contacts mean more risk of spread of the disease. So as the health secretary has done in recent days, the government is likely on Wednesday to focus on trying to choke off the rise in cases. The recent zeal to get as many people as possible back to work may slightly fade. But millions of people in the last couple of months have had a taste of life returning to normal. Persuading people again to comply fastidiously to the rules won't be an easy task.

"Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are relaxing some of the rules around gatherings and mixing with others which were introduced to tackle the spread of Omicron. However, some restrictions remain. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announceda further easing of Covid rules. From Friday 28 January, the requirement for physical distancing in indoor settings where people don't have to wear a face covering - such as those leading religious services - will reduce to 1m (3ft) from 2m (6 ft). Most of the rules governingindoorandoutdoorevents have already been lifted. Covid passports arerequired for nightclubs and large events. All restrictions at outdoor events have now been lifted. On 28 January, nightclubs will reopen, and the so-called ""rule of six"" - where gatherings in pubs and restaurants are limited to six people - will be scrapped. Some restrictions will remain in place: social distancing of 2m (6ft) in all premises open to the public and workplaces, where reasonable licensed premises must take additional measures to protect customers and staff, including table service and collecting contact details face coverings are required in hospitality settings, apart from when seated vaccine passports continue to berequired for venues including restaurants, bars and cinemas Pubs and other hospitality venues now no longer have to offer table service only, and the ""rule of six"", governing the size of groups in hospitality venues, has been scrapped. From Wednesday 26 January: Proof of Covid status ""encouraged"" but no longer legally required for entry to bars, restaurants or cinemas Nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, with dancing and unseated indoor events allowed again - Covid passports will remain in use for these venues (and for partially seated events with 500 or more people in attendance) Some rules remain in place: a maximum of 30 people from an unlimited number of households can meet indoors in domestic settings shops must take ""reasonable measures to manage risk"" and shoppers are asked to maintain physical distance with each other where possible. face coverings are compulsory in shops, indoor seated venues and visitor attractions, public transport and some other settings Thecurrent restrictions in Englanddon't include any limits on socialising - so friends and family are legally allowed to see each other in private houses, or to meet in public places like pubs and nightclubs.

"EU negotiator Michel Barnier arrives in London for talks The government will later publish plans which could override key elements of its Brexit deal with Brussels, in breach of international law. The Internal Market Bill will set out how powers currently held by the EU will be shared out after the post-Brexit transition period ends. But it has faced a backlash from senior Tories and prompted the resignation of a top civil servant. It comes as the talks over a trade deal with the EU continue in London. The Internal Market Bill could override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement that secured the UK's exit from the EU in January. Minister: New bill will 'break international law' Ministers unveil post-Brexit powers for UK nations Fresh row over devolved powers after Brexit What do I need to know about Brexit now? Ministers say it is needed to prevent ""damaging"" tariffs on goods travelling from the rest of the UK to Northern Ireland if negotiations with the EU on a free trade agreement fail. But senior Conservatives have warned it risks undermining the UK's reputation as an upholder of international law. Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, said the UK would ""lose the moral high ground"" if the government went through with the changes. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee said: ""Our entire economy is based on the perception that people have of the UK's adherence to the rule of law."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock insisted the changes were necessary to protect the Northern Ireland peace process if the UK failed to get a free trade deal with the EU. ""The decision we've made is to put the peace process first, first and foremost as our absolute top international obligation,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. A former Cabinet minister, involved in putting together the Withdrawal Agreement, reacted furiously to Mr Hancock's claim. The former minister, who did not want to be named, told the BBC: ""I cannot allow anyone to get away with saying the government is doing this to protect the peace process. This does the precise opposite. ""It is about the internal market in the UK and is more likely to lead to a hard border [between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland] which will imperil the peace process."" The permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department, Sir Jonathan Jones, hasresigned from his roleover concerns about the government breaching its obligations under international law. This video can not be played Brandon Lewis has said the bill contains powers that would break international law. In the Commons on Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis admitted the bill would break international law in a ""very specific and limited way"". It would allow the UK government to ""dis-apply"" the EU legal concept of ""direct effect"" - which gives EU law supremacy over UK law in areas covered by the Withdrawal Agreement - in ""certain, very tightly defined circumstances,"" he told MPs. The Scottish government, meanwhile, has said it will not consent to a change in the law along these lines, arguing that it would undermines devolution. The bill has also been attacked by the Welsh Brexit minister, Labour's Jeremy Miles, who accused the government of ""stealing powers from devolved administrations"". ""This bill is an attack on democracy and an affront to the people of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland,"" he added. The legislation will see Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland handed powers in areas such as air quality and building efficiency currently regulated at EU level. It will also set up a new body - the Office for the Internal Market - to make sure standards adopted in different parts of the UK do not undermine cross-border trade. The new body will be able to issue non-binding recommendations to the UK Parliament and devolved administrations when clashes emerge. However, plans to hand UK ministers extra powers to ensure the application of customs and trade rules in Northern Ireland have prompted a row over the UK's legal obligations in its exit deal. Under the UK's withdrawal agreement, Northern Ireland is due to stay part of the EU's single market for goods in a bid to avoid creating a hard border with the Irish Republic. In parallel with talks over a post-Brexit trade deal, the UK and EU are negotiating the precise nature of new customs checks that will be required. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has accused Downing Street of ""reopening old arguments that had been settled"" and said the government should instead focus on securing a deal with the EU. Former Conservative PM Theresa May warned the legislation could damage ""trust"" in the UK over future trade deals with other states. Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Coveney, called Mr Lewis's comments ""gravely concerning"". And French MEP Nathalie Loiseau said: ""The prime minister has promised to put a tiger in the tank in the negotiations. It seems for the time being he is putting an elephant in the china shop.""

"Harry Harvey, an experienced walker, has now been reunited with family and friends An 80-year-old hiker who went missing for three days in the Yorkshire Dales has spoken at a press conference arranged in a bid to track him down. Harry Harvey spent three nights wild camping after becoming separated from a walking group between Gunnerside and Tan Hill, North Yorkshire, on Saturday. A major search took placeincluding police, the RAF and rescue dogs. He was spotted by a wildlife photographer on Tuesday morning, who saw him waving at her near Keld. Mr Harvey was about six miles (10km) from where he was last seen. He was then taken by Land Rover to the nearby Tan Hill Inn, where he was reunited with family and friends at the press conference. This video can not be played The moment Mr Harvey was reunited with family at the Tan Hill Inn Speaking to journalists Mr Harvey, from Tynemouth in Tyne and Wear, said: ""I just got separated by getting caught in a really heavy hailstorm, a howling gale of wind. ""By the time I got my kit on it was getting really dark, so I missed what I would say was a turning. I had a plan B straight away, find somewhere safe to camp, put my tent up, keep warm, and that was it. ""The biggest problem I had was getting to Tynemouth from Keld, because I only had Â£21.05 in my pocket."" More stories from around Yorkshire Mr Harvey said he had ""three good nights wild camping"". ""The place where we got separated was absolutely desolate, there was no chance of putting a tent up that's for sure, so I had to find somewhere safe, which is what I did."" Mr Harvey said he was never worried as he had ""all the kit and all the training"", adding he would rather not have the attention which he said was ""not my scene at all"". The experienced hiker, who was reported missing on Sunday afternoon, said he could see search teams but did not realise they were looking for him. Mr Harvey went missing in an area between Gunnerside Gill (pictured) and Tan Hill His family said the past three days had been ""torture"" and they could not put the worry they had into words. ""We know he is experienced, but not three nights, that's taking it a little bit to the extreme,"" they said. Insp Mark Gee, from North Yorkshire Police, said: ""This is fantastic news. I want to thank all the search volunteers for their time, as well as gamekeepers, estate owners, farmers and local residents for their help and understanding. ""Thanks also to the Tan Hill, who looked after the volunteers and Mr Harvey's family."" Annette Pyrah, the photographer who found him, said she cried when she realised it was Mr Harvey. ""I was out taking photographs of grouse and instead of grouse I found Harry,"" she said. ""I had passed Tan Hill with a very heavy heart because I knew he hadn't been found and I thought after three days he's not going to be found. It was quite upsetting to see the police and sniffer dogs. ""I just looked up at the fell and this gentleman waved at me. I got out of my car and I said, 'Are you Harry? Have you been missing for three days?' And he said yes. And I started crying."" Ms Pyrah said he had a nasty bump on the head where he had fallen into a stream, but apart from that he was fit and well. ""I got him some help for his head and he rang his wife, which was the main thing,"" she said. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"This video can not be played A resident and a shopkeeper share their thoughts on how new lockdown measures will affect them Caerphilly has gone into lockdown, becoming the first county in Wales to face tougher restrictions following a spike in Covid-19 cases. No-one is allowed to leave the countywithout good reason, with stricter measures brought in from 18:00 BST. Family and friends living apart are no longer able to meet indoors, stay overnight, or form extended households. A senior police officer said Gwent Police was not planning to introduce roadblocks or cordons during lockdown. Ch Supt Mark Hobrough said neighbourhood officers would talk to motorists and visit shops and businesses to ensure everyone was aware of the new rules, with enforcement the ""last objective"". ""We really do want the community to work with us in relation to this to be able to combat this infection and fight it off as soon as possible,"" he said. The health minister said the restrictions would last until at least October, with a review in a fortnight. Vaughan Gething said the case rate had risen to 72.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people - the highest rate in Wales and one of the highest in the UK. The county, which has a population of 181,000, has had 132 people test positive in the last week. Meanwhile, he said a UK-wide testing programme being used in Waleswas facing ""challenges"" in meeting demand. What does the lockdown mean for Caerphilly? What do the stats tell us in Wales? 'Horrific' queues in Caerphilly as people 'rush' for Covid tests Mr Gething said he had been forced to act due to the increase in cases, after ""social distancing had broken down in large parts"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that testing in Caerphilly found 4% of people were positive for coronavirus: ""If we had testing positivity rates of 4% [across Wales], I think we would be into national lockdown."" This video can not be played Mixed reaction as Caerphilly placed under lockdown Ahead of the latest figures, analysis by the BBC suggested Caerphilly had moved into the top 10 of hardest-hit local areas in the UK over the past week. It was ranked at about the same level as Birmingham, Burnley, Rochdale and Salford. Bolton was top (122 cases per 100,000), followed by Bradford, Blackburn and Oldham. Caerphilly has also seen one of the largest jumps in its case rate, compared to the previous week. It has had more new cases in the past week - 132 - than anywhere else in Wales and more than the area has seen since the end of April. Mr Gething said: ""If we don't address the issue in Caerphilly, we'll see wider community transmission within the Caerphilly area but that will spread to other areas as well. ""We're in this position largely because social distancing has broken down and in particular people are socialising in each other's households in larger numbers."" He said not addressing the problem now could have ""national consequences"" and appealed for people to follow the rules: ""It's for you, your family and the whole community."" The changes come into effect throughout the county borough at 18:00 BST on Tuesday Mr Gething said significant transmission ""isn't taking place in pubs"" but an element of it was people coming back from European travel, along with mixing with others in their homes, including house parties of up to 30 people. People with reasonable causes, like needing to move house, could still leave the borough, he said, ""but going from Caerphilly to Cardiff for a night out or to go to the gym isn't covered"". ""If things deteriorate faster we may have to take more measures,"" he added, saying he ""won't hesitate"" to make it mandatory to wear face-coverings across Wales if necessary. ""We're in it for several weeks at least in Caerphilly. We expect the rate to rise in the next few days because community transmission has already taken place."" The lockdown would be reviewed in two weeks, the Welsh Government said. Addressing the weekly coronavirus briefing at lunchtime, Mr Gething expressed fears coronavirus in younger people could ""leap into"" more vulnerable and older groups of people. ""Over the summer, we've seen an increase in the number of cases in people under 40 in Wales."" ""At the moment it appears coronavirus is likely to be a milder illness for most people in this age group,"" he added, saying there is usually a lag of a couple of weeks before people are admitted to hospital. Targeted testing had been carried out in Caerphilly and would be starting in the lower Rhondda valley where there was also a rise in cases, he said. Mr Gething outlined how 13 cases of the virus were connected to a single trip to Ibiza taken by a group of friends last month: ""Three of them came home with coronavirus. When they came home, one of the group passed the virus on to their partner and his father. ""Another person in the group had a party the day after coming home and four people caught coronavirus. ""One of these then passed the virus on to their brother who then passed it to a friend by sharing a car. Another party guest passed it on to their sister, who in turn infected a friend on a night out"". The local lockdown was announced on Monday, giving people less than 24 hours to prepare for the changes. Under the new restrictions,listed at the Welsh Government website,external: People cannot enter or leave Caerphilly county borough - which includes Caerphilly town, Ystrad Mynach, Blackwood, Newbridge and Risca - without a ""reasonable excuse"" Everyone over the age of 11 will need to wear a face covering in shops Friends and family are not allowed to meet indoors or stay overnight Extended households will not be able to meet up A reasonable excuse for travel includes for work, if you are not able to work from home, to go to school, or to give care. People attend marriages and funeral services outside the county if they are invited, but are not allowed to go to receptions or wakes. Residents can move house, and continue childcare arrangements where parents are not living together. Schools, pubs, bars and restaurants will remain open. The rules will be kept under review, the first on 10 September and then again in the following 21 days. The council and the police will have responsibility for enforcement, with fixed penalty notices of Â£60 for a first offence, doubling on each subsequent offence. Gwent Police chief constable Pam Kelly said officers would be out in the community encouraging people to follow social distancing and the new regulations coming into force. ""Today we will be working to understand the new guidance and regulations and what enforcement action we can take for the few who do not comply with the new restrictions,"" she added. People leaving a bus in Caerphilly While they may be just hours away from a return to lockdown shoppers in Caerphilly have not hesitated to get out and stock up ahead of tonight's deadline. The high street is busy, shops are open and town centre car parks are full as people continue to go about their business. There is a visible rise in the wearing of masks. Many shoppers are choosing to wear face coverings ahead of them being implemented in certain situations. The shift has not been lost on local residents like, Roger Williams made a last-minute trip to the bank ahead the rule changes. ""There's more people wearing masks here than there has been in a long, long time"" he says. ""I can see the difference here,"" he said. For shopkeepers like Joe Thomas the prospect of another downturn in business is a real threat to the town. ""I think the town will probably collapse unless the government give businesses more help again she says"". Sarah Bruton says people have been anxious about going out post-lockdown in her experience Sarah Bruton, manager of Captiva Spa, said the spike showed Covid-19 was going to be ""part of our lives for a very long time"". ""It's going to be really tough for a lot of people. We've started to make plans to see family, to book holidays, in my case to rebuild our business and that's going to be taken away again,"" she added. Michael Roberts stopped allowing customers inside his restaurant last week Michael Roberts, who runs Urban Bar BQ in Caerphilly town centre, closed his restaurant for indoor service on Thursday and is just offering takeaway. ""We're feeling that hopefully this is a step which will take us in the right direction towards getting over it,"" he said. More than 1,600 people have been tested in Caerphilly county in the past week Caerphilly Labour Member of the Senedd Hefin David said more than 600 people messaged him on Monday asking for clarity on what the lockdown meant for things like gyms, leisure centres and hairdressers and moving to halls of residence. ""I am just trying to answer as many people's questions as I can,"" he told BBC Wales, adding that students would be fine to go off to university as it was classed as moving out of the borough. ""The biggest questions are about childcare,"" he added. Community testing started in the county borough at the weekend. A total of 450 people were tested and 19 were found positive. People will not be able to enter or leave Caerphilly county without good reason One class of 21 pupils at St Gwladys Primary School in Bargoed must stay at homeafter a member of staff tested positive for the virus, although the school remains open. Caerphilly RFC has closed for two days for deep cleaning after a member who was at the club on Saturday tested positive. Elsewhere, the Eden Centre said it was closing its soft play centres in Caerphilly and Blackwood due to the rise in cases. Meanwhile, Great Western Railway has confirmed a member of staff in south Wales has tested positive for Covid-19, but has not specified where. Close contacts of the person are self-isolating, the company said. No train services have been affected as a result of the diagnosis. Giri Shankar, of Public Health Wales, appealed to everyone in the Caerphilly area to use a local testing unit at the town's leisure centre if they were experiencing ""even the mildest"" of symptoms or feeling ""generally unwell with no explanation"".

"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock says the new rule will help prevent a second peak Social gatherings of more than six people will be illegal in England from Monday - with some exemptions - amid a steep rise in coronavirus cases. The law change will ban larger groups meeting anywhere socially indoors or outdoors, the government said. But it will not apply to schools, workplaces or Covid-secure weddings, funerals and organised team sports. It will be enforced through a Â£100 fine if people fail to comply, doubling on each offence up to a maximum of Â£3,200. The new rules - which come into force on 14 September - mark a change to England's current guidance. At present, the guidance says two households of any size are allowed to meet indoors or outdoors, or up to six people from different households outdoors. Until now the police have had no powers to stop gatherings unless they exceeded 30. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will give further details of the changes at a Downing Street news conference at 16:00 BST on Wednesday, alongside senior advisers Prof Chris Whitty and Sir Patrick Vallance. What are the new rules for meeting my friends? Five reasons rise in Covid cases is not all it seems ""One of the pieces of feedback we had including from the police was that we needed the rules to be super simple so that everybody knows what they are,"" said Health Secretary Matt Hancock. ""And now this will now be rigorously enforced by the police."" This video can not be played One and two metre social distancing - what does it look like? Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast: ""This is really simple. Gatherings are ok, they should be socially distanced of course, but groups only of up to six."" He said it means that some families will not be able to see both grandparents at the same time. ""You know, I have three children,"" he said. ""We have a family of five. And so we'll be able to see one other person at a time, as a whole family."" Challenged on whether the new rules could stop grandparents helping out with childcare, Mr Hancock said: ""I'm not actively trying to do that"". But he said the government is ""quite worried about"" the ""very serious problem"" of children potentially passing on the virus to older grandparents. Matt Hancock said the rules would be in place for the ""foreseeable future"". ""I really hope we can turn this round before Christmas. I think that, in a pandemic, Christmas is a long way off,"" he told BBC Radio 4. ""Three months is a long time in a pandemic and I very much hope this strong rule, together with the local action we've taken in places like Bolton... I very much hope therefore this can work to do that by Christmas."" THE NAKED SCIENTISTS:Where did COVID-19 come from? THE SECRET LIFE OF TEACHERS:What's it like returning to classrooms amid a global pandemic? Mr Hancock was also asked about testing, afterpeople with symptoms struggled to access testingin recent days. ""Unfortunately we have seen this quite sharp rise in the last couple of weeks of people without symptoms who don't have a good reason coming forward and getting a test,""he said,saying 25% of people who were getting a coronavirus test were not eligible. ""I've even heard stories of people saying 'I'm going on holiday next week therefore I'm going to go get a test'. No. That's not what the testing system is there for."" Social gatheringsof more than six peoplein England will not be allowed in lawfrom Monday 14 September The new ruleapplies to people in private homes, indoors and outdoors, and places such as pubs, restaurants, cafes and public outdoor spaces Itapplies to all ages The ruledoes not apply to schools and workplaces, or weddings, funerals and organised team sports A full list of exemptionsis due to be published before the law changes Peoplewho ignore policecould be fined Â£100 - doubling with each offence to a maximum of Â£3,200 Professor Sir Jeremy Farrar, who sits on the government's scientific advisory committee, said the next four to six weeks ""will be absolutely pivotal to the sort of autumn and winter we have"". ""So I am very supportive of the restrictions coming in and sincerely hope they are going to be enough."" Laura Kuenssberg: The government's warning system is flashing red UK coronavirus cases up by 2,460 - check the numbers in your area There are some exceptions to the new rules. Households andsupport bubblesbigger than six can socialise together - but not with anyone else at the same time - and gatherings can be more than six if it is for work or education purposes. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby,said the new rules,externaldid not affect places of worship as that is ""not a social gathering"". And Parkrun -which earlier this week announced it was to resume in England- is ""unaffected"" as it is an organised sport, its organisers said. No 10 said any group of seven or more people gathering anywhere ""risks being dispersed by police or fined for non-compliance"". BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley pointed out that pubs and restaurants would be allowed to have more than six customers inside, but that the groups of six would have to be socially distant from each other. The rationale behind allowing this, but not allowing larger groups of people inside other people's homes, is that businesses can only be open if they follow safety and hygiene measures set out by the government, he added. Downing Street said Mr Johnson held a virtual roundtable with police forces last week, and heard officers wanted clearer rules and enforcement on social contact. The devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are able to set their own coronavirus restrictions and, while largely implementing similar rules, have moved at their own pace during the pandemic. The number of people allowed to meet inside or outside varies in the UK's four nations. If you are meeting indoors:up to eight people,externalfrom three different households can meet inScotland;up to six people,externalfrom two households inNorthern Ireland;up to four households,externalcan form an ""extended household"" inWales. This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? Ministers and government advisers earlierexpressed concern over a ""sharp rise""in cases anda ""heartfelt"" apology was issuedfollowing shortages in England's testing system. Overall, there have been 8,396 new cases reported since Sunday - with 2,460 reported on Tuesday alone. There were also 32 deaths reported, but these will not have been related to the most recent rise in cases. The banning of gatherings of over six people is partly about solving a specific problem - giving police powers to crackdown on large gatherings. It also provides ministers and officials the opportunity to warn the public against complacency with signs infections may be on the rise. But what is more important is where the UK goes from here. Lockdown bought us time, but has essentially only deferred the problem - how to protect people, particularly the most vulnerable, from the virus while keeping society functioning. Better treatments, more testing and a network of contact tracers has put the UK in a better position than it was in the spring - even though there are problems with the last two. Further restrictions of more or less any sort come at a cost - whether to health, education, the economy or all three. It means the UK, like all nations, is faced with the impossibly difficult task of balancing harms. With winter around the corner - the time when respiratory viruses thrive - the decisions are just going to become even more difficult. The UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, who No 10 said backed urgent action in England, has said Covid-19 rates are now rising, especially among people between the ages of 17 and 29. He warned that if people stopped social distancing then ""Covid comes back"". England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam has also voiced concern saying: ""People have relaxed too much. Now is the time for us to re-engage, and to realise that this is a continuing threat to us."" In other developments: Businesses in England that are required to close because of coronavirus restrictions will be able to claim Â£1,500 per property every three weeks, the Treasury announced. But the British Chambers of Commerce said for most ""this will not be enough to offset the resulting cash crunch"" A new public information campaign will be launched across the UK reminding people of the ""basics"" - washing their hands, covering their face and giving others space Doncaster Racecoursehas been told by public health officialsto stop spectators attending its meeting from Thursday.

"Tredomen is among the testing centres that have seen long queues There are fears of a shortage of coronavirus tests as people rush to get symptoms checked in Caerphilly county, GPs have said. The county is being placed in lockdownfrom 18:00 BST on Tuesday, following a spike in cases. The British Medical Association (BMA) said the queues at the pop-up test centre in the town were ""horrific"". Health Minister Vaughan Gething said testing had picked up the levels of community transmission. But he acknowledged a UK-wide testing programme was facing challenges in coping with demand. Chief executive of Caerphilly council, Christina Harrhy, urged people to only get tested if they were showing symptoms. What does the lockdown mean for Caerphilly? Dr David Bailey, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Wales and a GP in Caerphilly, said: ""The queues at the pop-up centre in Caerphilly yesterday were horrific, although we understand people were all getting tested. ""The capacity seems to be struggling across the UK, and people being sent across the country is hardly helpful with keeping people local and staying socially distanced."" Caerphilly county has had more new cases in the past week - 98 - than anywhere else in Wales and more than the area has seen since the end of April. Community testing started in the county at the weekend, a total of 450 people were tested and 19 were positive for Covid-19. In Bridgend county, people spoke of trying to book a test at a drive-through centre or a mobile unit via aUK online system,external, but being told their nearest available slot was at Bristol Airport, more than 60 miles away. While Andy, from Caerphilly, said he was unable to get a test for his two sons after they developed a cough. ""My partner took them down to the testing site at the leisure centre, but there was a three-hour queue. That was at 8am. ""She was told to go up to the new centre up in Penallta. She made her way up there, and there were already hundreds of cars. ""She was waiting in the queue and she was told at that point that if she didn't have ID for the children they couldn't be tested - how are you going to have ID for children with you?"" Shehzad Malik was offered a test for his mother miles away after she developed a chest infection Shehzad Malik, from Cardiff, also had problems while trying to get a test for his parents. He said his mother was advised to get a test by her GP after developing a chest infection, but after hours of struggling with the system, was offered a test more than an hour's drive west of Cardiff. He said: ""Yesterday I tried several times to book a drive-through test at my nearest test centre but to no avail. ""Once I had found the correct link I filled in the relevant information and each time I tried submitting the information online the page would not load to offer me a test. ""I kept trying online to get an appointment, almost every half hour from 2pm to 10pm, and the site kept crashing. ""Eventually, at about 22:15, I was able to upload all the information and was offered a Covid test in Carmarthen, 55 miles from my home in Cardiff."" People will not be able to leave Caerphilly borough without good reason In Gwynedd, GPs spoke of patients being sent miles to get tested after being concerned about symptoms, including shortness of breath, persistent coughs, and high temperatures. Dr Huw Gwilym, who was on call at the Waunfawr surgery, said: ""There are examples of patients in Waunfawr being offered tests in Telford [125 miles], Oswestry [67 miles] and Aberystwyth [70 miles],"" he said. ""We are very concerned about the situation because it is unfair to ask people with Covid-19 symptoms, who are ill and should self-isolate, to travel for hours by car to get a test. We didn't expect such problems months into the pandemic."" Dr Eilir Hughes said people were requesting home tests but being told there were non avalaible Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP in Nefyn, Gwynedd, said he was concerned people were being ""put off"" going to get tested due to being asked to travel miles from their homes. ""There are several reports that people are being offered a test in Manchester [125 miles] or Aberystwyth [75 miles] whilst they live here on the LlÅ·n Peninsula,"" he said. ""The truth is the nearest TTP testing centre is Llandudno [55 miles] which in itself is too far. People then request home tests and they are told they've ran out of stock. Mr Gething said there were ""challenges"" about the way the UK-wide Lighthouse testing labs were running ""and its ability to cope with demand"". In the most recent week for which figures are available 9,904 tests were processed in NHS Wales labs, while 26,067 were sent to Lighthouse labs. He said: ""These are issues that my team have been raising through official levels. And I'm hoping to speak to other health ministers across the UK within the next day or two if possible - we sought a meeting today with colleagues in Northern Ireland as well - to be able to run through what is actually happening. ""None of us want to see people being asked to travel large distances which for some people won't be possible."" Mr Gething said mobile testing in Caerphilly had seen a large number of people attending. That allowed the Welsh Government ""to pick up the levels of community transmission from people outside the clusters we've already been able to identify"", he said. A spokesman added: ""We have raised this issue with the UK government, which runs the Lighthouse Lab testing system and we expect these issues to be resolved quickly to ensure people in Wales who have suspected coronavirus symptoms can receive a test as close to home as possible. ""We have recently announced Â£32m to increase capacity to process tests at laboratories in Wales, which includes extending our regional labs to 24-hour operation and six new 'hot labs' at hospitals across Wales. This investment will increase our testing resilience ahead of the winter."" Wales' first local lockdown begins in Caerphilly How do I book a coronavirus test in Wales?

"This video can not be played Matt Hancock: ""We will restrict all hospitality to takeaways only"" Tighter coronavirus restrictions have been introduced in Bolton, including only allowing takeaways and curtailing nightlife, after a rise in cases. All hospitality venues will be limited to takeaway and must be closed to customers between 22:00 BST and 05:00 each day. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the town in Greater Manchester had ""the highest case rate in the country."" A further 2,460 new coronavirus cases were reported across the UK on Tuesday. Overall, there have been 8,396 new cases reported since Sunday. A further 32 deaths within 28 days of a positive test across all settings were recorded on Tuesday - with the average number of daily deaths over the past week now around 11. Ministers and government advisers expressed concern over a ""sharp rise"" in cases anda ""heartfelt"" apology was issuedfollowing shortages in England's testing system. 'Drunk young people, hugging with no social distancing' UK coronavirus cases up by 2,420 on Tuesday - how many are in your area?  Mr Hancock told the House of Commons on Tuesday: ""Unfortunately, after improving for several weeks, we've seen a very significant rise in cases in Bolton. ""The rise in cases in Bolton is partly due to socialising by people in their 20s and 30s. We know this from contact tracing. ""And through our contact tracing system we've identified a number of pubs at which the virus has spread significantly."" He said there were 120 cases per 100,000 in Bolton, which had already been under stricter lockdown measures. The new measures, which came into force as Mr Hancock addressed the Commons, include: All hospitality for food and drink (restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs) are now restricted to takeaway only Late night restriction of operating hours, meaning all venues, including takeaways, will be required to close from 22:00 to 05:00 It will become illegal for people to socialise with those outside their own household in any setting, even outdoors Schools in Bolton will continue to welcome pupils as usual, Bolton Council said. Council leader Cllr David Greenhalgh said: ""This is not something we want to do, but it is clear the virus is currently moving round the borough uncontrolled and so we need to halt the transmission rate."" THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TESTING:What tests are available? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? SOCIAL LIFE:Is it safe to go to the pub? Muhammad Memon, 37, who owns Kids World clothing shop in Bolton town centre, said he had real fears about keeping his business afloat in light of the new restrictions. ""Town is empty. Four big retailers have shut down near me since lockdown,"" he said. ""There is no footfall."" ""I am praying for help from the government,"" he added. The Alma Inn pub and music venue in Boltonannounced,externalon Facebook it would now close permanently, two days after it said a customer tested positive for Covid-19. As well as restricting hospitality venues, Mr Hancock said visitor limits will also be put in place in care homes in Bolton. The health secretary said: ""I want us to learn the lesson from Spain, America and France - not to have to learn the lesson all over again ourselves through more hospitalisations and more deaths, and take this action locally in Bolton."" The move comes after plans toease restrictions in Bolton were scrapped last weekfollowing a spike in Covid-19 cases. Mr Hancock also told MPs that a strict local lockdown in Leicester had resulted in a ""very significant"" drop in cases, with measures there to be reviewed on Thursday. Demand at local coronavirus testing sites in Bolton has led to queues of people and cars It came as students at universities across Greater Manchester, including in Bolton,have been warned they face sanctionsif they break rules to limit the spread of coronavirus. Meanwhile, Boris Johnson's official spokesman was asked whether the government was considering a change in guidance on household gatherings across England. The spokesman said it was being kept under review and that ministers would not hesitate to act if needed. Guidance in England currently says two households can meet indoors.Outdoors up to six people from different households can meet- or up to 30 people from two households. What should I do to stay safe and stop the spread? New virus figures show UK faces 'impossible balancing act' âItâs unfair to blame young people for virus riseâ The UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, said Covid-19 rates are now rising, especially amongst people between the ages of 17 and 29. He warned that if people stopped social distancing then ""Covid comes back"". England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van Tam added: ""People have relaxed too much. Now is the time for us to re-engage, and to realise that this is a continuing threat to us."" Although there has been a sharp rise in coronavirus cases reported in the last few days, the 30 deaths recorded on Tuesday are unrelated. It takes time from becoming infected to developing symptoms. Someone who is very sick in hospital with coronavirus and who sadly dies will have caught the infection weeks before. Earlier, Mr Hancock told MPs that a ""sharp rise"" in coronavirus cases in recent days had been across the whole country rather than in localised ""hotspots"". Other parts of the UK are also facing tougher restrictions. In Wales,the county borough of Caerphilly is now under a local lockdownlasting until at least October,prompting a ""rush"" for tests. Stricter rules on visiting other people's homes were alsoextended to two more areas in the west of Scotlandfrom midnight. THE NAKED SCIENTISTS:Where did COVID-19 come from?

"The company which installed cladding blamed for fuelling the Grenfell Tower fire has told an inquiry into the blaze that it did not check the design met fire safety requirements. Ray Bailey, director of Harley Facades, said the firm relied on architects and building control officers to make sure designs were safe. He accused supplier Celotex of misleading his firm about its safety. The fire safety consultation is due to close,externalon 12 October. The fire at the west London tower block killed 72 people in 2017. A key question at this stage of the inquiry is how the companies involved allowed highly combustible cladding to be fitted to the outside of the 24-storey tower. Grenfell recommendations 'will be implemented' Mr Bailey said his firm was deceived that the insulation used on the project was safe for high-rises. He said Polyisocyanurate (PIR) foam rigid insulation boards became widely used in construction around a decade ago. Asked about how much he knew about their fire risk, he said: ""When we were asked to use Celotex on Grenfell Tower, we were of the mindset that these new special super duper insulation products were acceptable providing they met certain criteria. ""Celotex made a big, big deal about their products being suitable, specifically designed for building over 18 metres. ""They used the term, which is very misleading now looking back, 'Class 0 throughout'."" A Class 0 fire safety certificate is the minimum requirement for external surfaces of buildings. Mr Bailey said: ""I think we carried out all possible reasonable checks... we didn't believe for one second that they would attempt to mislead us on this."" Harley Facades managed the technical design and installation of cladding boxes that were added to frames on the building's exterior, to protect insulation panels from the rain. However under questioning from Richard Millett QC, Ray Bailey said he did not believe the ""buck stopped"" with the company for the safety of the design. He said ""there is a raft of layers with Harley, with the architect, with the fire consultants, with building control to ensure that the... design is compliant."" Stephanie Barwise QC, a lawyer for a group of survivors and the bereaved, has previously accused Celotex of promoting its Rs5000 insulation despite senior executives knowing it should have been recalled after safety tests. Craig Orr QC, representing Celotex, previously said its marketing literature promoted the use of Rs5000 on buildings taller than 18 metres only on a ""rainscreen cladding system with the specific components"" used when it passed a fire safety test, and that it stipulated any changes to those components would ""need to be considered by the building designer"". ""The rainscreen cladding system described in Celotex's marketing literature bore no resemblance to the rainscreen cladding system installed at Grenfell Tower,"" he added. Celotex was marketed for use on tall buildings when used with a specific combination of other materials, despite being combustible. The inquiry continues.

"The UK's ambassador to the US quit after private comments about the Trump administration were leaked The UK's former ambassador to the US has told BBC Newsnight he does not regret criticising Donald Trump in briefings later leaked to the media. Kim Darroch quit last year after it emerged he described the US President's government as ""dysfunctional"", ""inept"" and ""divided"" in private letters. The use of ""clear and direct"" language was not unusual for diplomats when reporting to ministers, he insisted. But its disclosure to the media was a ""vindictive"" breach of trust, he said. Lord Darroch left his post in July 2019 amid a huge diplomatic rowover the leaking of a series of private cables, in which he had questioned the competence of the Trump administration and its handling of major foreign policy issues, such as relations with Iran. In a wide-ranging interview with the BBC's Newsnight, to be broadcast at 22:45 BST on BBC Two, he said he accepted his position had become untenable after his observations became public, leading Mr Trump to describe him as a ""stupid guy"" and ""pompous fool"". UK ambassador to US resigns in Trump leaks row Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? But he defended his conduct during his three years in Washington, saying it was the job of diplomats to report in unvarnished terms about the workings of foreign governments and how they could affect the UK national interest. ""I never regret the terms in which I'd reported,"" he said. ""I spent 40 years in the Foreign Office writing in these terms and people hitherto had thought it a strength and an asset. ""There is nothing unusual in reporting in clear and direct terms. Wikileaks shows American diplomats reporting in direct terms and the US embassy was reporting directly about how the UK government was handling Brexit."" He said he knew he was ""in trouble"" when a confidential letter sent in 2017 to a small group of colleagues, which described the early weeks of the Trump era as ""uniquely dysfunctional"", appeared in the Mail on Sunday. He said he did not blame the newspaper for publishing the material but believed whoever had passed it onto them had acted in an ""irresponsible and vindictive"" way. In 2019 confidential emails emerged in which the former UK ambassador to the UScalled the Trump administration ""clumsy and inept"" In an angry response President Trump called the ambassador, then Sir Kim Darroch, a ""a very stupid guy"" Sir Kim stepped down saying it was ""impossible"" for him to continue, although he had the backing of many senior figures Boris Johnson - a Tory leadership candidate at the time - faced strong criticism for failing to fully support him The row ended a diplomatic career spanning 40 years, including time as the UK's permanent representative to the EU and national security adviser Ex-US ambassador 'showed little fury' in person If their aim had been to get him replaced by a Brexit-supporting politician, such as the former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, rather than another career diplomat, they clearly failed, he said. ""I blame the leaker taking highly classified information of the most damaging kind to me and to US-UK relations. This video can not be played Lord Darroch on UK's government stance on EU trade deal ""If you're in the position of having to write in code because you can't trust your colleagues that way madness lies. You have to trust them and on this occasion that trust was misplaced."" The Metropolitan Police launched a criminal probe into the leaking of the material in August 2019, with Commissioner Cressida Dick describing it as a ""very serious crime"". Boris Johnson, who at the time of Lord Darroch's exit was vying to be the next Conservative leader and prime minister, was criticised for not coming out in support of the UK diplomat and insisting he must stay in post. Lord Darroch said it would have been ""nice"" if Mr Johnson had done so but understood why he wanted to keep his ""options open"" given the ambassador had been left ""dangling"" by the row. Reflecting on his time in Washington and the current state of US-UK relations, he said the US President was ""not a politician"" in the conventional sense and it was not a surprise that Mr Johnson was ""fascinated"" by him. Asked if some of Mr Trump's approach to politics had rubbed off on Mr Johnson, he said it may be influencing his current ""negotiating style"" over a post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. The PM has been criticised forthreatening to change the terms of the legally-binding Withdrawal Agreement with the EU in the eventthe UK does not negotiate a trade deal. ""Trump famously said Theresa May should start Brexit negotiations by suing the EU, a mad dog negotiating style,"" Lord Darroch said. ""If you go back to the PM in 2018, he said if Trump was negotiating Brexit he would create chaos at the start and people would be outraged at what he was saying and there'd be huge rows and there might be a good outcome. ""We should think about that. That's when he was becoming dissatisfied with Brexit and now I watch the government conduct its future relationship I wonder if there's an element of Trump."" Lord Darroch, who became a member of the House of Lords in January, said he believed the so-called ""special relationship"" between the US and UK would remain strong whoever won November's presidential election. While Mr Johnson got on better with Mr Trump than his predecessor, this did not mean there would not be ""ups and downs"" if he were re-elected and that negotiations on a transatlantic trade deal would not be ""difficult"". And while Mr Trump's Democratic rival for the Presidency, Joe Biden, was an ""Anglophile"", he was vice-president in the Obama administration which famously said the UK would be at the ""back of the queue"" for a trade deal if it voted to leave the EU, added Lord Darroch. ""Biden said he'd have voted Remain so I have more questions about the relationship with a Democrat,"" he added.

"Denmark had chances to win the game in Copenhagen England played out a dreary deadlock with Denmark in Copenhagen as the Nations League meeting turned into a drab non-event. Harry Kane almost won it for England in the dying seconds when he went round Denmark keeper Kasper Schmeichel, only to see his shot cleared off the line by Mathias Jorgensen - but such a poor quality encounter barely deserved a dramatic finale. Manager Gareth Southgate will have hoped for some talking points on the pitch after the off-field distraction that saw young duo Phil Foden and Mason Greenwood sent home for breaking Covid-19 protocols in Iceland. Wolverhampton Wanderers captain Conor Coady made a measured England debut while Leeds United's Kalvin Phillips had a quiet introduction - and Aston Villa midfield man Jack Grealish finally got his long-awaited bow with 14 minutes left. Denmark had the better chances until Kane's late effort, with England keeper Jordan Pickford saving well from Kasper Dolberg in the first half and Christian Eriksen shooting over when well placed late on. England were sterile and conservative, creating very little apart from a Kane header off target and a low shot from Raheem Sterling that brought a smart save from Schmeichel before that late chance. Arsenal youngster Ainsley Maitland-Niles became England's fourth debutant in the final minutes on a night of very little excitement. 'Southgate must address lack of productivity, positivity and ambition' Trust needs to be rebuilt with Foden and Greenwood - Southgate Football Daily podcast: England are dull and drab in Denmark England's ploy of playing a three-man central defence and effectively two holding midfielders in Phillips and Declan Rice afforded Denmark the sort of respect that might be better reserved for more elite sides. It set the tone for a disappointing England performance, lacking in ambition and threat and one which would not have have deserved the late victory Kane almost gave them. There is the usual context that this is effectively a pre-season game in an international guise for England's players but there was no excuse for such a lifeless display lacking in energy. England's attacking trio of Kane, Sterling and the anonymous Jadon Sancho were nowhere near their best but they could point to the fact that they were cut off from any sort of supply line by the manner of Southgate's set-up. The team itself had an experimental air but there was no escaping England should have done much better than this. Wolves captain Conor Coady was no shrinking violet as he made his England debut, making his presence felt and heard even before kick-off. As silence fell on the largely deserted Parken Stadion in the seconds before the start, Coady's voice was heard bellowing instructions to his new England colleagues. The 27-year-old looked at home with England, urging team-mates on throughout and shouting tactical instructions. He also played well and can be very satisfied with his first taste of senior international football, playing his part in the clean sheet. It was a more subdued night for 24-year-old Leeds midfielder Phillips but it is worth remembering this is a player entering international football before even making his debut in the Premier League. England's system was not ideal for him and there were times in the first half when the game passed him by but he showed composure on the ball and did not waste possession, improving in the second half. Grealish can finally got the opportunity that will delight his many supporters but he had little time to influence affairs, apart from a couple of trademark jinking runs that came to nothing. This was England's sixth goalless draw in 43 matches under Gareth Southgate - as many as Roy Hodgson played out in 56 games in charge. The last England manager to oversee more 0-0s was Bobby Robson (17). England managed just two shots on target, their fewest since their behind-closed-doors match against Croatia in October 2018 (also two). England have kept a clean sheet in five successive competitive matches for the first time since another run of five ending in March 2017. Denmark have kept a clean sheet in six of their past eight matches in all competitions, conceding just three goals in this time. England's first shot on target in this game came in the 70th minute courtesy of Raheem Sterling - it was the longest they had to wait since a World Cup match against Costa Rica in 2014 (80th minute). This was the first time the England men's team has named four debutants in a non-friendly match since October 1962 in a European Championship qualifier against Poland (Ray Charnley, Chris Crowe, Mike Hellawell, Alan Hinton). Phillips was the first Leeds United player to start for England since Danny Mills in 2003, while Coady was the first Wolves player to start for England since Steve Bull in 1990.

"The posters put up in Skin Kerr salon in Bootle have since been taken down A beauty salon that banned coronavirus talk and said Covid-19 does not exist is being investigated by police. Skin Kerr salon in Bootle put posters in its window and posted online stating masks weren't being worn by staff as ""you can't catch what doesn't exist"". Merseyside Police said officers would visit the salon on Aintree Road to ""remind"" the owner and staff of their responsibilities around Covid-19. The shop window posters and social media posts have now been taken down. Sefton Council said its environmental health team will also visit and the owners are due to meet with the council on Wednesday. Cabinet member Councillor Paulette Lappin said the salon's stance was ""disappointing"". ""If the situation cannot be resolved satisfactorily during this meeting, and we are not satisfied that measures to keep customers and staff safe are in place, we will consider taking formal enforcement action,"" she said. In a statement Sefton Council said coronavirus had been the cause of death for over 1,000 people in Merseyside hospitals and reminded local businesses and their customers of the importance of following the Government's COVID-19 guidance. Sefton Community Policing Superintendent Graeme Robson said: ""My officers will be visiting the salon to speak to the staff and manager and reminding them of their continued responsibilities around Covid-19 and the safety and wellbeing of their staff and customers.

People living in Leighton Buzzard and Dunstable, Bedfordshire, and Milton Keynes and Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire said they felt it at about 09:45 BST. Carly Jan Smith, 31, in Dunstable, said it was ""really strong"" and lasted for about two seconds. Her whole room went from ""side to side"", she said. The British Geological Survey said it struck just north of Leighton Buzzard. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Smith of Dunstable told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""I was in my room and I thought my stepdad was doing something in the garage because the whole room just went from side to side, really strongly.

"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says a ""sharp rise"" in cases in the UK in recent days is ""concerning"" New restrictions brought in for Bolton, as cases reach 120 per 100,000 there No 10 not ruling out tightening restrictions on the number of people who can meet in England UK reports 32 new deaths - the highest daily total since 29 July People in Scotland warned to stick to one pub visit per night, as three news deaths recorded Japan says it will hold the Tokyo Games in 2021, even if the pandemic is still continuing UK tax authorities admit about 5-10% of cash paid out on the furlough scheme was wrongly awarded India records its highest daily deaths in more than a month - 1,133 people in 24 hours US President Donald Trump and rival Joe Biden trade insults over their stances on a vaccine Martha Buckley That's all for our live coverage today. Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Our editors were: Helier Cheung, Martha Buckley and Owen Amos. Our contributors were Lauren Turner, Ashitha Nagesh, Marie Jackson and Joshua Nevett. Here is a round-up of the major Covid-19 stories from today in the UK:  Demand at testing sites in Bolton has led to queues The French PM visited a section of the Tour de France route on Saturday Coronavirus cases rising, lockdown restrictions returning, economies wobbling. The pandemic has wreaked havoc worldwide on yet another eventful day. In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. Olga Robinson and Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check People in several countries have been sharing a link to a
webpage connected to the World Bank saying it shows test kits for Covid-19 were
being exported in 2017, long before the disease was known to exist. The claim on social media is that this is evidence the
pandemic was planned all along â but this is false and we can settle any doubts
about whatâs going on. The page is genuine and includes trade information under the
heading âCovid-19 test kits exports by country in 2017â. So you can understand why this might have
caused some confusion. Itâs from a database run by international organisations
including the World Bank. According to the World Bank, the page was created to make it
easier to find all of the previously existing products that are now being used
for Covid-19. All the medical devices listed on the site have had other
uses for many years, but they were re-labelled to ease the tracking of items
that are particularly important to tackle coronavirus. The title of the page has been amended to âmedical kitsâ and
to avoid further misunderstanding includes a disclaimer that says, âThe data
here track previously existing medical devices that are now classified by
the World Customs Organization as critical to tackling Covid-19.â The claim appears to have emerged on English-language
Facebook late last week and then spread across Twitter, Instagram and Reddit
over the weekend. Over the past few days it has also been shared in Italian,
German, Polish, Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch and other languages. The allegations have also been amplified by opponents of
vaccination and supporters of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. Earlierwe brought you the latest coronavirus figures for Great Britain- as there was a delay with the Northern Ireland data. That is now in and the updated figures for the whole UK show 2,460 new cases of coronavirus reported in the past 24 hours. There have also been a total of 32 deaths of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. It is the highest daily figure since 29 July,according to the government data,external.  If you're in the UK, here is a round-up of useful information on the spread of Covid-19: Travellers to Sydney, Australia are kept in isolation for a period to curb the spread of the coronavirus Police in Sydney, Australia have accused a man of falsely claiming his grandfather was terminally ill as an excuse to leave quarantine early. The 30-year-old man from neighbouring Victoria state was asked to quarantine at a hotel after arriving at Sydney Airport on Friday without an exemption. But the following morning, the man was released after he provided what he claimed to be a valid exemption document, saying he was in New South Wales to visit his terminally ill grandfather in hospital. Police later determined the document to be false, and discovered the manâs grandfather was not in hospital. The man was arrested on Saturday and charged with failure to comply with coronavirus regulations, and producing false documentation,police said,external. He was given bail and returned to hotel quarantine, with a court appearance due on 12 October 2020. Coronavirus restrictions have been eased in parts of northern England allowing more businesses to reopen - except in Bolton where there has been a rise in cases. Soft-play centres, bowling alleys, gyms and casinos are able to open again in parts of Lancashire, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire which had had restrictions reimposed. Beauty salons can also begin close-contact treatments such as facials. The move brings these areas back in line with the rest of England. One owner of a gym in Blackburn, Lancashire, described his ""unbelievable relief"" and ""excitement"" at being allowed to reopen after six months. ""I am finally back doing what I do best,"" said Nick Talbot, owner of The FitMill. He said he feared he would lose his gym if it did not reopen soon. Read more here. The Moria camp in Lesbos recorded its first case of coronavirus last week Three migrant facilities in Greece have entered quarantine amid concerns over the spread of Covid-19 among thousands of asylum seekers living in dire conditions. Restrictions will be placed on the camps of Malakassa, Schisto and Eleonas until 21 September, the Greek government said. Greece's migrant camps have technically been under lockdown since March, with restrictions on who can leave and enter. This has prompted criticism from aid groups, who have warned that an outbreak of the virus at these camps, where sanitation is poor and accommodation overcrowded, could easily spread. One of the largest camps, Moria, which hosts almost 13,000 asylum seekers on the island of Lesbos, recorded its first case of coronavirus last week. Up to now, Greece has recorded few coronavirus infections and deaths relative to its European neighbours. Of the 289 deaths confirmed in total, none of them have been at migrant camps. These up-to-date charts show that while confirmed cases in the UK are rising sharply...  ...the number of Covid hospital admissions remains low: The number of people dying with Covid-19 also remains relatively low: French Prime Minister Jean Castex said he would self-isolate until he received his test result French Prime Minister Jean Castex has tested negative for Covid-19,the BFM TV channel has reported, citing his office,external. Earlier, we reported that Castex was to be tested as a precaution, after he shared a car with the director of the Tour de France, Christian Prudhomme, who has contracted the virus. Prudhomme was confirmed positive on Tuesday. He and Castex had travelled in a car together along the route of the cycling race on Saturday. The prime ministerâs office said they were both âwearing masks and respecting social distancingâ. The posters put up in Skin Kerr salon in Bootle have since been taken down A beauty salon that said Covid-19 did not exist will be visited by police. Skin Kerr salon in Bootle put posters in its window and posted online stating masks weren't being worn by staff as ""You can't catch what doesn't exist."" Merseyside Police said officers would visit the salon to ""remind"" the owner and staff of their responsibilities around Covid-19. Sefton Council said its environmental health team would also visit and the owners are due to meet the council on Wednesday. The BBC has been unable to contact Skin Kerr for a response.Read our full story here. Canada's top doctor is urging caution after coronavirus cases spiked 25% in one week across the country. Chief Public Health Officer Theres Tam warned that Canadians would need to be ""even more diligent"" in the autumn, as temperatures plummeted and people headed indoors. âThis is a concern and a reminder that we all need to maintain public health measures to keep Covid-19 on the slow-burn path that we need,âshe said on Monday.,external Cases rose to 545 over the past week, up from 435 and 390 in the two weeks prior. On Tuesday, after a long weekend, public health officials in Ontario noted there were375 new cases over the past two days,external,the biggest increase since 6 July.,external About 23 of the new cases have been linked to amulti-location wedding the prior weekend.,external People in Bolton have been reacting to the tighter restrictionsannounced in their area- which include the closure of pubs and a ban on socialising with people outside their households. Nasser Herez, 59, who runs Yummies Kebab & Curry House, said: ""I have seen lots of drunk young people, hugging with no social distancing. ""It is sad it has come to this...but if that's what we need to do, then that's what I'll do."" The manager of The Elephant & Castle, Steve Coyle, said: ""We are disappointed but not surprised. ""We are not going to operate as a takeaway so we are just going to close - probably for a few weeks."" Readmore reaction from Bolton here. Kamala Harris has said she would not necessarily trust a vaccine approved by the Trump administration Democratic US vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris has said she would trust a coronavirus vaccine developed under US President Donald Trump, but only if health experts gave it their approval. Harris drew criticism from Republicans after saying she would not trust a vaccine approved by the Trump administration unless a ""credible"" source agreed it was safe. She and other Democrats have accused President Trump of pressuring health authorities to speed up vaccine development before Novemberâs presidential election. In response, President Trump has accused the Democrats of using ""anti-vaccine rhetoric"" for political ends. But today Harris struck a different tone in an interview with the WISN TV channel, saying: ""I would trust a vaccine if the public health professionals and the scientists told us that we can trust it."" As we reported earlier, nine companies developing vaccines against Covid-19 have pledged to ""uphold the integrity of the scientific process"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned the test-and-trace system is ""on the verge of collapse"". He said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had to take responsibility amid a rise in the number of coronavirus infections in the UK. Sir Keir told the BBC: ""Everybody is deeply concerned about the rise in the rate of infection. ""As we reopen the economy, as children go back to school, this was always going to be a risk, we understand that."" He said Mr Johnson should have used the summer to get a ""very effective"" test-and-trace system running. He added: ""What we're now seeing is stories over the past few days that is showing the testing regime is on the verge of collapse. ""Heartbreaking stories from people who need a test being told no tests are available. ""Or the website is crashing, or people are being told to go miles and miles for a test. Nobody can argue that that is good governance."" Sir Keir said he still supported the principles of the government's coronavirus restrictions. But he said that the government's messaging had been ""confused"". The parliament usually meets once a month in Strasbourg Next weekâs session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg has been cancelled over concerns about the spread of coronavirus in the French city. The parliament will hold the plenary session in the Belgian capital, Brussels, instead, EU Parliament President David Sassoli has announced. ""We are very saddened by this decision, but the transfer of the administrative operation of the European Parliament would mean all the staff would have to be quarantined on their return to Brussels,"" Sassoli said. The EU Parliament usually meets once a month for a plenary session in Strasbourg to vote on legislation and discuss political issues. The next session, scheduled for 14-17 September, was to be the first in the city since coronavirus containment measures were introduced in March. But MEPs have shown resistance to the notion of reconvening parliament in the city, which was recently designated a Covid-19 âred zoneâ. In a tweet,external, French MEP Christophe Grudler said the decision to relocate the session to Brussels went against the advice of French health authorities, describing it as âlamentableâ. The aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has been delayed a second day after a Covid outbreak on board. The Royal Navy warship was due to leave Portsmouth for training exerciseson Monday. A MoD spokesman confirmed that âfewer than 10â members of the 1,000-strong crew had tested positive. They are in isolation on shore, while people who had been in contact with them are isolating on board. The ship is now due to leaveon Wednesday.,external The Royal Navy said the positive tests were detected during ""routine"" preparations Silvio Berlusconi has served as Italian prime minister in four governments Thereâs been an update on the condition of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week. The doctor treating Berlusconi for a lung infection at San Raffaele hospital in Milan says his condition has shown a âfavourable evolutionâ. Berlusconiâs signs of recovery âare reassuringâ, said Alberto Zangrillo, head of the hospitalâs cardiovascular intensive-care unit. Berlusconi, 83, was admitted to hospital on Thursday. The media mogul's positive diagnosis came last week after a holiday at his luxury villa in Sardinia. His companion, Marta Fascina, and two of his children - daughter Barbara, 36, and son Luigi, 31 - have also contracted the virus. ONS figures earlier showed weekly deaths had dropped to their lowest level since mid-March - but that did not mean the virus is still a threat, according to England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. He told the Commons: ""We have seen a concerning rise in the number of positive cases, particularly among younger people, and these figures serve as a salutary reminder that this virus is still very much with us and remains a threat."" He said: ""Of course, there is a lag between people catching the disease and the statistics for new cases, and those who sadly die. ""The second thing is that this rise most recently has been largely, predominantly, not entirely, amongst young people who are much less likely to die. ""The danger is that they will pass it on to others and it will spread more broadly into the community.
""So, it is important to act on these cases even though, thankfully, currently the number who are dying is small."" He was speaking before Tuesday's daily coronavirus figures were released.

"A director of the government's test and trace programme in England has issued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the coronavirus testing system. In a tweet, Sarah-Jane Marsh explained it was the laboratories, not the testing sites themselves, that were the ""critical pinch-point"". This comes as scientists have sounded the alarm about rising coronavirus cases. A new Lighthouse lab is due to open in Loughborough in about a fortnight. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there had been a ""a problem with a couple of contracts"" which would take a matter of  weeks to be ""sorted in the short term"". But he said he had ""already put in certain solutions"" to make sure people didn't have to travel more than 75 miles for a test. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the testing programme was ""on the verge of collapse"". Ministers' concern over 'sharp rise' in Covid cases How do I get a coronavirus test? NI minister concerned by UK test booking 'glitch' Ms Marsh works as a deputy to Dido Harding, heading up the ""test"" element of the test and trace scheme. The programme aims to find coronavirus cases through testing and, once confirmed, track down their contacts and tell them to isolate, in order to contain the virus. Some people with symptoms have struggled to access testing in recent days, raising concerns these efforts will be hampered. ""All of our testing sites have capacity, which is why they don't look overcrowded,"" Ms Marsh explained. Instead, appointments were restricted because of a blockage in processing capacity in the labs. Carly in Manchester was left ""angry and disappointed"" after she tried to book a test for her seven-year-old son, who had a fever and a cough. ""I tried 30 or 40 times before I was able to get through and then I was told there were no appointments. ""At every point I was told everywhere's rammed to capacity."" But when she did manage to get a space at a testing centre at Manchester airport, she says there was ""absolutely no-one there"". Some found the option of applying for a home kit was unavailable, only to be offered a drive-through testing appointment more than 100 miles from their home. Rachel from Cardiff was directed to Dundee, more than 300 miles away, when she tried to apply for a test for her two sons, who had developed bad colds including symptoms she feared could be coronavirus. She wasn't given the option of a home test. Gavin on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland was directed more than 450 miles away to Portadown in Northern Ireland. Speaking to the BBC, Sir Keir described ""heart-breaking stories"" from people who have been unable to get a test, found the website ""crashing"" or have been ""told to go miles and miles to get a test"". ""Nobody could argue that that's good governance,"" he said. He also said the prime minister had to ""take responsibility"" for problems with the system and encouraged him to ""get on"" with holding a press conference on coronavirus. But the Department of Health and Social Care insisted that NHS Test and Trace was ""working"" - with capacity the ""highest it has ever been"" and laboratories processing more than a million tests a week. A spokeswoman said there was ""significant demand"" for tests but new slots and home testing kits were ""made available daily"". ""We are targeting testing capacity at the areas that need it most, including those where there is an outbreak, as well as prioritising at-risk groups - and we recently announced new laboratory facilities and new technology to process results even faster,"" she said. Last week, the BBC revealed thegovernment was reducing the numbers of tests availablein some parts of the country in order to make enough available where there were outbreaks. Following this, Mr Hancock pledged that no-one would have to drive more than 75 miles for a test from Friday 4 September. He told the BBC there had been ""operational challenges"". In Parliament on Tuesday, he said: ""I appreciate that 75 miles is far longer than you'd want to go and the vast majority of tests are much closer than that."" There have been suggestions some of the reduced capacity is down to schools in Scotland reopening, causing additional demand for tests. This could worsen as term has started for children across the UK. Ms Marsh went on to tweet that additional labs were to due to open ""imminently"", alongside an expansion of non-laboratory based tests such as thetwo rapid test kits that were rolled out in hospitalsfrom the beginning of August. In a 28 August letter to Mr Hancock seen by the BBC, chairs of the South East's strategic co-ordinating groups, responsible for responding to emergencies, described the government's approach as ""short sighted and flawed"". The group of chairs representing the South East, the most populous region in the UK, said they understood that testing sites were facing ""increasing demand and that laboratory capability has been matched to the areas of current high levels of prevalence"". The South East is currently an area of relatively low prevalence. But they said this would ""impede"" their view of infection rates in their communities and result in a ""lack of forewarning when infections rise in our areas"". They asked for ""clear, honest, ongoing communication"" on the current state and prioritisation of testing capability.

"Tredomen is among the testing centres that have seen long queues There are fears of a shortage of coronavirus tests as people rush to get symptoms checked in Caerphilly county, GPs have said. The county is being placed in lockdownfrom 18:00 BST on Tuesday, following a spike in cases. The British Medical Association (BMA) said the queues at the pop-up test centre in the town were ""horrific"". Health Minister Vaughan Gething said testing had picked up the levels of community transmission. But he acknowledged a UK-wide testing programme was facing challenges in coping with demand. Chief executive of Caerphilly council, Christina Harrhy, urged people to only get tested if they were showing symptoms. What does the lockdown mean for Caerphilly? Dr David Bailey, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Wales and a GP in Caerphilly, said: ""The queues at the pop-up centre in Caerphilly yesterday were horrific, although we understand people were all getting tested. ""The capacity seems to be struggling across the UK, and people being sent across the country is hardly helpful with keeping people local and staying socially distanced."" Caerphilly county has had more new cases in the past week - 98 - than anywhere else in Wales and more than the area has seen since the end of April. Community testing started in the county at the weekend, a total of 450 people were tested and 19 were positive for Covid-19. In Bridgend county, people spoke of trying to book a test at a drive-through centre or a mobile unit via aUK online system,external, but being told their nearest available slot was at Bristol Airport, more than 60 miles away. While Andy, from Caerphilly, said he was unable to get a test for his two sons after they developed a cough. ""My partner took them down to the testing site at the leisure centre, but there was a three-hour queue. That was at 8am. ""She was told to go up to the new centre up in Penallta. She made her way up there, and there were already hundreds of cars. ""She was waiting in the queue and she was told at that point that if she didn't have ID for the children they couldn't be tested - how are you going to have ID for children with you?"" Shehzad Malik was offered a test for his mother miles away after she developed a chest infection Shehzad Malik, from Cardiff, also had problems while trying to get a test for his parents. He said his mother was advised to get a test by her GP after developing a chest infection, but after hours of struggling with the system, was offered a test more than an hour's drive west of Cardiff. He said: ""Yesterday I tried several times to book a drive-through test at my nearest test centre but to no avail. ""Once I had found the correct link I filled in the relevant information and each time I tried submitting the information online the page would not load to offer me a test. ""I kept trying online to get an appointment, almost every half hour from 2pm to 10pm, and the site kept crashing. ""Eventually, at about 22:15, I was able to upload all the information and was offered a Covid test in Carmarthen, 55 miles from my home in Cardiff."" People will not be able to leave Caerphilly borough without good reason In Gwynedd, GPs spoke of patients being sent miles to get tested after being concerned about symptoms, including shortness of breath, persistent coughs, and high temperatures. Dr Huw Gwilym, who was on call at the Waunfawr surgery, said: ""There are examples of patients in Waunfawr being offered tests in Telford [125 miles], Oswestry [67 miles] and Aberystwyth [70 miles],"" he said. ""We are very concerned about the situation because it is unfair to ask people with Covid-19 symptoms, who are ill and should self-isolate, to travel for hours by car to get a test. We didn't expect such problems months into the pandemic."" Dr Eilir Hughes said people were requesting home tests but being told there were non avalaible Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP in Nefyn, Gwynedd, said he was concerned people were being ""put off"" going to get tested due to being asked to travel miles from their homes. ""There are several reports that people are being offered a test in Manchester [125 miles] or Aberystwyth [75 miles] whilst they live here on the LlÅ·n Peninsula,"" he said. ""The truth is the nearest TTP testing centre is Llandudno [55 miles] which in itself is too far. People then request home tests and they are told they've ran out of stock. Mr Gething said there were ""challenges"" about the way the UK-wide Lighthouse testing labs were running ""and its ability to cope with demand"". In the most recent week for which figures are available 9,904 tests were processed in NHS Wales labs, while 26,067 were sent to Lighthouse labs. He said: ""These are issues that my team have been raising through official levels. And I'm hoping to speak to other health ministers across the UK within the next day or two if possible - we sought a meeting today with colleagues in Northern Ireland as well - to be able to run through what is actually happening. ""None of us want to see people being asked to travel large distances which for some people won't be possible."" Mr Gething said mobile testing in Caerphilly had seen a large number of people attending. That allowed the Welsh Government ""to pick up the levels of community transmission from people outside the clusters we've already been able to identify"", he said. A spokesman added: ""We have raised this issue with the UK government, which runs the Lighthouse Lab testing system and we expect these issues to be resolved quickly to ensure people in Wales who have suspected coronavirus symptoms can receive a test as close to home as possible. ""We have recently announced Â£32m to increase capacity to process tests at laboratories in Wales, which includes extending our regional labs to 24-hour operation and six new 'hot labs' at hospitals across Wales. This investment will increase our testing resilience ahead of the winter."" Wales' first local lockdown begins in Caerphilly How do I book a coronavirus test in Wales?

"Andrew Lloyd Webber spent Â£100,000 on a pilot show The arts are at the ""point of no return"" following damage from the coronavirus pandemic, Lord Lloyd-Webber has said. The composer and theatre impresario told MPs it would be economically ""impossible"" to run theatres with social distancing. ""We simply have to get our arts sector back open and running,"" he told the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. ""We are at the point of no return."" In July, Lord Lloyd-Webber staged a concert at the London Palladium as an experiment to see whether socially-distanced performances were viable. He spent Â£100,000 on the pilot project in the hope that it could allow the theatre business to get up and running. He hoped to prove that theatres could open safely at full capacity. However, the concert had to take place with hundreds of empty seats to comply with the government's social distancing guidelines. Lord Lloyd-Webber staged a socially-distanced Beverley Knight concert at the London Palladium in July Since then, two major new indoor theatre productions have opened in London, but also with limited audience capacity. Most theatres, including those in the West End, are yet to reopen. ""There comes a point now when we really can't go on much more,"" Lord Lloyd-Webber said. The socially distanced show must go on - is it fun? Could Sleepless set a blueprint for theatre? ""Theatre is an incredibly labour-intensive business. In many ways putting on a show now is almost a labour of love. ""Very few shows hit the jackpot in the way a Hamilton, Lion King or Phantom of the Opera do."" He added that theatre productions were ""not like cinema, you can't just open the building"". The government announced a Â£1.57bn support packageearlier this year to support the arts, which was widely welcomed by the industry. But Lord Lloyd-Webber stressed the importance of naming a date when theatres can reopen. This video can not be played Andrew Lloyd Webber has previously said 'theatre canât run with social distancingâ He also discussed the ""critical"" importance of clean air. ""I am absolutely confident that the air in the London Palladium and in all my theatres is purer than the air outside,"" he said. He also suggested he could move his forthcoming production of Cinderella from the UK to a different location ""where people are being a little more helpful"". It was originally due to open in London's West End this month. Rebecca Kane Burton, chief executive of the LW Theatres, the company that runs Lord Lloyd-Webber's venues, added: ""We don't want to open theatres on a socially distanced basis. I have no intention of opening buildings at 30% capacity."" Recent months had been ""devastating and catastrophic"" for the sector, she said. ""It's a really bad, catastrophic time and we need to find a way out of it. It was disheartening that the pilot wasn't later seen as a way to getting full reopening."" She added: ""We need the time to plan. We can't switch on theatre like a tap. Christmas is hanging in the balance as we speak."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has suggested rapid testing could provide part of a solution for theatres A DCMS spokeswoman said the government was ""working flat out to support our world class performing arts sector through challenging times"". She said: ""Our unprecedented Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund builds on Â£200m in emergency public funding to stabilise organisations, protect jobs and ensure work continues to flow to freelancers. This funding will support organisations of all sizes across the country, including theatres. ""Performances indoors and outdoors can now take place with a socially distanced audience and we are working at pace with the industry on innovative proposals for how full audiences might return safely as soon as possible. We also want the public to show their support by visiting theatres as they start to reopen."" Writing in the Mail on Sunday at the weekend,external, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the government was working on a project that would see some theatre return in time for pantomime season at Christmas. He also suggested rapid testing could help ensure the return of theatres. ""Testing is the short-term key until we find a working vaccine. We're making exciting advances in quick turnaround testing, where on-the-day coronavirus tests could give people who test negative a pass to visit the theatre that evening,"" he wrote. Speaking on the BBC News Channel, actor Simon Callow said that kind of testing is ""the dream"", adding: ""That's exactly the kind of thing we need to be exploring."" He also said the furlough scheme - which has helped some in the arts industry - should be extended beyond October. That was echoed by the director of the Theatres Trust, Jon Morgan. ""Without an early date for theatres to re-open fully and with the furlough scheme ending in October we will see further redundancies and the permanent closure of more theatres,"" he said in a statement. Scene Change's This Is No Pantomime campaign launched earlier this week Lucy Noble, artistic and commercial director of the Royal Albert Hall and chair of the National Arenas Association, told the DCMS Committee there were ""huge consequences to venues not being able to put performances on... serious financial consequences"". She added: ""All venues are on their knees financially... When Oliver Dowden announced the Â£1.57 billion rescue package, the Royal Albert Hall was hailed as one of the crown jewels that this package would save. ""We have been told we are not eligible for any of the grant at all. ""We are only eligible to take a loan. We've already taken Â£10m worth of loans. We'd rather not get into any more debt.""

"The daily confirmed figures for coronavirus cases have shown a significant jump in the past two days. On Sunday they rose by nearly 3,000 and then on Monday by almost exactly the same again - the highest single day increases since May. It means the UK is now seeing four times as many cases on average as it was in mid July. And with the impact of the return of schools still to come - not to mention the re-opening of universities next month - fears are growing that cases and then deaths could start spiralling. The rise has been laid firmly at the door of young people. Around half of new cases in recent weeks have been diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s. Significant numbers of cases have also been identified in people in their 40s and 50s, as well as teenagers. That compares to the early days when most of the confirmed cases were in the older age groups. But that was because the UK was largely only testing in hospitals. Younger adults are very unlikely to be sick enough to need hospital treatment, so they hardly showed up in the official figures. Cases are rising, what should I do to stop the spread? Remember the R number? Why is it so important? If you look at results from antibody testing, to see if they had been exposed to the virus, the younger age groups were just as likely as older groups - if not more - to have been exposed. So what is happening now appears to be simply a case of the virus re-establishing itself in a group that is the least at risk of serious complications, hence there are no signs of a significant increase in hospitalisations. Much has been made of the fact these are the groups going out socialising, although it is also noticeable that the highest rates are spread across much of the working age population - many of whom will have to leave their home to make a living. So does it matter? After all, the level of cases being seen - even taking into account there will still be some not being picked up - is well below where it was in the spring. At the peak at the end of March, there were an estimated 100,000 cases a day (the official figures only show a fraction of these because of the problem mentioned above - testing was more or less limited to hospitals). And the fact that cases are rising after hitting such a low mark over the summer should not come as a surprise. More people are being tested and that testing is being targeted at high infection rate areas for one thing. But that does not tell the whole story. With people mixing more, and summer over (respiratory viruses tend to do better because of colder weather and the fact people are indoors) cases were always going to go up, and are likely to continue to do so. If you could keep the infections in younger age groups, who are not at any significant risk of complications, there would in theory not be much of a problem. The difficulty, says Prof Devi Sridhar, a public health expert at Edinburgh University, is that as cases rise, this becomes harder to achieve. She believes we are already in a position where protecting vulnerable groups will become impossible. But she admits ministers are in a ""lose-lose"" situation. If they let the virus spread they will be held culpable for rising deaths, and if they re-introduce restrictions they will be criticised for over-reacting. The result is that the UK, like all nations, faces an almost impossible balancing act - accepting some level of deaths, while keeping society functioning. Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in health protection at the University of East Anglia, says it is not realistic to return to national lockdown, saying it would not be fair to ""handicap"" children any more by closing schools. ""This is a virus that is mainly risky to older, more vulnerable groups. We need to accept winter will be extremely difficult. ""It is about finding a tolerable solution. I don't think we will see the scale of deaths we saw in spring. ""But there are, sadly, going to be many this winter. It will be the worst winter for a long time."" The key in the coming months, Prof Hunter and others believe, will be keeping deaths as low as possible by protecting the most vulnerable - more than nine in 10 deaths have happened in the over 65s with half in the over 85s. There are a number of factors that will have an impact - and on many the UK is in a stronger position than it was six months ago. The discovery that two steroids - dexamethasone and hydrocortisone - can reduce deaths among the seriously ill will make a significant difference. And, as always, good hand hygiene and continued adherence to social distancing and isolating when you have symptoms will be important principles for everyone to follow. Big local outbreaks will also need to be contained as best as possible. This is where the test and trace system comes in. While huge progress has been made in recent months though, there are still issues to be resolved on both the availability of testing and ability to reach the close contacts of infected individuals. On top of that, the government and care industry will have to do a better job of protecting care homes. There is much better availability of PPE now than there was in the early days and although regular testing of staff and residents has been slow to roll out it is a world away from the situation earlier in the year when testing stopped once a home had five confirmed cases. It also seems likely the re-introduction of shielding for the most vulnerable groups will need to happen at some point. It is of course impossible to predict - and depends on many different factors. A leaked report obtained by BBC Newsnight suggested the government had been advised there could be 85,000 deaths under a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"". Of course, the worst-case scenario should be avoided. If we are to avoid returning to the scale of deaths seen in the spring - as Prof Hunter and others think is possible - that would mean limiting fatalities to under the 41,500 coronavirus deaths that have been seen during the pandemic. But during any winter, deaths always increase by many thousands. The worst one of recent memory was three years ago when an extra 15,000 more people died in England and Wales than had on average in the previous five winters. It was a cold winter, the strain of flu was a little more virulent than normal and the vaccine available was not particularly effective. This year in the fight against coronavirus there is no vaccine and very limited immunity. Keeping the death toll anywhere near zero is, sadly, going to be impossible.

"Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are relaxing some of the rules around gatherings and mixing with others which were introduced to tackle the spread of Omicron. However, some restrictions remain. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announceda further easing of Covid rules. From Friday 28 January, the requirement for physical distancing in indoor settings where people don't have to wear a face covering - such as those leading religious services - will reduce to 1m (3ft) from 2m (6 ft). Most of the rules governingindoorandoutdoorevents have already been lifted. Covid passports arerequired for nightclubs and large events. All restrictions at outdoor events have now been lifted. On 28 January, nightclubs will reopen, and the so-called ""rule of six"" - where gatherings in pubs and restaurants are limited to six people - will be scrapped. Some restrictions will remain in place: social distancing of 2m (6ft) in all premises open to the public and workplaces, where reasonable licensed premises must take additional measures to protect customers and staff, including table service and collecting contact details face coverings are required in hospitality settings, apart from when seated vaccine passports continue to berequired for venues including restaurants, bars and cinemas Pubs and other hospitality venues now no longer have to offer table service only, and the ""rule of six"", governing the size of groups in hospitality venues, has been scrapped. From Wednesday 26 January: Proof of Covid status ""encouraged"" but no longer legally required for entry to bars, restaurants or cinemas Nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, with dancing and unseated indoor events allowed again - Covid passports will remain in use for these venues (and for partially seated events with 500 or more people in attendance) Some rules remain in place: a maximum of 30 people from an unlimited number of households can meet indoors in domestic settings shops must take ""reasonable measures to manage risk"" and shoppers are asked to maintain physical distance with each other where possible. face coverings are compulsory in shops, indoor seated venues and visitor attractions, public transport and some other settings Thecurrent restrictions in Englanddon't include any limits on socialising - so friends and family are legally allowed to see each other in private houses, or to meet in public places like pubs and nightclubs.

"More than 170 new cases were reported in total, with 91 in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde New coronavirus cases have been detected in every mainland health board area in Scotland in the past 24 hours. There have been 176 positive tests across the country since Monday, including 91 in NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde - where visiting restrictions are in force. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also said that three people had died after testing positive for the virus. This is the highest number of deaths by that measure since 30 June, she said. As well as the 91 cases in the Greater Glasgow area, 32 were detected in NHS Lanarkshire and 16 in NHS Ayrshire and Arran. The remainder were spread across the other mainland health boards - although there were no new cases in the Western Isles, Orkney or Shetland. The Scottish governmentimposed new lockdown restrictionson Renfrewshire and East Dunbartonshire on Monday evening, and extended existing restrictions in Glasgow, East Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire for a further seven days. The measures bar 1.1 million people in those areas from visiting other households and prohibit them from visiting homes in other local authorities. New cases per 100,000 people, a key figure in the decision to impose local restrictions, have risen across Greater Glasgow and Clyde. In West Dunbartonshire, there were more than 60 new cases per 100,000 people in the area,almost double the rate when visiting restrictions were imposed. The same was true in Glasgow city, which had 22 new cases per 100,000, but has seen an increase to more than 44. In Renfrewshire and East Dunbartonshire, the rate is 32.4 and 29.5 respectively. Live coverage: Coronavirus in Scotland New virus figures show UK faces 'impossible balancing act' What can I do to stop the spread? Meeting in pubs, restaurants and outdoor areas is still permitted - although the Scottish government said the situation would be monitored in the coming days. Director of public health for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Dr Linda de Caestecker, warned that the rise in cases in some local authorities could be driven by the hospitality industry. She said: ""When we examine the rate per 100,000 population it is highest in West Dunbartonshire where many cases relate to family gatherings and parties. ""The next highest rate is in Glasgow city where more cases are associated with visits to bars and restaurants."" The government said it was also keeping the situation in Inverclyde and Lanarkshire under review - although Ms Sturgeon said a rise in the number of cases in the two areas did not yet warrant additional restrictions. The overall incidence rate of the virus in Scotland as a whole was 20 cases per 100,000 people, Ms Sturgeon said - although the figure was slightly higher for the five council areas which are under stricter measures. There are tougher restrictions on visiting in five local authorities Ms Sturgeon said the latest statistics were further evidence that the ""really unwelcome"" decision to impose more lockdown restrictions was a ""proportionate"" response to rising coronavirus cases. The first minister also told her daily coronavirus briefing that she did not expect to be able to announce any further easing of restrictions elsewhere in the country when the Scottish government reviews its guidance on Thursday. Ms Sturgeon has already said she is unlikely to be announcing any further lockdown easing this week She added: ""At this time obviously we want to do everything possible to avoid the situation where more restrictions that have been lifted have to be re-imposed. ""The key to avoiding that rests with all of us - the decisions we make as individuals, still affect the safety and well being of our communities. ""So please do everything you can to avoid creating a bridge for the virus to cross over from one person to another, one household to another."" What's the story about young people and Covid-19? The first minister also criticised the ""really dangerous delusion"" that rising numbers of cases among younger people should not be a concern. She said: ""The risk of a young person getting seriously ill or dying is thankfully lower, but it is not zero, and I would ask people of all ages to remember that. ""If transmission becomes established in the younger population, it will eventually reach the older and more vulnerable population. So to younger people, please think about your loved ones as well as yourselves, which I know everybody does. ""And to older people, be even more vigilant about hygiene and distancing if you're spending time with young relatives who may have been in pubs and restaurants.""

"The company which installed cladding blamed for fuelling the Grenfell Tower fire has told an inquiry into the blaze that it did not check the design met fire safety requirements. Ray Bailey, director of Harley Facades, said the firm relied on architects and building control officers to make sure designs were safe. He accused supplier Celotex of misleading his firm about its safety. The fire safety consultation is due to close,externalon 12 October. The fire at the west London tower block killed 72 people in 2017. A key question at this stage of the inquiry is how the companies involved allowed highly combustible cladding to be fitted to the outside of the 24-storey tower. Grenfell recommendations 'will be implemented' Mr Bailey said his firm was deceived that the insulation used on the project was safe for high-rises. He said Polyisocyanurate (PIR) foam rigid insulation boards became widely used in construction around a decade ago. Asked about how much he knew about their fire risk, he said: ""When we were asked to use Celotex on Grenfell Tower, we were of the mindset that these new special super duper insulation products were acceptable providing they met certain criteria. ""Celotex made a big, big deal about their products being suitable, specifically designed for building over 18 metres. ""They used the term, which is very misleading now looking back, 'Class 0 throughout'."" A Class 0 fire safety certificate is the minimum requirement for external surfaces of buildings. Mr Bailey said: ""I think we carried out all possible reasonable checks... we didn't believe for one second that they would attempt to mislead us on this."" Harley Facades managed the technical design and installation of cladding boxes that were added to frames on the building's exterior, to protect insulation panels from the rain. However under questioning from Richard Millett QC, Ray Bailey said he did not believe the ""buck stopped"" with the company for the safety of the design. He said ""there is a raft of layers with Harley, with the architect, with the fire consultants, with building control to ensure that the... design is compliant."" Stephanie Barwise QC, a lawyer for a group of survivors and the bereaved, has previously accused Celotex of promoting its Rs5000 insulation despite senior executives knowing it should have been recalled after safety tests. Craig Orr QC, representing Celotex, previously said its marketing literature promoted the use of Rs5000 on buildings taller than 18 metres only on a ""rainscreen cladding system with the specific components"" used when it passed a fire safety test, and that it stipulated any changes to those components would ""need to be considered by the building designer"". ""The rainscreen cladding system described in Celotex's marketing literature bore no resemblance to the rainscreen cladding system installed at Grenfell Tower,"" he added. Celotex was marketed for use on tall buildings when used with a specific combination of other materials, despite being combustible. The inquiry continues.

Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Our editors were: Helier Cheung, Martha Buckley and Owen Amos. Our contributors were Lauren Turner, Ashitha Nagesh, Marie Jackson and Joshua Nevett. Here is a round-up of the major Covid-19 stories from today in the UK:  Demand at testing sites in Bolton has led to queues The French PM visited a section of the Tour de France route on Saturday Coronavirus cases rising, lockdown restrictions returning, economies wobbling. The pandemic has wreaked havoc worldwide on yet another eventful day. In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. Olga Robinson and Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check People in several countries have been sharing a link to a
webpage connected to the World Bank saying it shows test kits for Covid-19 were
being exported in 2017, long before the disease was known to exist. The claim on social media is that this is evidence the
pandemic was planned all along â but this is false and we can settle any doubts
about whatâs going on. The page is genuine and includes trade information under the
heading âCovid-19 test kits exports by country in 2017â. So you can understand why this might have
caused some confusion. Itâs from a database run by international organisations
including the World Bank. According to the World Bank, the page was created to make it
easier to find all of the previously existing products that are now being used
for Covid-19. All the medical devices listed on the site have had other
uses for many years, but they were re-labelled to ease the tracking of items
that are particularly important to tackle coronavirus. The title of the page has been amended to âmedical kitsâ and
to avoid further misunderstanding includes a disclaimer that says, âThe data
here track previously existing medical devices that are now classified by
the World Customs Organization as critical to tackling Covid-19.â The claim appears to have emerged on English-language
Facebook late last week and then spread across Twitter, Instagram and Reddit
over the weekend. Over the past few days it has also been shared in Italian,
German, Polish, Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch and other languages. The allegations have also been amplified by opponents of
vaccination and supporters of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. Earlierwe brought you the latest coronavirus figures for Great Britain- as there was a delay with the Northern Ireland data. That is now in and the updated figures for the whole UK show 2,460 new cases of coronavirus reported in the past 24 hours. There have also been a total of 32 deaths of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. It is the highest daily figure since 29 July,according to the government data,external.  If you're in the UK, here is a round-up of useful information on the spread of Covid-19: Travellers to Sydney, Australia are kept in isolation for a period to curb the spread of the coronavirus Police in Sydney, Australia have accused a man of falsely claiming his grandfather was terminally ill as an excuse to leave quarantine early. The 30-year-old man from neighbouring Victoria state was asked to quarantine at a hotel after arriving at Sydney Airport on Friday without an exemption. But the following morning, the man was released after he provided what he claimed to be a valid exemption document, saying he was in New South Wales to visit his terminally ill grandfather in hospital. Police later determined the document to be false, and discovered the manâs grandfather was not in hospital. The man was arrested on Saturday and charged with failure to comply with coronavirus regulations, and producing false documentation,police said,external. He was given bail and returned to hotel quarantine, with a court appearance due on 12 October 2020. Coronavirus restrictions have been eased in parts of northern England allowing more businesses to reopen - except in Bolton where there has been a rise in cases. Soft-play centres, bowling alleys, gyms and casinos are able to open again in parts of Lancashire, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire which had had restrictions reimposed. Beauty salons can also begin close-contact treatments such as facials. The move brings these areas back in line with the rest of England. One owner of a gym in Blackburn, Lancashire, described his ""unbelievable relief"" and ""excitement"" at being allowed to reopen after six months. ""I am finally back doing what I do best,"" said Nick Talbot, owner of The FitMill. He said he feared he would lose his gym if it did not reopen soon. Read more here. The Moria camp in Lesbos recorded its first case of coronavirus last week Three migrant facilities in Greece have entered quarantine amid concerns over the spread of Covid-19 among thousands of asylum seekers living in dire conditions. Restrictions will be placed on the camps of Malakassa, Schisto and Eleonas until 21 September, the Greek government said. Greece's migrant camps have technically been under lockdown since March, with restrictions on who can leave and enter. This has prompted criticism from aid groups, who have warned that an outbreak of the virus at these camps, where sanitation is poor and accommodation overcrowded, could easily spread. One of the largest camps, Moria, which hosts almost 13,000 asylum seekers on the island of Lesbos, recorded its first case of coronavirus last week. Up to now, Greece has recorded few coronavirus infections and deaths relative to its European neighbours. Of the 289 deaths confirmed in total, none of them have been at migrant camps. These up-to-date charts show that while confirmed cases in the UK are rising sharply...  ...the number of Covid hospital admissions remains low: The number of people dying with Covid-19 also remains relatively low: French Prime Minister Jean Castex said he would self-isolate until he received his test result French Prime Minister Jean Castex has tested negative for Covid-19,the BFM TV channel has reported, citing his office,external. Earlier, we reported that Castex was to be tested as a precaution, after he shared a car with the director of the Tour de France, Christian Prudhomme, who has contracted the virus. Prudhomme was confirmed positive on Tuesday. He and Castex had travelled in a car together along the route of the cycling race on Saturday. The prime ministerâs office said they were both âwearing masks and respecting social distancingâ.

Kamala Harris has said she would not necessarily trust a vaccine approved by the Trump administration Democratic US vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris has said she would trust a coronavirus vaccine developed under US President Donald Trump, but only if health experts gave it their approval. Harris drew criticism from Republicans after saying she would not trust a vaccine approved by the Trump administration unless a ""credible"" source agreed it was safe. She and other Democrats have accused President Trump of pressuring health authorities to speed up vaccine development before Novemberâs presidential election. In response, President Trump has accused the Democrats of using ""anti-vaccine rhetoric"" for political ends. But today Harris struck a different tone in an interview with the WISN TV channel, saying: ""I would trust a vaccine if the public health professionals and the scientists told us that we can trust it."" As we reported earlier, nine companies developing vaccines against Covid-19 have pledged to ""uphold the integrity of the scientific process"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned the test-and-trace system is ""on the verge of collapse"". He said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had to take responsibility amid a rise in the number of coronavirus infections in the UK. Sir Keir told the BBC: ""Everybody is deeply concerned about the rise in the rate of infection. ""As we reopen the economy, as children go back to school, this was always going to be a risk, we understand that."" He said Mr Johnson should have used the summer to get a ""very effective"" test-and-trace system running. He added: ""What we're now seeing is stories over the past few days that is showing the testing regime is on the verge of collapse. ""Heartbreaking stories from people who need a test being told no tests are available. ""Or the website is crashing, or people are being told to go miles and miles for a test. Nobody can argue that that is good governance."" Sir Keir said he still supported the principles of the government's coronavirus restrictions. But he said that the government's messaging had been ""confused"". The parliament usually meets once a month in Strasbourg Next weekâs session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg has been cancelled over concerns about the spread of coronavirus in the French city. The parliament will hold the plenary session in the Belgian capital, Brussels, instead, EU Parliament President David Sassoli has announced. ""We are very saddened by this decision, but the transfer of the administrative operation of the European Parliament would mean all the staff would have to be quarantined on their return to Brussels,"" Sassoli said. The EU Parliament usually meets once a month for a plenary session in Strasbourg to vote on legislation and discuss political issues. The next session, scheduled for 14-17 September, was to be the first in the city since coronavirus containment measures were introduced in March. But MEPs have shown resistance to the notion of reconvening parliament in the city, which was recently designated a Covid-19 âred zoneâ. In a tweet,external, French MEP Christophe Grudler said the decision to relocate the session to Brussels went against the advice of French health authorities, describing it as âlamentableâ.

The doctor treating Berlusconi for a lung infection at San Raffaele hospital in Milan says his condition has shown a âfavourable evolutionâ. Berlusconiâs signs of recovery âare reassuringâ, said Alberto Zangrillo, head of the hospitalâs cardiovascular intensive-care unit. Berlusconi, 83, was admitted to hospital on Thursday. The media mogul's positive diagnosis came last week after a holiday at his luxury villa in Sardinia. His companion, Marta Fascina, and two of his children - daughter Barbara, 36, and son Luigi, 31 - have also contracted the virus. ONS figures earlier showed weekly deaths had dropped to their lowest level since mid-March - but that did not mean the virus is still a threat, according to England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. He told the Commons: ""We have seen a concerning rise in the number of positive cases, particularly among younger people, and these figures serve as a salutary reminder that this virus is still very much with us and remains a threat."" He said: ""Of course, there is a lag between people catching the disease and the statistics for new cases, and those who sadly die. ""The second thing is that this rise most recently has been largely, predominantly, not entirely, amongst young people who are much less likely to die. ""The danger is that they will pass it on to others and it will spread more broadly into the community.
""So, it is important to act on these cases even though, thankfully, currently the number who are dying is small."" He was speaking before Tuesday's daily coronavirus figures were released.

"The government's most senior lawyer is to quit his post over plans which could modify the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It is understood Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department, was unhappy with a new bill to be unveiled on Wednesday. He has resigned and will leave his post before his five-year term was due to end next April. He is the sixth senior civil servant to announce his exit this year. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Sir Jonathan believed the plans went too far in breaching the government's obligations under international law. A spokesman for the Attorney General's Office confirmed Sir Jonathan had resigned but did not comment further. Minister: New bill will 'break international law' Chief civil servant sacked after exams row No 10 must honour NI protocol, say Remain parties The Financial Times, whichfirst reported the story,external, linked his departure to ""suggestions that Boris Johnson is trying to row back on parts of last year's Brexit deal relating to Northern Ireland"". The newspaper added people ""close to Sir Jonathan said he was 'very unhappy' about the decision to overwrite parts of the Northern Ireland protocol"". The resignation comes as the UK government is due to unveil an Internal Market Bill that could affect post-Brexit customs and trade rules in Northern Ireland. Under the UK's exit deal, Northern Ireland is due to stay part of the EU's single market for goods in a bid to avoid creating a hard border with the Irish Republic. In parallel with talks over a post-Brexit trade deal, the UK and EU are negotiating the precise nature of new customs checks that will be required. On Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said the bill would provide the UK with a ""safety net"" in case the talks to iron out border arrangements fail. He told MPsthe bill would break international law in a ""very specific and limited way"" by giving UK ministers the power to override EU law in ""tightly defined circumstances"" if border negotiations broke down. But he insisted the UK's ""leading priority"" was to try to work out the application of the protocol through negotiation with the EU. Whether you loathe the government's abrasive style or love its ruthlessness, far from seeking a peaceful conclusion to Brexit, for No 10 there are plenty of fights still to have. And that may mean accelerating the number of top civil servants who are cleared out - or clear off of their own volition. Six permanent secretaries - who head government departments - have gone now. Given the importance of the principle of the rule of law, one former permanent secretary told me Jonathan Jones' departure is ""absolutely massive, by far the most important yet"". And few at Westminster believe there won't be more to come. Read more from Laura here. Sir Jonathan is the latest permanent secretary - a senior civil servant leading a government department - to leave office this year. Rowena Collins Rice, director general at the Attorney General's Office, will also be leaving her post, the government confirmed earlier on Tuesday. This video can not be played Sir Kim Darroch: ""The idea that you could unilaterally rewrite part of the agreement is just unacceptable"" She is expected to take up a new public role. Her departure was the result of a ""process dating back several months,"" officials said. At the beginning of September, Simon Case was appointed as cabinet secretary and head of the civil service,after his predecessor Sir Mark Sedwill stood down. Sir Mark's exit followedreports of tensions between him and senior members of Mr Johnson's team. Sir Jonathan, who is a QC, was knighted in December 2019 for his legal services to the government. The honour recognised his work on constitutional issues and the EU Withdrawal Agreement. In response to Sir Jonathan's resignation, the shadow attorney general, Lord Charlie Falconer, said he was ""an impressive lawyer and a loyal civil servant"". He added: ""If he can't stay in public service, there must be something very rotten about this government. This resignation indicates that senior government lawyers think that the government is about to break the law."" Liberal Democrat Brexit spokesperson Christine Jardine said it was ""unsurprising"" Sir Jonathan has resigned, given the government's approach. ""Any government figure of any integrity would be appalled at these plans,"" she added. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union - which represents senior civil servants - said both ministers and officials were obliged to uphold the rule of law. ""It's extraordinary that the government's most senior legal adviser has decided he has no choice but to resign over an issue that he presumably believes conflicts with his own and ministerial obligations,"" he added.

"Police remain at the scene in Grange Farm, Kesgrave A ""long-barrelled gun"" has been recovered by police investigating the shooting of a 15-year-old boy on his way to school. The victimwas shot at about 08:40 BST on the Grange Farm estatein Kesgrave, Suffolk, on Monday. The Year 11 Kesgrave High School pupil is in a critical condition and a 15-year-old boy is under arrest. Supt Kerry Cutler said police were not looking for anyone else in connection with the shooting. She said: ""We have arrested an individual that we believe is involved in the incident and we also recovered a weapon."" The suspect, who is said to be from the Woodbridge area, was arrested by armed police on suspicion of attempted murder. Detectives have been granted a superintendent's extension to detain him for questioning for an additional 12 hours. A police cordon is in place at Friends Walk Supt Kerry Cutler said police were not looking for anyone else in connection with the shooting Suffolk Police said the two boys were known to each other and there was nothing to suggest the shooting was linked to organised criminality. The force said a boy was seen getting into a car following the attack. Officers added that a car had been seized and ""a long-barrelled firearm was recovered from inside it"". A temporary police station has been set up in Kesgrave and Supt Cutler said there was a large police presence, including officers from other forces. Police said a large police presence would remain in the area Supt Cutler said: ""Everybody is shocked, Kesgrave is on the outskirts of Ipswich, it is almost a semi-rural area, it's very much a residential area, this is not something we've seen in that area before and people will be impacted by it. ""The investigation goes on and we're still appealing for anybody who saw anything or has any information to come forward."" Suffolk Police said it was thought a single shot was fired on Friends Walk, off Through Jollys. Friends Walk remains closed off as police searches continue. Through Jollys and Ropes Drive reopened on Monday evening. The injured boy was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said the victim's parents tended to the boy after he had been shot. ""They were very distraught, nothing like this ever happens in the estate,"" he said. Former paramedic Richard Bennett, who lives near the scene, said he heard the gunshot and thought ""what on earth was going on"". ""As the day went on the tragedy unfolded, a 15-year-old boy had been shot, it's unbelievable,"" he said. Ellie, whose brother is in the same year as the victim at Kesgrave High, said local people were in ""disbelief"". She said: ""I've grown up here and went to Kesgrave High and I had an absolutely blissful experience there, and this area in Kesgrave it's thought of as such a safe place, there's children everywhere, there's families everywhere, it's not somewhere you'd ever think this would happen.""

"This video can not be played Watch how air pollution moves across Europe One in every eight deaths in Europe can be linked to pollution, according to a new report by the EU's environment agency (EEA). It said factors such as air and noise pollution, as well as poor water quality and exposure to chemicals, contributed to 13% of all deaths. The report also noted that poorer communities and vulnerable people were the hardest hit by pollution. ""Strong action is needed to protect the most vulnerable,"" the agency said. ""There is a clear link between the state of the environment and the health of our population,"" the EU's Environment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius said. ""Everyone must understand that by taking care of our planet we are not only saving ecosystems, but also lives,"" he added. The report by the Copenhagen-based agency,externalwas released on Tuesday, and was described as ""a major assessment on health and [the] environment"" in Europe. It found that a total of 630,000 premature deaths in the EU were attributable to environmental factors in 2012, the latest year for which data is available. Air pollution contributed to 400,000 annual deaths, with noise pollution being an attributable factor in 12,000. The remaining deaths were linked to extreme weather such as heatwaves. Watch how air pollution moves across Europe How healthy is your commute? Five ways to avoid breathing polluted air ""People are exposed to multiple risks at any time, including air, water and noise pollution, and chemicals, which combine and in some cases act in unison to impact on health,"" the report said. The World Health Organization (WHO) says air pollution causes the death of millions of people around the world each year and accounts for a third of fatalities from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease. Another WHO report on noise pollution, meanwhile, noted that it contributed to heart problems by raising blood pressure and stress hormones. This video can not be played UK scientists estimate air pollution cuts British people's lives by an average of six months The latest EEA report also explored which communities were affected. ""Poorer people are disproportionately exposed to air pollution and extreme weather, including heatwaves and extreme cold,"" it said. ""This is linked to where they live, work and go to school, often in socially deprived urban neighbourhoods close to heavy traffic,"" it added. But there were some positives in the agency's report. It said premature deaths linked to air pollution had fallen from 1m in 1990, and also noted that water quality across most of Europe was faring well. The EU report noted ""clear differences"" between Eastern and Western Europe. ""The burden of environmental disease is unevenly spread across Europe,"" it said. ""The percentage of deaths attributable to environmental factors [ranges] from a low of 9% in Norway and Iceland to 23% in Albania and 27% in Bosnia and Herzegovina."" This video can not be played Serbia has been named as the country with the highest rate of pollution-related deaths in Europe In the EU, the highest environmental contribution to mortality is seen in Romania at 19%. Other hard-hit countries include Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. In the UK, meanwhile, around 12% of deaths are said to be linked to environmental pollution. ""Socially deprived communities typically struggle under a triple burden of poverty, poor quality environments and ill health,"" the EEA report said. ""Eastern Europe and south-eastern Europe are both poorer and more polluted than the rest of Europe, with particulate matter emitted from the burning of solid fuel for residential heating and cooking,"" it added. The EEA said ""green and blue spaces"" should be prioritised as they ""cool cities during heatwaves, alleviate flood waters, reduce noise pollution and support urban biodiversity"". It also said road traffic should be reduced, and fossil fuel subsidies should be removed in an effort to address the problem. The European Commission has echoed this view that a reduction in road traffic - specifically diesel-powered vehicles - would be beneficial. It has also suggested introducing measures to encourage greater use of electric cars. Last year,London introduced a Ultra Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ)in an effort to limit emissions of pollutants from cars, vans and lorries. It involves charging drivers more to use older vehicles in certain areas. This video can not be played Air pollution: what are the effects on humans? Similar schemes are already in place around Europe. Italy has the most low emissions zones - some of them permanent, many of them seasonal. There are also about 80 in Germany, and 14 each in the Netherlands and the UK. Meanwhile,France is offering a subsidy to encourage people to cycle moreonce coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Under the â¬20m (Â£17m; $21.7m) scheme, everyone will be eligible for bike repairs of up to â¬50 at registered mechanics.

"Maria Kolesnikova told BBC Russian last month that ""to understand exactly what's going on, you really have to be here"" A detained Belarus opposition leader prevented officials from forcibly expelling her to Ukraine by tearing up her passport and throwing it out of a car window at the border, colleagues who travelled with her have said. On Monday Maria Kolesnikova was forced into a van by masked men in Minsk. She is one of three women who joined forces to challenge President Alexander Lukashenko in August's election. Mass protests erupted after the disputed vote. ""She was pushed into the back seat (of the car), she yelled that she wasn't going anywhere,"" Ms Kolesnikova's colleague Anton Rodnenkov told a news conference in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Tuesday. Mr Rodnenkov said he and another colleague had been kidnapped on Monday, driven between buildings, and interrogated with hoods over their heads and their hands tied. They accepted an offer to leave Belarus with Ms Kolesnikova but when the car reached the border she refused to cross. The two men told journalists they did not know where she was now. What's happening in Belarus? 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change Earlier on Tuesday, officials in Belarus had claimed that Ms Kolesnikova was detained while trying to cross into Ukraine. Meanwhile, in an interview with Russian media on Tuesday, President Lukashenko insisted he would not step down from power. Dozens of people were arrested in fresh protests in Minsk, the capital. In recent weeks thousands have faced down violence and threats of arrest in demonstrations against Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994. This video can not be played Ivan Kravtsov says Ms Kolesnikova tore her passport into pieces and then climbed through the rear car window The EU has demanded the release of all political prisonersand says it is planning to impose sanctions. Ms Kolesnikova is the last of three women leading the opposition to Mr Lukashenko to remain inside Belarus. The main opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, says she won 60-70% of the election in places where votes were properly counted. She fled to Lithuania after she was detained in August. The stay-at-home mum challenging Belarus's long-time ruler On Monday, witnesses saw masked men seize Ms Kolesnikova on a street in central Minsk and push her into a minibus. Anton Rodnenkov and his colleague Ivan Kravtsov were abducted while driving to her flat following reports of her disappearance, they told reporters in Kyiv. Officials threatened to prosecute them until the two men accepted an offer to leave Belarus with Ms Kolesnikova. ""What they were interested in was getting Maria Kolesnikova outside the country. They said this was necessary to de-escalate the situation in Belarus,"" Mr Kravtsov said. This video can not be played What lies behind the Belarus protests? The three were taken to the border with Ukraine by men in plain clothes early on Tuesday morning, Mr Rodnenkov said. But when the car reached a checkpoint between the two countries, Ms Kolesnikova prevented her deportation by ripping up her passport and throwing away the pieces, he said. ""It was clear that she was being taken by force, she was resisting,"" Mr Rodnenkov said. ""She climbed, climbed from the car and she walked proudly to Belarusian territory,"" Mr Kravtsov said, adding: ""She's really a hero. You must understand that. She's very dedicated to what she's doing now."" Last month Ms Kolesnikova told BBC Russian in an interview: ""To understand exactly what's going on, you really have to be here."" The Belarusian leader said if he stood down his supporters would be ""slaughtered"" Ms Tikhanovskaya has called for her colleague to be immediately freed. ""By kidnapping people in broad daylight, Lukashenko is showing his weakness and fear,"" she said in a statement. Another female activist, Olga Kovalkova, announced on Saturday she had fled to Poland amid threats of imprisonment. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Lukashenko told Russian reporters that Ms Kolesnikova had been held for ""violating the rules on crossing the state border"". In a sit-down interview, the long-term leader was quoted as saying he would not step down. Belarus election: 'He threatened to burn us alive' 'If we step back now we will become slaves' The great-grandmother taking on President Lukashenko He conceded that some Belarusians might be ""fed up"" with his rule but he was adamant that he wouldn't leave office, according to  the journalists. He also asserted that he was the only person who could ""defend"" Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko calls Vladimir Putin ""big brother"" in this interview and he's increasingly dependent on Russia for support. But his comments reveal a confidence that Moscow needs him, too. ""You know what we agreed with the Russian establishment and leadership?"" he asked the panel of Russian state TV reporters on the sofas before him. ""That if Belarus breaks, Russia will be next."" Back me up, Mr Lukashenko seemed to be saying to Moscow, and your own people won't get any bad ideas about ousting a long-standing leader through popular protests. As usual, he claimed the unrest in Belarus was fomented by hostile outside forces, mainly America, via the internet. But with opposition to his rule strong and persistent, Mr Lukashenko is now heavily reliant on his security forces. So he had a message for them too. If I go, he argued, the riot police would be ""slaughtered, torn to pieces. And what have they done wrong?"" Mr Lukashenko has twice appeared brandishing a gun during mass protests against his rule, and he told the reporters it was meant to show he had not fled. He has accused Western powers of interference and is expected to visit Moscow ""in the coming days"" amid claims by Lithuania that he is planning deeper integration with Russia.

In the Republic of Ireland, health authorities reported one further coronavirus-related death and 307 new cases of Covid-19 in their latest daily figures. It brings the total number of deaths in the Republic to 1,778 and the total of confirmed cases to 30,080. Health Minister Robin Swann says questions must be answered about the outbreaks at Craigavon Hospital The chief executive of the Southern Trust said the organisation would co-operate fully with the SAI review which has been announced. Mr Devlin told Good Morning Ulster the trust ""will be investigating thoroughly to understand what has happened, to make sure we can learn, because we need to learn"". He said he was confident the outbreaks at Craigavon Area Hospital are now ""under control"". ""There is still a considerable human impact and we need to work with families to get through that,"" he added. He said the important thing was to try and pin-point how the virus had entered the hospital wards in the first place. SDLP MLA for Newry and Armagh Justin McNulty said it has been ""devastatingly traumatic for the families involved"". He has spoken to some of those who have lost family members and told Good Morning Ulster they ""want answers and they deserve answers"". ""Their loved ones went into hospital Covid-free and the virus has been transmitted to them inside the ward,"" he said. ""They are really angry about that and feel that their loved ones should still be with them."" Family want answers about Covid-19 hospital death Third Covid-19 outbreak at Craigavon Area Hospital Mr McNulty described a meeting with Mr Devlin to discuss the deaths as ""frank and blunt"". He said he had relayed some concerns raised by the families of those who died about ""some inconsistencies that didn't sit well with them"". The SDLP MLA said he was hopeful the independent inquiry would get to the bottom of what caused the outbreak, and that lessons will be learned. ""This ward, the patients are immuno-compromised. You would hope there would have been a ring of steel around the ward, but sadly that wasn't the case. ""We might never get an explanation for how the virus got into the ward, but hopefully the investigation will unearth that.""

"Health Minister Vaughan Gething has been giving the Welsh Government's weekly Covid-19 briefing It comes as Caerphilly county borough faces a local lockdown from 18:00 BST due to a spike in cases People will not be able to enter or leave the area without a ""reasonable excuse"" such as work, school or caring responsibilities Everyone over the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings in shops Friends and family cannot no longer meet indoors or stay overnight The extra restrictions will remain in place at least until October, Mr Gething said Other areas could see local lockdowns if people flouted rules on social distancing, he added Doctors report 'horrific' queues at testing centres and people being told to travel long distances for tests Rachel Flint and Andy Roberts Thank you for following our live coverage of the Welsh Government's weekly coronavirus briefing as Caerphilly county borough becomes the first part of Wales to go under local lockdown measures. What we learnt today:  Follow BBC Wales News on social media or check the website for the very latest updates on coronavirus in Wales. Caerphilly county borough is the first part of Wales to face extra restrictions in a local lockdown from 18:00 BST tonight. It follows a spike in coronavirus cases, which Health Minister Vaughan Gething blamed on the breaking down of social distancing. The area now has one of the UK's highest rates of Covid-19, with 72.9 new cases per 100,000 of the population in the last seven days. Rhondda Cynon Taff could be âa few days or a week awayâ from a local lockdown, the leader of the council has said. Official figures show there were 38.1 cases per 100,000 of the population in the area over the last seven days, This is second highest rate in Wales, behind Caerphilly county borough where local lockdown measures begin tonight. Council leader Andrew Morgan said a temporary testing site is due to open in Rhondda Cynon Taff to help them understand what is going on in the community. He said rather than community transmission it appeared the cases were in clusters, such as in Porth. âI am concerned - I think the message to the public is we donât need to panic just yet,"" Mr Morgan said. ""Personally I think we have a number of days, maybe a week or two, to get on top of this, because if the numbers do continue to grow as weâve seen in Caerphilly, we do run the risk of a local lockdown."" Nick HartleyBBC News While they may be just hours away from a return to lockdown shoppers in Caerphilly have not hesitated to get out and stock up ahead of tonight's deadline. The high street is busy, shops are open and town centre car parks are full as people continue to go about their business. There is a visible rise in the wearing of masks. Many shoppers are choosing to wear face coverings ahead of them being implemented in certain situations. The shift has not been lost on local residents like Roger Williams, who made a last-minute trip to the bank ahead of the rule changes. ""There's more people wearing masks here than there has been in a long, long time"" he says. ""I can see the difference."" For shopkeepers like Joe Thomas the prospect of another downturn in business is a real threat. ""I think the town will probably collapse unless the government gives businesses more help."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The rise in coronavirus cases across the UKhas been laid firmly at the door of young people. Around half of new cases in recent weeks have been diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s. Significant numbers of cases have also been identified in people in their 40s and 50s, as well as teenagers. That compares to the early days when most of the confirmed cases were in the older age groups. But that was because the UK was largely only testing in hospitals. Younger adults are very unlikely to be sick enough to need hospital treatment, so they hardly showed up in the official figures. If you look at results from antibody testing, to see if they had been exposed to the virus, the younger age groups were just as likely as older groups - if not more - to have been exposed. So what is happening now appears to be simply a case of the virus re-establishing itself in a group that is the least at risk of serious complications, hence there are no signs of a significant increase in hospitalisations. Caerphilly county borough continues to have the highest rate of coronavirus cases in Wales, official figures show. The rate now stands at 72.9 cases per 100,000 of the population over the last seven days. Public Health Wales figures show the seven-day rate also increasing in Rhondda Cynon Taff, now standing at 38.1 cases per 100,000. In Merthyr Tydfil, the rate increased to 34.8. With only one case in the last seven days, Anglesey has the lowest rate in Wales, with 1.4 cases per 100,000. All other local authorities reported a case rate of less than 20 per 100,000 of the population in the last seven days. A further 150 further people have tested positive for coronavirus in Wales, official figures show. No new deaths were reported to Public Health Wales on Tuesday, meaning the number of people known to have died with Covid-19 remains at 1,597. Caerphilly county borough had the highest number of confirmed new cases, with 44 positive tests, as it faces extra restrictions from 18:00 BST tonight. Rhondda Cynon Taff was next with 17 new cases, then Cardiff with 15. This video can not be played Caerphilly coronavirus lockdown: 'I just hope it's over soon' Residents of Caerphilly mostly accept the news the county borough will be placed under a local lockdown with extra restrictions from 18:00 BST tonight. The Welsh Government âwonât hesitateâ to make it mandatory to wear face coverings across Wales if necessary, the health minister has said. Currently, wearing face coverings in shops is only advised in Wales while it is required by law in England. But from 18:00 BST tonight, people in Caerphilly county will have to wear coverings in shops aslocal lockdown measures are introduced. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said that was due to a âheightened level of community transmissionâ in Caerphilly âthat isn't in evidence in other parts of Walesâ. âCaerphilly is in a different position because of the heightened levels of coronavirus,â he said. . He added: âI don't want to introduce additional mandatory measures or lockdown measures in other parts of the country. âIf it's necessary though, I won't hesitate to do so.â A director of the UK government's test and trace programme in England has issued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the coronavirus testing system. In a tweet, Sarah-Jane Marsh explained it wasthe laboratories, not the testing sites themselves, that were the ""critical pinch-point"". This comes as scientists have sounded the alarm about rising coronavirus cases. Matt Hancock, health secretary for England, said there had been a ""a problem with a couple of contracts"" which would take a matter of weeks to be ""sorted in the short term"". But he said he had ""already put in certain solutions"" to make sure people didn't have to travel more than 75 miles for a test. One example was a woman from Cardiff who was directed to Dundee, more than 300 miles away, when she tried to apply for a test for her two sons who she thought were showing symptoms. As Caerphilly prepares to go into local lockdown, the health minister has warned other places could follow. But Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government did not want ""lots of local lockdowns"" to have to take place. He said people should ""follow the rules and the guidance"" to prevent the spread of Covid-19. ""Don't see lots of people in your own home, don't go to pubs and restaurants mixing with lots of different people,"" he warned. ""That's how you don't see a return on coronavirus in much larger numbers."" Mr Gething said ministers would look at information received by the Test Trace Protect service to get a better understanding of how coronavirus is spreading. ""If we do need to take further measures then we will not hesitate to do so to help keep Wales safe,"" he said Wales' health minister says he recognises the reintroduction of lockdown restrictions in the Caerphilly area will have an impact on businesses there. However, Vaughan Gething said the decision had to be taken due to a âbreakdown of social distancing and people not following the rulesâ. Speaking to reporters at the Welsh Governmentâs press briefing, he said: âI recognise that any form of restriction will have an impact on the way that businesses are able to operate. âAnd those people who think that these measures aren't required or have not followed the rules need to recognise the impact that has had in the choice that we have had to make to keep people safe and well."" Mr Gething said he wanted to remove the restrictions as ""soon as possible"", but it would only happen ""when it is safe to do so"". More local lockdowns could be introduced in Wales if people continue to have large house parties and flout social-distancing rules, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested. From 18:00 BST todayCaerphilly county borough will become the first part of Wales to be subject to additional restrictions. But Mr Gething warned that the measures showed there were ""consequences"" for people deliberately flouting rules, by holding large house parties and get-togethers. ""There could be other measures in other parts of Wales if we see the same pattern of events,"" he warned. ""I want people to sit up and take notice now so we don't need to implement further lockdown measures."" There are still challenges in whether the testing labs can cope with demand, Wales' health minister has claimed. People in Caerphilly have spoken ofthree-hour queues to access coronavirus tests, while GPs have warned of people being sent miles from their homes, or being unable to access the testing website. Vaughan Gething told the weekly Welsh Government press conference that the issues have been raised with officials and health ministers across the UK. ""There's a broader challenge, though, about the UK government-run lighthouse lab testing programme,"" he said. ""We do know across the whole of the UK there are challenges about the way that programme is running and its ability to cope with demand."" Mr Gething said he was hoping to speak to other health ministers across the UK to get ""clarity in the messaging"" about tests. ""None of us want to see people being asked to travel large distances which for some people won't be possible,"" he said. ""We want easy and regular access to those tests, whether they're run by the UK programme as indeed the drive-through centres are in Wales and other parts of the UK, or indeed from the programmes that we run and control here within NHS Wales."" People should not take matters into their own hands if they see people breaking lockdown rules, Wales' health minister has warned. Vaughan Gething said those with concerns about businesses not following rules should contact the council, while those concerned about individuals should contact the police. It comes afterpeople were seen crowding outside bars in Cardiffat the weekend. Mr Gething said ""intelligence from the wider community is really important"", but people must not get into ""conflict"" with those breaching rules. He added that the first action would be for police to ""engage"" with those people, in the hope they would change their behaviour, and then ""enforce"" the rules if necessary. This video can not be played Shock at crowds outside Cardiff nightclub Where are the hot spots in Wales and what is happening in care homes? We seem to be bombarded with different measures, but what do they mean and how does Wales compare with other parts of the UK? Here, we try to answer some of the questionsand explain what the different measures are and also give some of the most recent figures. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says people in Caerphilly need to recognise the ""clear and present threat"" which coronavirus represents. Mr Gething said the lockdown measures were a ""wake up call"" for people. He said the legal powers were ""a back stop"" but he expected the police to take action and use the ""full force of the law"" if the measures were flouted. People socialising in pubs is not ""a factor in transmission"" of coronavirus in Caerphilly, the health minister has said. From 18:00 BSTCaerphilly county will be placed in local lockdown, but pubs and bars will remain open. Vaughan Gething said pubs were not currently the issue, and has said many cases are down to people socialising in homes and at house parties. But he said he did not want to see pubs becoming ""a real factor and potentially have to close either individual businesses or indeed the whole sector"" because that would cause ""economic harm"". Mr Gething said the Welsh Government was taking ""proportionate action where we know transmission is taking place"". Health Minister Vaughan Gething said Gwent Police had been ""clear"" they will be policing and enforcing ""stay local"" rules in Caerphilly. He said in the past the ""great majority of people"" had behaved within the rules. But Mr Gething said police would be looking at the rules and guidance and then policing and enforcing it. He urged people to follow the rules and not ""lead us to a position where enforcement is necessary"". The health minister also reminded people in Caerphilly to ""stay local"" unless they have a ""reasonable excuse to leave or enter"". Communities in Caerphilly county borough ""must pull together"" to get through local lockdown, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. Restrictions to daily life will be brought inat 18:00 BST today. Mr Gething said: ""I know the introduction of these new rules will be disappointing for people many people living in Caerphilly borough; for some they will be a real inconvenience. ""But I would urge everyone in the borough to please pull together and follow these new guidelines. ""Only by working together can we reduce the spread of coronavirus and protect ourselves and our loved ones"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Watch how air pollution moves across Europe One in every eight deaths in Europe can be linked to pollution, according to a new report by the EU's environment agency (EEA). It said factors such as air and noise pollution, as well as poor water quality and exposure to chemicals, contributed to 13% of all deaths. The report also noted that poorer communities and vulnerable people were the hardest hit by pollution. ""Strong action is needed to protect the most vulnerable,"" the agency said. ""There is a clear link between the state of the environment and the health of our population,"" the EU's Environment Commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius said. ""Everyone must understand that by taking care of our planet we are not only saving ecosystems, but also lives,"" he added. The report by the Copenhagen-based agency,externalwas released on Tuesday, and was described as ""a major assessment on health and [the] environment"" in Europe. It found that a total of 630,000 premature deaths in the EU were attributable to environmental factors in 2012, the latest year for which data is available. Air pollution contributed to 400,000 annual deaths, with noise pollution being an attributable factor in 12,000. The remaining deaths were linked to extreme weather such as heatwaves. Watch how air pollution moves across Europe How healthy is your commute? Five ways to avoid breathing polluted air ""People are exposed to multiple risks at any time, including air, water and noise pollution, and chemicals, which combine and in some cases act in unison to impact on health,"" the report said. The World Health Organization (WHO) says air pollution causes the death of millions of people around the world each year and accounts for a third of fatalities from stroke, lung cancer and heart disease. Another WHO report on noise pollution, meanwhile, noted that it contributed to heart problems by raising blood pressure and stress hormones. This video can not be played UK scientists estimate air pollution cuts British people's lives by an average of six months The latest EEA report also explored which communities were affected. ""Poorer people are disproportionately exposed to air pollution and extreme weather, including heatwaves and extreme cold,"" it said. ""This is linked to where they live, work and go to school, often in socially deprived urban neighbourhoods close to heavy traffic,"" it added. But there were some positives in the agency's report. It said premature deaths linked to air pollution had fallen from 1m in 1990, and also noted that water quality across most of Europe was faring well. The EU report noted ""clear differences"" between Eastern and Western Europe. ""The burden of environmental disease is unevenly spread across Europe,"" it said. ""The percentage of deaths attributable to environmental factors [ranges] from a low of 9% in Norway and Iceland to 23% in Albania and 27% in Bosnia and Herzegovina."" This video can not be played Serbia has been named as the country with the highest rate of pollution-related deaths in Europe In the EU, the highest environmental contribution to mortality is seen in Romania at 19%. Other hard-hit countries include Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia. In the UK, meanwhile, around 12% of deaths are said to be linked to environmental pollution. ""Socially deprived communities typically struggle under a triple burden of poverty, poor quality environments and ill health,"" the EEA report said. ""Eastern Europe and south-eastern Europe are both poorer and more polluted than the rest of Europe, with particulate matter emitted from the burning of solid fuel for residential heating and cooking,"" it added. The EEA said ""green and blue spaces"" should be prioritised as they ""cool cities during heatwaves, alleviate flood waters, reduce noise pollution and support urban biodiversity"". It also said road traffic should be reduced, and fossil fuel subsidies should be removed in an effort to address the problem. The European Commission has echoed this view that a reduction in road traffic - specifically diesel-powered vehicles - would be beneficial. It has also suggested introducing measures to encourage greater use of electric cars. Last year,London introduced a Ultra Low Emissions Zone (ULEZ)in an effort to limit emissions of pollutants from cars, vans and lorries. It involves charging drivers more to use older vehicles in certain areas. This video can not be played Air pollution: what are the effects on humans? Similar schemes are already in place around Europe. Italy has the most low emissions zones - some of them permanent, many of them seasonal. There are also about 80 in Germany, and 14 each in the Netherlands and the UK. Meanwhile,France is offering a subsidy to encourage people to cycle moreonce coronavirus restrictions are lifted. Under the â¬20m (Â£17m; $21.7m) scheme, everyone will be eligible for bike repairs of up to â¬50 at registered mechanics. Similarly, the Belgian capital Brussels announced the creation of 40km (25 miles) of additional cycle paths so fewer people could use public transport as restrictions are relaxed.

"This video can not be played A resident and a shopkeeper share their thoughts on how new lockdown measures will affect them Caerphilly has gone into lockdown, becoming the first county in Wales to face tougher restrictions following a spike in Covid-19 cases. No-one is allowed to leave the countywithout good reason, with stricter measures brought in from 18:00 BST. Family and friends living apart are no longer able to meet indoors, stay overnight, or form extended households. A senior police officer said Gwent Police was not planning to introduce roadblocks or cordons during lockdown. Ch Supt Mark Hobrough said neighbourhood officers would talk to motorists and visit shops and businesses to ensure everyone was aware of the new rules, with enforcement the ""last objective"". ""We really do want the community to work with us in relation to this to be able to combat this infection and fight it off as soon as possible,"" he said. The health minister said the restrictions would last until at least October, with a review in a fortnight. Vaughan Gething said the case rate had risen to 72.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people - the highest rate in Wales and one of the highest in the UK. The county, which has a population of 181,000, has had 132 people test positive in the last week. Meanwhile, he said a UK-wide testing programme being used in Waleswas facing ""challenges"" in meeting demand. What does the lockdown mean for Caerphilly? What do the stats tell us in Wales? 'Horrific' queues in Caerphilly as people 'rush' for Covid tests Mr Gething said he had been forced to act due to the increase in cases, after ""social distancing had broken down in large parts"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that testing in Caerphilly found 4% of people were positive for coronavirus: ""If we had testing positivity rates of 4% [across Wales], I think we would be into national lockdown."" This video can not be played Mixed reaction as Caerphilly placed under lockdown Ahead of the latest figures, analysis by the BBC suggested Caerphilly had moved into the top 10 of hardest-hit local areas in the UK over the past week. It was ranked at about the same level as Birmingham, Burnley, Rochdale and Salford. Bolton was top (122 cases per 100,000), followed by Bradford, Blackburn and Oldham. Caerphilly has also seen one of the largest jumps in its case rate, compared to the previous week. It has had more new cases in the past week - 132 - than anywhere else in Wales and more than the area has seen since the end of April. Mr Gething said: ""If we don't address the issue in Caerphilly, we'll see wider community transmission within the Caerphilly area but that will spread to other areas as well. ""We're in this position largely because social distancing has broken down and in particular people are socialising in each other's households in larger numbers."" He said not addressing the problem now could have ""national consequences"" and appealed for people to follow the rules: ""It's for you, your family and the whole community."" The changes come into effect throughout the county borough at 18:00 BST on Tuesday Mr Gething said significant transmission ""isn't taking place in pubs"" but an element of it was people coming back from European travel, along with mixing with others in their homes, including house parties of up to 30 people. People with reasonable causes, like needing to move house, could still leave the borough, he said, ""but going from Caerphilly to Cardiff for a night out or to go to the gym isn't covered"". ""If things deteriorate faster we may have to take more measures,"" he added, saying he ""won't hesitate"" to make it mandatory to wear face-coverings across Wales if necessary. ""We're in it for several weeks at least in Caerphilly. We expect the rate to rise in the next few days because community transmission has already taken place."" The lockdown would be reviewed in two weeks, the Welsh Government said. Addressing the weekly coronavirus briefing at lunchtime, Mr Gething expressed fears coronavirus in younger people could ""leap into"" more vulnerable and older groups of people. ""Over the summer, we've seen an increase in the number of cases in people under 40 in Wales."" ""At the moment it appears coronavirus is likely to be a milder illness for most people in this age group,"" he added, saying there is usually a lag of a couple of weeks before people are admitted to hospital. Targeted testing had been carried out in Caerphilly and would be starting in the lower Rhondda valley where there was also a rise in cases, he said. Mr Gething outlined how 13 cases of the virus were connected to a single trip to Ibiza taken by a group of friends last month: ""Three of them came home with coronavirus. When they came home, one of the group passed the virus on to their partner and his father. ""Another person in the group had a party the day after coming home and four people caught coronavirus. ""One of these then passed the virus on to their brother who then passed it to a friend by sharing a car. Another party guest passed it on to their sister, who in turn infected a friend on a night out"". The local lockdown was announced on Monday, giving people less than 24 hours to prepare for the changes. Under the new restrictions,listed at the Welsh Government website,external: People cannot enter or leave Caerphilly county borough - which includes Caerphilly town, Ystrad Mynach, Blackwood, Newbridge and Risca - without a ""reasonable excuse"" Everyone over the age of 11 will need to wear a face covering in shops Friends and family are not allowed to meet indoors or stay overnight Extended households will not be able to meet up A reasonable excuse for travel includes for work, if you are not able to work from home, to go to school, or to give care. People attend marriages and funeral services outside the county if they are invited, but are not allowed to go to receptions or wakes. Residents can move house, and continue childcare arrangements where parents are not living together. Schools, pubs, bars and restaurants will remain open. The rules will be kept under review, the first on 10 September and then again in the following 21 days. The council and the police will have responsibility for enforcement, with fixed penalty notices of Â£60 for a first offence, doubling on each subsequent offence. Gwent Police chief constable Pam Kelly said officers would be out in the community encouraging people to follow social distancing and the new regulations coming into force. ""Today we will be working to understand the new guidance and regulations and what enforcement action we can take for the few who do not comply with the new restrictions,"" she added. People leaving a bus in Caerphilly While they may be just hours away from a return to lockdown shoppers in Caerphilly have not hesitated to get out and stock up ahead of tonight's deadline. The high street is busy, shops are open and town centre car parks are full as people continue to go about their business. There is a visible rise in the wearing of masks. Many shoppers are choosing to wear face coverings ahead of them being implemented in certain situations. The shift has not been lost on local residents like, Roger Williams made a last-minute trip to the bank ahead the rule changes. ""There's more people wearing masks here than there has been in a long, long time"" he says. ""I can see the difference here,"" he said. For shopkeepers like Joe Thomas the prospect of another downturn in business is a real threat to the town. ""I think the town will probably collapse unless the government give businesses more help again she says"". Sarah Bruton says people have been anxious about going out post-lockdown in her experience Sarah Bruton, manager of Captiva Spa, said the spike showed Covid-19 was going to be ""part of our lives for a very long time"". ""It's going to be really tough for a lot of people. We've started to make plans to see family, to book holidays, in my case to rebuild our business and that's going to be taken away again,"" she added. Michael Roberts stopped allowing customers inside his restaurant last week Michael Roberts, who runs Urban Bar BQ in Caerphilly town centre, closed his restaurant for indoor service on Thursday and is just offering takeaway. ""We're feeling that hopefully this is a step which will take us in the right direction towards getting over it,"" he said. More than 1,600 people have been tested in Caerphilly county in the past week Caerphilly Labour Member of the Senedd Hefin David said more than 600 people messaged him on Monday asking for clarity on what the lockdown meant for things like gyms, leisure centres and hairdressers and moving to halls of residence. ""I am just trying to answer as many people's questions as I can,"" he told BBC Wales, adding that students would be fine to go off to university as it was classed as moving out of the borough. ""The biggest questions are about childcare,"" he added. Community testing started in the county borough at the weekend. A total of 450 people were tested and 19 were found positive. People will not be able to enter or leave Caerphilly county without good reason One class of 21 pupils at St Gwladys Primary School in Bargoed must stay at homeafter a member of staff tested positive for the virus, although the school remains open. Caerphilly RFC has closed for two days for deep cleaning after a member who was at the club on Saturday tested positive. Elsewhere, the Eden Centre said it was closing its soft play centres in Caerphilly and Blackwood due to the rise in cases. Meanwhile, Great Western Railway has confirmed a member of staff in south Wales has tested positive for Covid-19, but has not specified where. Close contacts of the person are self-isolating, the company said. No train services have been affected as a result of the diagnosis.

"This video can not be played A resident and a shopkeeper share their thoughts on how new lockdown measures will affect them Caerphilly has gone into lockdown, becoming the first county in Wales to face tougher restrictions following a spike in Covid-19 cases. No-one is allowed to leave the countywithout good reason, with stricter measures brought in from 18:00 BST. Family and friends living apart are no longer able to meet indoors, stay overnight, or form extended households. A senior police officer said Gwent Police was not planning to introduce roadblocks or cordons during lockdown. Ch Supt Mark Hobrough said neighbourhood officers would talk to motorists and visit shops and businesses to ensure everyone was aware of the new rules, with enforcement the ""last objective"". ""We really do want the community to work with us in relation to this to be able to combat this infection and fight it off as soon as possible,"" he said. The health minister said the restrictions would last until at least October, with a review in a fortnight. Vaughan Gething said the case rate had risen to 72.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people - the highest rate in Wales and one of the highest in the UK. The county, which has a population of 181,000, has had 132 people test positive in the last week. Meanwhile, he said a UK-wide testing programme being used in Waleswas facing ""challenges"" in meeting demand. What does the lockdown mean for Caerphilly? What do the stats tell us in Wales? 'Horrific' queues in Caerphilly as people 'rush' for Covid tests Mr Gething said he had been forced to act due to the increase in cases, after ""social distancing had broken down in large parts"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that testing in Caerphilly found 4% of people were positive for coronavirus: ""If we had testing positivity rates of 4% [across Wales], I think we would be into national lockdown."" This video can not be played Mixed reaction as Caerphilly placed under lockdown Ahead of the latest figures, analysis by the BBC suggested Caerphilly had moved into the top 10 of hardest-hit local areas in the UK over the past week. It was ranked at about the same level as Birmingham, Burnley, Rochdale and Salford. Bolton was top (122 cases per 100,000), followed by Bradford, Blackburn and Oldham. Caerphilly has also seen one of the largest jumps in its case rate, compared to the previous week. It has had more new cases in the past week - 132 - than anywhere else in Wales and more than the area has seen since the end of April. Mr Gething said: ""If we don't address the issue in Caerphilly, we'll see wider community transmission within the Caerphilly area but that will spread to other areas as well. ""We're in this position largely because social distancing has broken down and in particular people are socialising in each other's households in larger numbers."" He said not addressing the problem now could have ""national consequences"" and appealed for people to follow the rules: ""It's for you, your family and the whole community."" The changes come into effect throughout the county borough at 18:00 BST on Tuesday Mr Gething said significant transmission ""isn't taking place in pubs"" but an element of it was people coming back from European travel, along with mixing with others in their homes, including house parties of up to 30 people. People with reasonable causes, like needing to move house, could still leave the borough, he said, ""but going from Caerphilly to Cardiff for a night out or to go to the gym isn't covered"". ""If things deteriorate faster we may have to take more measures,"" he added, saying he ""won't hesitate"" to make it mandatory to wear face-coverings across Wales if necessary. ""We're in it for several weeks at least in Caerphilly. We expect the rate to rise in the next few days because community transmission has already taken place."" The lockdown would be reviewed in two weeks, the Welsh Government said. Addressing the weekly coronavirus briefing at lunchtime, Mr Gething expressed fears coronavirus in younger people could ""leap into"" more vulnerable and older groups of people. ""Over the summer, we've seen an increase in the number of cases in people under 40 in Wales."" ""At the moment it appears coronavirus is likely to be a milder illness for most people in this age group,"" he added, saying there is usually a lag of a couple of weeks before people are admitted to hospital. Targeted testing had been carried out in Caerphilly and would be starting in the lower Rhondda valley where there was also a rise in cases, he said. Mr Gething outlined how 13 cases of the virus were connected to a single trip to Ibiza taken by a group of friends last month: ""Three of them came home with coronavirus. When they came home, one of the group passed the virus on to their partner and his father. ""Another person in the group had a party the day after coming home and four people caught coronavirus. ""One of these then passed the virus on to their brother who then passed it to a friend by sharing a car. Another party guest passed it on to their sister, who in turn infected a friend on a night out"". The local lockdown was announced on Monday, giving people less than 24 hours to prepare for the changes. Under the new restrictions,listed at the Welsh Government website,external: People cannot enter or leave Caerphilly county borough - which includes Caerphilly town, Ystrad Mynach, Blackwood, Newbridge and Risca - without a ""reasonable excuse"" Everyone over the age of 11 will need to wear a face covering in shops Friends and family are not allowed to meet indoors or stay overnight Extended households will not be able to meet up A reasonable excuse for travel includes for work, if you are not able to work from home, to go to school, or to give care. People attend marriages and funeral services outside the county if they are invited, but are not allowed to go to receptions or wakes. Residents can move house, and continue childcare arrangements where parents are not living together. Schools, pubs, bars and restaurants will remain open. The rules will be kept under review, the first on 10 September and then again in the following 21 days. The council and the police will have responsibility for enforcement, with fixed penalty notices of Â£60 for a first offence, doubling on each subsequent offence. Gwent Police chief constable Pam Kelly said officers would be out in the community encouraging people to follow social distancing and the new regulations coming into force. ""Today we will be working to understand the new guidance and regulations and what enforcement action we can take for the few who do not comply with the new restrictions,"" she added. People leaving a bus in Caerphilly While they may be just hours away from a return to lockdown shoppers in Caerphilly have not hesitated to get out and stock up ahead of tonight's deadline. The high street is busy, shops are open and town centre car parks are full as people continue to go about their business. There is a visible rise in the wearing of masks. Many shoppers are choosing to wear face coverings ahead of them being implemented in certain situations. The shift has not been lost on local residents like, Roger Williams made a last-minute trip to the bank ahead the rule changes. ""There's more people wearing masks here than there has been in a long, long time"" he says. ""I can see the difference here,"" he said. For shopkeepers like Joe Thomas the prospect of another downturn in business is a real threat to the town. ""I think the town will probably collapse unless the government give businesses more help again she says"". Sarah Bruton says people have been anxious about going out post-lockdown in her experience Sarah Bruton, manager of Captiva Spa, said the spike showed Covid-19 was going to be ""part of our lives for a very long time"". ""It's going to be really tough for a lot of people. We've started to make plans to see family, to book holidays, in my case to rebuild our business and that's going to be taken away again,"" she added. Michael Roberts stopped allowing customers inside his restaurant last week Michael Roberts, who runs Urban Bar BQ in Caerphilly town centre, closed his restaurant for indoor service on Thursday and is just offering takeaway. ""We're feeling that hopefully this is a step which will take us in the right direction towards getting over it,"" he said. More than 1,600 people have been tested in Caerphilly county in the past week Caerphilly Labour Member of the Senedd Hefin David said more than 600 people messaged him on Monday asking for clarity on what the lockdown meant for things like gyms, leisure centres and hairdressers and moving to halls of residence. ""I am just trying to answer as many people's questions as I can,"" he told BBC Wales, adding that students would be fine to go off to university as it was classed as moving out of the borough. ""The biggest questions are about childcare,"" he added. Community testing started in the county borough at the weekend. A total of 450 people were tested and 19 were found positive. People will not be able to enter or leave Caerphilly county without good reason One class of 21 pupils at St Gwladys Primary School in Bargoed must stay at homeafter a member of staff tested positive for the virus, although the school remains open. Caerphilly RFC has closed for two days for deep cleaning after a member who was at the club on Saturday tested positive. Elsewhere, the Eden Centre said it was closing its soft play centres in Caerphilly and Blackwood due to the rise in cases. Meanwhile, Great Western Railway has confirmed a member of staff in south Wales has tested positive for Covid-19, but has not specified where. Close contacts of the person are self-isolating, the company said. No train services have been affected as a result of the diagnosis.

"British employers planned more than 300,000 redundancies in June and July, as the coronavirus outbreak took its toll on the workplace. 1,784 firms made plans to cut nearly 150,000 jobs in July, almost a sevenfold increase on July 2019. The figures were obtained by a BBC Freedom of Information request. In June 1,888 employers filed plans for 156,000 job cuts, a sixfold increase on the previous year. The coronavirus lockdown and the resultingrecord-breaking economic downturnclosed restaurants and shops and brought travel to a standstill, forcing many firms to cut staff. A spokesman for the government stressed that it had already protected 9.6 million jobs through the Job Retention Scheme, as well as paying out billions in loans and grants to thousands of businesses. ""We are continuing to support livelihoods and incomes through our Plan for Jobs to ensure that nobody is left without hope or opportunity. This includes a Â£1,000 retention bonus for businesses that can bring furloughed employees back to work,"" he said. ""We are also creating new roles for young people with our Kickstart scheme, creating incentives for training and apprenticeships, and supporting and protecting jobs in the tourism and hospitality sectors through our VAT cut and last month's Eat Out to Help Out scheme."" Boots, John Lewis, Marks & Spencer, Zizzi owner Azzurri, and furniture retailer DFS were among the household names to announce redundancy plans in July.A survey found thatone in three firms expected to make some staff redundant between July and September. What are my rights if I am made redundant? Why is the unemployment rate close to a 40-year low? What's the latest with the furlough scheme? Firms planning 20 or more redundancies at a single ""establishment"" must by law notify government via a form called HR1, saying how many posts they want to lose. Both the number of firms filing notice and the number of positions at risk gives a strong early indication that large numbers of jobs are likely to go in coming months. Big high street names were among the companies announcing redundancies in July The furlough scheme, where the government temporarily pays the wages of workers, is coming to an end in October, raising fears that employers will have to cut even more jobs later in the year. ""The reason this data is so useful is that all our other official data is coming through with a time lag,"" said Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank. ""This puts policy makers in a really challenging situation. The main government support schemes are coming to an end, but in terms of the official data, we still don't know how big the jobs crisis is, or where we're heading as we move into the autumn."" He added that the data, taken alongside other business surveys and forecasts, paints ""a fairly bleak and consistent picture of the next couple of months"". Employers planning fewer than 20 redundancies don't have to file notice, so the overall totals of redundancies being planned will be higher than these figures. Official employment statistics,which are typically a few months behindwhat is happening on the ground, don't yet show a big increase in the unemployment rate or redundancies. However, the government's own spending watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that in a worst-case scenario, unemployment could hit four million next year. Companies in Northern Ireland file HR1 forms with the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency and they are not included in these figures. Are you currently on furlough from your job?

"Maria Kolesnikova told BBC Russian last month that ""to understand exactly what's going on, you really have to be here"" A detained Belarus opposition leader prevented officials from forcibly expelling her to Ukraine by tearing up her passport and throwing it out of a car window at the border, colleagues who travelled with her have said. On Monday Maria Kolesnikova was forced into a van by masked men in Minsk. She is one of three women who joined forces to challenge President Alexander Lukashenko in August's election. Mass protests erupted after the disputed vote. ""She was pushed into the back seat (of the car), she yelled that she wasn't going anywhere,"" Ms Kolesnikova's colleague Anton Rodnenkov told a news conference in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, on Tuesday. Mr Rodnenkov said he and another colleague had been kidnapped on Monday, driven between buildings, and interrogated with hoods over their heads and their hands tied. They accepted an offer to leave Belarus with Ms Kolesnikova but when the car reached the border she refused to cross. The two men told journalists they did not know where she was now. What's happening in Belarus? 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change Earlier on Tuesday, officials in Belarus had claimed that Ms Kolesnikova was detained while trying to cross into Ukraine. Meanwhile, in an interview with Russian media on Tuesday, President Lukashenko insisted he would not step down from power. Dozens of people were arrested in fresh protests in Minsk, the capital. In recent weeks thousands have faced down violence and threats of arrest in demonstrations against Mr Lukashenko, who has ruled the country since 1994. This video can not be played Ivan Kravtsov says Ms Kolesnikova tore her passport into pieces and then climbed through the rear car window The EU has demanded the release of all political prisonersand says it is planning to impose sanctions. Ms Kolesnikova is the last of three women leading the opposition to Mr Lukashenko to remain inside Belarus. The main opposition leader, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, says she won 60-70% of the election in places where votes were properly counted. She fled to Lithuania after she was detained in August. The stay-at-home mum challenging Belarus's long-time ruler On Monday, witnesses saw masked men seize Ms Kolesnikova on a street in central Minsk and push her into a minibus. Anton Rodnenkov and his colleague Ivan Kravtsov were abducted while driving to her flat following reports of her disappearance, they told reporters in Kyiv. Officials threatened to prosecute them until the two men accepted an offer to leave Belarus with Ms Kolesnikova. ""What they were interested in was getting Maria Kolesnikova outside the country. They said this was necessary to de-escalate the situation in Belarus,"" Mr Kravtsov said. This video can not be played What lies behind the Belarus protests? The three were taken to the border with Ukraine by men in plain clothes early on Tuesday morning, Mr Rodnenkov said. But when the car reached a checkpoint between the two countries, Ms Kolesnikova prevented her deportation by ripping up her passport and throwing away the pieces, he said. ""It was clear that she was being taken by force, she was resisting,"" Mr Rodnenkov said. ""She climbed, climbed from the car and she walked proudly to Belarusian territory,"" Mr Kravtsov said, adding: ""She's really a hero. You must understand that. She's very dedicated to what she's doing now."" Last month Ms Kolesnikova told BBC Russian in an interview: ""To understand exactly what's going on, you really have to be here."" The Belarusian leader said if he stood down his supporters would be ""slaughtered"" Ms Tikhanovskaya has called for her colleague to be immediately freed. ""By kidnapping people in broad daylight, Lukashenko is showing his weakness and fear,"" she said in a statement. Another female activist, Olga Kovalkova, announced on Saturday she had fled to Poland amid threats of imprisonment. Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Lukashenko told Russian reporters that Ms Kolesnikova had been held for ""violating the rules on crossing the state border"". In a sit-down interview, the long-term leader was quoted as saying he would not step down. Belarus election: 'He threatened to burn us alive' 'If we step back now we will become slaves' The great-grandmother taking on President Lukashenko He conceded that some Belarusians might be ""fed up"" with his rule but he was adamant that he wouldn't leave office, according to  the journalists. He also asserted that he was the only person who could ""defend"" Belarus. Alexander Lukashenko calls Vladimir Putin ""big brother"" in this interview and he's increasingly dependent on Russia for support. But his comments reveal a confidence that Moscow needs him, too. ""You know what we agreed with the Russian establishment and leadership?"" he asked the panel of Russian state TV reporters on the sofas before him. ""That if Belarus breaks, Russia will be next."" Back me up, Mr Lukashenko seemed to be saying to Moscow, and your own people won't get any bad ideas about ousting a long-standing leader through popular protests. As usual, he claimed the unrest in Belarus was fomented by hostile outside forces, mainly America, via the internet. But with opposition to his rule strong and persistent, Mr Lukashenko is now heavily reliant on his security forces. So he had a message for them too. If I go, he argued, the riot police would be ""slaughtered, torn to pieces. And what have they done wrong?"" Mr Lukashenko has twice appeared brandishing a gun during mass protests against his rule, and he told the reporters it was meant to show he had not fled. He has accused Western powers of interference and is expected to visit Moscow ""in the coming days"" amid claims by Lithuania that he is planning deeper integration with Russia.

"The daily confirmed figures for coronavirus cases have shown a significant jump in the past two days. On Sunday they rose by nearly 3,000 and then on Monday by almost exactly the same again - the highest single day increases since May. It means the UK is now seeing four times as many cases on average as it was in mid July. And with the impact of the return of schools still to come - not to mention the re-opening of universities next month - fears are growing that cases and then deaths could start spiralling. The rise has been laid firmly at the door of young people. Around half of new cases in recent weeks have been diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s. Significant numbers of cases have also been identified in people in their 40s and 50s, as well as teenagers. That compares to the early days when most of the confirmed cases were in the older age groups. But that was because the UK was largely only testing in hospitals. Younger adults are very unlikely to be sick enough to need hospital treatment, so they hardly showed up in the official figures. Cases are rising, what should I do to stop the spread? Remember the R number? Why is it so important? If you look at results from antibody testing, to see if they had been exposed to the virus, the younger age groups were just as likely as older groups - if not more - to have been exposed. So what is happening now appears to be simply a case of the virus re-establishing itself in a group that is the least at risk of serious complications, hence there are no signs of a significant increase in hospitalisations. Much has been made of the fact these are the groups going out socialising, although it is also noticeable that the highest rates are spread across much of the working age population - many of whom will have to leave their home to make a living. So does it matter? After all, the level of cases being seen - even taking into account there will still be some not being picked up - is well below where it was in the spring. At the peak at the end of March, there were an estimated 100,000 cases a day (the official figures only show a fraction of these because of the problem mentioned above - testing was more or less limited to hospitals). And the fact that cases are rising after hitting such a low mark over the summer should not come as a surprise. More people are being tested and that testing is being targeted at high infection rate areas for one thing. But that does not tell the whole story. With people mixing more, and summer over (respiratory viruses tend to do better because of colder weather and the fact people are indoors) cases were always going to go up, and are likely to continue to do so. If you could keep the infections in younger age groups, who are not at any significant risk of complications, there would in theory not be much of a problem. The difficulty, says Prof Devi Sridhar, a public health expert at Edinburgh University, is that as cases rise, this becomes harder to achieve. She believes we are already in a position where protecting vulnerable groups will become impossible. But she admits ministers are in a ""lose-lose"" situation. If they let the virus spread they will be held culpable for rising deaths, and if they re-introduce restrictions they will be criticised for over-reacting. The result is that the UK, like all nations, faces an almost impossible balancing act - accepting some level of deaths, while keeping society functioning. Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in health protection at the University of East Anglia, says it is not realistic to return to national lockdown, saying it would not be fair to ""handicap"" children any more by closing schools. ""This is a virus that is mainly risky to older, more vulnerable groups. We need to accept winter will be extremely difficult. ""It is about finding a tolerable solution. I don't think we will see the scale of deaths we saw in spring. ""But there are, sadly, going to be many this winter. It will be the worst winter for a long time."" The key in the coming months, Prof Hunter and others believe, will be keeping deaths as low as possible by protecting the most vulnerable - more than nine in 10 deaths have happened in the over 65s with half in the over 85s. There are a number of factors that will have an impact - and on many the UK is in a stronger position than it was six months ago. The discovery that two steroids - dexamethasone and hydrocortisone - can reduce deaths among the seriously ill will make a significant difference. And, as always, good hand hygiene and continued adherence to social distancing and isolating when you have symptoms will be important principles for everyone to follow. Big local outbreaks will also need to be contained as best as possible. This is where the test and trace system comes in. While huge progress has been made in recent months though, there are still issues to be resolved on both the availability of testing and ability to reach the close contacts of infected individuals. On top of that, the government and care industry will have to do a better job of protecting care homes. There is much better availability of PPE now than there was in the early days and although regular testing of staff and residents has been slow to roll out it is a world away from the situation earlier in the year when testing stopped once a home had five confirmed cases. It also seems likely the re-introduction of shielding for the most vulnerable groups will need to happen at some point. It is of course impossible to predict - and depends on many different factors. A leaked report obtained by BBC Newsnight suggested the government had been advised there could be 85,000 deaths under a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"". Of course, the worst-case scenario should be avoided. If we are to avoid returning to the scale of deaths seen in the spring - as Prof Hunter and others think is possible - that would mean limiting fatalities to under the 41,500 coronavirus deaths that have been seen during the pandemic. But during any winter, deaths always increase by many thousands. The worst one of recent memory was three years ago when an extra 15,000 more people died in England and Wales than had on average in the previous five winters. It was a cold winter, the strain of flu was a little more virulent than normal and the vaccine available was not particularly effective. This year in the fight against coronavirus there is no vaccine and very limited immunity. Keeping the death toll anywhere near zero is, sadly, going to be impossible.

"Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are relaxing some of the rules around gatherings and mixing with others which were introduced to tackle the spread of Omicron. However, some restrictions remain. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announceda further easing of Covid rules. From Friday 28 January, the requirement for physical distancing in indoor settings where people don't have to wear a face covering - such as those leading religious services - will reduce to 1m (3ft) from 2m (6 ft).

"This video can not be played Brandon Lewis says Northern Ireland customs rules legislation do âbreak international law in a very specific and limited wayâ A government minister has said a new bill to amend the UK's Brexit deal with the EU will ""break international law"". Concerns had been raised about legislation being brought forward which could change parts of the withdrawal agreement, negotiated last year. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis conceded it would go against the treaty in a ""specific and limited way"". Former PM Theresa May warned the change could damage ""trust"" in the UK over future trade deals with other states. The permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department, Sir Jonathan Jones, has announcedhe is resigning from government in light of the bill, making him the sixth senior civil servant to leave Whitehall this year. Sir Jonathan, who is the government's most senior lawyer, is understood to have believed the plans went too far in breaching the government's obligations under international law. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer condemned the bill and accused No 10 of ""reopening old arguments that had been settled"", saying the ""focus should be on getting a [trade] deal done"" with the EU. Brexit is back - and likely to get louder 'One train of thought in DUP' on NI Protocol What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? No 10 revealed on Monday that it would be introducing anew UK Internal Market Billthat could affect post-Brexit customs and trade rules in Northern Ireland. Downing Street said it would only make ""minor clarifications in extremely specific areas"" - but it worried some in Brussels and Westminster that it could see the government try to change the withdrawal agreement, which became international law when the UK left the EU in January. The row also comes at the start of the eighth round of post-Brexit trade deal talks between the UK and the EU. The two sides are trying to secure a deal before the end of the transition period on 31 December, which will see the UK going onto World Trade Organisation rules if no agreement is reached. Irish Foreign Affairs Minister, Simon Coveney, called Mr Lewis' comments ""gravely concerning"", adding: ""Any unilateral departure from the terms of the withdrawal agreement would be a matter of considerable concern and a very serious step."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says planned government legislation over Northern Ireland is âwrongâ The UK's chief Brexit negotiator, Lord David Frost,called for ""realism"" from his EU counterparts, saying he would ""drive home our clear message that we must make progress this week if we are to reach an agreement in time"". The EU said it would ""do everything in [its] power to reach an agreement"" with the UK, but ""will be ready"" for a no-deal scenario. On Monday, Boris Johnson said if a deal hadn't been done by the time the European Council meets on 15 October, the two sides should ""move on"" and accept the UK's exit without one. Shadow Northern Ireland secretary, Louise Haigh, said it was ""deeply concerning"" that the prime minister ""appeared to be undermining the legal obligations of his own deal"" with the introduction of the new law while the negotiations are taking place. The text of the new bill will not be published until Wednesday, although the government has confirmed it will deal with the issue of the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol - an element of the withdrawal agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland after Brexit. The practicalities of the protocol - which will deal with issues of state aid (financial support given to businesses by governments) and whether there needs to be customs checks on goods - is still being negotiated by a joint UK and EU committee. But Mr Lewis said the bill would take ""limited and reasonable steps to create a safety net"" if the negotiations failed. Speaking during an urgent question on the bill, chair of the Justice Committee and Tory MP Bob Neill said the ""adherence to the rule of law is not negotiable"". He asked Mr Lewis: ""Will he assure us that nothing proposed in this legislation does or potentially might breach international obligations or international legal arrangements?"" The Northern Ireland secretary replied: ""Yes. This does break international law in a very specific and limited way."" He said the government was still working ""in good faith"" with the EU joint committee to overcome its concerns for the future of trade in Northern Ireland, but said there was ""clear precedence for UK and indeed other countries needing to consider their obligations if circumstances change"". Sir Bob later told BBC Radio 4's PM the decision was ""troubling"", adding: ""Britain is a country which prides itself on standing by the rule of law... whether it is inconvenient or convenient for us. ""Whatever we seek to do, if we find something we signed up to 'inconvenient', I am afraid this doesn't mean we can renege on our contract... as that would damage our reputation long term."" This was an extremely unusual statement - a minister standing up in Parliament to say the government is planning to break international law. Brandon Lewis told the House of Commons that ""there are clear precedents for the UK and other countries needing to consider their international obligations as circumstances change"". That may suggest, says Catherine Barnard, professor of law at the University of Cambridge, that the government is looking at Article 62 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which enables a state to get out of its treaty obligations when circumstances change radically. But those changed circumstances have to be pretty dramatic - something like the dissolution of Yugoslavia, when a recognised country ceases to exist. In the case of the Northern Ireland Protocol, it is less than a year since the government negotiated the treaty in full knowledge of the sensitivity of the situation. And if the government does go ahead with legislation which appears to contradict the withdrawal agreement? ""There is a chance,"" says Prof Barnard, ""that the EU will decide to trigger the dispute resolution mechanism in the withdrawal agreement, which could lead to arbitration and a case before the European Court of Justice."" Theresa May - who stood down as prime minister last year after her own Brexit deal failed to get the support of Parliament - said: ""The United Kingdom government signed the withdrawal agreement with the Northern Ireland Protocol. ""This Parliament voted that withdrawal agreement into UK legislation. The government is now changing the operation of that agreement."" ""How can the government reassure future international partners that the UK can be trusted to abide by the legal obligations of the agreements it signs?"" The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Sir Ed Davey, also called it a ""sad and shocking state of affairs for our country"". This video can not be played BBC Reality Checkâs Chris Morris looks at where the UK and EU are struggling to agree on their future relationship Sammy Wilson, who acts as Brexit spokesman for the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, said he was ""pleased"" to have the new bill that could deal with some of the issues that could affect his constituents - such as state aid and customs checks. But he said the DUP had ""warned ministers of the impact of the withdrawal agreement"" early on, saying it was a ""union splitting, economy destroying and border creating agreement that has to be changed and replaced"". He added: ""We will judge this bill on whether it delivers on these kind of issues."" However, Claire Hanna, a Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) MP for Belfast South, said the protocol was ""a symptomâ¦ of four years of terrible political decision making"". She added: ""It is now the law. This government is obliged to implement it in full."" She also ""cautioned"" Mr Lewis ""not to use the threat of a border on the island of Ireland or the hard won impartiality of the Good Friday Agreement as a cat's paw in this or any other negotiation."" But former Conservative leader, Sir Iain Duncan Smith, said the act that brought the withdrawal agreement into law in the UK allowed the government to ""reserve the right to make clarifications under the sovereignty clause"". Mr Lewis agreed, saying the law would ""clarify... the points about what will apply in January if we are not able to get satisfactory and mutually suitable conclusions"" in negotiations. He added: ""It is reasonable and sensible to give that certainty and clarity to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland.""

"Hundreds were injured in the bombing at the end of an Ariana Grande concert Only one paramedic was at the scene of the Manchester Arena bombing for the first 40 minutes after the explosion, an inquiry into the attack was told. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more injured when Salman Abedi detonated a suicide bomb as 14,000 fans left the arena in May 2017. The inquiry heard the sole paramedic had arrived in the arena foyer 18 minutes after the bomb went off. But at least eight ambulances had arrived nearby after 40 minutes. Lead counsel Paul Greaney QC said the public inquiry would have to consider whether lives were lost as a result of a failure to co-ordinate the response of emergency services. Within 10 minutes of the bomb exploding at 22:31 BST, 12 British Transport Police (BTP) officers had run into the arena foyer carrying first aid. Casualties were carried out on makeshift stretchers and only one actual stretcher was used on the night of the attack. What is the Manchester Arena inquiry? The final person was evacuated from the City Room - where the bombing happened - at 23:40 on a stretcher ""made of cardboard and a crowd control barrier"". The bombing after an Ariana Grande concert killed 22 people and injured hundreds more The inquiry also heard how John Atkinson, who was killed in the bombing, was only evacuated from the scene 46 minutes after the blast on a makeshift stretcher to a triage area nearby. He remained there for another 24 minutes but chest compressions were only started on him one hour and 15 minutes after he was first injured in the blast. ""The issue of John Atkinson's survivability is, as we shall explore, a significant issue for the inquiry to consider,"" Mr Greaney added. The inquiry was told BTP had primary responsibility for policing in the arena foyer and Greater Manchester Police (GMP) was not aware ""at an organisational level"" of the Ariana Grande concert. ""On the face of it that may seem surprising,"" Mr Greaney added. He said BTP had ""primacy"" in this area due to the proximity of Victoria Station and the inquiry must consider whether that affected preparedness for any terror attack. The inquiry will, among other things, look at the emergency response to the attack ""There is a legitimate question about whether it was appropriate that BTP, who specialise in the railways, should take the lead,"" he added. Following the blast, BTP declared a major incident at 22:39 but they did not communicate this to GMP and there was no attempt to integrate communications at the arena. The inquiry heard the BTP officer, who thought he was acting as operational commander, was in Blackpool when the bomb went off. He took a taxi to Manchester but ""by the time he arrived the need for an immediate response had long since passed"". Mr Greaney said it appeared ""no one acted as a BTP operational commander for the policing response to the bombing"". GMP did not declare a major incident until 01:00 on 23 May, the inquiry heard. Arena bomber drew suspicion ahead of blast The second day of the hearing was told there had been multi-agency exercises rehearsing for a terror attack, including one in 2016 for an incident at the Trafford Centre. Mr Greaney said ""experts have expressed serious concerns about whether the necessary lessons were learned from it"". The hearings will take place in a room specially converted from two courtrooms at Manchester Magistrates' Court Another exercise, held in July 2016, rehearsed for an attack in the City Room at the arena - the exact scene of the attack in May 2017. The inquiry is seeking to establish whether BTP took part in that exercise. The first fire engine, which had stretchers, arrived at Manchester Arena two hours and six minutes after the explosion. ""An important issue for the inquiry to investigate will be how that came to pass and whether it made any difference,"" Mr Greaney added. But he told the inquiry it was ""important we acknowledge the pressure that those who responded were under"". ""The inquiry process must not be used to vilify those who did their best on the night but made mistakes and could have done better,"" he added. CCTV caught Salman Abedi in the arena foyer just seconds before he blew himself up BTP officer Jessica Bullough, who was first to enter the foyer, described the scene of the attack as like a ""war zone"". Two minutes after the explosion, PC Bullough radioed through, saying ""it's definitely a bomb - people are injured - at least 20 casualties"". She then ""made the first of a number of requests for ambulances"". The inquiry was told that 24 minutes later another officer radioed to control, saying ""you're going to hate me - where's our ambulances please?"". Control replied, saying ""we don't know. We're calling them again"". The public inquiry follows a trial in which a jury found Hashem Abedi guilty of helping his older sibling to plan the atrocity. He wasjailed for at least 55 yearson 20 August for the 22 murders. The chairman of the inquiry Sir John Saunders will make a report and recommendations once all the evidence has been heard, which is expected to take up to six months.

"Andrew Lloyd Webber spent Â£100,000 on a pilot show The arts are at the ""point of no return"" following damage from the coronavirus pandemic, Lord Lloyd-Webber has said. The composer and theatre impresario told MPs it would be economically ""impossible"" to run theatres with social distancing. ""We simply have to get our arts sector back open and running,"" he told the House of Commons Digital, Culture, Media and Sport select committee. ""We are at the point of no return."" In July, Lord Lloyd-Webber staged a concert at the London Palladium as an experiment to see whether socially-distanced performances were viable. He spent Â£100,000 on the pilot project in the hope that it could allow the theatre business to get up and running. He hoped to prove that theatres could open safely at full capacity. However, the concert had to take place with hundreds of empty seats to comply with the government's social distancing guidelines. Lord Lloyd-Webber staged a socially-distanced Beverley Knight concert at the London Palladium in July Since then, two major new indoor theatre productions have opened in London, but also with limited audience capacity. Most theatres, including those in the West End, are yet to reopen. ""There comes a point now when we really can't go on much more,"" Lord Lloyd-Webber said. The socially distanced show must go on - is it fun? Could Sleepless set a blueprint for theatre? ""Theatre is an incredibly labour-intensive business. In many ways putting on a show now is almost a labour of love. ""Very few shows hit the jackpot in the way a Hamilton, Lion King or Phantom of the Opera do."" He added that theatre productions were ""not like cinema, you can't just open the building"". The government announced a Â£1.57bn support packageearlier this year to support the arts, which was widely welcomed by the industry. But Lord Lloyd-Webber stressed the importance of naming a date when theatres can reopen. This video can not be played Andrew Lloyd Webber has previously said 'theatre canât run with social distancingâ He also discussed the ""critical"" importance of clean air. ""I am absolutely confident that the air in the London Palladium and in all my theatres is purer than the air outside,"" he said. He also suggested he could move his forthcoming production of Cinderella from the UK to a different location ""where people are being a little more helpful"". It was originally due to open in London's West End this month. Rebecca Kane Burton, chief executive of the LW Theatres, the company that runs Lord Lloyd-Webber's venues, added: ""We don't want to open theatres on a socially distanced basis. I have no intention of opening buildings at 30% capacity."" Recent months had been ""devastating and catastrophic"" for the sector, she said. ""It's a really bad, catastrophic time and we need to find a way out of it. It was disheartening that the pilot wasn't later seen as a way to getting full reopening."" She added: ""We need the time to plan. We can't switch on theatre like a tap. Christmas is hanging in the balance as we speak."" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden has suggested rapid testing could provide part of a solution for theatres A DCMS spokeswoman said the government was ""working flat out to support our world class performing arts sector through challenging times"". She said: ""Our unprecedented Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund builds on Â£200m in emergency public funding to stabilise organisations, protect jobs and ensure work continues to flow to freelancers. This funding will support organisations of all sizes across the country, including theatres. ""Performances indoors and outdoors can now take place with a socially distanced audience and we are working at pace with the industry on innovative proposals for how full audiences might return safely as soon as possible. We also want the public to show their support by visiting theatres as they start to reopen."" Writing in the Mail on Sunday at the weekend,external, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the government was working on a project that would see some theatre return in time for pantomime season at Christmas. He also suggested rapid testing could help ensure the return of theatres. ""Testing is the short-term key until we find a working vaccine. We're making exciting advances in quick turnaround testing, where on-the-day coronavirus tests could give people who test negative a pass to visit the theatre that evening,"" he wrote. Speaking on the BBC News Channel, actor Simon Callow said that kind of testing is ""the dream"", adding: ""That's exactly the kind of thing we need to be exploring."" He also said the furlough scheme - which has helped some in the arts industry - should be extended beyond October. That was echoed by the director of the Theatres Trust, Jon Morgan. ""Without an early date for theatres to re-open fully and with the furlough scheme ending in October we will see further redundancies and the permanent closure of more theatres,"" he said in a statement. Scene Change's This Is No Pantomime campaign launched earlier this week Lucy Noble, artistic and commercial director of the Royal Albert Hall and chair of the National Arenas Association, told the DCMS Committee there were ""huge consequences to venues not being able to put performances on... serious financial consequences"". She added: ""All venues are on their knees financially... When Oliver Dowden announced the Â£1.57 billion rescue package, the Royal Albert Hall was hailed as one of the crown jewels that this package would save. ""We have been told we are not eligible for any of the grant at all. ""We are only eligible to take a loan. We've already taken Â£10m worth of loans. We'd rather not get into any more debt.""

"The existing Velindre Cancer Centre is based in Whitchurch - and the new facility would be close to this site Leading doctors and specialists have expressed ""deep concern"" about plans for a new cancer centre and have called for an independent review. Fifty-seven cancer experts said they have concerns for patient safety at the new Velindre centre in Cardiff, which is due to open in 2022. In a letter to Health Minister Vaughan Gething they said the Â£180m centre would not be fit for purpose. Velindre University NHS Trust has agreed to seek independent advice. The group of medical professionals said modern cancer treatments needed a range of services onsite, including surgery and intensive care. Protest over cancer hospital plan for city meadows Thousands petition against site of cancer hospital They also argued the new centre should be located alongside an existing hospital and called for clarity on how the original decision to build a new stand-alone centre near the existing Velindre facility, in Whitchurch, was reached. The letter, signed by surgeons, radiologists, GPs, anaesthetists and palliative care specialists, was also sent to Wales' chief medical officer, the local member of the Senedd Julie Morgan and the chief executive of the Welsh NHS. Artist's impression of the new Velindre Cancer Centre in Whitchurch The letter said: ""We are committed to transforming cancer care for patients in south east Wales and believe there is an exceptional opportunity to get this right."" It adds the ""limitation of the proposed approach has already been apparent through review of other stand-alone cancer centres"", includingMount Vernon in Middlesex. Steve Ham, chief executive of Velindre University NHS Trust, said: ""We are continuing to work with our patients, clinicians and health board partners to further strengthen the model to ensure it is always fit for purpose. This will include independent external advice."" The trust in a statement added: ""We, like all our colleagues across the south east Wales area, have the interests of our patients at the heart of everything we do. ""We believe that the future model will improve the quality and safety of care; enhance patient experience; and improve the equity of access to treatment and research."" Opposition to the new centre has largely centred on environmental concerns until now, with some people not happy about plans to build it at a local beauty spot. This video can not be played People attended a socially distanced protest on the green space earmarked for a new cancer hospital. There have been demonstrations andan online petition to try and save the Northern Meadows, an area of grassland and woods in the Whitchurch area of the city. But there are also many supporters of the scheme. The Velindre Trust has thousands of backers on its own online platforms and has said 60% of the land would continue to be available to the local community. The trust added: ""We are committed to securing a future for the fields as a community asset."" The Welsh Government said that the minister had responded to the letter confirming that the Velindre trust would seek independent advice on the clinical model for the new cancer hospital. ""The chief medical officer is also discussing the management of acutely unwell cancer patients with health board medical directors to ensure the current model of delivery is fit for purpose,"" said a spokesperson.

"This video can not be played Keen cyclists Meredith and Elly, who was training for a marathon, say they're still suffering from Covid-19 symptoms months after getting it Greater NHS support is needed for people chronically ill for months with Covid-19 symptoms, experts have toldBBC Radio 4's File on 4. The Royal College of GPs is calling for a national network of ""post-Covid"" clinics to help such people. But less than 12% of 86 NHS care commissioning groups asked by the BBC said they were running such services. NHS England said it was ""rapidly expanding new and strengthened rehab centres"". Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London and leader of the Covid Symptom Study app, said around 300,000 people in the UK have reported symptoms lasting for more than a month - so called ""long Covid"". He added that data from the app showed around 60,000 people have been ill for more than three months. However, many of these people may not have been tested for Covid. The government moved away from community testing on 12 March, instead only testing those admitted to hospital. That meant people who recovered from suspected coronavirus at home were unable to access tests. How long will it take me to recover? Elly MacDonald, 37, from Surbiton, was training for the London Marathon when she first developed what she believes were Covid symptoms on 21 March. More than five months on, she still suffers from breathlessness and extreme fatigue, but has not received a positive test result - because community testing was re-introduced too late for it to detect her illness. She changed her GP practice after initially feeling she was not being helped, Elly said: ""Just knowing that I actually have people who are taking me seriously - that's been very important for my recovery. I just want my life back."" Your Covid Recovery has been set up to support anyone who has had Covid - including those who recovered at home Paul Garner, a professor at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, has had long Covid since 19 March, and feels some patients are not being believed by healthcare professionals. ""I think the proof is in the symptoms and the stage that we're at in the epidemic,"" he said. ""We need sensible guidelines that really help people. The government is simply not doing enough with the existing medical expertise. It needs to be commandeered and brought together to work together."" File on 4 asked all 212 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and health boards across the UK whether they had set up post-Covid clinics for patients who were not admitted to hospital with the virus - but did not necessarily receive a positive test result. Of the 86 that responded, 10 said they were already running such facilities. A further 16 said they were planning or redesigning services. Many patients will be seen by their GP, or existing services. Elly MacDonald (L), a keen rower and rock climber, has had long Covid since March 21 Martin Marshall, GP and chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""Without doubt, we know that there's going to be a growing number of people who have significant and worrying symptoms of long Covid. ""A small proportion, but in total a large number, will require specialist advice. ""So we really do need to see a growing number of post-Covid clinics being established."" NHS England's newYour Covid Recovery,externalwebsite offers personalised support for all patients recovering from Covid. Lynne Turner Stokes, professor of rehabilitation medicine at King's College London, said it had some ""good resources"" but that ""we have to do much more"". She said: ""For people who have never been to hospital, nobody's looked properly at their lungs, their hearts and so on. ""It will be very useful if we had more one stop (face to face) services."" The UK government and NHS England say there will be new and strengthened rehab centres and community services in every part of the country. In Wales, community and specialist rehabilitation programmes are likely to be the forum for offering Covid care.

Neil Pooran from PA asks about the number of tests being carried out and says the number of tests fell yesterday to around 12,000. ""You will see test numbers fluctuate day by day, "" replies the first minister. A large part of testing is demand led and yesterday's numbers would have reflected the number of tests done on Sunday, she adds. The number of tests carried out yesterday is just under 20,000 Ms Sturgeon tells Mr Pooran. Bryan Rutherford from Bauer asks about other areas which are causing concern and may face further restrictions soon. The first minister replies it is not possible to answer that question definitively. She explains figures in parts of Lanarkshire were a cause of concern, but it was not felt to be at the point where restrictions were necessary. Nicola Sturgeon also explains Inverclyde was looked at closely, but the cases numbers were ""significantly below"" cases per 100,000 compared to other parts of the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. ""But we have to keep the whole country under review,"" she adds, again highlighting every mainland health board has reported a positive case in the last 24 hours. Tim Backshall from ITV Border asks how concerned the first minister is about students going back to universities and colleges. ""To be blunt about it I'm concerned about everything that potentially increases transmission,"" replies Ms Sturgeon. She says over the next month the return of universities and colleges is probably the thing that is likely to have the biggest impact on that. The first minister adds: ""Yes I'm concerned, but we can't stay locked down for ever."" She points out following the basic public health messages and allowing Test and Protect to do its job is crucial. ""This is not unique to Scotland, this is a global pandemic."" The BBC's Suzanne Allan asks about the latest data on cases per 100,000 and whether a particular demographic is behind the increase. Ms Sturgeon confirms the incidence rate in Scotland as a whole, as of yesterday, was 20 per 100,000 people. This figure was slightly higher for the five council areas which are currently under stricter measures, she adds.  In terms of the demographic, the first minister says she does not was to ""point the finger"" but the greatest number of recent infections is in the 18-39 age group. She explains this is ""not surprising"" given this is the group more likely to be taking advantaging of reopening hospitality or to be back at work - but she warns that as the population is not segregated is is likely transmission will eventually move to older populations.

The five council areas in the West of Scotland are actively looking at how to step up enforcement of restrictions. Theguidance for hospitality,externalnow has a legal underpinning. ""Ultimately it comes down to every one of us."" National clinical director Jason Leitch highlights the pandemic is still accelerating worldwide, with it likely the global death toll will cross 900,000 today. While Scotland, the UK and Europe has done well in reducing prevalence of Covid-19, it is accelerating again he says. ""We are worried about it,"" he adds. Prof Leitch  highlights there have been 1,000 new cases in Scotland in the last seven days. The national clinical director urges people to stick to the ""basic rules"" of FACTS. He admits to being worried when seeing groups in hospitality settings who are not keeping ""at least"" one metre apart. We're at the edge of what we can safely do while maintaining the prevalence at this rate and we have to do better to get those numbers down.""  The first minister says the virus is spreading again in Scotland. She explains that was always likely but it means that when the three weekly review comes on Thursday, ""we may well not be able to go ahead with any further easing of restrictions at this time"". The responsibility for avoiding the reimposition of more restrictions lies with all of us, she says.  She refutes the argument we don't need to worry about the situation which is ""potentially a really dangerous illusion"". The first minister calls on us to listen to the warning signal that the announcement of three deaths today is. Nicola Sturgeon stresses again people must follow the five pieces of advice in FACTS: They are: Ms Sturgeon explains she doesn't want to have to create new laws for the hospitality sector. People must take personal responsibility, she says and the first minister adds we are still living in a pandemic and we should not be socialising as we did in the past. Ms Sturgeon tells the briefing the international situation remains very volatile with cases rising across many country ""My advice is you should still be cautious at this time about non-essential foreign travel."" Ms Sturgeon says at the moment the number of new cases, while rising, in Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire does not warrant additional restrictions. This will be kept under review, explains the first minister. She says the evidence suggests house gatherings have made the biggest contribution to the spread of Covid across Greater Glasgow and Clyde. They are also where older and more vulnerable people are likely to socialise, she points out.  However some transmission is happening in pubs and restaurants so that is under close review. There remains a responsibility for customers, who should not meet more than eight people from a maximum of three households going out to the pub or restaurant. They must also socially distance from people from other households. The strong advice is to avoid busy bars where social distancing is difficult and to only visit one bar in an evening, Ms Sturgeon tells the briefing. The first minster accepts these rules are very unwelcome and she does not want them in place any longer than is necessary. Ms Sturgeon adds: ""Overall I believe that they represent a proportionate and hopefully effective, but also an absolutely necessary response to a worrying increase in Covid across these areas. ""The restrictions will be reviewed next week and will stay in place as long as they are needed, but they will not stay in place any longer than that."" The restrictions now cover the five council areas of Glasgow City, West Dunbartonshire, East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire. The first minister explains that 1.1 million people in these areas:  Read more about the measures here.,external Ms Sturgeon turns to the extension of restrictions in the west of Scotland. The first minister points out the resilience committee met yesterday to discuss the restrictions put in place in  Glasgow, East Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire last week.  She says having assessed the number of new cases and assessed advice from clinical advisers it was decided the existing restrictions must stay in place. ""We also concluded on the evidence presented that the restrictions should also be extended to cover two other local authority areas.""

"Lord Frost (left) and Michel Barnier (right) will meet on Tuesday for the latest round of trade talks The UK's chief Brexit negotiator has called for ""realism"" from the EU ahead of the next round of trade talks beginning in London. Lord Frost said there was ""still time"" for the two sides to agree a post-Brexit trade deal for next year. But he said the EU needed to recognise the UK's negotiating position came from that of a ""sovereign state"". His words follow a pledge from Boris Johnson to walk away from the talks if a deal isn't done by 15 October. The EU said it would ""do everything in [its] power to reach an agreement"" with the UK, but ""will be ready"" for a no-deal scenario. The exchange also comes afterNo 10 revealed it would be introducing new legislationon customs rules in Northern Ireland, in case the negotiations fail. The announcement has led to concerns from Brussels that the UK would not deliver on the withdrawal agreement, made ahead of its exit from the bloc in January. But the government said the legislation would only result in ""minor clarifications"" and it was committed to the earlier deal. 'One train of thought in DUP' on NI Protocol New Brexit law will not 'tear up' EU trade plans What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? Trade talks: What do the UK and EU want? The transition period - which sees the UK following a number of the EU's rules while the two sides try to negotiate a trade deal - is due to end on 31 December. If a deal is not made and ratified by parliaments across Europe by then, the UK will move onto trading with the bloc on World Trade Organisation rules, which would involve tariffs. Critics fear this would damage the economy. Mr Johnson has ruled out any extension to the talks and, despite both sides admitting to little progress recently, he has set a deadline of mid-October - when the European Council is due to meet. In an email to Conservative Party members on Monday, the prime minister said if there was no agreement by that date, ""then I do not see that there will be a free trade agreement between us, and we should both accept that and move on"". This video can not be played BBC Reality Checkâs Chris Morris looks at where the UK and EU are struggling to agree on their future relationship Lord Frost, who has led the UK's team of negotiators in talks since March, will meet his opposite number from the EU, Michel Barnier, on Tuesday at the start of the eighth round of talks between the two sides. He was introduced as a peer for the first time in the House of Lords earlier, having been ennobled by Mr Johnson in July. Lord Frost was introduced in the House of Lords earlier Speaking ahead of his meeting with Mr Barnier, Lord Frost promised to ""drive home our clear message that we must make progress this week if we are to reach an agreement in time"". Lord Frost added: ""We have now been talking for six months and can no longer afford to go over well-trodden ground. We need to see more realism from the EU about our status as an independent country. ""As we have done from the beginning in public and in private, I will reinforce our simple, reasonable request for a free trade agreement based on those the EU has signed before with like-minded partners."" Lord Frost said the UK had ""listened closely"" to the bloc's team and ""signalled flexibility"" on where it can move, but added: ""We have repeatedly made clear that key elements of our position derive from the fundamentals of being a sovereign state, and it's time for the EU to fully recognise this reality."" He said the UK was ""ramping up"" preparations for a no-deal outcome, but also said he hoped progress could be made this week. Beyond all the talk, there is a genuine frustration in government that the EU is yet to treat the UK as if it were a fully sovereign country. That's matched on the EU side by similar irritation that the UK won't budge. But the bad tempers do not necessarily mean that a deal won't be reached. And all the blood curdling vows don't mean that in the end there won't be compromise. Read more from Laura European Commission spokesman Dan Ferie said the EU had ""engaged constructively and in good faith"" with the talks so far and would be ""fully concentrated on making the most out of this week's negotiating round"". But, while he said the bloc shared the UK's ""desire to reach a deal quickly"", it should be ""in line with the EU's long-term economic and political interests"". Mr Ferie added: ""The EU has made numerous constructive proposals to move the negotiations forward. ""And Michel Barnier has repeatedly said that there needs to be enough time later this year for the European Parliament and the Council to have their say on any agreement. ""Whether or not there is an agreement in place by the end of the year, the UK's decision to leave the single market and the customs union will inevitably create barriers to trade across border exchanges that do not exist today.""

"It is unclear what ""criminal activity"" Cheng Lei has allegedly committed An Australian journalist detained in China for weeks is being held on national security grounds, China has said. Cheng Lei, a presenter for China Global Television Network (CGTN), is suspected of ""criminal activity endangering China's national security"". She has been detained since 14 August. The announcement comes afterthe last two journalists working for Australian media in China flew home to Sydneyafter a five-day diplomatic stand-off. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Bill Birtles and the Australian Financial Review's (AFR) Mike Smith landed in Sydney on Tuesday. Chinese authorities questioned both men before their departure. Mr Birtles told the BBC he was questioned about Ms Cheng. Who is the Australian TV anchor detained by China? Yang Hengjun: Australian 'will fight to the end' Relations between Australia and China have deteriorated in recent years. There had been allegations of Chinese interference in Australian society in the past, but ties worsened after Canberra backed an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said on Mondaya record 17 foreign journalists had been expelled from the country in the first half of 2020. An Australian citizen based in Beijing, Ms Cheng is a high-profile, respected business journalist for English-language channel CGTN. In August she suddenly disappeared from television and cut off contact with friends and relatives. China eventually announced she was being held under ""residential surveillance"" in an unknown location. No charges were announced at the time. But now foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the government detained her on ""national security grounds"", saying authorities had taken ""compulsory measures"" against her. An investigation is now under way, he added. The spokesman gave no details about the accusations, and it is unclear what ""criminal activity"" she is alleged to have committed. But at the time of her detention some believed her Australian nationality may have been a factor, amid increasingly poor relations between Beijing and Canberra. Mike Smith and Bill Birtles left China on Monday after being interviewed by Chinese authorities. Birtles told the BBC that Australian diplomats advised him last Monday that he should leave China immediately. ""They'd received some sort of warning or advice, they never specified what,"" said the journalist. He was then booked on a flight due to leave Beijing last Thursday. But the situation escalated on Wednesday at midnight when six Chinese police officers and a translator visited his apartment as he held farewell drinks with friends. How reliant is Australia on China? Why China's rise exposes Australian vulnerabilities He said the police did not detain him, but informed him that he was involved in a ""national security investigation,"" and that he could not leave the country. He contacted Australian consular officials the next morning, who collected him and took him to the Australian embassy, where he spent the next four days.

Mr Birtles said he was questioned about Cheng Lei. ""I know her, but not particularly well, it didn't seem like I would be the most logical person to interrogate if you wanted evidence about her case,"" he said. Mr Birtles said he was also asked about sources he used to report on Hong Kong's national security law, and on Australia's relations with China. ""There wasn't any real rigorous effort to extract any evidence or anything that could really be used in any case,"" he added. Mike Smith, who is based in Shanghai, also received a visit by police - prompting him to go to the Australian consulate there. He, too, was questioned over Ms Cheng, the AFR reported. Mike Smith and Bill Birtles departed from Shanghai on Monday The pair were both allowed to leave the country after their interviews by police. The countries rely heavily on each other for trade, but their relationship has soured in recent years, amid allegations of Chinese interference in Australian society. Ties have deteriorated further this year after Canberra backed an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus. Tensions have risen in recent years between Australia and China In actions widely viewed as retaliatory, Beijing has since imposed restrictions on Australian exports such as beef, barley and wine. It has also warned Chinese tourists and students about racism in Australia. In July, Australia warned its citizens they may face ""arbitrary detention"" in China -a travel warning that remains in place,external. Canberra has also expressed concerns about human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and urged China to release detained Australians such as Yang Hengjun, a democracy activist who has been held for 19 months without trial.

"Health Minister Vaughan Gething has been giving the Welsh Government's weekly Covid-19 briefing It comes as Caerphilly county borough faces a local lockdown from 18:00 BST due to a spike in cases People will not be able to enter or leave the area without a ""reasonable excuse"" such as work, school or caring responsibilities Everyone over the age of 11 will have to wear face coverings in shops Friends and family cannot no longer meet indoors or stay overnight The extra restrictions will remain in place at least until October, Mr Gething said Other areas could see local lockdowns if people flouted rules on social distancing, he added Doctors report 'horrific' queues at testing centres and people being told to travel long distances for tests Rachel Flint and Andy Roberts Thank you for following our live coverage of the Welsh Government's weekly coronavirus briefing as Caerphilly county borough becomes the first part of Wales to go under local lockdown measures. What we learnt today:  Follow BBC Wales News on social media or check the website for the very latest updates on coronavirus in Wales. Caerphilly county borough is the first part of Wales to face extra restrictions in a local lockdown from 18:00 BST tonight. It follows a spike in coronavirus cases, which Health Minister Vaughan Gething blamed on the breaking down of social distancing. The area now has one of the UK's highest rates of Covid-19, with 72.9 new cases per 100,000 of the population in the last seven days. Rhondda Cynon Taff could be âa few days or a week awayâ from a local lockdown, the leader of the council has said. Official figures show there were 38.1 cases per 100,000 of the population in the area over the last seven days, This is second highest rate in Wales, behind Caerphilly county borough where local lockdown measures begin tonight. Council leader Andrew Morgan said a temporary testing site is due to open in Rhondda Cynon Taff to help them understand what is going on in the community. He said rather than community transmission it appeared the cases were in clusters, such as in Porth. âI am concerned - I think the message to the public is we donât need to panic just yet,"" Mr Morgan said. ""Personally I think we have a number of days, maybe a week or two, to get on top of this, because if the numbers do continue to grow as weâve seen in Caerphilly, we do run the risk of a local lockdown."" Nick HartleyBBC News While they may be just hours away from a return to lockdown shoppers in Caerphilly have not hesitated to get out and stock up ahead of tonight's deadline. The high street is busy, shops are open and town centre car parks are full as people continue to go about their business. There is a visible rise in the wearing of masks. Many shoppers are choosing to wear face coverings ahead of them being implemented in certain situations. The shift has not been lost on local residents like Roger Williams, who made a last-minute trip to the bank ahead of the rule changes. ""There's more people wearing masks here than there has been in a long, long time"" he says. ""I can see the difference."" For shopkeepers like Joe Thomas the prospect of another downturn in business is a real threat. ""I think the town will probably collapse unless the government gives businesses more help."" Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The rise in coronavirus cases across the UKhas been laid firmly at the door of young people. Around half of new cases in recent weeks have been diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s. Significant numbers of cases have also been identified in people in their 40s and 50s, as well as teenagers. That compares to the early days when most of the confirmed cases were in the older age groups. But that was because the UK was largely only testing in hospitals. Younger adults are very unlikely to be sick enough to need hospital treatment, so they hardly showed up in the official figures. If you look at results from antibody testing, to see if they had been exposed to the virus, the younger age groups were just as likely as older groups - if not more - to have been exposed. So what is happening now appears to be simply a case of the virus re-establishing itself in a group that is the least at risk of serious complications, hence there are no signs of a significant increase in hospitalisations. Caerphilly county borough continues to have the highest rate of coronavirus cases in Wales, official figures show. The rate now stands at 72.9 cases per 100,000 of the population over the last seven days. Public Health Wales figures show the seven-day rate also increasing in Rhondda Cynon Taff, now standing at 38.1 cases per 100,000. In Merthyr Tydfil, the rate increased to 34.8. With only one case in the last seven days, Anglesey has the lowest rate in Wales, with 1.4 cases per 100,000. All other local authorities reported a case rate of less than 20 per 100,000 of the population in the last seven days. A further 150 further people have tested positive for coronavirus in Wales, official figures show. No new deaths were reported to Public Health Wales on Tuesday, meaning the number of people known to have died with Covid-19 remains at 1,597. Caerphilly county borough had the highest number of confirmed new cases, with 44 positive tests, as it faces extra restrictions from 18:00 BST tonight. Rhondda Cynon Taff was next with 17 new cases, then Cardiff with 15. This video can not be played Caerphilly coronavirus lockdown: 'I just hope it's over soon' Residents of Caerphilly mostly accept the news the county borough will be placed under a local lockdown with extra restrictions from 18:00 BST tonight. The Welsh Government âwonât hesitateâ to make it mandatory to wear face coverings across Wales if necessary, the health minister has said. Currently, wearing face coverings in shops is only advised in Wales while it is required by law in England. But from 18:00 BST tonight, people in Caerphilly county will have to wear coverings in shops aslocal lockdown measures are introduced. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said that was due to a âheightened level of community transmissionâ in Caerphilly âthat isn't in evidence in other parts of Walesâ. âCaerphilly is in a different position because of the heightened levels of coronavirus,â he said. . He added: âI don't want to introduce additional mandatory measures or lockdown measures in other parts of the country. âIf it's necessary though, I won't hesitate to do so.â A director of the UK government's test and trace programme in England has issued a ""heartfelt"" apology for problems with the coronavirus testing system. In a tweet, Sarah-Jane Marsh explained it wasthe laboratories, not the testing sites themselves, that were the ""critical pinch-point"". This comes as scientists have sounded the alarm about rising coronavirus cases. Matt Hancock, health secretary for England, said there had been a ""a problem with a couple of contracts"" which would take a matter of weeks to be ""sorted in the short term"". But he said he had ""already put in certain solutions"" to make sure people didn't have to travel more than 75 miles for a test. One example was a woman from Cardiff who was directed to Dundee, more than 300 miles away, when she tried to apply for a test for her two sons who she thought were showing symptoms. As Caerphilly prepares to go into local lockdown, the health minister has warned other places could follow. But Vaughan Gething said the Welsh Government did not want ""lots of local lockdowns"" to have to take place. He said people should ""follow the rules and the guidance"" to prevent the spread of Covid-19. ""Don't see lots of people in your own home, don't go to pubs and restaurants mixing with lots of different people,"" he warned. ""That's how you don't see a return on coronavirus in much larger numbers."" Mr Gething said ministers would look at information received by the Test Trace Protect service to get a better understanding of how coronavirus is spreading. ""If we do need to take further measures then we will not hesitate to do so to help keep Wales safe,"" he said Wales' health minister says he recognises the reintroduction of lockdown restrictions in the Caerphilly area will have an impact on businesses there. However, Vaughan Gething said the decision had to be taken due to a âbreakdown of social distancing and people not following the rulesâ. Speaking to reporters at the Welsh Governmentâs press briefing, he said: âI recognise that any form of restriction will have an impact on the way that businesses are able to operate. âAnd those people who think that these measures aren't required or have not followed the rules need to recognise the impact that has had in the choice that we have had to make to keep people safe and well."" Mr Gething said he wanted to remove the restrictions as ""soon as possible"", but it would only happen ""when it is safe to do so"". More local lockdowns could be introduced in Wales if people continue to have large house parties and flout social-distancing rules, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has suggested. From 18:00 BST todayCaerphilly county borough will become the first part of Wales to be subject to additional restrictions. But Mr Gething warned that the measures showed there were ""consequences"" for people deliberately flouting rules, by holding large house parties and get-togethers. ""There could be other measures in other parts of Wales if we see the same pattern of events,"" he warned. ""I want people to sit up and take notice now so we don't need to implement further lockdown measures."" There are still challenges in whether the testing labs can cope with demand, Wales' health minister has claimed. People in Caerphilly have spoken ofthree-hour queues to access coronavirus tests, while GPs have warned of people being sent miles from their homes, or being unable to access the testing website. Vaughan Gething told the weekly Welsh Government press conference that the issues have been raised with officials and health ministers across the UK. ""There's a broader challenge, though, about the UK government-run lighthouse lab testing programme,"" he said. ""We do know across the whole of the UK there are challenges about the way that programme is running and its ability to cope with demand."" Mr Gething said he was hoping to speak to other health ministers across the UK to get ""clarity in the messaging"" about tests. ""None of us want to see people being asked to travel large distances which for some people won't be possible,"" he said. ""We want easy and regular access to those tests, whether they're run by the UK programme as indeed the drive-through centres are in Wales and other parts of the UK, or indeed from the programmes that we run and control here within NHS Wales."" People should not take matters into their own hands if they see people breaking lockdown rules, Wales' health minister has warned. Vaughan Gething said those with concerns about businesses not following rules should contact the council, while those concerned about individuals should contact the police. It comes afterpeople were seen crowding outside bars in Cardiffat the weekend. Mr Gething said ""intelligence from the wider community is really important"", but people must not get into ""conflict"" with those breaching rules. He added that the first action would be for police to ""engage"" with those people, in the hope they would change their behaviour, and then ""enforce"" the rules if necessary. This video can not be played Shock at crowds outside Cardiff nightclub Where are the hot spots in Wales and what is happening in care homes? We seem to be bombarded with different measures, but what do they mean and how does Wales compare with other parts of the UK? Here, we try to answer some of the questionsand explain what the different measures are and also give some of the most recent figures. Health Minister Vaughan Gething says people in Caerphilly need to recognise the ""clear and present threat"" which coronavirus represents. Mr Gething said the lockdown measures were a ""wake up call"" for people. He said the legal powers were ""a back stop"" but he expected the police to take action and use the ""full force of the law"" if the measures were flouted. People socialising in pubs is not ""a factor in transmission"" of coronavirus in Caerphilly, the health minister has said. From 18:00 BSTCaerphilly county will be placed in local lockdown, but pubs and bars will remain open. Vaughan Gething said pubs were not currently the issue, and has said many cases are down to people socialising in homes and at house parties. But he said he did not want to see pubs becoming ""a real factor and potentially have to close either individual businesses or indeed the whole sector"" because that would cause ""economic harm"". Mr Gething said the Welsh Government was taking ""proportionate action where we know transmission is taking place"". Health Minister Vaughan Gething said Gwent Police had been ""clear"" they will be policing and enforcing ""stay local"" rules in Caerphilly. He said in the past the ""great majority of people"" had behaved within the rules. But Mr Gething said police would be looking at the rules and guidance and then policing and enforcing it. He urged people to follow the rules and not ""lead us to a position where enforcement is necessary"". The health minister also reminded people in Caerphilly to ""stay local"" unless they have a ""reasonable excuse to leave or enter"". Communities in Caerphilly county borough ""must pull together"" to get through local lockdown, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. Restrictions to daily life will be brought inat 18:00 BST today. Mr Gething said: ""I know the introduction of these new rules will be disappointing for people many people living in Caerphilly borough; for some they will be a real inconvenience. ""But I would urge everyone in the borough to please pull together and follow these new guidelines. ""Only by working together can we reduce the spread of coronavirus and protect ourselves and our loved ones"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Rhiannon is a student at St Andrews University students have been telling the BBC how they were only told that most of their courses in the coming term will be taught online after paying hundreds of pounds for accommodation far from home. Sara is a third year student from Leeds, studying international development at King's College London, at a cost of Â£9,250 for the year. She says she was told her course would be completely online this term on 1 September - the day she began paying almost Â£3,000 for her accommodation. Sara moved home to Leeds in March, at the start of lockdown, She says she has hardly had any lectures since February, when university staff went on strike. In an email, seen by the BBC, she was then told ""all teaching for final year students"" will be online this term - including seminars and dissertation supervisions. In-person teaching in her second term ""will depend on the Covid-19 situation closer to the time"". It's left her feeling short-changed. ""If I knew that we were going to be online for the first semester I wouldn't have got accommodation for this term at all,"" Sara says. She says she's had little guidance about what campus life will look like and whether she will need to - or be able to - spend any time there. ""Do I need to be in London or not? Do I need to go in or not? There's no point in [just] sitting in my house,"" she says. ""I do think there should be some kind of reduction with everything online. You still get an education but they should reduce the amount you're paying."" The University of St Andrews also announced at the end of August that it was planning to phase in in-person teaching over the first seven weeks of term. It said only classes deemed to be ""essential"" would initially take place in-person. However, many students moving into halls for their first year had already signed their contracts by the time the announcement was made, while many second and third year students in private accommodation signed contracts months ago. Lottie, a third-year student in philosophy and history of art, says the university had initially encouraged students to return to the town. ""In June or July, they said that all students should plan to come back to St Andrews at the start of term and it would be dual teaching - everything they could do in person they would do, with the rest online. ""They did say they would give people the option to study completely online from home, but when you applied to do that you needed to have a specific reason."" Rhiannon, another student at St Andrews studying international relations, is paying Â£525 a month for a room in a shared house. ""Our house has been empty since March. I would have stayed at home, and cancelled my rental contract. I actually tried to negotiate with my landlord in June because of the uncertainty and the landlord was completely inflexible."" The University of St Andrews said the first fortnight of term would have no in-person teaching, other than laboratory-based classes, classes in medicine and some practical classes. In-person teaching would then be phased in from week three to five, but would be limited to small group tutorials and seminars ""where the physical presence in a classroom is preferred to support the educational experience"". The university currently plans to deliver ""all small group tutorials, seminars and classes smaller than 35 students in person"" from week seven of the term. It blamed the sudden change on increased student numbers this year. ""The late changes to the way A-level and Higher exam results were calculated have obliged us to admit significantly more entrants than would otherwise have been the case,""Principal Sally Mapstone said in a letter to staff and students,external. ""Our teaching arrangements are hugely important, but we are also focusing extremely closely on safety beyond the classroom, and how we support and ensure the safe behaviour of our student community in town,"" Mrs Mapstone added. King's College London told the BBC it was ""prioritising the safety of our students and staff, by developing a flexible approach to the start of the new academic year"". ""Where possible, and it is safe to do so, we are planning for some small group teaching to take place on campus,"" the university said. Should I go to university this year? What will university be like for freshers this year? 'Critical moment' as students return to university Students at several other universities have also contacted the BBC with similar stories. One said she only found out her course had moved online four days after her enrolment. Universities UK, which represents 137 universities in the UK, said it expected the vast majority of universities to retain some in-person teaching. ""A recent survey by UUK suggested that 97% of respondents are planning some in-person teaching for the new academic year in line with government and public health guidance. ""In addition, the overwhelming majority are providing some in-person social activities and support and wellbeing. Most students will experience a blended offer of online and in-person underpinned by a safety first approach,"" it said. But the National Union of Students called on universities to be ""honest and clear about the practicality of studies resuming"" and to ""provide support with housing, finances, digital learning, support services and transport if circumstances change"". NUS president Larissa Kennedy said government officials needed to offer a ""bigger package of financial support for student renters - many of whom have struggled to pay rent and fallen into arrears.""

"The daily confirmed figures for coronavirus cases have shown a significant jump in the past two days. On Sunday they rose by nearly 3,000 and then on Monday by almost exactly the same again - the highest single day increases since May. It means the UK is now seeing four times as many cases on average as it was in mid July. And with the impact of the return of schools still to come - not to mention the re-opening of universities next month - fears are growing that cases and then deaths could start spiralling. The rise has been laid firmly at the door of young people. Around half of new cases in recent weeks have been diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s. Significant numbers of cases have also been identified in people in their 40s and 50s, as well as teenagers. That compares to the early days when most of the confirmed cases were in the older age groups. But that was because the UK was largely only testing in hospitals. Younger adults are very unlikely to be sick enough to need hospital treatment, so they hardly showed up in the official figures. Cases are rising, what should I do to stop the spread? Remember the R number? Why is it so important? If you look at results from antibody testing, to see if they had been exposed to the virus, the younger age groups were just as likely as older groups - if not more - to have been exposed. So what is happening now appears to be simply a case of the virus re-establishing itself in a group that is the least at risk of serious complications, hence there are no signs of a significant increase in hospitalisations. Much has been made of the fact these are the groups going out socialising, although it is also noticeable that the highest rates are spread across much of the working age population - many of whom will have to leave their home to make a living. So does it matter? After all, the level of cases being seen - even taking into account there will still be some not being picked up - is well below where it was in the spring. At the peak at the end of March, there were an estimated 100,000 cases a day (the official figures only show a fraction of these because of the problem mentioned above - testing was more or less limited to hospitals). And the fact that cases are rising after hitting such a low mark over the summer should not come as a surprise. More people are being tested and that testing is being targeted at high infection rate areas for one thing. But that does not tell the whole story. With people mixing more, and summer over (respiratory viruses tend to do better because of colder weather and the fact people are indoors) cases were always going to go up, and are likely to continue to do so. If you could keep the infections in younger age groups, who are not at any significant risk of complications, there would in theory not be much of a problem. The difficulty, says Prof Devi Sridhar, a public health expert at Edinburgh University, is that as cases rise, this becomes harder to achieve. She believes we are already in a position where protecting vulnerable groups will become impossible. But she admits ministers are in a ""lose-lose"" situation. If they let the virus spread they will be held culpable for rising deaths, and if they re-introduce restrictions they will be criticised for over-reacting. The result is that the UK, like all nations, faces an almost impossible balancing act - accepting some level of deaths, while keeping society functioning. Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in health protection at the University of East Anglia, says it is not realistic to return to national lockdown, saying it would not be fair to ""handicap"" children any more by closing schools. ""This is a virus that is mainly risky to older, more vulnerable groups. We need to accept winter will be extremely difficult. ""It is about finding a tolerable solution. I don't think we will see the scale of deaths we saw in spring. ""But there are, sadly, going to be many this winter. It will be the worst winter for a long time."" The key in the coming months, Prof Hunter and others believe, will be keeping deaths as low as possible by protecting the most vulnerable - more than nine in 10 deaths have happened in the over 65s with half in the over 85s. There are a number of factors that will have an impact - and on many the UK is in a stronger position than it was six months ago. The discovery that two steroids - dexamethasone and hydrocortisone - can reduce deaths among the seriously ill will make a significant difference. And, as always, good hand hygiene and continued adherence to social distancing and isolating when you have symptoms will be important principles for everyone to follow. Big local outbreaks will also need to be contained as best as possible. This is where the test and trace system comes in. While huge progress has been made in recent months though, there are still issues to be resolved on both the availability of testing and ability to reach the close contacts of infected individuals. On top of that, the government and care industry will have to do a better job of protecting care homes. There is much better availability of PPE now than there was in the early days and although regular testing of staff and residents has been slow to roll out it is a world away from the situation earlier in the year when testing stopped once a home had five confirmed cases. It also seems likely the re-introduction of shielding for the most vulnerable groups will need to happen at some point. It is of course impossible to predict - and depends on many different factors. A leaked report obtained by BBC Newsnight suggested the government had been advised there could be 85,000 deaths under a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"". Of course, the worst-case scenario should be avoided. If we are to avoid returning to the scale of deaths seen in the spring - as Prof Hunter and others think is possible - that would mean limiting fatalities to under the 41,500 coronavirus deaths that have been seen during the pandemic. But during any winter, deaths always increase by many thousands. The worst one of recent memory was three years ago when an extra 15,000 more people died in England and Wales than had on average in the previous five winters. It was a cold winter, the strain of flu was a little more virulent than normal and the vaccine available was not particularly effective. This year in the fight against coronavirus there is no vaccine and very limited immunity. Keeping the death toll anywhere near zero is, sadly, going to be impossible.

Rhiannon, another student at St Andrews studying international relations, is paying Â£525 a month for a room in a shared house. ""Our house has been empty since March. I would have stayed at home, and cancelled my rental contract. I actually tried to negotiate with my landlord in June because of the uncertainty and the landlord was completely inflexible."" The University of St Andrews said the first fortnight of term would have no in-person teaching, other than laboratory-based classes, classes in medicine and some practical classes. In-person teaching would then be phased in from week three to five, but would be limited to small group tutorials and seminars ""where the physical presence in a classroom is preferred to support the educational experience"". The university currently plans to deliver ""all small group tutorials, seminars and classes smaller than 35 students in person"" from week seven of the term. It blamed the sudden change on increased student numbers this year. ""The late changes to the way A-level and Higher exam results were calculated have obliged us to admit significantly more entrants than would otherwise have been the case,""Principal Sally Mapstone said in a letter to staff and students,external. ""Our teaching arrangements are hugely important, but we are also focusing extremely closely on safety beyond the classroom, and how we support and ensure the safe behaviour of our student community in town,"" Mrs Mapstone added. King's College London told the BBC it was ""prioritising the safety of our students and staff, by developing a flexible approach to the start of the new academic year"". ""Where possible, and it is safe to do so, we are planning for some small group teaching to take place on campus,"" the university said. Should I go to university this year? What will university be like for freshers this year? 'Critical moment' as students return to university Students at several other universities have also contacted the BBC with similar stories. One said she only found out her course had moved online four days after her enrolment. Universities UK, which represents 137 universities in the UK, said it expected the vast majority of universities to retain some in-person teaching. ""A recent survey by UUK suggested that 97% of respondents are planning some in-person teaching for the new academic year in line with government and public health guidance. ""In addition, the overwhelming majority are providing some in-person social activities and support and wellbeing. Most students will experience a blended offer of online and in-person underpinned by a safety first approach,"" it said. But the National Union of Students called on universities to be ""honest and clear about the practicality of studies resuming"" and to ""provide support with housing, finances, digital learning, support services and transport if circumstances change"". NUS president Larissa Kennedy said government officials needed to offer a ""bigger package of financial support for student renters - many of whom have struggled to pay rent and fallen into arrears.""

"Police remain at the scene in Grange Farm, Kesgrave A ""long-barrelled gun"" has been recovered by police investigating the shooting of a 15-year-old boy on his way to school. The victimwas shot at about 08:40 BST on the Grange Farm estatein Kesgrave, Suffolk, on Monday. The Year 11 Kesgrave High School pupil is in a critical condition and a 15-year-old boy is under arrest. Supt Kerry Cutler said police were not looking for anyone else in connection with the shooting. She said: ""We have arrested an individual that we believe is involved in the incident and we also recovered a weapon."" The suspect, who is said to be from the Woodbridge area, was arrested by armed police on suspicion of attempted murder. Detectives have been granted a superintendent's extension to detain him for questioning for an additional 12 hours. A police cordon is in place at Friends Walk Supt Kerry Cutler said police were not looking for anyone else in connection with the shooting Suffolk Police said the two boys were known to each other and there was nothing to suggest the shooting was linked to organised criminality. The force said a boy was seen getting into a car following the attack. Officers added that a car had been seized and ""a long-barrelled firearm was recovered from inside it"". A temporary police station has been set up in Kesgrave and Supt Cutler said there was a large police presence, including officers from other forces. Police said a large police presence would remain in the area Supt Cutler said: ""Everybody is shocked, Kesgrave is on the outskirts of Ipswich, it is almost a semi-rural area, it's very much a residential area, this is not something we've seen in that area before and people will be impacted by it. ""The investigation goes on and we're still appealing for anybody who saw anything or has any information to come forward."" Suffolk Police said it was thought a single shot was fired on Friends Walk, off Through Jollys. Friends Walk remains closed off as police searches continue. Through Jollys and Ropes Drive reopened on Monday evening. The injured boy was airlifted to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge. A neighbour, who did not want to be named, said the victim's parents tended to the boy after he had been shot. ""They were very distraught, nothing like this ever happens in the estate,"" he said. Former paramedic Richard Bennett, who lives near the scene, said he heard the gunshot and thought ""what on earth was going on"". ""As the day went on the tragedy unfolded, a 15-year-old boy had been shot, it's unbelievable,"" he said. Ellie, whose brother is in the same year as the victim at Kesgrave High, said local people were in ""disbelief"". She said: ""I've grown up here and went to Kesgrave High and I had an absolutely blissful experience there, and this area in Kesgrave it's thought of as such a safe place, there's children everywhere, there's families everywhere, it's not somewhere you'd ever think this would happen.""

"EasyJet says it is expecting to fly fewer passengers because consumer confidence has been hit by UK coronavirus quarantine measures. The airline expanded its schedule to 40% of its normal capacity last month, but now says it expects that to fall. ""Customer confidence to make travel plans has been negatively affected"" by ""constantly evolving government restrictions"", EasyJet said. ""We know our customers are as frustrated as we are,"" it added. On Monday, the government added seven Greek islands to the quarantine list which means people return to England from these locations will have to isolate for 14 days. Johan Lundgren, the boss of EasyJet, told the BBC on Monday that the latest change to the quarantine rules - which means islands can be treated differently from their mainland countries if infection rates differ - was ""too little, too late"", as the peak of the summer holiday season had passed.

Dan Sanderson from the Telegraph asks if Lewis Capaldi or Andy Robertson might not be a better messenger for the TV and radio public health ads. ""Maybe Andy Robertson after a Scotland win last night?"" ponders the first minister. Ms Sturgeon adds: ""We think about this all the time."" The government is very mindful about the types of message that works best with each part of the population. She says there will soon be a marketing campaign aimed at young people. Prof Leitch points out Andy Robertson has already done a video clip to help out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Andrew Learmonth from the National asks about the UK government exploring the possibility of creating ""Covid-free"" passes for 24 hours after a test which would allow people to attend events. Ms Sturgeon says before a vaccine, we all hope to look at ways to allow people to test themselves regularly. But ""we cannot bank on that being a reality any time soon"", the first minister adds. ""The test doesn't exist and the logistics don't exist, but we should of course be in the room aiming for it,"" says Prof Leitch. Protesters gathered outside the Scottish Parliament at the weekend Alasdair Clark from Edinburgh Live asks about the conspiracy theories being shared as anti-lockdown protest marches. Ms Sturgeon says the right to protest is fundamental to democracy, but adds: ""This pandemic is not made up."" The measures in place are based on scientific advice, she adds, though she accepts some of this is more definitive than other parts. We hope an effective vaccine will be found soon and we will be encourage people to be vaccinated, she adds. Until then we will need to find ways to keep the virus at bay, she says.

Rachel Watson from the Daily Mail asks whether the level of young people being infected in being reflected in the rise in hospitalisations and deaths. I wouldn't make that assumptions, replies the first minister, though she adds she is unable to say more due to patient confidentiality. Prof Leitch adds that he would not be surprise is hospital admissions and deaths do not come for a month after the virus.  He explains this is because a person tends to be ill for two weeks before being hospitalised, and the person will incubate the virus for up to 10 days before that. ""That's why we're so worried when we see numbers rise even in youngsters,"" he adds. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Neil Pooran from PA asks about the number of tests being carried out and says the number of tests fell yesterday to around 12,000. ""You will see test numbers fluctuate day by day, "" replies the first minister. A large part of testing is demand led and yesterday's numbers would have reflected the number of tests done on Sunday, she adds. The number of tests carried out yesterday is just under 20,000 Ms Sturgeon tells Mr Pooran. Bryan Rutherford from Bauer asks about other areas which are causing concern and may face further restrictions soon. The first minister replies it is not possible to answer that question definitively. She explains figures in parts of Lanarkshire were a cause of concern, but it was not felt to be at the point where restrictions were necessary. Nicola Sturgeon also explains Inverclyde was looked at closely, but the cases numbers were ""significantly below"" cases per 100,000 compared to other parts of the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. ""But we have to keep the whole country under review,"" she adds, again highlighting every mainland health board has reported a positive case in the last 24 hours. Tim Backshall from ITV Border asks how concerned the first minister is about students going back to universities and colleges. ""To be blunt about it I'm concerned about everything that potentially increases transmission,"" replies Ms Sturgeon. She says over the next month the return of universities and colleges is probably the thing that is likely to have the biggest impact on that. The first minister adds: ""Yes I'm concerned, but we can't stay locked down for ever."" She points out following the basic public health messages and allowing Test and Protect to do its job is crucial. ""This is not unique to Scotland, this is a global pandemic."" The BBC's Suzanne Allan asks about the latest data on cases per 100,000 and whether a particular demographic is behind the increase. Ms Sturgeon confirms the incidence rate in Scotland as a whole, as of yesterday, was 20 per 100,000 people. This figure was slightly higher for the five council areas which are currently under stricter measures, she adds.  In terms of the demographic, the first minister says she does not was to ""point the finger"" but the greatest number of recent infections is in the 18-39 age group. She explains this is ""not surprising"" given this is the group more likely to be taking advantaging of reopening hospitality or to be back at work - but she warns that as the population is not segregated is is likely transmission will eventually move to older populations. Read more about the age profile of new infections here Ewan Petrie from STV asks how local authorities should enforce responsible behaviour in bars and restaurants. Mr Petrie also asks if the first minister is considering making restrictions on the number of pubs you can visit compulsory. ""Look, everything remains an option,"" replies Ms Sturgeon. ""We have to keep all options under review.""  Local authorities have the powers now to close down or put conditions on individual premises, she explains. The five council areas in the West of Scotland are actively looking at how to step up enforcement of restrictions. Theguidance for hospitality,externalnow has a legal underpinning. ""Ultimately it comes down to every one of us."" National clinical director Jason Leitch highlights the pandemic is still accelerating worldwide, with it likely the global death toll will cross 900,000 today. While Scotland, the UK and Europe has done well in reducing prevalence of Covid-19, it is accelerating again he says. ""We are worried about it,"" he adds. Prof Leitch  highlights there have been 1,000 new cases in Scotland in the last seven days. The national clinical director urges people to stick to the ""basic rules"" of FACTS. He admits to being worried when seeing groups in hospitality settings who are not keeping ""at least"" one metre apart. We're at the edge of what we can safely do while maintaining the prevalence at this rate and we have to do better to get those numbers down.""  The first minister says the virus is spreading again in Scotland. She explains that was always likely but it means that when the three weekly review comes on Thursday, ""we may well not be able to go ahead with any further easing of restrictions at this time"". The responsibility for avoiding the reimposition of more restrictions lies with all of us, she says.  She refutes the argument we don't need to worry about the situation which is ""potentially a really dangerous illusion"". The first minister calls on us to listen to the warning signal that the announcement of three deaths today is. Nicola Sturgeon stresses again people must follow the five pieces of advice in FACTS: They are: Ms Sturgeon explains she doesn't want to have to create new laws for the hospitality sector. People must take personal responsibility, she says and the first minister adds we are still living in a pandemic and we should not be socialising as we did in the past. Ms Sturgeon tells the briefing the international situation remains very volatile with cases rising across many country ""My advice is you should still be cautious at this time about non-essential foreign travel."" Ms Sturgeon says at the moment the number of new cases, while rising, in Inverclyde, North and South Lanarkshire does not warrant additional restrictions. This will be kept under review, explains the first minister. She says the evidence suggests house gatherings have made the biggest contribution to the spread of Covid across Greater Glasgow and Clyde. They are also where older and more vulnerable people are likely to socialise, she points out.  However some transmission is happening in pubs and restaurants so that is under close review. There remains a responsibility for customers, who should not meet more than eight people from a maximum of three households going out to the pub or restaurant. They must also socially distance from people from other households. The strong advice is to avoid busy bars where social distancing is difficult and to only visit one bar in an evening, Ms Sturgeon tells the briefing. The first minster accepts these rules are very unwelcome and she does not want them in place any longer than is necessary. Ms Sturgeon adds: ""Overall I believe that they represent a proportionate and hopefully effective, but also an absolutely necessary response to a worrying increase in Covid across these areas. ""The restrictions will be reviewed next week and will stay in place as long as they are needed, but they will not stay in place any longer than that."" The restrictions now cover the five council areas of Glasgow City, West Dunbartonshire, East Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire. The first minister explains that 1.1 million people in these areas:  Read more about the measures here.,external Ms Sturgeon turns to the extension of restrictions in the west of Scotland. The first minister points out the resilience committee met yesterday to discuss the restrictions put in place in  Glasgow, East Renfrewshire and West Dunbartonshire last week.  She says having assessed the number of new cases and assessed advice from clinical advisers it was decided the existing restrictions must stay in place. ""We also concluded on the evidence presented that the restrictions should also be extended to cover two other local authority areas."" That means restrictions on meeting in a house or visiting care home residents came into effect atmidnight in East Dunbartonshire and Renfrewshire. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Bill Birtles: ""It was a whirlwind week"" The last two reporters working in China for Australian media have flown home after a five-day diplomatic standoff. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Bill Birtles and the Australian Financial Review's Mike Smith landed in Sydney on Tuesday. Chinese authorities questioned both men before their departure. The ABC reported Birtles was ""not asked about his reporting or conduct in China"". Relations between Australia and China have deteriorated in recent years. There had been allegations of Chinese interference in Australian society in the past, but ties worsened after Canberra backed an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said on Mondaya record 17 foreign journalists were expelled from the country in the first half of 2020. Australian foreign minister Marise Payne said consular officials had assisted the pair in returning home. ""I also want to note that Australia is of course a strong supporter of media freedom, freedom of the press, and that it is disappointing that after many years, Australia will not have a media organisation present in China for some period of time,"" she added in a statement on Tuesday. The Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that Chinese authorities had questioned the journalists about Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist for Chinese state media who has been detained since last month. In their first comments on the detention, the Chinese foreign ministry said she was being held on ""national security grounds"". Mr Birtles told the BBC that Australian diplomats advised him last Monday that he should leave China immediately. ""They'd received some sort of warning or advice, they never specified what,"" said the journalist. He was then booked on a flight due to leave Beijing last Thursday. But the situation escalated on Wednesday at midnight when six Chinese police officers and a translator visited his apartment as he held farewell drinks with friends. He said the police did not detain him, but informed him that he was involved in a ""national security investigation,"" and that he could not leave the country. They said they would call him the following afternoon to talk about the investigation. He contacted Australian consular officials the next morning, who collected him and took him to the Australian embassy, where he spent the next four days. Mike Smith and Bill Birtles departed from Shanghai on Monday ""There obviously is not a great deal of trust with China at the moment about how safe I would have been if initially, by myself, I went and did that meeting,"" said Mr Birtles. He was later interviewed by Chinese police in the presence of Australia's ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher. Mr Birtles said he was questioned aboutCheng Lei, an Australian journalist who worked for state broadcaster CGTN. She was detained in China last month on suspicion of ""criminal activity endangering China's national security"". ""I know her, but not particularly well, it didn't seem like I would be the most logical person to interrogate if you wanted evidence about her case,"" he said. Mr Birtles said he was also asked about sources he used to report Hong Kong's national security law, and on Australia's relations with China. ""There wasn't any real rigorous effort to extract any evidence or anything that could really be used in any case,"" he added. Mr Smith, who is based in Shanghai, also received a visit by police - prompting him to go to the Australian consulate there. He, too, was questioned over Ms Cheng, the AFR reported. The pair were both allowed to leave the country after their interviews by police. ""It's very disappointing to have to leave under those circumstances,"" Mr Birtles said in Sydney. ""It's a relief to be back in the country with genuine rule of law. But this was a whirlwind and it's not a particularly good experience."" The AFR's editors, Michael Stutchbury and Paul Bailey, said they were glad both journalists were safe. ""This incident targeting two journalists, who were going about their normal reporting duties, is both regrettable and disturbing and is not in the interests of a co-operative relationship between Australia and China,"" they said in a joint statement. By anyone's standards, what happened with these two journalists is a worrying development. Bill Birtles and Mike Smith were the last correspondents for Australian media working in China. Their evacuation means for the first time since the mid-1970s, there are no accredited Australian journalists in the country. China is not only Australia's key trading partner and the biggest customer for its coal and iron ore, but it's also one of its most important stories to cover. As tensions rise between Beijing and Canberra, the need for journalists on the ground in China becomes ever more crucial. The ABC's news director, Gaven Morris, said: ""The story of China, its relationship with Australia and its role in our region and in the world is one of great importance for all Australians and we want to continue having our people on the ground to cover it."" How reliant is Australia on China? But as both countries continue to exchange political and diplomatic jabs - and with China's broader crackdown on Western journalists - it's hard to see when Australian reporters will be allowed back. This development is not only a critical marker in the relationship between the two countries, it will no doubt affect Australian media coverage of this important story. The countries rely heavily on each other for trade, but their relationship has soured in recent years, amid allegations of Chinese interference in Australian society. Ties have deteriorated further this year after Canberra backed an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus. In actions widely viewed as retaliatory, Beijing has since imposed restrictions on Australian exports such as beef, barley and wine. It has also warned Chinese tourists and students about racism in Australia. In July, Australia warned its citizens they may face ""arbitrary detention"" in China -a travel warning that remains in place,external. Canberra has also expressed concerns about human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and urged China to release detained Australians such as Yang Hengjun, a democracy activist who has been held for 19 months without trial. Yang Hengjun: 'I will fight to the end' Why China's rise exposes Australian vulnerabilities The case of Ms Lei - made public last week - has been shrouded in secrecy. The Melbourne-raised presenter for Chinese state broadcaster CGTN is beingheld in a secret location for unknown reasons, according to Australian officials.

"HMRC is now reviewing 27,000 ""high risk"" cases where abuse or fraud is suspected Up to Â£3.5bn in Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme payments may have been claimed fraudulently or paid out in error, the government has said. HM Revenue and Customs told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee it estimates that 5-10% of furlough cash has been wrongly awarded. Latest data shows the programme has cost the government Â£35.4bn so far. The scheme has paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave since March, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Speaking to MPs on Monday, HMRC's permanent secretary, Jim Harra, said: ""We have made an assumption for the purposes of our planning that the error and fraud rate in this scheme could be between 5% and 10%. ""That will range from deliberate fraud through to error."" The Public Accounts Committee estimates that a total of Â£30bn in tax was lost in 2019 due to taxpayer error and fraud. Both HM Treasury and HMRC were ordered to appear in front of MPs to explain how they were intending to reduce the problem. What's the latest with the furlough scheme? Coronavirus: Taxpayers to lose billions to virus fraud - report Furlough wind down: 'We prepared for the worst' ""What we have said in our risk assessment is we are not going to set out to try to find employers who have made legitimate mistakes in compiling their claims, because this is obviously something new that everybody had to get to grips with in a very difficult time,"" said Mr Harra. ""Although we will expect employers to check their claims and repay any excess amount, what we will be focusing on is tackling abuse and fraud."" So far, 8,000 calls have been received to HMRC's fraud telephone hotline. HMRC is now looking into 27,000 ""high risk"" cases where they believe a serious error has been made in the amount an employer has claimed, he added. Mr Harra advised that any employee who feels that their employer may have been fraudulently claiming furlough money can report it to HMRCby filling in a form on its website,external. ""While we can't get involved in any relationship between the employee and employer, we can certainly reclaim any grant that the employer is not entitled to, which includes grants they have not passed on in wages to their employees."" This is the first time that HMRC has spoken publicly about potential fraud affecting the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Swetha Ramachandran, investment manager at GAM Investments, told the BBC: ""The speed with which they wanted to expedite this programme in order to ensure that this was available to employers, to minimise the damage that could have been caused, means there was always a likelihood that this was going to happen. ""So I don't think it's that surprising."" She said other government programmes, such as the Bounce Back Loans scheme or the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans scheme, might suffer from similar problems. ""That won't probably emerge for a few months,"" she added. HMRC's Jim Harra: ""We will be focusing on is tackling abuse and fraud."" In July, centre-right think tank Policy Exchangewarned that fraud and error could cost the government between Â£1.3bn and Â£7.9bn. The think tank said the government's financial rescue scheme were vulnerable to scams because of the size of the packages and the speed at which measures were rushed through to save people and businesses from economic ruin. The calculation is based on expected fraud rates for government expenditure from the Cabinet Office and the Department for Work and Pensions. The report said the true value lost to fraud may be closer to the higher end of the estimate ""due to the higher than usual levels of fraud that accompany disaster management"". It said: ""This is a serious squandering of public finances and properly resourced post event assurance will be required to reassure the public that every possible step has been taken to reduce this level of fraud."" At the time, a government spokesman said it was committed to ""extensive post payment reviews of stimulus and support payments, to find fraud and recover money for the taxpayer"".

Here is a round-up of the major Covid-19 stories from today in the UK:  Demand at testing sites in Bolton has led to queues The French PM visited a section of the Tour de France route on Saturday Coronavirus cases rising, lockdown restrictions returning, economies wobbling. The pandemic has wreaked havoc worldwide on yet another eventful day. In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. Olga Robinson and Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check People in several countries have been sharing a link to a
webpage connected to the World Bank saying it shows test kits for Covid-19 were
being exported in 2017, long before the disease was known to exist. The claim on social media is that this is evidence the
pandemic was planned all along â but this is false and we can settle any doubts
about whatâs going on. The page is genuine and includes trade information under the
heading âCovid-19 test kits exports by country in 2017â. So you can understand why this might have
caused some confusion. Itâs from a database run by international organisations
including the World Bank. According to the World Bank, the page was created to make it
easier to find all of the previously existing products that are now being used
for Covid-19. All the medical devices listed on the site have had other
uses for many years, but they were re-labelled to ease the tracking of items
that are particularly important to tackle coronavirus. The title of the page has been amended to âmedical kitsâ and
to avoid further misunderstanding includes a disclaimer that says, âThe data
here track previously existing medical devices that are now classified by
the World Customs Organization as critical to tackling Covid-19.â The claim appears to have emerged on English-language
Facebook late last week and then spread across Twitter, Instagram and Reddit
over the weekend. Over the past few days it has also been shared in Italian,
German, Polish, Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch and other languages. The allegations have also been amplified by opponents of
vaccination and supporters of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. Earlierwe brought you the latest coronavirus figures for Great Britain- as there was a delay with the Northern Ireland data. That is now in and the updated figures for the whole UK show 2,460 new cases of coronavirus reported in the past 24 hours. There have also been a total of 32 deaths of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. It is the highest daily figure since 29 July,according to the government data,external.  If you're in the UK, here is a round-up of useful information on the spread of Covid-19: Travellers to Sydney, Australia are kept in isolation for a period to curb the spread of the coronavirus Police in Sydney, Australia have accused a man of falsely claiming his grandfather was terminally ill as an excuse to leave quarantine early. The 30-year-old man from neighbouring Victoria state was asked to quarantine at a hotel after arriving at Sydney Airport on Friday without an exemption. But the following morning, the man was released after he provided what he claimed to be a valid exemption document, saying he was in New South Wales to visit his terminally ill grandfather in hospital. Police later determined the document to be false, and discovered the manâs grandfather was not in hospital. The man was arrested on Saturday and charged with failure to comply with coronavirus regulations, and producing false documentation,police said,external. He was given bail and returned to hotel quarantine, with a court appearance due on 12 October 2020. Coronavirus restrictions have been eased in parts of northern England allowing more businesses to reopen - except in Bolton where there has been a rise in cases. Soft-play centres, bowling alleys, gyms and casinos are able to open again in parts of Lancashire, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire which had had restrictions reimposed. Beauty salons can also begin close-contact treatments such as facials. The move brings these areas back in line with the rest of England. One owner of a gym in Blackburn, Lancashire, described his ""unbelievable relief"" and ""excitement"" at being allowed to reopen after six months. ""I am finally back doing what I do best,"" said Nick Talbot, owner of The FitMill. He said he feared he would lose his gym if it did not reopen soon. Read more here. The Moria camp in Lesbos recorded its first case of coronavirus last week Three migrant facilities in Greece have entered quarantine amid concerns over the spread of Covid-19 among thousands of asylum seekers living in dire conditions. Restrictions will be placed on the camps of Malakassa, Schisto and Eleonas until 21 September, the Greek government said. Greece's migrant camps have technically been under lockdown since March, with restrictions on who can leave and enter. This has prompted criticism from aid groups, who have warned that an outbreak of the virus at these camps, where sanitation is poor and accommodation overcrowded, could easily spread. One of the largest camps, Moria, which hosts almost 13,000 asylum seekers on the island of Lesbos, recorded its first case of coronavirus last week. Up to now, Greece has recorded few coronavirus infections and deaths relative to its European neighbours. Of the 289 deaths confirmed in total, none of them have been at migrant camps. These up-to-date charts show that while confirmed cases in the UK are rising sharply...  ...the number of Covid hospital admissions remains low: The number of people dying with Covid-19 also remains relatively low: French Prime Minister Jean Castex said he would self-isolate until he received his test result French Prime Minister Jean Castex has tested negative for Covid-19,the BFM TV channel has reported, citing his office,external. Earlier, we reported that Castex was to be tested as a precaution, after he shared a car with the director of the Tour de France, Christian Prudhomme, who has contracted the virus. Prudhomme was confirmed positive on Tuesday. He and Castex had travelled in a car together along the route of the cycling race on Saturday. The prime ministerâs office said they were both âwearing masks and respecting social distancingâ. The posters put up in Skin Kerr salon in Bootle have since been taken down A beauty salon that said Covid-19 did not exist will be visited by police. Skin Kerr salon in Bootle put posters in its window and posted online stating masks weren't being worn by staff as ""You can't catch what doesn't exist."" Merseyside Police said officers would visit the salon to ""remind"" the owner and staff of their responsibilities around Covid-19. Sefton Council said its environmental health team would also visit and the owners are due to meet the council on Wednesday. The BBC has been unable to contact Skin Kerr for a response.Read our full story here. Canada's top doctor is urging caution after coronavirus cases spiked 25% in one week across the country.

Kamala Harris has said she would not necessarily trust a vaccine approved by the Trump administration Democratic US vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris has said she would trust a coronavirus vaccine developed under US President Donald Trump, but only if health experts gave it their approval. Harris drew criticism from Republicans after saying she would not trust a vaccine approved by the Trump administration unless a ""credible"" source agreed it was safe. She and other Democrats have accused President Trump of pressuring health authorities to speed up vaccine development before Novemberâs presidential election. In response, President Trump has accused the Democrats of using ""anti-vaccine rhetoric"" for political ends. But today Harris struck a different tone in an interview with the WISN TV channel, saying: ""I would trust a vaccine if the public health professionals and the scientists told us that we can trust it."" As we reported earlier, nine companies developing vaccines against Covid-19 have pledged to ""uphold the integrity of the scientific process"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned the test-and-trace system is ""on the verge of collapse"". He said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had to take responsibility amid a rise in the number of coronavirus infections in the UK. Sir Keir told the BBC: ""Everybody is deeply concerned about the rise in the rate of infection. ""As we reopen the economy, as children go back to school, this was always going to be a risk, we understand that."" He said Mr Johnson should have used the summer to get a ""very effective"" test-and-trace system running. He added: ""What we're now seeing is stories over the past few days that is showing the testing regime is on the verge of collapse. ""Heartbreaking stories from people who need a test being told no tests are available. ""Or the website is crashing, or people are being told to go miles and miles for a test. Nobody can argue that that is good governance."" Sir Keir said he still supported the principles of the government's coronavirus restrictions. But he said that the government's messaging had been ""confused"". The parliament usually meets once a month in Strasbourg Next weekâs session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg has been cancelled over concerns about the spread of coronavirus in the French city. The parliament will hold the plenary session in the Belgian capital, Brussels, instead, EU Parliament President David Sassoli has announced. ""We are very saddened by this decision, but the transfer of the administrative operation of the European Parliament would mean all the staff would have to be quarantined on their return to Brussels,"" Sassoli said. The EU Parliament usually meets once a month for a plenary session in Strasbourg to vote on legislation and discuss political issues. The next session, scheduled for 14-17 September, was to be the first in the city since coronavirus containment measures were introduced in March. But MEPs have shown resistance to the notion of reconvening parliament in the city, which was recently designated a Covid-19 âred zoneâ. In a tweet,external, French MEP Christophe Grudler said the decision to relocate the session to Brussels went against the advice of French health authorities, describing it as âlamentableâ. The aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has been delayed a second day after a Covid outbreak on board. The Royal Navy warship was due to leave Portsmouth for training exerciseson Monday. A MoD spokesman confirmed that âfewer than 10â members of the 1,000-strong crew had tested positive. They are in isolation on shore, while people who had been in contact with them are isolating on board. The ship is now due to leaveon Wednesday.,external The Royal Navy said the positive tests were detected during ""routine"" preparations Silvio Berlusconi has served as Italian prime minister in four governments Thereâs been an update on the condition of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week. The doctor treating Berlusconi for a lung infection at San Raffaele hospital in Milan says his condition has shown a âfavourable evolutionâ. Berlusconiâs signs of recovery âare reassuringâ, said Alberto Zangrillo, head of the hospitalâs cardiovascular intensive-care unit. Berlusconi, 83, was admitted to hospital on Thursday. The media mogul's positive diagnosis came last week after a holiday at his luxury villa in Sardinia. His companion, Marta Fascina, and two of his children - daughter Barbara, 36, and son Luigi, 31 - have also contracted the virus. ONS figures earlier showed weekly deaths had dropped to their lowest level since mid-March - but that did not mean the virus is still a threat, according to England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. He told the Commons: ""We have seen a concerning rise in the number of positive cases, particularly among younger people, and these figures serve as a salutary reminder that this virus is still very much with us and remains a threat."" He said: ""Of course, there is a lag between people catching the disease and the statistics for new cases, and those who sadly die. ""The second thing is that this rise most recently has been largely, predominantly, not entirely, amongst young people who are much less likely to die. ""The danger is that they will pass it on to others and it will spread more broadly into the community.
""So, it is important to act on these cases even though, thankfully, currently the number who are dying is small."" He was speaking before Tuesday's daily coronavirus figures were released.

These up-to-date charts show that while confirmed cases in the UK are rising sharply...  ...the number of Covid hospital admissions remains low: The number of people dying with Covid-19 also remains relatively low: French Prime Minister Jean Castex said he would self-isolate until he received his test result French Prime Minister Jean Castex has tested negative for Covid-19,the BFM TV channel has reported, citing his office,external. Earlier, we reported that Castex was to be tested as a precaution, after he shared a car with the director of the Tour de France, Christian Prudhomme, who has contracted the virus. Prudhomme was confirmed positive on Tuesday. He and Castex had travelled in a car together along the route of the cycling race on Saturday. The prime ministerâs office said they were both âwearing masks and respecting social distancingâ.

Kamala Harris has said she would not necessarily trust a vaccine approved by the Trump administration Democratic US vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris has said she would trust a coronavirus vaccine developed under US President Donald Trump, but only if health experts gave it their approval. Harris drew criticism from Republicans after saying she would not trust a vaccine approved by the Trump administration unless a ""credible"" source agreed it was safe. She and other Democrats have accused President Trump of pressuring health authorities to speed up vaccine development before Novemberâs presidential election. In response, President Trump has accused the Democrats of using ""anti-vaccine rhetoric"" for political ends. But today Harris struck a different tone in an interview with the WISN TV channel, saying: ""I would trust a vaccine if the public health professionals and the scientists told us that we can trust it."" As we reported earlier, nine companies developing vaccines against Covid-19 have pledged to ""uphold the integrity of the scientific process"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned the test-and-trace system is ""on the verge of collapse"". He said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had to take responsibility amid a rise in the number of coronavirus infections in the UK. Sir Keir told the BBC: ""Everybody is deeply concerned about the rise in the rate of infection. ""As we reopen the economy, as children go back to school, this was always going to be a risk, we understand that."" He said Mr Johnson should have used the summer to get a ""very effective"" test-and-trace system running. He added: ""What we're now seeing is stories over the past few days that is showing the testing regime is on the verge of collapse. ""Heartbreaking stories from people who need a test being told no tests are available. ""Or the website is crashing, or people are being told to go miles and miles for a test. Nobody can argue that that is good governance."" Sir Keir said he still supported the principles of the government's coronavirus restrictions. But he said that the government's messaging had been ""confused"". The parliament usually meets once a month in Strasbourg Next weekâs session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg has been cancelled over concerns about the spread of coronavirus in the French city. The parliament will hold the plenary session in the Belgian capital, Brussels, instead, EU Parliament President David Sassoli has announced. ""We are very saddened by this decision, but the transfer of the administrative operation of the European Parliament would mean all the staff would have to be quarantined on their return to Brussels,"" Sassoli said. The EU Parliament usually meets once a month for a plenary session in Strasbourg to vote on legislation and discuss political issues. The next session, scheduled for 14-17 September, was to be the first in the city since coronavirus containment measures were introduced in March. But MEPs have shown resistance to the notion of reconvening parliament in the city, which was recently designated a Covid-19 âred zoneâ. In a tweet,external, French MEP Christophe Grudler said the decision to relocate the session to Brussels went against the advice of French health authorities, describing it as âlamentableâ. The aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has been delayed a second day after a Covid outbreak on board. The Royal Navy warship was due to leave Portsmouth for training exerciseson Monday. A MoD spokesman confirmed that âfewer than 10â members of the 1,000-strong crew had tested positive. They are in isolation on shore, while people who had been in contact with them are isolating on board. The ship is now due to leaveon Wednesday.,external The Royal Navy said the positive tests were detected during ""routine"" preparations Silvio Berlusconi has served as Italian prime minister in four governments Thereâs been an update on the condition of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week. The doctor treating Berlusconi for a lung infection at San Raffaele hospital in Milan says his condition has shown a âfavourable evolutionâ. Berlusconiâs signs of recovery âare reassuringâ, said Alberto Zangrillo, head of the hospitalâs cardiovascular intensive-care unit. Berlusconi, 83, was admitted to hospital on Thursday. The media mogul's positive diagnosis came last week after a holiday at his luxury villa in Sardinia. His companion, Marta Fascina, and two of his children - daughter Barbara, 36, and son Luigi, 31 - have also contracted the virus. ONS figures earlier showed weekly deaths had dropped to their lowest level since mid-March - but that did not mean the virus is still a threat, according to England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. He told the Commons: ""We have seen a concerning rise in the number of positive cases, particularly among younger people, and these figures serve as a salutary reminder that this virus is still very much with us and remains a threat."" He said: ""Of course, there is a lag between people catching the disease and the statistics for new cases, and those who sadly die. ""The second thing is that this rise most recently has been largely, predominantly, not entirely, amongst young people who are much less likely to die. ""The danger is that they will pass it on to others and it will spread more broadly into the community.
""So, it is important to act on these cases even though, thankfully, currently the number who are dying is small."" He was speaking before Tuesday's daily coronavirus figures were released.

"Donald Trump delivered his Labour Day news conference from the White House Donald Trump and Joe Biden have been trading insults over each other's position on a vaccine for Covid-19. President Trump again hinted that a vaccine might be available before the November presidential election and accused his Democratic rivals of ""reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric"". Mr Biden expressed scepticism that Mr Trump would listen to the scientists and implement a transparent process. The US has six million cases of coronavirus, the highest in the world. The virus has also claimed nearly 190,000 lives and fuelled a major recession, double-digit unemployment and sagging consumer confidence. Last week it emerged the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had urged states to consider ""waiving requirements"" in order to be able distribute a vaccine by 1 November - two days before the 3 November election. No vaccine has yet completed clinical trials, leading some scientists to fear politics rather than health and safety is driving the push for a vaccine. How close to developing a vaccine are we? What drugs can help treat coronavirus? Both Mr Biden and his running mate Kamala Harris have questioned the president's credibility on the issue. Ms Harris said on Sunday she would not trust Mr Trump's word that a vaccine was safe, and Mr Biden also questioned whether the wider public would trust him too. ""He has said so many things that aren't true I am worried that if we do have a really good vaccine people are going to be reluctant to take it,"" Mr Biden said in Pennsylvania on Monday, Labour Day. Joe Biden was speaking while on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania But he added that: ""If I could get a vaccine tomorrow, I'd do it. If it cost me the election I would do it. We need a vaccine and we need it now. We have to listen to the scientists."" Mr Trump, who is trailing in the polls, hit back at a White House news conference, calling Mr Biden ""stupid"" and Ms Harris ""the most liberal person in Congress... not a competent person in my opinion"". He said they ""would destroy this country and would destroy this economy"", and added that they ""should immediately apologise for the reckless anti-vaccine rhetoric that they are talking right now"". The president, at times asking journalists to take off their face masks when asking questions, again suggested a vaccine could be ready next month. ""We're going to have a vaccine very soon, maybe even before a very special date,"" he said. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Trump panned over reports he mocked US military Trump is a racist mobster, says ex-lawyer in book The top US infectious diseases expert, Dr Anthony Fauci, has said that it is unlikely but ""not impossible"" that a vaccine could win approval in October, and Stephen Hahn of the Food and Drug Administration said it might be ""appropriate"" to approve a vaccine before clinical trials are complete if the benefits outweighed the risks. But both scientists, the White House and the executives of five top pharmaceutical companies have made clear there will be no compromises on safety and effectiveness of a vaccine. Three vaccine trials in the US are in their final stages - each involving 30,000 people who will get shots, three weeks apart, and will then be monitored for coronavirus infections and side effects for anywhere from a week to two years, the Associated Press reports.

Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Our editors were: Helier Cheung, Martha Buckley and Owen Amos. Our contributors were Lauren Turner, Ashitha Nagesh, Marie Jackson and Joshua Nevett. Here is a round-up of the major Covid-19 stories from today in the UK:  Demand at testing sites in Bolton has led to queues The French PM visited a section of the Tour de France route on Saturday Coronavirus cases rising, lockdown restrictions returning, economies wobbling. The pandemic has wreaked havoc worldwide on yet another eventful day. In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. Olga Robinson and Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check People in several countries have been sharing a link to a
webpage connected to the World Bank saying it shows test kits for Covid-19 were
being exported in 2017, long before the disease was known to exist. The claim on social media is that this is evidence the
pandemic was planned all along â but this is false and we can settle any doubts
about whatâs going on. The page is genuine and includes trade information under the
heading âCovid-19 test kits exports by country in 2017â. So you can understand why this might have
caused some confusion. Itâs from a database run by international organisations
including the World Bank. According to the World Bank, the page was created to make it
easier to find all of the previously existing products that are now being used
for Covid-19. All the medical devices listed on the site have had other
uses for many years, but they were re-labelled to ease the tracking of items
that are particularly important to tackle coronavirus. The title of the page has been amended to âmedical kitsâ and
to avoid further misunderstanding includes a disclaimer that says, âThe data
here track previously existing medical devices that are now classified by
the World Customs Organization as critical to tackling Covid-19.â The claim appears to have emerged on English-language
Facebook late last week and then spread across Twitter, Instagram and Reddit
over the weekend. Over the past few days it has also been shared in Italian,
German, Polish, Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch and other languages. The allegations have also been amplified by opponents of
vaccination and supporters of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. Earlierwe brought you the latest coronavirus figures for Great Britain- as there was a delay with the Northern Ireland data. That is now in and the updated figures for the whole UK show 2,460 new cases of coronavirus reported in the past 24 hours. There have also been a total of 32 deaths of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. It is the highest daily figure since 29 July,according to the government data,external.  If you're in the UK, here is a round-up of useful information on the spread of Covid-19: Travellers to Sydney, Australia are kept in isolation for a period to curb the spread of the coronavirus Police in Sydney, Australia have accused a man of falsely claiming his grandfather was terminally ill as an excuse to leave quarantine early. The 30-year-old man from neighbouring Victoria state was asked to quarantine at a hotel after arriving at Sydney Airport on Friday without an exemption. But the following morning, the man was released after he provided what he claimed to be a valid exemption document, saying he was in New South Wales to visit his terminally ill grandfather in hospital. Police later determined the document to be false, and discovered the manâs grandfather was not in hospital. The man was arrested on Saturday and charged with failure to comply with coronavirus regulations, and producing false documentation,police said,external. He was given bail and returned to hotel quarantine, with a court appearance due on 12 October 2020. Coronavirus restrictions have been eased in parts of northern England allowing more businesses to reopen - except in Bolton where there has been a rise in cases. Soft-play centres, bowling alleys, gyms and casinos are able to open again in parts of Lancashire, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire which had had restrictions reimposed. Beauty salons can also begin close-contact treatments such as facials. The move brings these areas back in line with the rest of England. One owner of a gym in Blackburn, Lancashire, described his ""unbelievable relief"" and ""excitement"" at being allowed to reopen after six months. ""I am finally back doing what I do best,"" said Nick Talbot, owner of The FitMill. He said he feared he would lose his gym if it did not reopen soon. Read more here. The Moria camp in Lesbos recorded its first case of coronavirus last week Three migrant facilities in Greece have entered quarantine amid concerns over the spread of Covid-19 among thousands of asylum seekers living in dire conditions. Restrictions will be placed on the camps of Malakassa, Schisto and Eleonas until 21 September, the Greek government said. Greece's migrant camps have technically been under lockdown since March, with restrictions on who can leave and enter. This has prompted criticism from aid groups, who have warned that an outbreak of the virus at these camps, where sanitation is poor and accommodation overcrowded, could easily spread. One of the largest camps, Moria, which hosts almost 13,000 asylum seekers on the island of Lesbos, recorded its first case of coronavirus last week.

"Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are relaxing some of the rules around gatherings and mixing with others which were introduced to tackle the spread of Omicron. However, some restrictions remain. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has announceda further easing of Covid rules. From Friday 28 January, the requirement for physical distancing in indoor settings where people don't have to wear a face covering - such as those leading religious services - will reduce to 1m (3ft) from 2m (6 ft). Most of the rules governingindoorandoutdoorevents have already been lifted. Covid passports arerequired for nightclubs and large events. All restrictions at outdoor events have now been lifted. On 28 January, nightclubs will reopen, and the so-called ""rule of six"" - where gatherings in pubs and restaurants are limited to six people - will be scrapped. Some restrictions will remain in place: social distancing of 2m (6ft) in all premises open to the public and workplaces, where reasonable licensed premises must take additional measures to protect customers and staff, including table service and collecting contact details face coverings are required in hospitality settings, apart from when seated vaccine passports continue to berequired for venues including restaurants, bars and cinemas Pubs and other hospitality venues now no longer have to offer table service only, and the ""rule of six"", governing the size of groups in hospitality venues, has been scrapped. From Wednesday 26 January: Proof of Covid status ""encouraged"" but no longer legally required for entry to bars, restaurants or cinemas Nightclubs will be allowed to reopen, with dancing and unseated indoor events allowed again - Covid passports will remain in use for these venues (and for partially seated events with 500 or more people in attendance) Some rules remain in place: a maximum of 30 people from an unlimited number of households can meet indoors in domestic settings shops must take ""reasonable measures to manage risk"" and shoppers are asked to maintain physical distance with each other where possible. face coverings are compulsory in shops, indoor seated venues and visitor attractions, public transport and some other settings Thecurrent restrictions in Englanddon't include any limits on socialising - so friends and family are legally allowed to see each other in private houses, or to meet in public places like pubs and nightclubs.

"The daily confirmed figures for coronavirus cases have shown a significant jump in the past two days. On Sunday they rose by nearly 3,000 and then on Monday by almost exactly the same again - the highest single day increases since May. It means the UK is now seeing four times as many cases on average as it was in mid July. And with the impact of the return of schools still to come - not to mention the re-opening of universities next month - fears are growing that cases and then deaths could start spiralling. The rise has been laid firmly at the door of young people. Around half of new cases in recent weeks have been diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s. Significant numbers of cases have also been identified in people in their 40s and 50s, as well as teenagers. That compares to the early days when most of the confirmed cases were in the older age groups. But that was because the UK was largely only testing in hospitals. Younger adults are very unlikely to be sick enough to need hospital treatment, so they hardly showed up in the official figures. Cases are rising, what should I do to stop the spread? Remember the R number? Why is it so important? If you look at results from antibody testing, to see if they had been exposed to the virus, the younger age groups were just as likely as older groups - if not more - to have been exposed. So what is happening now appears to be simply a case of the virus re-establishing itself in a group that is the least at risk of serious complications, hence there are no signs of a significant increase in hospitalisations. Much has been made of the fact these are the groups going out socialising, although it is also noticeable that the highest rates are spread across much of the working age population - many of whom will have to leave their home to make a living. So does it matter? After all, the level of cases being seen - even taking into account there will still be some not being picked up - is well below where it was in the spring. At the peak at the end of March, there were an estimated 100,000 cases a day (the official figures only show a fraction of these because of the problem mentioned above - testing was more or less limited to hospitals). And the fact that cases are rising after hitting such a low mark over the summer should not come as a surprise. More people are being tested and that testing is being targeted at high infection rate areas for one thing. But that does not tell the whole story. With people mixing more, and summer over (respiratory viruses tend to do better because of colder weather and the fact people are indoors) cases were always going to go up, and are likely to continue to do so. If you could keep the infections in younger age groups, who are not at any significant risk of complications, there would in theory not be much of a problem. The difficulty, says Prof Devi Sridhar, a public health expert at Edinburgh University, is that as cases rise, this becomes harder to achieve. She believes we are already in a position where protecting vulnerable groups will become impossible. But she admits ministers are in a ""lose-lose"" situation. If they let the virus spread they will be held culpable for rising deaths, and if they re-introduce restrictions they will be criticised for over-reacting. The result is that the UK, like all nations, faces an almost impossible balancing act - accepting some level of deaths, while keeping society functioning. Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in health protection at the University of East Anglia, says it is not realistic to return to national lockdown, saying it would not be fair to ""handicap"" children any more by closing schools. ""This is a virus that is mainly risky to older, more vulnerable groups. We need to accept winter will be extremely difficult. ""It is about finding a tolerable solution. I don't think we will see the scale of deaths we saw in spring. ""But there are, sadly, going to be many this winter. It will be the worst winter for a long time."" The key in the coming months, Prof Hunter and others believe, will be keeping deaths as low as possible by protecting the most vulnerable - more than nine in 10 deaths have happened in the over 65s with half in the over 85s. There are a number of factors that will have an impact - and on many the UK is in a stronger position than it was six months ago. The discovery that two steroids - dexamethasone and hydrocortisone - can reduce deaths among the seriously ill will make a significant difference. And, as always, good hand hygiene and continued adherence to social distancing and isolating when you have symptoms will be important principles for everyone to follow. Big local outbreaks will also need to be contained as best as possible. This is where the test and trace system comes in. While huge progress has been made in recent months though, there are still issues to be resolved on both the availability of testing and ability to reach the close contacts of infected individuals. On top of that, the government and care industry will have to do a better job of protecting care homes. There is much better availability of PPE now than there was in the early days and although regular testing of staff and residents has been slow to roll out it is a world away from the situation earlier in the year when testing stopped once a home had five confirmed cases. It also seems likely the re-introduction of shielding for the most vulnerable groups will need to happen at some point. It is of course impossible to predict - and depends on many different factors. A leaked report obtained by BBC Newsnight suggested the government had been advised there could be 85,000 deaths under a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"". Of course, the worst-case scenario should be avoided. If we are to avoid returning to the scale of deaths seen in the spring - as Prof Hunter and others think is possible - that would mean limiting fatalities to under the 41,500 coronavirus deaths that have been seen during the pandemic. But during any winter, deaths always increase by many thousands. The worst one of recent memory was three years ago when an extra 15,000 more people died in England and Wales than had on average in the previous five winters. It was a cold winter, the strain of flu was a little more virulent than normal and the vaccine available was not particularly effective. This year in the fight against coronavirus there is no vaccine and very limited immunity. Keeping the death toll anywhere near zero is, sadly, going to be impossible.

"The daily confirmed figures for coronavirus cases have shown a significant jump in the past two days. On Sunday they rose by nearly 3,000 and then on Monday by almost exactly the same again - the highest single day increases since May. It means the UK is now seeing four times as many cases on average as it was in mid July. And with the impact of the return of schools still to come - not to mention the re-opening of universities next month - fears are growing that cases and then deaths could start spiralling. The rise has been laid firmly at the door of young people. Around half of new cases in recent weeks have been diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s. Significant numbers of cases have also been identified in people in their 40s and 50s, as well as teenagers. That compares to the early days when most of the confirmed cases were in the older age groups. But that was because the UK was largely only testing in hospitals. Younger adults are very unlikely to be sick enough to need hospital treatment, so they hardly showed up in the official figures. Cases are rising, what should I do to stop the spread? Remember the R number? Why is it so important? If you look at results from antibody testing, to see if they had been exposed to the virus, the younger age groups were just as likely as older groups - if not more - to have been exposed. So what is happening now appears to be simply a case of the virus re-establishing itself in a group that is the least at risk of serious complications, hence there are no signs of a significant increase in hospitalisations. Much has been made of the fact these are the groups going out socialising, although it is also noticeable that the highest rates are spread across much of the working age population - many of whom will have to leave their home to make a living. So does it matter? After all, the level of cases being seen - even taking into account there will still be some not being picked up - is well below where it was in the spring. At the peak at the end of March, there were an estimated 100,000 cases a day (the official figures only show a fraction of these because of the problem mentioned above - testing was more or less limited to hospitals). And the fact that cases are rising after hitting such a low mark over the summer should not come as a surprise. More people are being tested and that testing is being targeted at high infection rate areas for one thing. But that does not tell the whole story. With people mixing more, and summer over (respiratory viruses tend to do better because of colder weather and the fact people are indoors) cases were always going to go up, and are likely to continue to do so. If you could keep the infections in younger age groups, who are not at any significant risk of complications, there would in theory not be much of a problem.

"It is thought that a million people have been detained in camps in Xinjiang, China Disney is under fire for shooting its new film Mulan in parts of China where the government is accused of serious human rights abuses. The final credits thank a government security agency in Xinjiang province, where about 1m people - mostly Muslim Uighurs - are thought to be detained. The film was already thetarget of a boycottafter its lead actress backed a crackdown on Hong Kong protesters. Disney has not commented on the row over the locations and the credits. China says its detention camps in Xinjiang are necessary to improve security. The live-action film, which is one of the biggest releases of the year, is a remake of the 1998 animated story of a young girl who takes her father's place in the army. But fans in some Asian countries called for a boycott after Chinese-born actress Liu Yifei made comments supporting Hong Kong's police who have been accused of violence against pro-democracy protesters in recent months. Then, on Monday, social media users noticed that inthe credits Disney thanked a number of government entities in Xinjiang,external, including the public security bureau in the city of Turpan and the ""publicity department of CPC Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomy Region Committee"".

Join us again tomorrow for more of the latest news on coronavirus as it happens. Our editors were: Helier Cheung, Martha Buckley and Owen Amos. Our contributors were Lauren Turner, Ashitha Nagesh, Marie Jackson and Joshua Nevett. Here is a round-up of the major Covid-19 stories from today in the UK:  Demand at testing sites in Bolton has led to queues The French PM visited a section of the Tour de France route on Saturday Coronavirus cases rising, lockdown restrictions returning, economies wobbling. The pandemic has wreaked havoc worldwide on yet another eventful day. In case you missed them, here are some of the main developments from around the world today. Olga Robinson and Jack GoodmanBBC Reality Check People in several countries have been sharing a link to a
webpage connected to the World Bank saying it shows test kits for Covid-19 were
being exported in 2017, long before the disease was known to exist. The claim on social media is that this is evidence the
pandemic was planned all along â but this is false and we can settle any doubts
about whatâs going on. The page is genuine and includes trade information under the
heading âCovid-19 test kits exports by country in 2017â. So you can understand why this might have
caused some confusion. Itâs from a database run by international organisations
including the World Bank. According to the World Bank, the page was created to make it
easier to find all of the previously existing products that are now being used
for Covid-19. All the medical devices listed on the site have had other
uses for many years, but they were re-labelled to ease the tracking of items
that are particularly important to tackle coronavirus. The title of the page has been amended to âmedical kitsâ and
to avoid further misunderstanding includes a disclaimer that says, âThe data
here track previously existing medical devices that are now classified by
the World Customs Organization as critical to tackling Covid-19.â The claim appears to have emerged on English-language
Facebook late last week and then spread across Twitter, Instagram and Reddit
over the weekend. Over the past few days it has also been shared in Italian,
German, Polish, Hebrew, Spanish, Dutch and other languages. The allegations have also been amplified by opponents of
vaccination and supporters of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. Earlierwe brought you the latest coronavirus figures for Great Britain- as there was a delay with the Northern Ireland data. That is now in and the updated figures for the whole UK show 2,460 new cases of coronavirus reported in the past 24 hours. There have also been a total of 32 deaths of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. It is the highest daily figure since 29 July,according to the government data,external.  If you're in the UK, here is a round-up of useful information on the spread of Covid-19: Travellers to Sydney, Australia are kept in isolation for a period to curb the spread of the coronavirus Police in Sydney, Australia have accused a man of falsely claiming his grandfather was terminally ill as an excuse to leave quarantine early. The 30-year-old man from neighbouring Victoria state was asked to quarantine at a hotel after arriving at Sydney Airport on Friday without an exemption. But the following morning, the man was released after he provided what he claimed to be a valid exemption document, saying he was in New South Wales to visit his terminally ill grandfather in hospital. Police later determined the document to be false, and discovered the manâs grandfather was not in hospital. The man was arrested on Saturday and charged with failure to comply with coronavirus regulations, and producing false documentation,police said,external. He was given bail and returned to hotel quarantine, with a court appearance due on 12 October 2020. Coronavirus restrictions have been eased in parts of northern England allowing more businesses to reopen - except in Bolton where there has been a rise in cases. Soft-play centres, bowling alleys, gyms and casinos are able to open again in parts of Lancashire, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire which had had restrictions reimposed. Beauty salons can also begin close-contact treatments such as facials. The move brings these areas back in line with the rest of England. One owner of a gym in Blackburn, Lancashire, described his ""unbelievable relief"" and ""excitement"" at being allowed to reopen after six months. ""I am finally back doing what I do best,"" said Nick Talbot, owner of The FitMill. He said he feared he would lose his gym if it did not reopen soon. Read more here. The Moria camp in Lesbos recorded its first case of coronavirus last week Three migrant facilities in Greece have entered quarantine amid concerns over the spread of Covid-19 among thousands of asylum seekers living in dire conditions. Restrictions will be placed on the camps of Malakassa, Schisto and Eleonas until 21 September, the Greek government said. Greece's migrant camps have technically been under lockdown since March, with restrictions on who can leave and enter. This has prompted criticism from aid groups, who have warned that an outbreak of the virus at these camps, where sanitation is poor and accommodation overcrowded, could easily spread. One of the largest camps, Moria, which hosts almost 13,000 asylum seekers on the island of Lesbos, recorded its first case of coronavirus last week. Up to now, Greece has recorded few coronavirus infections and deaths relative to its European neighbours. Of the 289 deaths confirmed in total, none of them have been at migrant camps. These up-to-date charts show that while confirmed cases in the UK are rising sharply...  ...the number of Covid hospital admissions remains low: The number of people dying with Covid-19 also remains relatively low: French Prime Minister Jean Castex said he would self-isolate until he received his test result French Prime Minister Jean Castex has tested negative for Covid-19,the BFM TV channel has reported, citing his office,external. Earlier, we reported that Castex was to be tested as a precaution, after he shared a car with the director of the Tour de France, Christian Prudhomme, who has contracted the virus. Prudhomme was confirmed positive on Tuesday. He and Castex had travelled in a car together along the route of the cycling race on Saturday. The prime ministerâs office said they were both âwearing masks and respecting social distancingâ. The posters put up in Skin Kerr salon in Bootle have since been taken down A beauty salon that said Covid-19 did not exist will be visited by police. Skin Kerr salon in Bootle put posters in its window and posted online stating masks weren't being worn by staff as ""You can't catch what doesn't exist."" Merseyside Police said officers would visit the salon to ""remind"" the owner and staff of their responsibilities around Covid-19. Sefton Council said its environmental health team would also visit and the owners are due to meet the council on Wednesday. The BBC has been unable to contact Skin Kerr for a response.Read our full story here. Canada's top doctor is urging caution after coronavirus cases spiked 25% in one week across the country. Chief Public Health Officer Theres Tam warned that Canadians would need to be ""even more diligent"" in the autumn, as temperatures plummeted and people headed indoors. âThis is a concern and a reminder that we all need to maintain public health measures to keep Covid-19 on the slow-burn path that we need,âshe said on Monday.,external Cases rose to 545 over the past week, up from 435 and 390 in the two weeks prior. On Tuesday, after a long weekend, public health officials in Ontario noted there were375 new cases over the past two days,external,the biggest increase since 6 July.,external About 23 of the new cases have been linked to amulti-location wedding the prior weekend.,external People in Bolton have been reacting to the tighter restrictionsannounced in their area- which include the closure of pubs and a ban on socialising with people outside their households. Nasser Herez, 59, who runs Yummies Kebab & Curry House, said: ""I have seen lots of drunk young people, hugging with no social distancing. ""It is sad it has come to this...but if that's what we need to do, then that's what I'll do."" The manager of The Elephant & Castle, Steve Coyle, said: ""We are disappointed but not surprised. ""We are not going to operate as a takeaway so we are just going to close - probably for a few weeks."" Readmore reaction from Bolton here. Kamala Harris has said she would not necessarily trust a vaccine approved by the Trump administration Democratic US vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris has said she would trust a coronavirus vaccine developed under US President Donald Trump, but only if health experts gave it their approval. Harris drew criticism from Republicans after saying she would not trust a vaccine approved by the Trump administration unless a ""credible"" source agreed it was safe. She and other Democrats have accused President Trump of pressuring health authorities to speed up vaccine development before Novemberâs presidential election. In response, President Trump has accused the Democrats of using ""anti-vaccine rhetoric"" for political ends. But today Harris struck a different tone in an interview with the WISN TV channel, saying: ""I would trust a vaccine if the public health professionals and the scientists told us that we can trust it."" As we reported earlier, nine companies developing vaccines against Covid-19 have pledged to ""uphold the integrity of the scientific process"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has warned the test-and-trace system is ""on the verge of collapse"". He said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had to take responsibility amid a rise in the number of coronavirus infections in the UK. Sir Keir told the BBC: ""Everybody is deeply concerned about the rise in the rate of infection. ""As we reopen the economy, as children go back to school, this was always going to be a risk, we understand that."" He said Mr Johnson should have used the summer to get a ""very effective"" test-and-trace system running. He added: ""What we're now seeing is stories over the past few days that is showing the testing regime is on the verge of collapse. ""Heartbreaking stories from people who need a test being told no tests are available. ""Or the website is crashing, or people are being told to go miles and miles for a test. Nobody can argue that that is good governance."" Sir Keir said he still supported the principles of the government's coronavirus restrictions. But he said that the government's messaging had been ""confused"". The parliament usually meets once a month in Strasbourg Next weekâs session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg has been cancelled over concerns about the spread of coronavirus in the French city. The parliament will hold the plenary session in the Belgian capital, Brussels, instead, EU Parliament President David Sassoli has announced. ""We are very saddened by this decision, but the transfer of the administrative operation of the European Parliament would mean all the staff would have to be quarantined on their return to Brussels,"" Sassoli said. The EU Parliament usually meets once a month for a plenary session in Strasbourg to vote on legislation and discuss political issues. The next session, scheduled for 14-17 September, was to be the first in the city since coronavirus containment measures were introduced in March. But MEPs have shown resistance to the notion of reconvening parliament in the city, which was recently designated a Covid-19 âred zoneâ. In a tweet,external, French MEP Christophe Grudler said the decision to relocate the session to Brussels went against the advice of French health authorities, describing it as âlamentableâ. The aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth has been delayed a second day after a Covid outbreak on board. The Royal Navy warship was due to leave Portsmouth for training exerciseson Monday. A MoD spokesman confirmed that âfewer than 10â members of the 1,000-strong crew had tested positive. They are in isolation on shore, while people who had been in contact with them are isolating on board. The ship is now due to leaveon Wednesday.,external The Royal Navy said the positive tests were detected during ""routine"" preparations Silvio Berlusconi has served as Italian prime minister in four governments Thereâs been an update on the condition of former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week. The doctor treating Berlusconi for a lung infection at San Raffaele hospital in Milan says his condition has shown a âfavourable evolutionâ. Berlusconiâs signs of recovery âare reassuringâ, said Alberto Zangrillo, head of the hospitalâs cardiovascular intensive-care unit. Berlusconi, 83, was admitted to hospital on Thursday. The media mogul's positive diagnosis came last week after a holiday at his luxury villa in Sardinia. His companion, Marta Fascina, and two of his children - daughter Barbara, 36, and son Luigi, 31 - have also contracted the virus. ONS figures earlier showed weekly deaths had dropped to their lowest level since mid-March - but that did not mean the virus is still a threat, according to England's Health Secretary, Matt Hancock. He told the Commons: ""We have seen a concerning rise in the number of positive cases, particularly among younger people, and these figures serve as a salutary reminder that this virus is still very much with us and remains a threat."" He said: ""Of course, there is a lag between people catching the disease and the statistics for new cases, and those who sadly die. ""The second thing is that this rise most recently has been largely, predominantly, not entirely, amongst young people who are much less likely to die. ""The danger is that they will pass it on to others and it will spread more broadly into the community.
""So, it is important to act on these cases even though, thankfully, currently the number who are dying is small."" He was speaking before Tuesday's daily coronavirus figures were released.

"File photo of an Indian Border Security Force guard near the India-China border China has accused Indian troops of illegally crossing a disputed Himalayan border and firing ""provocative"" warning shots at patrolling soldiers. China's military said its soldiers were ""forced to take countermeasures"", though it is not clear what they were. India rejected the allegations and accused Chinese troops of firing in the air during the face-off in the high-altitude Ladakh region. Relations between the countries have steadily deteriorated in recent months. India said the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had tried to approach a forward Indian position near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and ""fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate [our] own troops"". ""At no stage has the Indian army transgressed across the LAC or resorted to use of any aggressive means, including firing,"" the statement from India's military said. The allegations of firing, if true, would be the first time in 45 years that shots had been fired there. A 1996 agreement between both countries bars the use of guns and explosives from the Line of Actual Control, as the disputed border is known, although soldiers have clashed there before. According to Chinese state media outlet the Global Times, the Indian troops had ""illegally crossed the Line of Actual Control (LAC) into the Shenpao mountain region near the south bank of Pangong Tso Lake"", quoting senior colonel Zhang Shuili, a spokesperson of the PLA. India's move ""seriously violated related agreements reached by both sides, stirred up tensions in the region... and is very vile in nature"", said Mr Zhang. But India's statement added that the army was ""committed to maintaining peace"", adding that it was also ""determined to protect national integrity and sovereignty at all costs"". The incident reportedly took place near the Pangong lake The PLA spokesperson also called on the Indian side to ""immediately stop dangerous moves, withdraw personnel who crossed the LAC... and punish the personnel who fired the provocative shot"". The tense confrontation comes just one day after India's military alerted Chinese officials of reports that five Indian civilians had been kidnapped by Chinese troops from an area near the disputed border. India-China border dispute explained in 400 words China and India face off on the roof of the world Indian cabinet minister KIren Rijiju tweeted on Tuesday that the PLA had responded to India's message. ""They have confirmed that the missing youths from Arunachal Pradesh have been found by their side,"" he said, adding that arrangements were being made to hand them over to Indian authorities. Tensions rose in June when 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent skirmish with Chinese forces. Local media outlets said then that the soldiers had been ""beaten to death"". In August, India accused China of provoking military tensions at the border twice within one week. Both charges were denied by China, which said that the border standoff was ""entirely"" India's fault. The Line of Actual Control is poorly demarcated. The presence of rivers, lakes and snowcaps mean the line can shift. The soldiers on either side - representing two of the world's largest armies - come face to face at many points. India has accused China of sending thousands of troops into Ladakh's Galwan valley and says China occupies 38,000sq km (14,700sq miles) of its territory.

"This video can not be played Bill Birtles: ""It was a whirlwind week"" The last two reporters working in China for Australian media have flown home after a five-day diplomatic standoff. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Bill Birtles and the Australian Financial Review's Mike Smith landed in Sydney on Tuesday. Chinese authorities questioned both men before their departure. The ABC reported Birtles was ""not asked about his reporting or conduct in China"". Relations between Australia and China have deteriorated in recent years. There had been allegations of Chinese interference in Australian society in the past, but ties worsened after Canberra backed an international inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said on Mondaya record 17 foreign journalists were expelled from the country in the first half of 2020. Australian foreign minister Marise Payne said consular officials had assisted the pair in returning home. ""I also want to note that Australia is of course a strong supporter of media freedom, freedom of the press, and that it is disappointing that after many years, Australia will not have a media organisation present in China for some period of time,"" she added in a statement on Tuesday. The Australian Financial Review (AFR) reported that Chinese authorities had questioned the journalists about Cheng Lei, an Australian journalist for Chinese state media who has been detained since last month. In their first comments on the detention, the Chinese foreign ministry said she was being held on ""national security grounds"". Mr Birtles told the BBC that Australian diplomats advised him last Monday that he should leave China immediately. ""They'd received some sort of warning or advice, they never specified what,"" said the journalist. He was then booked on a flight due to leave Beijing last Thursday. But the situation escalated on Wednesday at midnight when six Chinese police officers and a translator visited his apartment as he held farewell drinks with friends. He said the police did not detain him, but informed him that he was involved in a ""national security investigation,"" and that he could not leave the country. They said they would call him the following afternoon to talk about the investigation. He contacted Australian consular officials the next morning, who collected him and took him to the Australian embassy, where he spent the next four days. Mike Smith and Bill Birtles departed from Shanghai on Monday ""There obviously is not a great deal of trust with China at the moment about how safe I would have been if initially, by myself, I went and did that meeting,"" said Mr Birtles. He was later interviewed by Chinese police in the presence of Australia's ambassador to China, Graham Fletcher. Mr Birtles said he was questioned aboutCheng Lei, an Australian journalist who worked for state broadcaster CGTN. She was detained in China last month on suspicion of ""criminal activity endangering China's national security"". ""I know her, but not particularly well, it didn't seem like I would be the most logical person to interrogate if you wanted evidence about her case,"" he said. Mr Birtles said he was also asked about sources he used to report Hong Kong's national security law, and on Australia's relations with China. ""There wasn't any real rigorous effort to extract any evidence or anything that could really be used in any case,"" he added. Mr Smith, who is based in Shanghai, also received a visit by police - prompting him to go to the Australian consulate there. He, too, was questioned over Ms Cheng, the AFR reported. The pair were both allowed to leave the country after their interviews by police. ""It's very disappointing to have to leave under those circumstances,"" Mr Birtles said in Sydney. ""It's a relief to be back in the country with genuine rule of law. But this was a whirlwind and it's not a particularly good experience."" The AFR's editors, Michael Stutchbury and Paul Bailey, said they were glad both journalists were safe. ""This incident targeting two journalists, who were going about their normal reporting duties, is both regrettable and disturbing and is not in the interests of a co-operative relationship between Australia and China,"" they said in a joint statement. By anyone's standards, what happened with these two journalists is a worrying development. Bill Birtles and Mike Smith were the last correspondents for Australian media working in China. Their evacuation means for the first time since the mid-1970s, there are no accredited Australian journalists in the country. China is not only Australia's key trading partner and the biggest customer for its coal and iron ore, but it's also one of its most important stories to cover. As tensions rise between Beijing and Canberra, the need for journalists on the ground in China becomes ever more crucial. The ABC's news director, Gaven Morris, said: ""The story of China, its relationship with Australia and its role in our region and in the world is one of great importance for all Australians and we want to continue having our people on the ground to cover it."" How reliant is Australia on China? But as both countries continue to exchange political and diplomatic jabs - and with China's broader crackdown on Western journalists - it's hard to see when Australian reporters will be allowed back. This development is not only a critical marker in the relationship between the two countries, it will no doubt affect Australian media coverage of this important story. The countries rely heavily on each other for trade, but their relationship has soured in recent years, amid allegations of Chinese interference in Australian society. Ties have deteriorated further this year after Canberra backed an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus. In actions widely viewed as retaliatory, Beijing has since imposed restrictions on Australian exports such as beef, barley and wine. It has also warned Chinese tourists and students about racism in Australia. In July, Australia warned its citizens they may face ""arbitrary detention"" in China -a travel warning that remains in place,external. Canberra has also expressed concerns about human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, and urged China to release detained Australians such as Yang Hengjun, a democracy activist who has been held for 19 months without trial. Yang Hengjun: 'I will fight to the end' Why China's rise exposes Australian vulnerabilities The case of Ms Lei - made public last week - has been shrouded in secrecy. The Melbourne-raised presenter for Chinese state broadcaster CGTN is beingheld in a secret location for unknown reasons, according to Australian officials.

"File photo of an Indian Border Security Force guard near the India-China border China has accused Indian troops of illegally crossing a disputed Himalayan border and firing ""provocative"" warning shots at patrolling soldiers. China's military said its soldiers were ""forced to take countermeasures"", though it is not clear what they were. India rejected the allegations and accused Chinese troops of firing in the air during the face-off in the high-altitude Ladakh region. Relations between the countries have steadily deteriorated in recent months. India said the People's Liberation Army (PLA) had tried to approach a forward Indian position near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and ""fired a few rounds in the air in an attempt to intimidate [our] own troops"". ""At no stage has the Indian army transgressed across the LAC or resorted to use of any aggressive means, including firing,"" the statement from India's military said. The allegations of firing, if true, would be the first time in 45 years that shots had been fired there. A 1996 agreement between both countries bars the use of guns and explosives from the Line of Actual Control, as the disputed border is known, although soldiers have clashed there before.

"Maria Kolesnikova's whereabouts are unknown The EU has demanded the Belarus authorities release ""all detained on political grounds before and after"" the disputed presidential elections. It is planning sanctions for those responsible for ""violence, repression and falsification of election results"". Key opposition figure Maria Kolesnikova went missing on Monday after she was seen being bundled into a minibus. She was one of three women who joined forces to challenge incumbent Alexander Lukashenko in August's election. Mass protests followed his re-election amid allegations of vote-rigging. More than 600 people were arrested on Sunday, following a fourth consecutive weekend of anti-government protests in the capital Minsk and other cities. At least four people have died and hundreds have been injured as authorities have tried to crush dissent. What's happening in Belarus? 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change Mr Lukashenko - who has been in power since 1994 - has accused Western nations of interference. He is expected to visit his ally Russia ""in the coming days"", the Kremlin said on Monday. Ms Kolesnikova was seen by witnesses being seized by masked men on a street in Minsk on Monday morning and pushed into a minibus. She is a member of the Co-ordination Council set up by the opposition to ensure a transfer of power. A member of the council, Maxim Znak, said on Monday evening: ""We still don't know where Maria is and what is happening to her"". The council says its press secretary, Anton Rodnenkov, and its executive secretary, Ivan Kravtsov, have also disappeared. The interior ministry said it had no information about the council members being detained. Ms Kolesnikova was the last of the three women who joined forces against Mr Lukashenko to remain inside Belarus. Veronika Tsepkalo and presidential candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya left the country soon after the vote. Ms Tikhanovskaya said the latest detentions were an attempt to disrupt the work of the Co-ordination Council. ""The more they try to scare us, the more people will take to the streets,"" she said in a statement from Lithuania. Government authorities have launched a criminal case against opposition leaders, saying the ""creation and activity of the Co-ordination Council are aimed at seizure of state power, and at harming national security"". The council accuses Mr Lukashenko of ""openly using methods of terror"". Last week, Ms Kolesnikova announced she was forming a new political party The EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Josep Borrell, strongly condemned what he called the ""unabating arbitrary and unexplained arrests and detentions on political grounds"". ""It is clear that the State authorities in Belarus continue to intimidate or allow intimidation of its citizens in an increasingly lawless way and crudely violate both their own domestic laws and international obligations."" He called for the immediate release of opposition figures as well the 633 people who were detained during Sunday's protest. ""We expect the authorities to stop political persecution and engage in an inclusive national dialogue, in full respect of the Belarusian people's democratic and fundamental rights."" Earlier, the EU said it planned to impose economic sanctions on 31 senior Belarus officials - including the interior minister - by mid-September. The sanctions are expected to cover travel bans and asset freezes. Police began to make arrests in Minsk at the end of an unsanctioned rally as people were going home. Video footage shows men in plain clothes beating peaceful protesters with batons. This video can not be played Protesters took to the streets of Minsk and demonstrated outside the presidential palace on Sunday The interior ministry confirmed at least 633 arrests had been made across the country. Internal Affairs Minister Yuri Karayev defended the actions of the security forces, saying ""there are no more humane, restrained and cool-headed police anywhere in the world"". In recent days,the security forces have targeted university studentsas they returned from their holidays, dragging some from the streets and university buildings into unmarked minivans.

"The daily confirmed figures for coronavirus cases have shown a significant jump in the past two days. On Sunday they rose by nearly 3,000 and then on Monday by almost exactly the same again - the highest single day increases since May. It means the UK is now seeing four times as many cases on average as it was in mid July. And with the impact of the return of schools still to come - not to mention the re-opening of universities next month - fears are growing that cases and then deaths could start spiralling. The rise has been laid firmly at the door of young people. Around half of new cases in recent weeks have been diagnosed in people in their 20s and 30s. Significant numbers of cases have also been identified in people in their 40s and 50s, as well as teenagers. That compares to the early days when most of the confirmed cases were in the older age groups. But that was because the UK was largely only testing in hospitals. Younger adults are very unlikely to be sick enough to need hospital treatment, so they hardly showed up in the official figures. Cases are rising, what should I do to stop the spread? Remember the R number? Why is it so important? If you look at results from antibody testing, to see if they had been exposed to the virus, the younger age groups were just as likely as older groups - if not more - to have been exposed. So what is happening now appears to be simply a case of the virus re-establishing itself in a group that is the least at risk of serious complications, hence there are no signs of a significant increase in hospitalisations. Much has been made of the fact these are the groups going out socialising, although it is also noticeable that the highest rates are spread across much of the working age population - many of whom will have to leave their home to make a living. So does it matter? After all, the level of cases being seen - even taking into account there will still be some not being picked up - is well below where it was in the spring. At the peak at the end of March, there were an estimated 100,000 cases a day (the official figures only show a fraction of these because of the problem mentioned above - testing was more or less limited to hospitals). And the fact that cases are rising after hitting such a low mark over the summer should not come as a surprise. More people are being tested and that testing is being targeted at high infection rate areas for one thing. But that does not tell the whole story. With people mixing more, and summer over (respiratory viruses tend to do better because of colder weather and the fact people are indoors) cases were always going to go up, and are likely to continue to do so. If you could keep the infections in younger age groups, who are not at any significant risk of complications, there would in theory not be much of a problem. The difficulty, says Prof Devi Sridhar, a public health expert at Edinburgh University, is that as cases rise, this becomes harder to achieve. She believes we are already in a position where protecting vulnerable groups will become impossible. But she admits ministers are in a ""lose-lose"" situation. If they let the virus spread they will be held culpable for rising deaths, and if they re-introduce restrictions they will be criticised for over-reacting. The result is that the UK, like all nations, faces an almost impossible balancing act - accepting some level of deaths, while keeping society functioning. Prof Paul Hunter, an expert in health protection at the University of East Anglia, says it is not realistic to return to national lockdown, saying it would not be fair to ""handicap"" children any more by closing schools. ""This is a virus that is mainly risky to older, more vulnerable groups. We need to accept winter will be extremely difficult. ""It is about finding a tolerable solution. I don't think we will see the scale of deaths we saw in spring. ""But there are, sadly, going to be many this winter. It will be the worst winter for a long time."" The key in the coming months, Prof Hunter and others believe, will be keeping deaths as low as possible by protecting the most vulnerable - more than nine in 10 deaths have happened in the over 65s with half in the over 85s. There are a number of factors that will have an impact - and on many the UK is in a stronger position than it was six months ago. The discovery that two steroids - dexamethasone and hydrocortisone - can reduce deaths among the seriously ill will make a significant difference. And, as always, good hand hygiene and continued adherence to social distancing and isolating when you have symptoms will be important principles for everyone to follow. Big local outbreaks will also need to be contained as best as possible. This is where the test and trace system comes in. While huge progress has been made in recent months though, there are still issues to be resolved on both the availability of testing and ability to reach the close contacts of infected individuals. On top of that, the government and care industry will have to do a better job of protecting care homes. There is much better availability of PPE now than there was in the early days and although regular testing of staff and residents has been slow to roll out it is a world away from the situation earlier in the year when testing stopped once a home had five confirmed cases. It also seems likely the re-introduction of shielding for the most vulnerable groups will need to happen at some point. It is of course impossible to predict - and depends on many different factors. A leaked report obtained by BBC Newsnight suggested the government had been advised there could be 85,000 deaths under a ""reasonable worst-case scenario"". Of course, the worst-case scenario should be avoided. If we are to avoid returning to the scale of deaths seen in the spring - as Prof Hunter and others think is possible - that would mean limiting fatalities to under the 41,500 coronavirus deaths that have been seen during the pandemic. But during any winter, deaths always increase by many thousands. The worst one of recent memory was three years ago when an extra 15,000 more people died in England and Wales than had on average in the previous five winters. It was a cold winter, the strain of flu was a little more virulent than normal and the vaccine available was not particularly effective. This year in the fight against coronavirus there is no vaccine and very limited immunity. Keeping the death toll anywhere near zero is, sadly, going to be impossible.

"This video can not be played A resident and a shopkeeper share their thoughts on how new lockdown measures will affect them Caerphilly has gone into lockdown, becoming the first county in Wales to face tougher restrictions following a spike in Covid-19 cases. No-one is allowed to leave the countywithout good reason, with stricter measures brought in from 18:00 BST. Family and friends living apart are no longer able to meet indoors, stay overnight, or form extended households. A senior police officer said Gwent Police was not planning to introduce roadblocks or cordons during lockdown. Ch Supt Mark Hobrough said neighbourhood officers would talk to motorists and visit shops and businesses to ensure everyone was aware of the new rules, with enforcement the ""last objective"". ""We really do want the community to work with us in relation to this to be able to combat this infection and fight it off as soon as possible,"" he said. The health minister said the restrictions would last until at least October, with a review in a fortnight. Vaughan Gething said the case rate had risen to 72.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people - the highest rate in Wales and one of the highest in the UK. The county, which has a population of 181,000, has had 132 people test positive in the last week. Meanwhile, he said a UK-wide testing programme being used in Waleswas facing ""challenges"" in meeting demand. What does the lockdown mean for Caerphilly? What do the stats tell us in Wales? 'Horrific' queues in Caerphilly as people 'rush' for Covid tests Mr Gething said he had been forced to act due to the increase in cases, after ""social distancing had broken down in large parts"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that testing in Caerphilly found 4% of people were positive for coronavirus: ""If we had testing positivity rates of 4% [across Wales], I think we would be into national lockdown."" This video can not be played Mixed reaction as Caerphilly placed under lockdown Ahead of the latest figures, analysis by the BBC suggested Caerphilly had moved into the top 10 of hardest-hit local areas in the UK over the past week. It was ranked at about the same level as Birmingham, Burnley, Rochdale and Salford. Bolton was top (122 cases per 100,000), followed by Bradford, Blackburn and Oldham. Caerphilly has also seen one of the largest jumps in its case rate, compared to the previous week. It has had more new cases in the past week - 132 - than anywhere else in Wales and more than the area has seen since the end of April. Mr Gething said: ""If we don't address the issue in Caerphilly, we'll see wider community transmission within the Caerphilly area but that will spread to other areas as well. ""We're in this position largely because social distancing has broken down and in particular people are socialising in each other's households in larger numbers."" He said not addressing the problem now could have ""national consequences"" and appealed for people to follow the rules: ""It's for you, your family and the whole community."" The changes come into effect throughout the county borough at 18:00 BST on Tuesday Mr Gething said significant transmission ""isn't taking place in pubs"" but an element of it was people coming back from European travel, along with mixing with others in their homes, including house parties of up to 30 people. People with reasonable causes, like needing to move house, could still leave the borough, he said, ""but going from Caerphilly to Cardiff for a night out or to go to the gym isn't covered"". ""If things deteriorate faster we may have to take more measures,"" he added, saying he ""won't hesitate"" to make it mandatory to wear face-coverings across Wales if necessary. ""We're in it for several weeks at least in Caerphilly. We expect the rate to rise in the next few days because community transmission has already taken place."" The lockdown would be reviewed in two weeks, the Welsh Government said. Addressing the weekly coronavirus briefing at lunchtime, Mr Gething expressed fears coronavirus in younger people could ""leap into"" more vulnerable and older groups of people. ""Over the summer, we've seen an increase in the number of cases in people under 40 in Wales."" ""At the moment it appears coronavirus is likely to be a milder illness for most people in this age group,"" he added, saying there is usually a lag of a couple of weeks before people are admitted to hospital. Targeted testing had been carried out in Caerphilly and would be starting in the lower Rhondda valley where there was also a rise in cases, he said. Mr Gething outlined how 13 cases of the virus were connected to a single trip to Ibiza taken by a group of friends last month: ""Three of them came home with coronavirus. When they came home, one of the group passed the virus on to their partner and his father. ""Another person in the group had a party the day after coming home and four people caught coronavirus. ""One of these then passed the virus on to their brother who then passed it to a friend by sharing a car. Another party guest passed it on to their sister, who in turn infected a friend on a night out"". The local lockdown was announced on Monday, giving people less than 24 hours to prepare for the changes. Under the new restrictions,listed at the Welsh Government website,external: People cannot enter or leave Caerphilly county borough - which includes Caerphilly town, Ystrad Mynach, Blackwood, Newbridge and Risca - without a ""reasonable excuse"" Everyone over the age of 11 will need to wear a face covering in shops Friends and family are not allowed to meet indoors or stay overnight Extended households will not be able to meet up A reasonable excuse for travel includes for work, if you are not able to work from home, to go to school, or to give care.

The rules will be kept under review, the first on 10 September and then again in the following 21 days. The council and the police will have responsibility for enforcement, with fixed penalty notices of Â£60 for a first offence, doubling on each subsequent offence. Gwent Police chief constable Pam Kelly said officers would be out in the community encouraging people to follow social distancing and the new regulations coming into force. ""Today we will be working to understand the new guidance and regulations and what enforcement action we can take for the few who do not comply with the new restrictions,"" she added. People leaving a bus in Caerphilly While they may be just hours away from a return to lockdown shoppers in Caerphilly have not hesitated to get out and stock up ahead of tonight's deadline. The high street is busy, shops are open and town centre car parks are full as people continue to go about their business. There is a visible rise in the wearing of masks. Many shoppers are choosing to wear face coverings ahead of them being implemented in certain situations. The shift has not been lost on local residents like, Roger Williams made a last-minute trip to the bank ahead the rule changes. ""There's more people wearing masks here than there has been in a long, long time"" he says. ""I can see the difference here,"" he said. For shopkeepers like Joe Thomas the prospect of another downturn in business is a real threat to the town. ""I think the town will probably collapse unless the government give businesses more help again she says"". Sarah Bruton says people have been anxious about going out post-lockdown in her experience Sarah Bruton, manager of Captiva Spa, said the spike showed Covid-19 was going to be ""part of our lives for a very long time"". ""It's going to be really tough for a lot of people. We've started to make plans to see family, to book holidays, in my case to rebuild our business and that's going to be taken away again,"" she added. Michael Roberts stopped allowing customers inside his restaurant last week Michael Roberts, who runs Urban Bar BQ in Caerphilly town centre, closed his restaurant for indoor service on Thursday and is just offering takeaway. ""We're feeling that hopefully this is a step which will take us in the right direction towards getting over it,"" he said. More than 1,600 people have been tested in Caerphilly county in the past week Caerphilly Labour Member of the Senedd Hefin David said more than 600 people messaged him on Monday asking for clarity on what the lockdown meant for things like gyms, leisure centres and hairdressers and moving to halls of residence. ""I am just trying to answer as many people's questions as I can,"" he told BBC Wales, adding that students would be fine to go off to university as it was classed as moving out of the borough. ""The biggest questions are about childcare,"" he added. Community testing started in the county borough at the weekend. A total of 450 people were tested and 19 were found positive. People will not be able to enter or leave Caerphilly county without good reason One class of 21 pupils at St Gwladys Primary School in Bargoed must stay at homeafter a member of staff tested positive for the virus, although the school remains open. Caerphilly RFC has closed for two days for deep cleaning after a member who was at the club on Saturday tested positive. Elsewhere, the Eden Centre said it was closing its soft play centres in Caerphilly and Blackwood due to the rise in cases. Meanwhile, Great Western Railway has confirmed a member of staff in south Wales has tested positive for Covid-19, but has not specified where. Close contacts of the person are self-isolating, the company said. No train services have been affected as a result of the diagnosis. Giri Shankar, of Public Health Wales, appealed to everyone in the Caerphilly area to use a local testing unit at the town's leisure centre if they were experiencing ""even the mildest"" of symptoms or feeling ""generally unwell with no explanation"".

"Many bars are reporting reduced footfall since reopening Up to 12,500 jobs are at risk in Scotland's bars and pubs due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, according to an industry body. A survey by the Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA) found nearly nine in 10 of them were facing reduced revenue. The responses from 600 premises also found that 45% of owners did not expect to return to normal trading until a vaccine for the disease was found. One industry expert warned the sector was facing a ""battle for survival"". The survey, sponsored by KPMG, found revenues had dropped by more than half from the same period last year at 38% of premises. 90,000 jobs at risk from second lockdown Aberdeen coronavirus outbreak officially over New Covid rules in force for bars and restaurants How are pubs keeping customers safe? Some 85% reported a decline in footfall while 89% have experienced a drop in revenue. Social distancing regulations have also had an impact, with pubs and bars spending an average of Â£2,500 per outlet to comply with the rules. This has prompted fears that about a quarter of the 50,000 people employed in the sector could lose their jobs. Colin Wilkinson, managing director of the SLTA, said: ""The impact of Covid has been more severe for Scotland's pubs and bars than virtually any other sector. ""We now face the stark reality that up to 12,500 jobs could be lost as nearly 90% of premises report that their revenue is down versus last year, with 38% reporting revenue decreases of over 50%. ""Our own surveyreinforces a recent survey by the University of Edinburgh on behalf of the tourism industry, which shows the devastating impact on employment in pubs, bars and the wider hospitality sector."" He added: ""With many people working from home and local restrictions, one of Scotland's major employment sectors faces unparalleled difficulties and the current business climate is leading to a real threat of permanent business closures and job losses."" Alistair McAlinden, head of hospitality and leisure for KPMG in Scotland, said: ""It's incredibly concerning but not entirely surprising, to hear that so many licensed trade operators across Scotland are worried about large-scale job losses and possible business failures over the next 12 months. ""The industry is facing a battle for survival and there will inevitably be some casualties."" Bar owner Michael Bergson says another lockdown could put him out of business Michael Bergson, the owner of Bucks Bar in Glasgow, has spent 25 years working in hospitality - and has never seen so any businesses go to the wall. ""It's been like nothing we've ever faced before,"" he said. Getting back up and running was ""manic"". ""Staff were scared, customers were scared, getting all our safety measures in place - but I think confidence started to come back so people feel safe to go to bars and restaurants again,"" he said. ""Eat Out to Help out was massive for us. It was a much-need boost but now that's over we've got many challenges ahead. ""It meant we were able to turn a profit during the week, which is crucial because you need that to cover your costs now."" The recovery is a fragile one. As well as facing the extra costs of PPE, there is reduced capacity because of physical separation rules and more staff are needed to carry out extra duties such as cleaning. Mr Bergson would like to see politicians doing more to restore confidence, convincing customers that it is safe to return to bars and restaurants. ""If you don't give people a controlled environment to socialise in then I'm afraid to say they will find other ways, especially young people,"" he said. He'd also like to see a relaxation of the rules on ambient music - designed to stop people leaning in to be heard - because he believes they are counter productive. ""What we're finding is that when you've got no music in a bar or restaurant, people feel self-conscious of who's next to them and it causes them to lean in.""

"This video can not be played Keen cyclists Meredith and Elly, who was training for a marathon, say they're still suffering from Covid-19 symptoms months after getting it Greater NHS support is needed for people chronically ill for months with Covid-19 symptoms, experts have toldBBC Radio 4's File on 4. The Royal College of GPs is calling for a national network of ""post-Covid"" clinics to help such people. But less than 12% of 86 NHS care commissioning groups asked by the BBC said they were running such services. NHS England said it was ""rapidly expanding new and strengthened rehab centres"". Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London and leader of the Covid Symptom Study app, said around 300,000 people in the UK have reported symptoms lasting for more than a month - so called ""long Covid"". He added that data from the app showed around 60,000 people have been ill for more than three months. However, many of these people may not have been tested for Covid. The government moved away from community testing on 12 March, instead only testing those admitted to hospital. That meant people who recovered from suspected coronavirus at home were unable to access tests. How long will it take me to recover? Elly MacDonald, 37, from Surbiton, was training for the London Marathon when she first developed what she believes were Covid symptoms on 21 March. More than five months on, she still suffers from breathlessness and extreme fatigue, but has not received a positive test result - because community testing was re-introduced too late for it to detect her illness. She changed her GP practice after initially feeling she was not being helped, Elly said: ""Just knowing that I actually have people who are taking me seriously - that's been very important for my recovery. I just want my life back."" Your Covid Recovery has been set up to support anyone who has had Covid - including those who recovered at home Paul Garner, a professor at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, has had long Covid since 19 March, and feels some patients are not being believed by healthcare professionals. ""I think the proof is in the symptoms and the stage that we're at in the epidemic,"" he said. ""We need sensible guidelines that really help people. The government is simply not doing enough with the existing medical expertise. It needs to be commandeered and brought together to work together."" File on 4 asked all 212 Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and health boards across the UK whether they had set up post-Covid clinics for patients who were not admitted to hospital with the virus - but did not necessarily receive a positive test result. Of the 86 that responded, 10 said they were already running such facilities. A further 16 said they were planning or redesigning services. Many patients will be seen by their GP, or existing services. Elly MacDonald (L), a keen rower and rock climber, has had long Covid since March 21 Martin Marshall, GP and chair of the Royal College of GPs, said: ""Without doubt, we know that there's going to be a growing number of people who have significant and worrying symptoms of long Covid. ""A small proportion, but in total a large number, will require specialist advice. ""So we really do need to see a growing number of post-Covid clinics being established."" NHS England's newYour Covid Recovery,externalwebsite offers personalised support for all patients recovering from Covid. Lynne Turner Stokes, professor of rehabilitation medicine at King's College London, said it had some ""good resources"" but that ""we have to do much more"". She said: ""For people who have never been to hospital, nobody's looked properly at their lungs, their hearts and so on. ""It will be very useful if we had more one stop (face to face) services."" The UK government and NHS England say there will be new and strengthened rehab centres and community services in every part of the country. In Wales, community and specialist rehabilitation programmes are likely to be the forum for offering Covid care.

"This video can not be played An air ambulance was called to the scene A 15-year-old boy is in a critical condition after he was shot on the way to school. Officers were called just after 08:40 BST to the Grange Farm estate in Kesgrave, Suffolk, where a person was later seen receiving medical treatment. Kesgrave High School said it had been told the incident involved one of its Year 11 students. The victim, who was shot once, was flown to hospital. Suffolk Police have arrested a boy, 15, in connection with the shooting. The suspect, who is said to be from the Woodbridge area, was arrested by armed police on suspicion of attempted murder. Updates as pupil shot on way to school This video can not be played Police cordons remain in place around the Grange Farm estate An Essex and Herts Air Ambulance landed on an area of grass and took off just before 10:00. Police said they were treating the shooting ""as an isolated incident"" and do ""not believe there is any wider threat to the local community"". The Suffolk force said it was thought a single shot was fired in the incident. Assistant Chief Constable Rob Jones said: ""Following this serious incident our priority is to keep everyone safe."" ""There will be more police officers on patrol and to provide reassurance in the area and I would ask for anyone with information about this incident to come forward,"" he added. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the House of Commons: ""I think we're all shocked and saddened to learn about the incident in which a young person was seriously hurt on their way to school in Suffolk today. ""Our thoughts are very much with the young person, their family and the whole school community at this very difficult time."" Eyewitness Andy Watts told the BBC he was out walking his dog when he heard ""a gunshot and then I heard a great big scream"". ""It sounded like scaffolding falling down originally because it was a big, big crash,"" he said. ""I saw them working on the young lad over on the green; he was over there for quite a while while they were attending to him, a lot of ambulance staff and paramedics working on him."" Phil Bennett, 38, said his father lived near the scene in Kesgrave and heard a gunshot. Mr Bennett said he drove to check on his parents at their home in Lyon Close after seeing vague details of the incident on Facebook and becoming concerned. ""My dad heard a gunshot,"" he said. ""He's a retired paramedic - he's heard a lot of gunshots in his time, so he stayed indoors. ""The next thing he knew there were police piling in, then it's a scene of crime. ""It's hard to believe this has happened 100 metres from my mum's front door, that someone's been shot. It's terrible what's going on."" Kate Scotter, BBC News Kesgrave is a small town on the edge of Ipswich that has grown rapidly over the past 20 years. It has two primary schools and a high school and is packed with families. I've been to the scene of the shooting, in the heart of the town's Grange Farm estate, and the sense of shock about what's happened is palpable. This is a tight-knit community where many people know and look out for each other. The police have reassured people that this is an ""isolated incident"" but the feeling of concern remains. Kesgrave High, which said the pupil was on his way to school at the time of the incident, said in a statement: ""Students in school are safe and we are managing the situation in constant, close communication with the police."" It is understood Monday was the first day back at school for its Year 11 pupils following the coronavirus lockdown and the summer holiday.

"A ""sharp rise"" in coronavirus cases in recent days in the UK is ""concerning"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. He told MPs that the increase had been across the whole country rather than in localised ""hotspots"", but there was ""no inevitability"" of a second spike. The government's scientific advisers have given stark warnings, after 2,948 new UK cases wererecorded on Monday.,external Downing Street said it would not rule out reducing the number of people who could meet in groups in England. Asked whether the government was considering a change in guidance, the prime minister's official spokesman said the regulations were being kept under review. The guidance in England currently says two households can meet indoors. Outdoors up to six people from different households can meet - or up to 30 people from two households. Analysis: New figures show we face 'impossible balancing act' What should I do to stay safe and stop the spread? Remember the R number? Why is it so important? Ministers have singled out young people in particular for not following social-distancing rules. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said Covid-19 rates are now rising, especially amongst people aged between the ages of 17 and 29. He warned that if people stopped social distancing then ""Covid comes back"". But another expert cited the government's ""confused messaging"" and said it was unfair to blame the young. On Sunday 2,988 new cases were announced - the highest figure since 22 May. At the peak of the virus in spring official figures showed there were 6,000 cases a day, although testing was largely only taking place in hospitals. Estimates suggest there were around 100,000 cases a day at that point. Mr Hancock told MPs on the Commons Health Select Committee it was ""so important that people take their responsibilities seriously, and people don't become relaxed about this virus"". He said the government's strategy was clear, with the first line of defence being social distancing, followed by testing and tracing, and then local action. He added: ""I have taken quite robust action in areas where there are local spikes. I don't like doing that but I don't resile from doing it because it is necessary."" He also told the committee that the first ""credible"" cases of coronavirus reinfection were starting to be seen. ""Through genomic analysis you can see it is a different disease to the one the person got the first time around,"" he said. ""But in all the cases that I have seen it has been an asymptomatic second infection that has been picked up through asymptomatic testing."" On Monday Mr Hancock warnedthe UK could see a second spike in coronavirus casesif young people did not follow the rules. His comments were echoed by Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, who said there was a particular responsibility on younger people to follow government guidelines on Covid-19, so that infection rates would not spike again. ""We have to keep hammering the message home. Of course the people in those age categories are unlikely to become extremely unwell as a result of having the virus. ""But they are able to pass it on to others,"" he said. ""There's a responsibility on younger people to not just stay at home, obviously to go out and go to work and to enjoy pubs and restaurants, but to do so in accordance with the guidelines."" Mr Jenrick also said the UK was entering a ""period of particular concern"" with the number of coronavirus cases rising, adding ""we all have to be very cautious"". However, Prof Susan Michie, a behavioural expert on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), was critical of the government's ""confused messaging"" over the coronavirus restrictions. She told the BBC News Channel that the constant changing of the guidance and variations between nations had left young people ""very confused about what it is they are and aren't meant to be doing"". She said ministers had almost signalled ""go out and about as usual"" to young people by lifting restrictions and added it was unfair to then say ""actually you are the problem"" rather than take any responsibility as a government for the messaging. Another Sage member, Prof Andrew Hayward, told Radio 4's Today programme he was worried that the rise in virus cases over the last few days might ""get out of hand"" if control measures were not taken seriously. He added: ""Generally it is local outbreaks, but there is also very worrying increases in cases, particularly over the last few days."" On Monday, his Sage colleague Prof Van Tam described the latest change in coronavirus infections across the UKas a ""great concern"",adding: ""People have relaxed too much. Now is the time for us to re-engage, and to realise that this a continuing threat to us."" England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty reiterated concerns raised by his deputy Prof Van-Tam about a rise in cases. Hetweeted:,external""We have, through the extraordinary efforts of the whole population, got Covid rates right down. They are now rising again especially in those aged 17 to 29. ""If we stop social distancing Covid comes back."" Meanwhile, official weekly figures show the number of deaths linked to coronavirus have fallen to their lowest level since mid-March. A total of 101 deaths were registered during the week ending 28 August, according to the Office for National Statistics. The Sage scientists' warnings come as more parts of the UK face tougher restrictions following a rise in the number of cases. In Wales,the county borough of Caerphilly is to be placed under a local lockdownfrom 18:00 BST on Tuesday, lasting until at least October. Welsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething blamed a breakdown in social distancing, especially among  extended households.

"HMRC is now reviewing 27,000 ""high risk"" cases where abuse or fraud is suspected Up to Â£3.5bn in Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme payments may have been claimed fraudulently or paid out in error, the government has said. HM Revenue and Customs told MPs on the Public Accounts Committee it estimates that 5-10% of furlough cash has been wrongly awarded. Latest data shows the programme has cost the government Â£35.4bn so far. The scheme has paid 80% of the wages of workers placed on leave since March, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 a month. Speaking to MPs on Monday, HMRC's permanent secretary, Jim Harra, said: ""We have made an assumption for the purposes of our planning that the error and fraud rate in this scheme could be between 5% and 10%. ""That will range from deliberate fraud through to error."" The Public Accounts Committee estimates that a total of Â£30bn in tax was lost in 2019 due to taxpayer error and fraud. Both HM Treasury and HMRC were ordered to appear in front of MPs to explain how they were intending to reduce the problem. What's the latest with the furlough scheme? Coronavirus: Taxpayers to lose billions to virus fraud - report Furlough wind down: 'We prepared for the worst' ""What we have said in our risk assessment is we are not going to set out to try to find employers who have made legitimate mistakes in compiling their claims, because this is obviously something new that everybody had to get to grips with in a very difficult time,"" said Mr Harra. ""Although we will expect employers to check their claims and repay any excess amount, what we will be focusing on is tackling abuse and fraud."" So far, 8,000 calls have been received to HMRC's fraud telephone hotline. HMRC is now looking into 27,000 ""high risk"" cases where they believe a serious error has been made in the amount an employer has claimed, he added. Mr Harra advised that any employee who feels that their employer may have been fraudulently claiming furlough money can report it to HMRCby filling in a form on its website,external. ""While we can't get involved in any relationship between the employee and employer, we can certainly reclaim any grant that the employer is not entitled to, which includes grants they have not passed on in wages to their employees."" This is the first time that HMRC has spoken publicly about potential fraud affecting the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Swetha Ramachandran, investment manager at GAM Investments, told the BBC: ""The speed with which they wanted to expedite this programme in order to ensure that this was available to employers, to minimise the damage that could have been caused, means there was always a likelihood that this was going to happen. ""So I don't think it's that surprising."" She said other government programmes, such as the Bounce Back Loans scheme or the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans scheme, might suffer from similar problems. ""That won't probably emerge for a few months,"" she added. HMRC's Jim Harra: ""We will be focusing on is tackling abuse and fraud."" In July, centre-right think tank Policy Exchangewarned that fraud and error could cost the government between Â£1.3bn and Â£7.9bn. The think tank said the government's financial rescue scheme were vulnerable to scams because of the size of the packages and the speed at which measures were rushed through to save people and businesses from economic ruin. The calculation is based on expected fraud rates for government expenditure from the Cabinet Office and the Department for Work and Pensions. The report said the true value lost to fraud may be closer to the higher end of the estimate ""due to the higher than usual levels of fraud that accompany disaster management"". It said: ""This is a serious squandering of public finances and properly resourced post event assurance will be required to reassure the public that every possible step has been taken to reduce this level of fraud."" At the time, a government spokesman said it was committed to ""extensive post payment reviews of stimulus and support payments, to find fraud and recover money for the taxpayer"".

"This video can not be played Rhys Thomas says he is speaking out to try to educate others ""How could I be an alcoholic? I'm not that guy with the brown paper bag."" For athletes like retired Wales international Rhys Thomas and former boxing champion Russell Pearce, addiction at one time seemed incompatible with professional sport. Both drank heavily during their careers before seeking help for alcoholism in retirement. They want to raise awareness and educate others, inside and outside sport, to prevent more people suffering. ""I just feel a duty to be honest,"" said Thomas, who retired in 2012 following a heart attack while training with the Scarlets. After a quadruple bypass operation he was put on a transplant waiting list, fitted with a pump to help reduce hispulmonary hypertension,externaland forced to limit all fluids to two and a half litres, or less than four and a half pints a day. ""Things got pretty drastic and in my state, you know, where I'm on a heart transplant list and I'm drinking to those levels with a wire coming out of my stomach, which if it gets pulled would almost certainly kill me,"" the 38-year-old added. Sporty people likely to drink more alcohol, survey finds 'I became alcoholic during lockdown' Acclaimed scientist gets brain surgery for alcohol addiction The prop forward, from Newport, said he struggled to cope with the loss of his sport, career and health. ""I'd wake up in the morning and have like a little 200ml glass of water... and then go out for the day and have no mixers because I had to have it straight because there was extra fluid... and to me at the time, it seemed completely acceptable, but I mean, this was insanity"". The Johannesburg-born father-of-four said he would have ""panic attacks, where I thought I was having another heart attack, but all self-induced - like this did not have to happen"". Rhys Thomas surges forward for the Scarlets in a Pro 12 match with Aironi Rugby in 2011 Thomas, who has been sober for a year, said he was speaking out now to try to educate others about the disease. He said he had had an ""amazing"" rugby career and incredible amounts of fun but had he been better educated and informed about mental health and addiction the outcome may have been different. He added there had been an improvement in sport, with support put in place, but he wants to share his story in the hope of helping others. Russell Pearce thinks there is extra pressure in high-level sport For former boxing champion Russell Pearce, rock bottom came after an arrest. ""I was on my own in that cell thinking about the highs of my career, standing on the podium listening to the national anthem, to sitting in that cell for stealing alcohol - it's quite a big come down."" When Pearce turned professional at 18 he soon learnt he got paid the same money whether he won or lost and fighting soon became a means to help him drink. ""That's when things started to slide - the realisation that I could turn up, not really try, get paid and then go out with my friends again"". The 33-year-old's career soon slipped away and he found himself in a small flat in his hometown of Welshpool, Powys, drinking bottles of vodka every day. ""When the money did dry up I ended up going to my local shop, stealing alcohol just to fund my habit, I got caught and consequently I was arrested"". While in a prison cell, he was visited by someone from the drugs and alcohol charity Kaleidoscope who helped him turn his life around. The retired boxer is now a support worker for the charity, and will be three years sober next month. Pearce added he feels there is extra pressure in high-level sport which may prevent some athletes from seeking help if they know where to get it. ""There's not enough awareness around addiction. If someone had asked me when I was boxing, who do you turn to if you think you've got a drink problem, or any addiction, I wouldn't have had a clue"". A study co-written by researchers at Swansea University in 2017 suggested the prevalence of substance abuse in sport posed a heightened risk of addiction for people who are already vulnerable. It found the competitive culture and demands of sport, as well as the end of a sporting career, can create an environment where abuse and addiction develops. Wales' minimum alcohol price 'won't tackle middle class drinkers' Former Wales forward reveals alcohol battle Sian Edwards, involved in postgraduate research into addiction in sport, believes there is still a lot of stigma and shame which can make it difficult for people to talk about. The Cardiff Metropolitan University PhD student said most people did not understand addiction. ""One of the difficulties in addiction is that we try and have this single picture of what addiction looks like and actually, there isn't really a typical picture of addiction. It affects all people from all walks of life in lots of different ways - there are lots of different types of addictive behaviour"" She added sport and alcohol often went hand in hand but it could often mask the warning signs of addiction. ""It can sometimes be difficult to see how someone can be addicted if at the same time they can go out onto the rugby pitch or into the boxing ring, or whatever sport it might be and go and perform in a way that most people could never do"".
