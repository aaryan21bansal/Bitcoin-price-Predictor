"Sir Richard Sutton and his family's wealth was valued at Â£301m in the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List One of the UK's richest men has been stabbed to death. Sir Richard Sutton, 83, was pronounced dead at a his mansion near Gillingham, Dorset, at 21:15 BST on Wednesday. A woman, in her 60s and believed to be his partner, was also stabbed and remains in a critical condition. The businessman and his family's wealth was valued at Â£301min the 2020 Sunday Times Rich List,external. A 34-year-old man, from Gillingham, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. He was stopped in a vehicle in the Hammersmith area of London and taken to hospital with injuries that were not believed to be life-threatening. Dorset Police said the arrested man and the victims were known to each other. Sir Richard, who was number 435 in last year's Sunday Times Rich List, owned a string of top hotels. The baronet had an extensive property and farming portfolio, including owning the freehold of the Sheraton Grand London Park Lane and the Athenaeum Hotel in Mayfair. Dorset Police said the victim and the arrested man were known to each other A statement from the businessman's company, Sir Richard Sutton Limited, said staff were ""deeply saddened and devastated by the sudden death"". ""Sir Richard was a caring, generous and warm family man, who genuinely regarded those who worked for him as part of his extended family,"" it said. It added he was ""passionately devoted to both his company and its people, setting the highest standards for quality in the hotel, farming and property interests within the group"". Describing him as an an ""incredible individual"", the firm said Sir Richard's loss ""will be felt by everyone within the company"". A cordon is in place at the property and police have appealed for information. A police cordon is still in place at the country estate in Gillingham North Dorset Conservative MP Simon Hoare, who was a friend of Sir Richard, said he had received a briefing from Dorset Police and described the death as ""deeply awful"". ""I knew him, strangely enough I knew him before I was an MP as my company did a lot of work for his estate many years ago,"" he said. ""He was a charming man, he had a very good sense of humour, he was politically astute and genial. ""If you wanted to conjure up a picture of a country gentleman then that was him. ""It is a huge loss for his family in what is clearly deeply awful circumstances."" The MP added the incident was rare for his constituency and there was ""no cause or reason for alarm"" based on the police briefing. Flowers were laid at a police cordon Dorset Police said it received a report at 19:30 on Wednesday raising concerns about the welfare of the occupants of an address in Higher Langham. Det Insp Simon Huxter, of Dorset Police's Major Crime Investigation Team (MCIT), said the force is appealing for anyone to come forward who saw or heard anything suspicious. ""Our thoughts are with the family of the man who sadly died and the injured woman at this extremely difficult time and they are being supported by specially-trained officers,"" he said.

"Socially distanced fans returned in limited numbers to stadia in tier one and two areas in December in England The UK's leading sports bodies are backing the use of 'vaccine passports' and Covid testing as a ""credible"" means of allowing full capacities at venues. In a joint letter to the leaders of the major political parties, the group said it could ""see the benefit"" of a certification process ""in getting more fans safely back as quickly as possible"". ""We know that our stadia can only be fully filled with an assurance process,"" it added. ""This process must ensure that everyone can access stadia and must include arrangements that would verify a negative Covid test or an antibody test or vaccination certification."" However, the group also warned that ""the final approach must not be discriminatory, should protect privacy, and have clear exit criteria"". Signatories to the letter, which has been seen by the BBC, include the Football Association, the Premier League, the England and Wales Cricket Board, the Rugby Football Union, the All England Tennis Club at Wimbledon and the Silverstone motor-racing circuit. All of them are suffering an unprecedented financial crisis as a result of being forced to stage events behind closed doors for almost all of the past year. ""The alternative [to certification] is not freedom,"" Premier League executive director Bill Bush told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. ""The alternative is social distancing, tiny crowds, major restrictions on people's movement and ability to eat, drink, travel. Away fans banned, for example. ""So to end those restrictions of freedom, we believe that something like this is an acceptable burden to give fans the freedom to attend."" As part of the government's reopening roadmap, from 17 May in England larger outdoor sports venues will be allowed to operate at up to 25% capacity, with a maximum of 10,000 spectators. Restrictions will be eased further from 21 June, but with all adults not expected to be offered at least their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine until the end of July, full venues at major sports events are understood to be unlikely until late summer at the earliest. Wembley will only have a maximum of 50% capacity for the latter stages of the Euro 2020 matches in July. What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? Under current plans in Scotland, large-scale events could also resume from 17 May, thoughthe Euro 2020 matches at Hampden in Junethat could see 12,000 supporters attend are the first confirmation of fans returning to stadia in Scotland. The Welsh government hopes to put on a series of outdoor cultural and sporting pilot events in the summer, forbetween 200 and 1,000 people. Supporters will not be able to return to matches in Northern Irelanduntil phase fourof the Stormont executive's lockdown exit plan, with no date yet set and the next review due on 15 April. The extent to which all social distancing can end from 21 June to allow for larger crowds at sport, arts and hospitality venues is being examined by the Events Research Programme (ERP) at a number of forthcoming pilots, including a semi-final and the final of the FA Cup at Wembley. Passes that would show if a person had been vaccinated, had a recent negative test, or natural immunity are among a number of measures to be trialled. In their letter to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the leaders of the main opposition parties, the group of sports bodies - which also includes the English Football League, Lawn Tennis Association and the Rugby Football League - warn that the 25% cap on crowds ""will be insufficient to end sport's Covid financial crisis."" They appeal for ""certainty as soon as possible"" over the plans to lift social distancing after 21 June, ""so we can plan efficiently and effectively with many big sporting events scheduled for late June and onwards. ""There are many issues to be addressed including how [Covid certification] technology would work and its ease of use at major events, for both the attendees and the organisers,"" the group added. On Wednesday,EFL chief executive Trevor Birchsaid Covid passports ""had to be embraced because without Covid certification, we may not be able to get full fans back in stadiums, which will have a dramatic financial effect."" EFL clubs have suffered Â£250m of losses caused by more than a season with almost no fans at matches. However, the use of such measures in wider society has sparked opposition from politicians and civil liberties campaigners, and some figures in sport have also expressed their concern before a parliamentary vote on the issue. Former Wolves goalkeeper Carl Ikeme urged the FA not to use Covid passes, describing them as a ""form of discrimination"" against people from ethnic minorities. ""We know black and ethnic minorities are more hesitant to have vaccines,""Ikeme told the i newspaper.,external ""It will create a bigger divide. I don't believe communities who have their own personal choice not to have a vaccine should be discriminated against even further than they have been throughout the years. ""Having these Covid passes is either going to force people to have a jab they don't want or is going to force people not to take part in society the way we're all used to. Football players have been bending the knee all year against discrimination and this will affect ethnic communities even more."" The group of sports bodies supporting certification say that ""the final approach must not be discriminatory, should protect privacyâ¦ [and] should not be a requirement for any form of participation in grassroots sport. ""Based on these principles, we support the review of the use of Covid certification for major events,"" it added. A government spokesperson said: ""We welcome the constructive approach from major British sports as we explore how testing Covid certification and other steps can help get more fans back into stadiums and other large events safely. ""We want as many fans as possible to be able to enjoy a great British summer of sport, safely.""

"Islamic scholars and NHS leaders are urging Muslims not to let fasting over Ramadan stop them getting a Covid jab. During Ramadan many Muslims abstain from food and drink in daylight hours. Islamic teaching says Muslims should refrain ""from anything entering the body"" between sunrise and sunset. But Qari Asim, an imam in Leeds, said that because the vaccine goes into the muscle rather than the bloodstream and is not nutritious, it does not amount to breaking the fast. ""The majority of the Islamic scholars are of the view that taking the vaccine during Ramadan will not invalidate the fast,"" Mr Asim, who chairs the Mosques and Imams National Advisory Board, told the BBC. He said his message to the Muslim community was: ""If you are eligible for the vaccine and have received your invite, you need to ask yourself: do you take the vaccine which has proven to be effective or do you risk catching Covid, which can make you quite ill, and you may potentially miss the whole of Ramadan and possibly end up in hospital?"" Mosque becomes UK's first to offer Covid vaccine Mosque training sessions tackle vaccine fears Some NHS vaccine sites in Nottingham and Brighton are extending their opening hours so Muslims can come after they have broken their fast. But Dr Farzana Hussain, a senior GP from The Surgery Project in east London, said there was no need to avoid daylight hours. ""We know that a lot of Muslims are a bit concerned about having their Covid vaccination during Ramadan. Many people believe that having an injection actually breaks the fast,"" she said. ""But it doesn't at all because it's not considered nutrition."" She added: ""The Quran says saving your life is the most important thing: 'To save one life is to save the whole of humanity.' It's a responsibility of a practising Muslim to take their vaccine."" Some mosques are being used as vaccination centres in an effort to boost take up among minority communities. Polling from Ipsos Mori,externalsuggests a dramatic increase in ethnic minority Britons who say they have had, or are likely to have, the vaccine - from 77% in January to 92% in March. This video can not be played Birmingham mosque opens doors as vaccination centre Ramadan, which is expected to begin on Monday evening after the sighting of the Moon over Mecca, is traditionally marked by regular communal prayers in mosques and shared meals - or Iftars - to break the fast after sunset. Although communal worship is allowed across the UK, social distancing must be enforced and different households cannot mix indoors. The British Islamic Medical Association (BIMA) has issued guidance for mosques during Ramadan. They recommend keeping Taraweeh - the main evening prayers - short, increasing ventilation, and say imams should wear ""properly fitted double masks to protect congregants"". Dr Shehla Imtiaz-Umer urged people to get vaccinated to protect future Ramadans Dr Shehla Imtiaz-Umer, a GP in Derby and representative of the BIMA, told the BBC: ""We've seen a lot of devastation in our communities because of the Covid pandemic and we want to try and make sure that our future Ramadans are not affected to this extent. ""Unfortunately it's been affected last year and this year.

"David Cameron stepped down as PM after the Brexit referendum in 2016 The Treasury has released two text messages sent by Rishi Sunak to David Cameron amid an ongoing lobbying row. Mr Cameron sent messages to the chancellor's private phone last year to ask for help for finance firm Greensill Capital, where he worked as an adviser. The firm was run by Lex Greensill - a former unpaid adviser to the ex-PM during his time in No 10. The texts show Mr Sunak told Mr Cameron his request for access to government-backed loans was being examined. Mr Cameron's messages to Mr Sunak have not been released. In adocument,externaldetailing the messages, officials said Mr Cameron had sent the messages as a Greensill employee with an expectation that they would remain confidential. It also revealed that the former PM had contacted two other Treasury ministers - Jesse Norman and John Glen - about the company. A source close to Mr Sunak said Mr Cameron had messaged the chancellor ""multiple times"" on his personal phone. The source added Mr Sunak had chosen to publish the messages ""in order to reassure beyond doubt that there was no wrongdoing and that he acted with integrity and propriety"". But Labour's shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, said the messages ""raise very serious questions about whether the chancellor may have broken the ministerial code"", saying they suggested the firm ""got accelerated treatment and access to officials"" and Mr Sunak ""pushed officials to consider Greensill's requests"". David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? Ex-PM Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog After leaving office, Mr Cameron got a job as an adviser from his own former adviser, Mr Greensill. When advising Greensill Capital - which has now gone bust - the former prime minister texted Conservative ministers within the Treasury to appeal for access to emergency loans for Greensill Capital. But the requests were rejected by Treasury officials. Mr Cameron was investigated by a watchdog over whether he broke rules by not registering as a lobbyist for his work at Greensill -but he was cleared in March. However, critics have continued to question his access to ministers and the role Mr Greensill played in Downing Street when Mr Cameron was prime minister. Who has access to those in power, how is that access used - and how do those in power respond? These are the questions that matter at the heart of this, or any other political row about lobbying; the attempt to exert influence on politicians. Labour is demanding what it calls ""a full, transparent and thorough investigation"" into Greensill Capital's connections at Westminster. David Cameron was working for Greensill Capital, a firm run by Lex Greensill, who had previously worked in Downing Street... when Mr Cameron was prime minister. Former politicians have two marketable assets when they leave politics: 1.) They know how government works. 2.) And they know who works in government. Mr Cameron had served the two-year lobbying ban imposed on former ministers when they leave office before he worked for Greensill. And seeking to make your case to government - as an individual, charity, trade union, or business - is an integral part of politics in a democracy. But would someone who didn't happen to be a former prime minister be able to text the Chancellor, and get a reply? What is tricky in any story about lobbying is trying to prove whether the intervention of the lobbyist made any difference. While the rules on lobbying are more transparent than they were, plenty think they need to be much more so. In Mr Sunak's reply to a text from Mr Cameron on 3 April 2020, the chancellor said: ""Hi David, thanks for your message. I am stuck back to back on calls but will try you later this evening and if gets too late, first thing tomorrow. Best, Rishi."" In the second reply on 23 April, Mr Sunak said: ""Hi David, apologies for the delay. I think the proposals in the end did require a change to the Market Notice but I have pushed the team to explore an alternative with the Bank that might work. ""No guarantees, but the Bank are currently looking at it and Charles should be in touch. Best, Rishi."" The 23 April message relates to Greensill Capital's desire to be part of a government-backed Covid loan scheme. The ""Bank"" Mr Sunak refers to is understood to be the Bank of England, which was running the Corporate Covid Financing Facility - a scheme to help big firms through the crisis. And it is understood that ""Charles"" refers to Charles Roxburgh, the second most senior civil servant at the Treasury. The Treasury said the firm's requests were eventually rejected by officials. Lex Greensill has yet to comment on the row Ms Dodds added: ""The Chancellor's decision to open the door to Greensill Capital has put public money at risk. ""There must be a full, transparent and thorough investigation into the chain of events that saw Greensill awarded lucrative contracts, the freedom of Whitehall and the right to lend millions of pounds of government-backed Covid loans."" The SNP's Stewart Hosie accused the government of ""stumbling from one scandal to the next"", adding: ""Tory ministers and former prime ministers casually texting each other over government access utterly reeks."" He called on Mr Sunak to ""come before Parliament and set the record straight"". Mr Greensill, the Australian founder of Greensill Capital, has yet to comment on the row. Mr Cameron has also declined requests for a comment. Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"This video can not be played After being refused treatment because of her BMI, Victoria told the BBC her disorder got worse and worse Victoria Spence says she fell into a ""deep, dark hole"" about her own body image as a teenager, leading to her developing an eating disorder. From staring at pictures of ""girls with thigh gaps"" on social media to having her weight shared during a science class, she eventually hit rock bottom, telling her mum that she had begun to hate herself. But when Victoria's parents tried to seek help, her doctor told her that her Body Mass Index (BMI) wasn't low enough for treatment. ""I came away and just got worse and worse and worse, because I saw what the doctor said to me as 'you are not thin enough yet, there is still more to go, you should still lose weight',"" the 26-year-old from Manchester told the BBC. After seeking private treatment and her parents being warned she could die, Victoria is on the road to recovery and shares her story on Instagram with over 100,000 followers, offering support to others. She is now backing the findings of an inquiry by MPs calling for BMI to be scrapped. The report from the Women and Equalities Committee has also brandedthe government's obesity strategy""dangerous"", saying some of the measures - such as calorie labels on menus - could affect those with, or at risk of developing, eating disorders. The government says NHS England does not support the use of ""BMI thresholds"" and that its approach is ""guided by the latest research and emerging evidence"". Parents warned of 'sharp rise' in eating disorders Unhealthy food deals targeted to tackle obesity Calls for eating disorder help amid pandemic rise BMI is calculated by dividing an adult's weight by the square of their height. It gives a number that then fits on a scale, concluding whether someone is underweight, a healthy weight, overweight or obese. But while it is a simple tool, a number of scientists have questioned its validity as a measure of a person's health, saying other factors are not included and it is based on the physique of a European man. During its inquiry into body image, the committee looked into BMI and concluded it ""inspires weight stigma"". Its report said for those with higher BMIs, serious medical issues were being disregarded as simply the patient being ""overweight"" and patients were being made to feel ""shamed"" into losing weight. It also pointed to stories like Victoria's, saying some GPs had ""an over-reliance on BMI, particularly when diagnosing eating disorders"". Committee chair Caroline Nokes said the measure needed to be scrapped and replaced with a ""health at every size"" approach instead. The Tory MP added: ""We know BMI is an absolutely lousy measure of good health in an individual. It works as an average across populations, but for individuals, it really doesn't help at all. ""We have seen instances of people who have been refused treatments because their BMI is too high or they have been refused access to eating disorder services because their BMI isn't low enough - and what a dreadful target that is to set anyone with an eating disorder. ""We want young people to be enjoying their childhood, we want them to be healthy and active, not obsessing over numbers like BMI."" Tory MP and chair of the committee Caroline Nokes is calling for ""urgent action"" from the government The call was backed by eating disorder charity Beat, which said BMI ""should never be used as the sole factor in diagnosing eating disorders, or for determining who is 'unwell enough' to access treatment"". Its director of external affairs, Tom Quinn, said: ""This can lead to potentially dangerous delays, and can drive people deeper into eating disorders in order to be taken seriously."" A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said that NHS England ""had been clear it does not support the use of BMI thresholds"". Health Minister Nadine Dorries also acknowledged to the committee that there was ""good and bad"" in the use of BMI - although she said doctors needed to gauge whether a person is a healthy weight or not. The report also criticised the government's obesity strategy, saying it was ""at best ineffective and at worst perpetuating unhealthy behaviours"". Boris Johnson unveiled his plan in July 2020 amid the pandemic, saying it would ""reduce our health risks and protect ourselves against coronavirus"". It included banning ""buy one get one free"" deals on unhealthy food, as well as restrictions on where those foods can be promoted in-store, and new rules for displaying calories on menus. But the committee said there had been no reviews of the effectiveness of the current or previous obesity strategies before the plan was published, and called for an urgent review to examine the evidence behind the measures. Other conclusions of the report included: A warning against the National Child Measurement Programme - recording primary school children's weight - saying it would be ""likely to cause harm to children's mental health"" A call for the government to work with the Advertising Standards Agency to drive more companies to advertise ""with real images of people"" Another call to bring forward legislation to restrict or ban the use of altered images in advertising Ms Nokes said: ""The government must ensure its policies are not contributing to body image pressures."" Responding to the committee's report, a Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said the government's approach was ""guided by the latest research and emerging evidence"". She added: ""We know poor body image can be a factor in disordered eating for both men and women and we are committed to improving outcomes for those with eating disorders and related mental health issues - with record funding to expand dedicated services in the community."" But, she added: ""With over six in 10 adults overweight or living with obesity, it is important that we take action to help people live healthier lives.""

"Patients testing positively for Covid in hospital in 2024 was lower than the year before What can statistics tell us about coronavirus in Wales? Here we assess some of the figures showing the pandemic over its peak years and also give some of the remaining indicators as they stood in May 2024. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared in May 2023 that Covid-19 wasno longer a global health emergency, but said it did not mean the danger was over. In Wales, while some hospital and mortality data was still being published in autumn 2024, other surveillance measures had been scaled back or discontinued. There was a peak in people testing positive for Covid in hospitals in late January 2024 and numbers then settled into a pattern of rising and falling. Other indicators around waste water monitoring and people contacting their GPs last winter showed lower levels than the same period the year before. Mortality figures involving Covid in the eight months to the end of August 2024 were about 60% of the total we saw in the same period of 2023 - about 13 deaths a week compared with 22 deaths a week. Digital Health and Care Wales stopped its weekly Covid snapshot figures in the summer of 2023, although Public Health Wales (PHW) was still publishing some hospital and testing data in autumn 2024. Positive tests for Covid appear to follow a more cyclical pattern than flu or other winter viruses, which show a seasonal peak. Numbers of inpatients with Covid started to drop again by early February 2024 but followed a rising and falling pattern in the next few months. There were 192 in-patients testing positive for Covid, including 15 patients in critical care in the week ending 8 September. We might expect to see more elderly people in hospital and around half of those testing positive for Covid were over 80 and 89% were over 60. We no longer know how many of these patients are being treated primarily for Covid or happen to be incidentally testing positive while in hospital for other things. Is the Covid pandemic finally over in Wales? True Covid pandemic death toll is 15 million - WHO What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now? PHW was still publishing weekly data on patients who test positive for Covid in hospitals - and where they were likely to have acquired it. There were 91 positive tests for Covid in hospitals in the week ending 8 September. Figures showed ""probably"" or ""definitely"" hospital-acquired infections in patients made up 59% of those with Covid in beds, compared with those patients who came with Covid or the origin cannot be determined. Hospital-acquired infections stood at 54. There have been nearly 25,000 hospital-acquired infections recorded since the start of the pandemic. The issue of patients catching Covid while in hospital was a particularly acute feature during the early days of the pandemic, when there was no vaccine. The pattern of acute respiratory infections over the past two winters suggest seasonal peaks for flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). But Covid infections among those in hospital show more of an undulating pattern over the course of the year. The peaks were not as high in the winter of 2023-24 as they were in the previous winter. RSV had started to rise amongst mostly young children to very high intensity levels but dropped back. Flu cases in the community rose in early February but only to low intensity before falling back. Patients testing positive for flu in hospital fell from mid-February. Health officials kept a close eye on Covid over the winter period in 2023-24, in case it added to pressures on the NHS with more seasonal viruses. This winter, there was a realistic worst scenario of just under 1,200 Covid patients in late December and a ""most likely"" of 620 patients in the early modelling from Welsh government scientists. The actual figures in late December were close to the optimistic scenario - 380 patients - but moved closer to the worst-case scenario at the end of the first week of 2024. For about half the winter period, the actual number of patients testing positive for Covid was greater than the most likely scenario. By the end of March, it was below the most likely and optimistic scenarios. In winter 2022-23, the peak when it came in late December reached about 650 patients, three weeks after the modelled peak for a reasonable worst scenario of 1,800 patients. The actual curve for patients with Covid positive tests by the end of the modelling period in March 2023 was tracking with the ""most likely"" scenario after following a more undulating pattern, which had taken it closer to the ""optimistic"" scenario at one point. Another snapshot of how Covid and other viruses are present is sample tests from up to 1,500 patients attending hospital each week. These tests are for a range of respiratory viruses and showed around 13% testing positive for Covid at the winter peak in mid-January and 16% for flu when it peaked in early February. By the end of June, fewer than 2% were testing for flu but 18% were for Covid on these random tests - the highest proportion since the previous October. This is separate from testing for Covid or flu only or those showing symptoms. The rate at which GPs are consulted about Covid-19 is also another indicator, which peaked in the first week of January 2022 at 98 consultations per 100,000 and had fallen back to extremely low levels, around one or two per 100,000 in the first quarter of 2024. Another measure had been analysing samples of waste water, which was re-started for the winter of 2023/24. Early results showed samples indicating presence of Covid were not close to to the levels seen in the autumn and winter of 2022-23, reflecting indicators elsewhere. Surveillance involving testing for infection of blood donors was also stopped at the same time. Wales did not join a scaled-down relaunch of the long-running ONS swab survey, which had been discontinued in early 2023. The number of people who have died with Covid as a contributory factor had reached 12,902 in Wales by the end of August 2024. Deaths in 2023 ran at around half the number we saw in 2022. In the most recent week, up 30 August, 10 people in Wales had a death registered which involved Covid-19 and saw it mentioned on their death certificate, according to the ONS. Six of these deaths had Covid as the underlying cause of death. Up to 30 August 2024, there had been around 10,476 deaths due to Covid, with the virus the underlying cause of death. The first death in Wales from Covid occurred on 15 March 2020 in a 68-year-old Wrexham hospital patient The first wave peaked with 73 deaths on a single day in April 2020 Covid's second wave in the winter of 2020-21 brought 83 deaths on 11 January 2021 alone - the worst single day of the pandemic in Wales The pattern for deaths remained fairly low in 2022, although the summer heatwave brought a peak of 27 deaths between 18-19 July 2022 Winter 2022-23 brought a peak of 17 deaths on 10 January 2023, the most occurring in a single day for a year. The whole of 2023 brought just over 1,000 deaths with Covid a factor. Covid was the ninth leading cause of death in 2023 up to the end of July. There were an average of 15 deaths a week due to Covid in 2023, and this compared with an average of 100 a week during the main pandemic period in 2020. It had dropped again to nine deaths a week in the first eight months of 2024. ONS also now records so-called ""expected deaths"". This is a change from a previous ""excess deaths "" approach, which looked at an average for deaths from all causes across five non-pandemic years. This now adjusts for population changes and age trends and so it has revised down estimates we saw under the previous method. So between January 2020 and August 2024, there had been around 7,000 more deaths than we might have expected to see. During 2020, there were around 3,216 more deaths than expected - compared to around 3,500 when measured as ""excess deaths"". Why did so many people die in 2022? Over the eight months to late August 2024, deaths have been running below expected levels in all but 12 weeks. There were 508 deaths from all causes - 108 fewer than we might expect to see in week ending 30 August2024. Why did so many people die in 2022? Covid accounted for 1.3% of all deaths in Wales in the first eight months of 2024. Nearly a fifth (17%) of all Covid deaths registered have occurred in care homes. The first occurred in Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly in the last week of March 2020 and eventually totalled around 1,650 Covid deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic. There were 16 deaths involving Covid among care home residents registered between January and late August 2024. Care Inspectorate Wales reported that deaths peaked in May 2020 andbefore it stopped publishing data,externalit was notified of 2,339 care home resident deaths with suspected or confirmed Covid up to the end of June 2023. There were 726 deaths above the five-year average in care homes in Wales in April 2020, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic. There were also high numbers of excess deaths in the winter of 2020-21, when the vaccination programme was only just starting. Altogether, in the three-year period from January 2020 there were nearly 1,500 excess deaths in care homes in Wales. ONS analysis of deaths in care homes in 2021,externalfound mortality rates lower in Wales in male residents than in England or any English region. The sameoccurred in 2022.,external The two peaks for Covid deaths in care homes came in weeks in April 2020 (125 deaths) and January 2021 (129 deaths). Covid was the second leading cause of death in care home residents after dementia in 2021, accounting for 12.9% of male resident deaths and 11.1% of female resident deaths. In 2022, Covid dropped to being the fifth leading cause of death in care home residents in 2022, accounting for 4.5% of deaths. Meanwhile, up to the end of February 2022, 120 people working in health and social care in Wales had died, with Covid a factor. Of these, 62 were care workers and 58 worked for the health service. There were nearly twice as many deaths due to flu and pneumonia in Wales than due to Covid in 2023. There have been more Covid than flu deaths in only three weeks over the last year and four times as many flu deaths than Covid deaths in 2024 up to the start of May. Covid-19 was the 32nd leading cause of death in Wales in July 2023, after being the 19th leading cause in June. This was the lowest ranking as cause of death for two years and the third lowest since the pandemic began. It was behind accidental poisoning and appendicitis. Monthly mortality analysis - which was also discontinued at the end of July - showed there were 21 deaths due to Covid in July 2023 - 0.8% of all registered deaths. Looking at when Covid was a contributory factor, there were 29 deaths involving Covid in Wales - or 1.1% of all deaths registered in July. Heart disease was again the leading cause of death in July 2023 in Wales. Flu and pneumonia again ranked sixth but below normal levels. Covid was the leading cause of death at the height of the pandemic in 2020 and then the second leading cause of death in Wales after heart disease in 2021. It was the seventh leading cause of death in 2022, with a mortality rate of 38.5 deaths per 100,000. It was then the eighth leading cause of death for 2023 in Wales, with a mortality rate of 23.3 deaths per 100,000. Across England and Wales in the whole of 2023, deaths due to Covid were 2% of all cause deaths. This compared to 4.2% from flu and pneumonia Heart disease ranked as the leading cause of death for 2022 and in England and Wales it was dementia and Alzheimer's disease in 2023, closely followed by heart disease. The median age of a person to die due to Covid during the pandemic has been 82. Three children aged one to 14 have died where Covid has been a factor. A baby girl is so far the only child under one to have died where Covid was a factor, in the week ending 18 November 2022. In the first wave of the pandemic in 2020, 68% of Covid deaths in Wales were estimated to involve people who considered themselves to have some form of disability Around 73% of deaths involving Covid were in the over 75s and the median age of death due to Covid in June 2023 was 83. There has been one death in Wales, in October 2022, where Covid vaccination has been a factor, according to death registrations. It involved a person in their 50s. There were seven deaths involving Covid in the age group 15 to 44 in 2023. Analysis of mortality from the start of the pandemic until the end of July 2023 shows the age-standardised mortality rate for deaths involving Covid is slightly higher in Wales (102.2 deaths per 100,000), than England on 101.5 deaths per 100,000. Scotland (9.56) and Northern Ireland (93.2) are both lower in the 41 months to the end of July. The age-standardised mortality rate due to Covid - with Covid the underlying cause of death - is slightly higher in England than in Wales. It is also higher in all English regions apart from south west, south east and east England. When a crude mortality rate, not adjusting for the age or population profile, is used, deaths are higher in Wales. Covid was the underlying cause of death - not just a contributory factor - in 70% of Covid deaths mentioned by doctors on death certificate in Wales in 2023. It has been as high as 94% and on average since the outbreak of the pandemic until the end of August 2024, 82% of deaths with Covid on death certificates could be said to be due to Covid. So, there had been around 10,429 deaths due to Covid by 30 August 2024 in Wales. Covid has been ""suspected"" by doctors in around 4% of cases. A doctor's duties include certifying deaths, and this can include any cause in a chain of events leading up to them, including pre-existing conditions and whatever medically makes a contribution. Rhondda Cynon Taf (RCT) and Merthyr Tydfil had the highest crude mortality rates over the course of the pandemic in Wales. By 29 December 2023, RCT had reached a total of 1,235 deaths, with the highest crude mortality rate - 516.7 deaths per 100,000. This was the seventh highest crude mortality rate of all local authorities across England and Wales. Deaths involving Covid can also be shown to be hitting people living in deprived areas, usually associated with poorer health, harder than in the least deprived areas of Wales. When deaths from Covid as the underlying cause and adjusted for age are looked at, then Rhondda Cynon Taf, Blaenau Gwent and Merthyr had the highest mortality rates in 2020. Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate in 2021, including the peak of the pandemic's second wave. Conwy had a relatively higher mortality rate in the third year of the pandemic. Six of RCT's communities were in the highest 20 within Wales during the first and second waves, when the death rates can be broken down further. At a health board level, the age-standardised mortality rate for Cwm Taf Morgannwg, which covers RCT, Merthyr and Bridgend, was 127 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the three years of the pandemic up to the end of July 2023. This is the highest in Wales, the lowest being 55.5 deaths per 100,000 due to Covid in the Powys health board area, set against a Welsh average of 84.3. For 2023, Conwy, Bridgend and Powys had the highest Covid mortality rates in Wales, based on the sizes of their populations. The community with the highest number of Covid deaths across 2020 and 2021, including in the first two waves of the pandemic, was Tonyrefail West (RCT) with a total of 63 deaths due to Covid. In the period to include 2023, this rose to 75 deaths. Nearby Porth East and Ynys-hir had the highest mortality rate due to Covid, 2020 to 2023, with more than 741 deaths per 100,000. The lowest number of deaths at a community level during the main pandemic years were in Aberystwyth North and Aberystwyth South, Bangor City and Llandudno Junction South and Llansanffraid Glan Conwy. At a local authority level, in the second wave of the pandemic, Bridgend was the worst-hit area in Wales. In 2021, Bridgend had the highest Covid mortality rate - 271 deaths or 183.2 deaths per 100,000; this was the 24th highest area across England and Wales. The first wave of the pandemic brought early clusters of deaths in the old Gwent valleys, around Pontnewydd and Upper Cwmbran, Cross Keys and Ebbw Vale, followed by Tonyrefail East in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Blaenau Ffestiniog and Llanberis in Gwynedd also had early clusters in north Wales, according to data analysis. These were adjusted for age or deprivation and so other factors such as travel patterns or occupations may have come into play to explain the spread of infection. The highest rate by the end of March - a few days after lockdown - was around Caerphilly and the valleys to the north and was more than 11 times what would be expected compared with the whole of Wales. By mid-April, higher mortality rates had spread to Welsh border counties and expanded into Cardiff and Swansea and other valleys areas. By the end of the first wave, the only clusters of higher mortality were showing in parts of north Wales. ONS said there was higher mortality in more deprived areas of south east Wales,external, but consistently high mortality was also seen in some rural areas after accounting for known risk factors. There are figures to compare relative excess deaths in different European countries. Bulgaria has the highest relative cumulative age-standardised mortality rate - 18.2% higher than normal - and Norway the lowest, 4.1% below average. Wales was 3.7% above average in June 2021 and then 2.1% above average in July 2022 - ranked 21st out of 33 nations. For those aged under 65, Wales was 4.8% above average (ranked 12th) and 1.5% above average (joint 24th) in the over-65s. Wales also saw excess mortality in more than half of weeks over the period. Covid vaccinations passed the 10m mark as the spring 2024 booster programme progressed in April 2024. The autumn-winter booster programme reached more than 742,500 people in 2023-24. That included nearly three quarters of over 65s and 85% of care home residents. Numbers of NHS staff who took up offers of a vaccine booster was down on earlier stages of the programme. Just over half of all those eligible across different groups had taken up the offer, perhaps reflecting numbers who felt they had immunity from having had the virus more than once. The 2024 spring programme - targeting mainly the over 75s - reached 147,481 doses by early May. Analysis of vaccine uptake has consistently found gaps between people living in deprived areas and also people from black, Asian and mixed groups. Jab uptake slow among younger at risk people The offers of the primary course of vaccine to anyone over five, available since December 2020, ended in June 2023. The dominant variant in Wales has been Omicron for more than two years and 357 positive test results had been sequenced in the month ending 21 May 2024. Because of the ending of mass testing in April 2022, we should not expect to see the same numbers of results going off for sequencing any more. Nearly all of those analysed in the last month have been the JN.1 sub-variant. From summer 2020, the ONS organised a weekly nose and throat swab survey involving thousands of households across Wales, which latterly saw people being sent test kits by post. It became the most important tool to measure the level of infections, with the end of mass testing in March 2022. By this measure, infections were estimated to have peaked in Wales in April 2022 with 232,000 (around 8%) estimated to be affected. However, the survey was ""paused"" at the end of March 2023, asthe UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) worked to confirm a surveillance approach,externalwhich was ""proportionate and cost effective"" to living with Covid. The health minister expressed her ""deep disappointment and concern"" aboutthe ""loss of this important source of surveillance"".,externaland the break in data gathering at a time infections were still being recorded in Wales. But the Welsh government decided not to re-join a scaled-down version of the survey, which was relaunched in winter 2023, testing around 29,000 people. This suggested 2.7% of people in England and Scotland had Covid in the week ending 3 January 2024. Data from the infection survey, before it was wound up, also suggested 94.6% of adults in Wales have some protection from antibodies - through vaccination or immunity following infection. The estimate was 91% of 16 to 24-year-olds in Wales would have tested positive for antibodies in February 2023. At the higher threshold, 79.5% of adults in Wales are at or above 800 nanograms per millilitre and nearly three quarters in those aged 16 to 24 and 92.3% of the 75-79 age group. A test of blood donors in Wales found more than 80% prevalence of the N antibody, indicating a natural infection from having Covid, and a 99.9% prevalence of the S antibody from either infection or having had the Covid vaccine. The number of people who were reporting they had long Covid symptoms in Wales a year after being infected in early March 2023 was estimated to be around 57,000. This was just under 2% of the population who are estimated to still be suffering symptoms 12 months or more since having Covid. A total of 94,000 people were estimated to have long Covid at any duration. Of these, 24% said it had ""a lot"" of impact on their daily lives and 52% said it had little impact. An estimated 3.14% of people in Wales reported having long Covid - this was slightly less than in Scotland and the West Midlands and north west and north east of England. Just under 2% reported long Covid after a year - fewer than England and most of its regions and Scotland. Long Covid sufferers feel forgotten three years on Long Covid leaves girl, 10, struggling to walk 'My shame over long Covid 18-month work absence' Two thirds in Wales reporting long Covid said they had symptoms of weakness and tiredness and more than half a shortness of breath. Nearly half had muscle ache. This data set has now been curtailed, with the end of the ONS infection survey. A separate survey of more than 1,600 people with long Covid in Wales referred to the Adferiad recovery programme found around 70% were female and half were aged over 50. Of those needing follow-up, around a quarter had hospital treatment. Average stays were around two weeks. Fatigue, ""brain fog"" and shortness of breath were the most common symptoms. Scientific advisers for the Welsh government estimate thatpotentially up to a quarter of people who have Covid may develop long Covid.,external In January 2022, this would have included far higher proportions of Covid cases involving people aged between 50 and 70 - an estimated 43% of those with Covid. But even if 6% of young people under 25 with Covid developed long-term symptoms, this could still mean more than 2,200 young people with long Covid in Wales. This analysis was used to develop a ""social cost"" estimate for Covid, which looked at the cost to the NHS of treating Covid at different stages of the pandemic. With the effects of the vaccine, and less patient time in hospital and intensive care, it meant this estimated cost had fallen from Â£21,000 per case in the second wave of the pandemic to Â£5,769 per case by January 2022. Of this, more than Â£4,800 per case would be the cost of long Covid. The first Welsh patient to be admitted to a hospital with Covid was on 2 March 2020. Waves of the pandemic saw dozens of patients in critical care with Covid. This reached 164 patients at the first wave peak in April 2020, while the second wave peak in January peaked at 150 patients. As the vaccination programme kicked in, there were only 40 patients at the winter peak of 2021-22 and then 24 patients with Covid in critical care at the peak of winter 2022-23. For the final Digital Health and Care Wales figures, there were five patients in critical care with Covid on 12 July 2023, with one of those recovering from Covid. Along-running study of more than 500 Welsh critical care patients with Covid,externalgave insights into the virus. The mortality rate was about 34%, including those who died later on a general ward. About 63% had been discharged from hospital. The study also showed patients admitted in the past year who survived were spending less time in critical care - an average of seven days - than early in the pandemic. Around 60% of patients had been admitted to critical care with Covid the primary reason for treatment. The average age of those admitted in 2022-23 was 58, and just over half were men. Half were from more deprived parts of Wales. About 26% were under 50. At its peaks, there were between 120 and 140 admissions a day on average to hospitals for patients with Covid. By the time Digital Health and Care Wales halted their data gathering, there were five admissions of people testing positive for Covid on 12 July 2023, with numbers in single figures for the previous three months. Figures had been low and, for the first time since the pandemic began, no Covid admissions were recorded on 24 January 2023. The previous low had been just one admission on two days in May and June 2022. Over 18 months from the start of 2022, hospitals in Wales were asked to track how many of their patients testing positively for Covid were actually being primarily treated for it. Over this period, 13% of patients on average with Covid were being actively or primarily treated for it. There were some differences between health boards over definitions so care needs to be taken in how we interpret this. But since the autumn of 2022, the proportion of ""active"" Covid cases was usually in single figures. TheIcnarc intensive care study,externalhas found a far smaller proportion of critical care patients with Covid were being primarily treated for the virus during 2022 (41%), compared with the period before (nearly 86%). The mortality rate was 31% for those with ""primary"" Covid, compared with 25% for those with incidental Covid. After the end of mass testing at the end of March 2022, there was no longer a reliable case rate based on PCR test results Up to 1 April 2022, there were 827,225 positive cases across Wales, but this only measured people who were tested. It did not include many people not offered a test in the first wave, those who chose not to be tested, as well as thousands testing positive with lateral flow tests in 2022 Over the course of the mass testing period in the pandemic, Merthyr Tydfil had the highest cases per 100,000 of Wales' local authorities. The biggest spike in cases came with the Omicron variant in early 2022 - by which stage, nearly three quarters of people had received two doses of the vaccine Only around 33,730 positive PCR tests were recorded in the year after mass testing ended. Only around 100 positive PCR tests were being recorded weekly by April 2024. There were nearly 14,000 positive PCR tests recorded in 2023. In the autumn of 2020, a series of local lockdowns - which began in Caerphilly in early September 2020 - were introduced to try to stop a rise in cases. These eventually covered most local authority areas in Wales but only had a short term impact. This measure was followed by a Wales-wide ""firebreak"" lockdown on 23 October 2020.  The case rate then rose to a second wave peak in winter 2020. When we look at infections at a community level, there has generally a split between rural and more urban areas. This is noticeable when we look at a map of community case rates for the whole pandemic, taking into account population sizes. Pontardawe in Neath Port Talbot - of similar-sized smaller communities - had the highest number of positive Covid tests, 3,796 Tonypandy West and Clydach Vale in Rhondda Cynon Taf had the highest case rate of these smaller communities The lowest case rate was in Cilgerran and Crymych in Pembrokeshire Abersoch in Gwynedd is the community with the smallest number of positive tests, 839. At the peak of the Omicron wave at the end of 2021, the positivity rate - the number of positive results from all PCR tests taken - reached 51.6%. Locally, Neath Port Talbot over the course of the whole pandemic had the highest positivity rate (18.8%) and Ceredigion the lowest. Earlier in the pandemic, a 5% positivity threshold was suggested by the World Health Organisation as an indicator that infections were too high. How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? Four numbers that reveal the real Covid trends There was a much younger profile to cases in the third wave in the latter half of 2021. Between January and March 2022 there was a rise in proportions of those aged 20 to 40 testing positive. In terms of PCR tests, the 20 to 40 age group made up more than 41% of positive results in winter 2021-22. Nearly 8.9 million Covid-19 tests have been carried out since the start of the pandemic, with the first positive result recorded in Swansea on 27 February 2020. For most of the first wave, testing was confined to hospitals and some care homes but mass testing became available in the spring of 2020. This ended at the start of April 2022, although it is still taking place in hospitals and also for some vulnerable people and those with symptoms in care homes. There are around 2,500 PCR tests currently taking place each week, about half in the over 60s. This compares to around 200,000 a week at the pandemic's peak. Up to the end of routine testing in April 2022, about 17,000 PCR tests routinely took place in hospitals each week and up to 30,000 weekly in care homes. Testing that was processed privately - at so-called Lighthouse labs - is no longer taking place. There have also now been changes to guidance for Covid testing in hospitals, although patients will still be tested before admission or ahead of surgery or chemotherapy. Altogether, around 32,500 positive results were recorded in care homes over the course of the routine testing programme from autumn 2020. Care home staff no longer need to take a weekly PCR test, while free lateral flow testswill only be provided in limited circumstances.,external School absences for Covid-related reasons are no longer being recorded. We saw over the 2021-22 academic year, 69.1% of pupils missed at least half a day's schooling because of Covid. Absenteeism for any reason continued to rise, including those persistently absent. The percentage of secondary school pupils who were persistently absent had tripled to 16.3% from 2018-19 - the last full academic year before Covid - and 2022-23. Schools face widening gaps for poorer pupils Pupil reading standards fall since Covid This was more than twice the absence rate in pre-pandemic years. Analysis of these figures showed10% were persistently absent - and this rose to 21% of those from poorer backgrounds. The so-called R-number - the reproduction number - had been a tool to express the infection rate of Covid. However, it is has now been phased out as a measure. Expressed within a range, if it was above 1, this indicated that infections were growing. The range for the last estimate in December 2022 was between 0.9 and 1.2, suggesting infections were rising. So, for every 10 people with Covid in Wales, between another nine and 12 people would be infected. In the financial year ending in March 2021, the first year of the pandemic, spending on infectious diseases in the NHS in Wales jumped by Â£373 million. That worked out at Â£156 per person in Wales, or just under 6% of all NHS Wales spending. The costing of treating patients with Covid and managing the virus was put at Â£628m. Spending also included field hospitals and operating the track and trace system.

"The gates of one of Belfast's so-called peace walls were prised open before being set alight Rioting in Belfast on Wednesday night was on a scale not seen in Northern Ireland for years, police have said. During several hours of violence, police officers were attacked, petrol bombs were thrown and a bus was burnt. Eight officers were injured at an interface between loyalist and nationalist areas in west Belfast. Senior police sources now say there was no evidence of UVF organisational involvement in last night's trouble in west Belfast. Earlier the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had suspected that individuals within the paramilitary group had encouraged some of the trouble. However, following the progress of an investigation, police are now satisfied the group and its leadership was not involved. This video can not be played Police officers were attacked, petrol bombs were thrown and a bus was burnt during rioting in Belfast Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive said it was ""gravely concerned"" by recent street violence and has called for calm to be restored. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also condemned the disorder. How Northern Ireland's violence unfolded Disorder on previous occasions - in south Belfast, Newtownabbey and Londonderry - has been connected to the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). More than 50 officers have been hurt in violence in several areas since the end of last month Earlier, PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said it was likely that paramilitary organisations were involved and had planned the rioting on Wednesday night. ""Last night was at a scale we haven't seen in Belfast or further afield in Northern Ireland for a number of years,"" he said. This video can not be played Youths attacked a bus which had been hijacked ""We are very, very lucky no-one was seriously injured or killed last night given in particular the large number of petrol bombs thrown."" Police officers were called in from other parts of Northern Ireland to help to deal with the rioting. LIVE: Reaction to wave of violence in Northern Ireland More than 50 officers have been hurt in violence in several areas since the end of last month. The bus driver whose double-decker was attacked and burned is ""very shaken by the incident but is physically unhurt"", according to the public transport provider Translink. The PSNI is concerned at the potential for further trouble in the days ahead. According to police, Wednesday night's trouble involved ""equally large numbers on both sides"" of the peaceline at Lanark Way. It is believed the PSNI will be paying close attention to interface areas and the risk of further clashes between communities. The activities of dissident Republicans are monitored as routine and the police are wary of any attempt to escalate the situation. Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts was asked at a press conference if he feared weapons could come on to the streets. ""Given the history of Northern Ireland, it is something always in the back of our minds,"" he said. This video can not be played Belfast rioting reaction: 'We're lucky there wasn't a fatality' Meanwhile, a group linked to the south Belfast UDA has issued a statement urging calm. ""The way forward must be through politics alone,"" the message from the Ulster Political Research Group read. ""Rioting, street disturbances and the destruction of property will not change what must be solved by our political representatives."" It cited the Irish Sea border and policing as the main problems. The group is associated with the Jackie McDonald, the man widely regarded as the UDA leader in south Belfast. The Loyalist Communities Council, an umbrella body which includes representatives of the UDA and UVF, was due to meet on Thursday. It has not issued any public statements since it published a letter it sent to Boris Johnson in March warning of the danger created by the Irish Sea Border. Some unionists have linked the violence in recent days to thedecision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to prosecute anyone who attended the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey in June 2020. It was attended by 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid-19 restrictions were in place. They have also linked it to simmeringloyalist tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal. In recent days10 people have been arrestedas a result of rioting by gangs of people, some as young as 13. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a statement, the White House said it was ""concerned by the violence in Northern Ireland"" and joined other leaders in their ""steadfast"" support of ""a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard won peace peace"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis travelled to Belfast on Thursday to meet political parties. Mr Lewis said he was aware of unionist concerns in recent months and he had been ""engaging and listening"" them. He denied that the UK government has abandoned unionists through the new Brexit arrangements. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer said the violence was ""completely unacceptable"" and he called on Mr Johnson to ""step up"" and ""show leadership"". The disorder at the Shankill and Springfield Road areas lasted for several hours Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin wrote on social media: ""Now is the time for the two governments and leaders on all sides to work together to defuse tensions and restore calm."" The taoiseach and prime minister spoke on Thursday afternoon. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told BBC News NI that political leaders need to come together to make a ""clear and strong statement that violence is not the answer"". ""This is a time for unity in the face of violence and concern across Northern Ireland in terms of what's been happening,"" he said. All of the main political parties in Northern Ireland have criticised the disorder but they are divided over its causes. What is behind the violence in Northern Ireland? However, after an emergency meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive, a joint statement was issued from ministers, saying they were ""gravely concerned"" by the recent disorder. ""Attacks on police officers, public services and communities are deplorable and they must stop,"" they said. A bus was hijacked and left to freewheel along a road before it was set on fire ""Destruction, violence and the threat of violence are completely unacceptable and unjustifiable, no matter what concerns may exist in communities. ""Those who would seek to use and abuse our children and young people to carry out these attacks have no place in our society."" The violence has been brought on by a combination of factors. Northern Ireland politics and bigger events like Brexit are all in play here but there is no single straightforward reason. There is a lot of fury over the attendance of Sinn FÃ©in politicians at a funeral of a former IRA leader last summer which appeared to blatantly flout Covid-19 rules. Sinn FÃ©in's most senior politicians, among long lines of former IRA members, walked through the streets behind a cortege at a time when many people missed attending funerals for their own loved ones. ""Republicans do what they like and get away with it"" has broadly become one of the narratives being used to justify trouble against the police. However there were also loyalist funerals which broke rules during the pandemic. Brexit has beencreating tension in loyalist communities for months, with the growing realisation over just how differently Northern Ireland is now being treated from the rest of the UK. Signs of anger over the new Irish Sea trade border are plastered on walls and lampposts in unionist and loyalist areas. Loyalists have been angered by the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland In these areas it feels that Boris Johnson has betrayed Northern Ireland and there is a backlash. But that isn't all - there are much more localised issues too. Loyalist paramilitaries have been subject to a series of raids and arrests for their criminal activities and police believe in some areas these are the figures in the background helping to encourage trouble. Unionist political leaders - including Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader and First Minister Arlene Foster - have said PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne should resign over the force's handling of the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey in June 2020. Last week a decision was madenot to prosecute senior Sinn FÃ©in members who attendedthe funeral. Mrs Foster tweeted on Thursday morning that she had spoken to Mr Byrne in the wake of the violence, as did Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald. The first minister had faced criticism for not speaking to the chief constable after the violence on previous days. Mr Byrne briefed both the Stormont executive and individual parties. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and the Alliance Party have accused unionist politicians of ramping up rhetoric in recent days by calling for Mr Byrne to stand down. Council workers cleared the debris from the peace wall gates on Thursday morning Mark Lindsay, the chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said removing the chief constable ""in the middle of a crisis"" would not be helpful, although he said there were ""serious issues that need to be addressed"". On Thursday the Northern Ireland Assemblywas recalled for politicians to consider a motion calling for an ""immediate and complete end"" to violence in loyalist areas. WATCH: Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History Mrs Foster said the violent scenes were unacceptable, and Northern Ireland is ""faced with a number of deep and significant political challenges in the time ahead, and collectively we must work through those challenges"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in said the violence in Belfast on Wednesday night was a ""dangerous escalation"" of events. Bus drivers hold a protest at Belfast City Hall in support for a colleague whose bus was burnt Meanwhile, Education Minister Peter Weir has confirmed the further reopening of some youth services in response to the violence.

After another night of violence on Wednesday it was a busy day on the political scene in Northern Ireland. Jordan KennyBBC News NI Northern Ireland has seen 10 days of sporadic violence, with crowds of predominantly young people rioting in towns and cities almost nightly since the end of March. Armed with bricks, bars, fireworks and petrol bombs, people as young as 12 have attacked police in Londonderry, Belfast, Carrickfergus, Ballymena and Newtownabbey. BBC News NI charts how the violence has unfolded. To view the timeline,click here. Amy Gribbin works for Forthspring Inter Community Group which has been operating on the peace line since it was built in 1997. She told Evening Extra that the recent violence has been a ""massive step back"" for their cross-community work. ""Our youth project has been working very hard across the interface division to build strong and meaningful cross-community relationships,"" she said. ""Our young people have worked hard for the extensions of interface gate opening times to ensure they can access shared youth provision for longer but what happened last night and in the lead up may impact the possibility of the gates opening longer,"" she said. ""We're youth workers, we're not police, we're not armed or protected, we're going out in red coats with good intentions. She added that young people need to have a ""sense of pride and ownership in their community"" and a ""parental role plays another huge part."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin have spoken about the violence of recent nights in Northern Ireland. A statement from the Irish government said they stressed that violence is unacceptable and called for calm. A spokesperson added: ""The way forward is through dialogue and working the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. ""They agreed that the two Governments would continue to stay in contact.""  Green Party councillor Brian Smyth said the ""failure of politicians to address the root causes"" was to blame for the recent violence. ""How can you tell young people who believe they have nothing, no future, poor educational outcomes, unemployed and canât afford a bus into the city centre and youâre telling them they canât travel to America? [if they get a criminal record]"" he said. ""That's at the root of this and we are trying to communicate with young people who have little to no hope, trying to sell them a dream but thereâs no reality for that on the ground."" ""Itâs heartbreaking and the failure of politicians to address the root causes, poverty, inequality, poor health outcomes, poor educational outcomes, youth services stripped back - all they [young people] have known is austerity, they may not know what austerity means but theyâve lived through it,"" he said. ""Thereâs no investment, no hope."" Julian O'NeillBBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) is suspected of involvement inthe worst night of rioting Northern Ireland has seen in years, according to police sources. It is said to have âencouragedâ the trouble at a Belfast
interface, although a loyalist source has disputed the police belief of UVF involvement. It means the fingerprints of both main loyalist paramilitary
groups are on separate incidents of street violence which have erupted since
last Friday. Disorder on previous occasions â in south Belfast,
Newtownabbey and Londonderry â is connected to the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor NI Secretary Brandon Lewis has denied that the UK government has abandoned unionists through the new Brexit arrangements. He was responding to concerns raised by loyalist community workers who said the new Irish Sea border created by the Northern Ireland protocol had left unionists feeling disconnected from the rest of the UK. It followed a night of rioting on Thursday at an interface in Belfast during which police were pelted with petrol bombs. Mr Lewis returned to Northern Ireland today to speak to political leaders and the police. Speaking to the BBC he denied the government had played a part in the unrest. âWe recognise the issues around identity and are working to make sure UK citizens in Northern Ireland have the same experience as UK citizens living in Great Britain,"" he said. He added that the government was working with the EU to address concerns raised over the protocol. He insisted there were a range of âcomplicatedâ issues which had been flagged up including criminal gangs, which according to the PSNI were behind much of the trouble in Northern Ireland this week. âWhatever the concerns, violence is not the answer,â he said He also welcomed the cross party condemnation of lasts night violence through a joint statement issued by the Northern Ireland Executive. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has said he is ""absolutely"" open to visiting the site of some of the worst violence Northern Ireland has seen in years. Mr Lewis landed in Northern Ireland for emergency talks with Stormont's main parties this afternoon. Asked by the BBC's Evening Extra programme if he would speak to people on the Shankill Road, he said: ""I have been talking to people in that community and community leaders already, so I am absolutely prepared to continue doing that. ""I'm really keen as well to see the EU play its part."" Asked to respond to comments he had been ""missing in action"" while violence erupted in Northern Ireland, he said he had been talking to political leaders and the Police Service of Northern Ireland ""over the past couple of days"". He said he was unaware of claims he had been ""missing."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said she does not believe her attendance at Bobby Storey's funeral last summer has anything to do with the violence in recent days. Last week unionist politicians reacted with anger after the Public Prosecution Service said nobody who attended the funeral would be prosecuted over alleged breaches of Covid-19 regulations - including Ms O'Neill. Speaking to Evening Extra on BBC Radio Ulster she said: ""There's no justification whatsoever - and no equivocation in myself attending a funeral - for people attempting to murder a police officer and wreck their community. ""If people have issues with my attendance at a funeral there are avenues and ways which people can express concerns, we should not allow discontent with any situation to spill out into violence on our streets."" ""Iâm worried that any child thinks it's the right thing to do to go out and lift a petrol bomb and attack their community."" She said the PSNI had confirmed that organised criminal gangs were ""using young people to go out on the streets to carry out criminal activity detrimental to their community and to themselves. ""We must call on all young people not to be used and abused by these criminal gangs."" Some youth services will reopen after children joined in recent riots in Northern Ireland. Education Minister Peter Weir says it will apply in areas of unrest. In a statement this afternoon, he says the aim was to ""divert"" young people from becoming involved in violence. âAs a society we should all be appalled at witnessing young people and even children being involved in the recent violence on our streets. âAt this time it is even more important that youth services are able to meet the needs of young people in these areas.â It has been agreed that all youth centres and provisions in areas where there is heightened community tensions can maximise the use of their facilities and services with immediate effect. This includes educational visits and overnight stays when there is significant risk of harm or criminalisation of children and young people. A Shankill Road pastor said his ""heart sank"" seeing young children riot in the streets. Church of God pastor Stephen Reynolds, who is also chairman of Conway Youth Centre, said the young people involved were encouraged by ""sinister elements"" in the community. ""To think young children are out on the streets rioting, and throwing petrol bombs, bricks, all sorts of things like that, it was just heartbreaking,"" he said. ""This was something that we've known in the past, it's not something we want today or going forward for our children and young people, so my heart just sank when I saw it all. ""I think the main reason why they're getting involved in all this kind of activity is due to sinister elements within the community, who are encouraging them to get involved."" He says the violence forced some shops to close early and halted bus services and some food delivery vans were cancelled because of fears for workers' safety. Sir Keir Starmer says the violence witnessed in west Belfast was ""completely
unacceptable"" and calls on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ""step
up"" and ""show leadership"". Speaking in an interview during a visit
to Bristol, the Labour leader says he is ""very concernedâ by the street violence
and believes âthe prime minister needs to convene all-party talks"". He adds: ""This is
about leadership and the prime minister can't be absent"". Sir Keir says ""everybody with responsibility, in and for Northern
Ireland, needs to condemn the violence in no uncertain terms"". A community worker in Londonderry says people on the ground have been working to ease tensions in the Waterside following repeated incidents of violence, but believes there has been a lack of political leadership. Brian Dougherty, who is from the North West Cultural Partnership, tells BBC Radio Foyle many unionists feel forgotten about. ""The leadership has raised a lot of questions within loyalism generally over how the protocol was handled and how it has manifested itself here now as well."" He adds: ""At a time when leadership is required, we are not seeing it at that elected level"". Mr Dougherty says ""more pressure"" is being put on community groups to take on that responsibility. Police responded to an incident in the Waterside on Monday where cars were set alight and surrounding roads blocked with fires In the latest incidents in Derry on Monday, petrol bombs were thrown at police and vehicles set alight in the Waterside. On Tuesday, PSNI district commander Darrin Jones said twelve officers were injured in the north west during seven nights of unrest, but all have since returned to work. There has never been so much anger toward a unionist party
than there is now directed at the DUP, a former Progressive Unionist Party councillor has said. Julie-Anne Corr-Johnston said there was a ""growing disconnect"" between unionism and its base. She said people were mislead about the consequences of Brexit - a charge echoed by formerNorthern Ireland Secretary Lord Hain on the same programme. She told the BBC: ""Violence can never ever be justified but it can be explained ""I have never experienced as much anger towards a party within
unionism then I have at this point in time towards the DUP.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Eileen Weir, a community activist in Belfast, told Talkback that community workers on the ground are ""burnt out."" ""Theyâre dealing with the pandemic, now theyâre dealing with violence within the interfaces which is very sad but people in west and north Belfast are not our enemies, that is not where we should be taking our frustrations out,"" she said. ""We need the language coming from our political leaders be positive and forceful so the communities can get their trust back in their political leaders."" ""I was 15 when the troubles started and the propaganda within communities makes you get up and do something, that propaganda within communities is there and if youâre young and a teenager youâre going to act and react, which is wrong,"" she said. ""Let's get back to what the Good Friday Agreement was about, peaceful means, not to wreck their own communities and put more hardship on those areas already suffering."" Bus drivers gathered at Belfast City Hall earlier to protest the hijacking of a bus on the Shankill Road yesterday evening. Michael Dornan, chairman of the Unite Union for Metro bus drivers, said a crowd stopped the bus before crowding around it. ""They started pelting the bus with bricks etc, forced the doors open and then he and the passengers were allowed off and then they petrol-bombed the bus. ""It all happened within a matter of seconds. ""We're just lucky there wasn't a fatality there last night."" Michael HirstBBC News NI While there are no clear indications the unrest is being orchestrated by an organised group, the violence has been concentrated in areas where criminal gangs linked to loyalist paramilitaries have significant influence. Unionist leaders have linked the violence to simmeringloyalist tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal. The new trading border is the result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, introduced to avoid the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland. Some unionist leaders have also attributed the violence to the decision not to prosecute leaders of Sinn FÃ©in for breaching Covid regulationsat the funeral of a former IRA intelligence chief last June. There have been calls for the PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign over the police's handling of Bobby Storey's funeral, however Mr Byrne has refused to step down.

He adds that the people of Northern Ireland ""deserve better than a continuation of the violence and disorder that we have witnessed in recent days"". ""Those engaged in this destruction and disorder do not represent Northern Ireland."" He says the strength of the Good Friday Agreement lay in providing a framework for all communities, through mutual respect and tolerance, to live and work together.

"This video can not be played Talks about the possibility of introducing vaccine passports in Wales are ongoing A decision on vaccine passports needs to be made ""urgently"", according to the artistic director of the Wales Millennium Centre. Graeme Farrow said a settlement over their possible introduction ""can't come soon enough"". Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has said the matter is being discussed between the four governments in the UK. Opposition parties have highlighted concerns about the plans for such a scheme in Wales. The centre is hoping to be open by October and ""fully operational"" - with no social distancing - by Christmas. The Wales Millennium Centre is aiming to be fully operational by the end of the year The news about passports was a ""step forward"", Mr Farrow said. Certification is 'one option', vaccines minister says Covid: US rules out federal vaccine passports Passports showing vaccine status would be time-limited, says minister ""If passports are a way to reopen this building then we are all for it, and we will be discussing with government how we do that,"" Mr Farrow said. Passports ""would work for us"", he said, but details of how they would work would need to be examined. ""Anything that brings back audiences more quickly into theatres, and safely, we are going to be supportive of,"" he said. Artistic director Graeme Farrow said a decision on vaccine passport introduction was needed ""urgently"" But he said he feared a situation where those yet to be vaccinated, or unable to be, could not attend shows. ""We want to open to as many people and to as diverse an audience as we can,"" Mr Farrow said. Barrister Andrew Taylor said there were ""legal, ethical and security issues"" with the idea of passports. ""If most people can have the vaccine, which we know is the case, then that covers the majority of the population,"" he said. ""But not everyone is able to have it because of health considerations, or some people perhaps choose not to have it. ""The difficulty I see in the future is in the jobs market and, for example, the ability to go to venues could lead to a two-tier economy."" He warned of the possibility of workplace discrimination. ""Employers might say, 'You can only work here if you have the passport'. Barrister Andrew Taylor said ""legal, ethical and security issues"" surrounded the idea of passports ""If you are not allowed to have the vaccine, you therefore cannot work, so what is already a situation of disadvantage for some people may become exacerbated."" He believed any policy would have to be UK-wide. Night Time Industries Association chief executive Michael Kill said he was against vaccine passports. He said: ""There are other mechanisms that we have in place that we do very well, that I think need to be considered, as well as some further engagement with the industry as a whole, to ensure we are all very aware of the output of this, if it is something that is being considered."" Mr Kill called for an ""even playing field"" for different businesses. ""There are some challenges around the age group we attract,"" he said. ""The 18-24 age group is not going to be vaccinated, or have the opportunity or choice to be vaccinated until the end of July potentially, and that has to be taken into account when you are looking at some of these measures."" First Minister and Welsh Labour leader Mr Drakeford said there were ""practical and ethical"" problems to be solved around vaccine passports. He said he was in discussions with the governments of the other UK nations and would be ""having discussions again next week"". He said: ""If you can do it in a way that doesn't discriminate unfairly against people, if you can do it in a way that does not make the system vulnerable to fraud and counterfeit certificates and so on, then I think there is a part they might be able to play in Wales."" The Welsh Conservatives said talk of vaccine passports in Wales was ""unnecessary"" as there was ""a review ongoing at a UK level"". In Israel, a ""green pass"" showing someone is fully vaccinated is required for people to do certain things A spokesman said: ""The focus of ministers in Cardiff Bay should be on the vaccine rollout, accelerating the reopening of outdoor hospitality and gyms, whilst extending business support for those firms who've been badly let down by Labour's decision this week to backtrack on previous commitments."" Plaid Cymru said a domestic vaccine scheme posed ""ethical and practical questions"". A spokesman said it was concerned about people being excluded because they were unable to take the vaccine. ""It could risk marginalising those groups and further entrenching divides in our society,"" he said. ""Plaid Cymru cannot support the introduction of vaccine certificates for domestic use until these concerns have been fully addressed."" Welsh Liberal Democrats leader Jane Dodds said her party ""remain opposed to these plans"" as vaccine passports would be ""divisive and discriminatory, as well as unworkable and illiberal"". Ms Dodds said: ""They would mean that only those over-50 would be able to visit a shop or restaurant when they reopen, and individuals in their 20s and 30s will be barred from premises for many, many months until they are offered a vaccine.""

"The gates of one of Belfast's so-called peace walls were prised open before being set alight Rioting in Belfast on Wednesday night was on a scale not seen in Northern Ireland for years, police have said. During several hours of violence, police officers were attacked, petrol bombs were thrown and a bus was burnt. Eight officers were injured at an interface between loyalist and nationalist areas in west Belfast. Senior police sources now say there was no evidence of UVF organisational involvement in last night's trouble in west Belfast. Earlier the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had suspected that individuals within the paramilitary group had encouraged some of the trouble. However, following the progress of an investigation, police are now satisfied the group and its leadership was not involved. This video can not be played Police officers were attacked, petrol bombs were thrown and a bus was burnt during rioting in Belfast Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive said it was ""gravely concerned"" by recent street violence and has called for calm to be restored. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also condemned the disorder. How Northern Ireland's violence unfolded Disorder on previous occasions - in south Belfast, Newtownabbey and Londonderry - has been connected to the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). More than 50 officers have been hurt in violence in several areas since the end of last month Earlier, PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said it was likely that paramilitary organisations were involved and had planned the rioting on Wednesday night. ""Last night was at a scale we haven't seen in Belfast or further afield in Northern Ireland for a number of years,"" he said. This video can not be played Youths attacked a bus which had been hijacked ""We are very, very lucky no-one was seriously injured or killed last night given in particular the large number of petrol bombs thrown."" Police officers were called in from other parts of Northern Ireland to help to deal with the rioting. LIVE: Reaction to wave of violence in Northern Ireland More than 50 officers have been hurt in violence in several areas since the end of last month. The bus driver whose double-decker was attacked and burned is ""very shaken by the incident but is physically unhurt"", according to the public transport provider Translink. The PSNI is concerned at the potential for further trouble in the days ahead. According to police, Wednesday night's trouble involved ""equally large numbers on both sides"" of the peaceline at Lanark Way. It is believed the PSNI will be paying close attention to interface areas and the risk of further clashes between communities. The activities of dissident Republicans are monitored as routine and the police are wary of any attempt to escalate the situation. Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts was asked at a press conference if he feared weapons could come on to the streets. ""Given the history of Northern Ireland, it is something always in the back of our minds,"" he said. This video can not be played Belfast rioting reaction: 'We're lucky there wasn't a fatality' Meanwhile, a group linked to the south Belfast UDA has issued a statement urging calm. ""The way forward must be through politics alone,"" the message from the Ulster Political Research Group read. ""Rioting, street disturbances and the destruction of property will not change what must be solved by our political representatives."" It cited the Irish Sea border and policing as the main problems. The group is associated with the Jackie McDonald, the man widely regarded as the UDA leader in south Belfast. The Loyalist Communities Council, an umbrella body which includes representatives of the UDA and UVF, was due to meet on Thursday. It has not issued any public statements since it published a letter it sent to Boris Johnson in March warning of the danger created by the Irish Sea Border. Some unionists have linked the violence in recent days to thedecision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to prosecute anyone who attended the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey in June 2020. It was attended by 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid-19 restrictions were in place. They have also linked it to simmeringloyalist tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal. In recent days10 people have been arrestedas a result of rioting by gangs of people, some as young as 13. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a statement, the White House said it was ""concerned by the violence in Northern Ireland"" and joined other leaders in their ""steadfast"" support of ""a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard won peace peace"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis travelled to Belfast on Thursday to meet political parties. Mr Lewis said he was aware of unionist concerns in recent months and he had been ""engaging and listening"" them. He denied that the UK government has abandoned unionists through the new Brexit arrangements. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer said the violence was ""completely unacceptable"" and he called on Mr Johnson to ""step up"" and ""show leadership"". The disorder at the Shankill and Springfield Road areas lasted for several hours Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin wrote on social media: ""Now is the time for the two governments and leaders on all sides to work together to defuse tensions and restore calm."" The taoiseach and prime minister spoke on Thursday afternoon. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told BBC News NI that political leaders need to come together to make a ""clear and strong statement that violence is not the answer"". ""This is a time for unity in the face of violence and concern across Northern Ireland in terms of what's been happening,"" he said. All of the main political parties in Northern Ireland have criticised the disorder but they are divided over its causes. What is behind the violence in Northern Ireland? However, after an emergency meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive, a joint statement was issued from ministers, saying they were ""gravely concerned"" by the recent disorder. ""Attacks on police officers, public services and communities are deplorable and they must stop,"" they said. A bus was hijacked and left to freewheel along a road before it was set on fire ""Destruction, violence and the threat of violence are completely unacceptable and unjustifiable, no matter what concerns may exist in communities. ""Those who would seek to use and abuse our children and young people to carry out these attacks have no place in our society."" The violence has been brought on by a combination of factors. Northern Ireland politics and bigger events like Brexit are all in play here but there is no single straightforward reason. There is a lot of fury over the attendance of Sinn FÃ©in politicians at a funeral of a former IRA leader last summer which appeared to blatantly flout Covid-19 rules. Sinn FÃ©in's most senior politicians, among long lines of former IRA members, walked through the streets behind a cortege at a time when many people missed attending funerals for their own loved ones. ""Republicans do what they like and get away with it"" has broadly become one of the narratives being used to justify trouble against the police. However there were also loyalist funerals which broke rules during the pandemic. Brexit has beencreating tension in loyalist communities for months, with the growing realisation over just how differently Northern Ireland is now being treated from the rest of the UK. Signs of anger over the new Irish Sea trade border are plastered on walls and lampposts in unionist and loyalist areas. Loyalists have been angered by the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland In these areas it feels that Boris Johnson has betrayed Northern Ireland and there is a backlash. But that isn't all - there are much more localised issues too. Loyalist paramilitaries have been subject to a series of raids and arrests for their criminal activities and police believe in some areas these are the figures in the background helping to encourage trouble. Unionist political leaders - including Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader and First Minister Arlene Foster - have said PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne should resign over the force's handling of the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey in June 2020. Last week a decision was madenot to prosecute senior Sinn FÃ©in members who attendedthe funeral. Mrs Foster tweeted on Thursday morning that she had spoken to Mr Byrne in the wake of the violence, as did Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald. The first minister had faced criticism for not speaking to the chief constable after the violence on previous days. Mr Byrne briefed both the Stormont executive and individual parties. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and the Alliance Party have accused unionist politicians of ramping up rhetoric in recent days by calling for Mr Byrne to stand down. Council workers cleared the debris from the peace wall gates on Thursday morning Mark Lindsay, the chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said removing the chief constable ""in the middle of a crisis"" would not be helpful, although he said there were ""serious issues that need to be addressed"". On Thursday the Northern Ireland Assemblywas recalled for politicians to consider a motion calling for an ""immediate and complete end"" to violence in loyalist areas. WATCH: Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History Mrs Foster said the violent scenes were unacceptable, and Northern Ireland is ""faced with a number of deep and significant political challenges in the time ahead, and collectively we must work through those challenges"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in said the violence in Belfast on Wednesday night was a ""dangerous escalation"" of events. Bus drivers hold a protest at Belfast City Hall in support for a colleague whose bus was burnt Meanwhile, Education Minister Peter Weir has confirmed the further reopening of some youth services in response to the violence. Mr Weir said it would apply in areas of ""heightened community tensions"". Did you witness the violence? Do you live in the area? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Zachary Horwitz, also known as Zach Avery, is yet to play a major role in a Hollywood film An aspiring Hollywood actor has been accused of scamming millions from film investors by tricking them with fake Netflix deals to fund a lavish lifestyle. Zachary Horwitz, 34, was arrested on Tuesday by FBI agents on suspicion of running a $690m (Â£502m) Ponzi scheme. Mr Horwitz, whose stage name is Zach Avery, allegedly raised funds from investors for film licensing deals with Netflix and HBO that did not exist. He was charged with wire fraud. If convicted, he could be jailed for up to 20 years. The criminal complaint was filed by prosecutors and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday. HSBC moved Ponzi scheme millions despite warning How a woman scammed the world, then vanished Why are we fascinated by con artists? It accuses Mr Horwitz of using investor funds for ""lavish personal spending"", including extravagant trips to Las Vegas, flights on chartered jets, payments for high-end cars and the purchase of a $5.7m mansion in Los Angeles. ""We allege that Horwitz promised extremely high returns and made them seem plausible by invoking the names of two well-known entertainment companies and fabricating documents,"" Michele Wein Layne, a senior SEC official,said in a statement on Tuesday,external. As an actor, Mr Horwitz has not had the most illustrious career in Hollywood. Other than an uncredited part in Fury - a 2014 American war film starring Brad Pitt - Mr Horwitz has mostly appeared in low-budget films with mediocre ratings. A lawyer for Mr Horwitz, Anthony Pacheco, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. At first glance, Lucia's Grace - an Italian comedy released in 2018 - doesn't seem like a lucrative prospect for investors. In a largely scathing review,Variety magazine critic Jay Weissberg said,externalthe film ""can generously be called a pleasant comic bauble"", panning its script as lacking ""cohesion"" and trying too hard to be ""as blandly populist as possible"". The tone of the review is reflected in the film's 43% critics' ratingon the Rotten Tomatoes website,external. Still, with the backing of major streaming platforms, the film theoretically had potential to make money. At least that's what investors told prosecutors they were led to believe by Mr Horwitz. Mr Horwitz was arrested at his home in Beverlywood, Los Angeles From 2015, he promised investors that his company, 1inMM Capital LLC, would use their funds to buy the rights to distribute films in Latin America, Africa and New Zealand. Distribution deals had been struck with Netflix and HBO, Mr Horwitz allegedly told investors. Through these deals, backers were promised returns of at least 35% within a year. But in reality, 1inMM had no business relationship with either company, prosecutors say. Mr Horwitz allegedly showed investors fabricated agreements and emails regarding the purported deals with HBO and Netflix. ""I believed that if HBO was involved, my investment was safe,"" one investor was quoted as saying in the criminal complaint. At some points, Mr Horwitz was able to pay some investors, using funds raised from other investors to do so. But prosecutors say the scheme collapsed in 2019 when 1inMM Capital began defaulting on payments. The criminal complaint alleges Mr Horwitz ""deposited or transferred at least some investor funds to his personal bank accounts"". Some of the payments listed in the complaint include $691,800 to a celebrity interior decorator,  $165,408 for luxury cars, $137,072 for chartered jets flights and f $54,600 for a watch subscription service. At a court appearance on Tuesday, a judge set Mr Horwitz's bond, or bail, at $1m.

"Naana Aisha Issaka had struggled to source funding via the usual routes A woman has raised nearly Â£40,000 to pay for her nursing training after making a tearful plea on social media. Naana Aisha Issaka, a support worker from Nottingham, set up a fundraising page in August after applications for financial support were rejected. After her Instagram video went viral last week, she has been inundated with donations. Model and actress Cara Delevingne was among those who donated money to the appeal. The fundraiser has now received more than 2,600 contributions, sending it sailing past its target amount of Â£38,750. The 22-year-old said the cash would pay for tuition, accommodation and travel during the three-year course at De Montfort University in Leicester, which started in September. Allow Instagram content?

Ms Issaka grew up in Ghana but has lived in the UK since she was 10. When she turned 18, her father's visa no longer supported her, so she was detained by the Home Office before being granted leave to remain. Her visa status meant applications for funding from Student Finance England and a private student loans company were both unsuccessful, while an attempt at receiving a university scholarship also failed.

"Shareena Clanton has accused the Neighbours set of being a ""culturally unsafe space"" The production company behind Australian TV soap Neighbours has ordered an independent review over allegations of racism on the show. Two Aboriginal-Australian TV stars have alleged they witnessed racist incidents while working on set. Shareena Clanton said it was ""traumatising to work in such a culturally unsafe space"". Announcing the inquiry, Fremantle Media, which produces the soap, said it did not tolerate discrimination. ""Fremantle is committed to providing an environment where employees and others in the workplace are treated fairly and with respect, and are free from unlawful discrimination, harassment, victimisation and bullying,"" Fremantle said. ""We do not tolerate behaviour that does not align to our Anti-Discrimination, Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO), Harassment and Bullying Policy and take all complaints very seriously, investigating all allegations fairly and thoroughly."" It added: ""We have asked Campfire X, creative leaders in Indigenous Cultural Protocols, to conduct an independent review of Neighbours and the production process."" A spokesperson for Channel 5, which airs the soap in the UK, said it ""condemns racism and takes all allegations of discrimination seriously"". On Monday, Clanton alleged ""multiple racist traumas"" during her time on the show in an Instagram post. A day later, former Neighbours actor Meyne Wyatt said in a tweet he too had experienced racism on set. The actors, both Australians of indigenous descent, said they had heard other cast members use racist slurs. ""It's been lonely, triggering and traumatising to work in such a culturally unsafe space,"" wrote Clanton, who has guest starred in yet-to-be-aired episodes of Neighbours. Meyne Wyatt played the role of Nate Kinski in Neighbours First broadcast in 1985, Neighbours follows the lives of the residents of Ramsay Street, in a fictional suburb of Melbourne, Victoria. The soap was a launch pad for numerous pop and Hollywood stars, including Kylie Minogue and Russell Crowe. But the soap has been criticised for failing to reflect Australia's ethnic diversity in its casting of actors. Wyatt was the first indigenous actor to be added to the main cast when he appeared on the show from 2014 to 2016. Best known for her role in Australian drama series Wentworth, Clanton was hired to play a character named Sheila in upcoming episodes of Neighbours. In her Instagram post,external, she said she was ""navigating ongoing counselling"" from her stint on what she called a ""highly problematic show"". She made her allegations in a list of seven bullet points, without naming any individuals. One alleged that ""overt and covert levels of racism were rife"" on set. She cited several alleged examples of white actors using racist slurs, including two instances where she claimed the ""n-word"" was openly used. She alleged that she was told to ""go somewhere else"" when she confronted an actor who had used the slur ""because I was making others 'uncomfortable'"". ""The retaliation for calling out this misconduct and racism often left me ostracised and further marginalised,"" Clanton wrote. Does Neighbours really represent Australia? National anthem changes to reflect indigenous past Australia admits failings on indigenous equality Wyatt expressed similar sentiments in his posts on Twitter. He said he had walked in on someone using a racist insult, ""called it out and it didn't happen around me again"". He said it was ""disappointing but not at all surprising"" to hear about Clanton's allegations five years after he had left the show. Allow Twitter content?

"The Duke of Cambridge has urged banks to ""invest in nature"" to help fight global climate change. Speaking at an IMF and World Bank meeting, Prince William said protecting nature continued to play only a small part in combating global warming. He said investing in reforestation and sustainable agriculture were ""cost effective"" ways of tackling the issue. Banks have come under increasing pressure to step up efforts to help fight climate change. Just this week, Barclays' London headquarters was the target of a protest staged by climate activist group Extinction Rebellion. Members held placards and broke several windows as they called on the bank to stop financing fossil fuel companies. Addressing central bankers and finance ministers at the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, the duke said the world's natural habitats continue to decline at an ""alarming rate"". ""We cannot recover sustainably from coronavirus, eradicate global poverty, achieve net-zero emissions, or adapt to climate change, without investing in nature,"" he said. The duke said investing in nature accounted for only a ""fraction of the money that is spent on the fight against climate change"". ""We must invest in nature, through reforestation, sustainable agriculture and supporting healthy oceansâ¦ because doing so is one of the most cost effective and impactful ways of tackling climate change. ""It removes carbon from the atmosphere, helps build more resilient communities, tackles biodiversity loss and protects people's livelihoods."" Electricity system 'greenest ever' over Easter Then and now: Rising temperatures threaten corals Net zero climate targets are 'pie in the sky' The spring meetings of the IMF and World Bank are taking place virtually this week bringing together central banks, policymakers and business leaders to discuss the state of the world's economy. A key focus of the discussions will also centre on climate risks and building a sustainable economic recovery post Covid. The duke said: ""All of you here at the World Bank and across each of the multilateral development banks have that crucial part to play by supporting a green, inclusive and resilient recovery from the pandemic, by valuing nature and putting it at the heart of your work, and by increasing investment in a future where the natural world can thrive."" The decisions taken at the next UN climate change summit in Glasgow later this year will be a ""vital step"" in putting nature centre stage, the duke added. The duke has become a vocal campaigner on environmental issues. He launched a competition to try to inspire people to solve ""some of the world's greatest environmental challenges"". The Earthshot Prize will recognise ideas and technologies that can safeguard the planet offering five prizes of Â£1m to support environmental and conservation projects. Barclays' London headquarters was the target of a protest staged by Extinction Rebellion this week The duke's comments come amid growing pressure from shareholders on banks to take a tougher stance on climate change. HSBC announced last month it would stop financing coal projects across the EU by 2030, and all other markets by 2040, following pressure from a coalition of investment firms. Shareholders at Barclays are set to table a resolution at the bank's upcoming annual general meeting calling on the bank to phase out financing for coal, oil and gas companies. Meanwhile a group of central banks are reviewing ways to use monetary policy to tackle climate change. Options include greener asset purchases and lending schemes, according to report by the Network for Greening the Financial System.

"Naana Aisha Issaka had struggled to source funding via the usual routes A woman has raised nearly Â£40,000 to pay for her nursing training after making a tearful plea on social media. Naana Aisha Issaka, a support worker from Nottingham, set up a fundraising page in August after applications for financial support were rejected. After her Instagram video went viral last week, she has been inundated with donations. Model and actress Cara Delevingne was among those who donated money to the appeal. The fundraiser has now received more than 2,600 contributions, sending it sailing past its target amount of Â£38,750. The 22-year-old said the cash would pay for tuition, accommodation and travel during the three-year course at De Montfort University in Leicester, which started in September. Allow Instagram content?

Ms Issaka grew up in Ghana but has lived in the UK since she was 10. When she turned 18, her father's visa no longer supported her, so she was detained by the Home Office before being granted leave to remain. Her visa status meant applications for funding from Student Finance England and a private student loans company were both unsuccessful, while an attempt at receiving a university scholarship also failed. Ms Issaka set up the fundraising page but it was her video that received hundreds of thousands of views and prompted the avalanche of donations. The clip went viral after being shared by imjustbait, a meme page with millions of followers.

""Thank you for everything you do and will come to do in the future."" Ms Issaka said: ""I was just so shocked. She also posted it so I'm so grateful and thankful. ""The public has just basically changed my life."" The student said the success of her fundraiser highlighted the need to help aspiring healthcare workers who may not be able to access financial aid. ""It's not just me in this situation, there are so many students who are also wanting to do a healthcare-related degree, which obviously this country is screaming that they need, but are unable to do because of their circumstances,"" she said.

"Boris Johnson has paid tribute to former Conservative MP Peter Ainsworth who has died aged 64. Mr Ainsworth was MP for East Surrey from 1992 to 2010 and served in the shadow cabinet. Mr Johnson said he was ""a delightful colleague and passionate about his causes especially the environment"". The PM also recalled sharing a corridor with him in Parliament and said the pair often found themselves ""charging late"" for votes. ""He has been taken far too young,"" Mr Johnson added and said his thoughts were with Mr Ainsworth's widow Claire and his family. Before becoming an MP, Mr Ainsworth worked as an investment analyst and banker. He was a long-term supporter of the Conservatives, having joined the party as a schoolboy and in the 1980s he became a Tory councillor in Wandsworth. In 1992, he won the East Surrey constituency and three years later was named 'Country Parliamentarian of the Year"" by Country Life for his opposition to enlarging the M25 and for trying to preserve hedgerows. During his time in the House of Commons, Mr Ainsworth held a series of senior frontbench roles, including shadow culture secretary and shadow environment secretary. Peter Ainsworth (front row, left) with David Cameron's shadow cabinet in 2006 Former Prime Minister David Cameron described him as ""a key driver of our modernising agenda in opposition, particularly our environmental policy"". ""It was an honour to have him in my shadow cabinet - he was also such a kind, generous and thoroughly decent man and will be greatly missed,"" added the former PM. Mr Ainsworth also served under ex-Conservative leader William Hague who described him as a ""most thoughtful, considerate and conscientious man"". Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said Mr Ainsworth was ""without doubt a genuinely lovely guy, who was well-liked across the House"". 'Like so many people we enjoy being around, he was taken too soon. My thoughts and prayers go out to his family."" Mr Ainsworth went on to be chairman of the Big Lottery Fund, which distributes cash to good causes, after leaving politics. He also served as chairman of trustees at the Churches Conservation Trust and the Heritage Alliance. Both organisations said Mr Ainsworth had been ""a passionate advocate for heritage"" who would be ""greatly missed"".

"Zachary Horwitz, also known as Zach Avery, is yet to play a major role in a Hollywood film An aspiring Hollywood actor has been accused of scamming millions from film investors by tricking them with fake Netflix deals to fund a lavish lifestyle. Zachary Horwitz, 34, was arrested on Tuesday by FBI agents on suspicion of running a $690m (Â£502m) Ponzi scheme. Mr Horwitz, whose stage name is Zach Avery, allegedly raised funds from investors for film licensing deals with Netflix and HBO that did not exist. He was charged with wire fraud. If convicted, he could be jailed for up to 20 years. The criminal complaint was filed by prosecutors and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday. HSBC moved Ponzi scheme millions despite warning How a woman scammed the world, then vanished Why are we fascinated by con artists? It accuses Mr Horwitz of using investor funds for ""lavish personal spending"", including extravagant trips to Las Vegas, flights on chartered jets, payments for high-end cars and the purchase of a $5.7m mansion in Los Angeles. ""We allege that Horwitz promised extremely high returns and made them seem plausible by invoking the names of two well-known entertainment companies and fabricating documents,"" Michele Wein Layne, a senior SEC official,said in a statement on Tuesday,external. As an actor, Mr Horwitz has not had the most illustrious career in Hollywood. Other than an uncredited part in Fury - a 2014 American war film starring Brad Pitt - Mr Horwitz has mostly appeared in low-budget films with mediocre ratings. A lawyer for Mr Horwitz, Anthony Pacheco, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. At first glance, Lucia's Grace - an Italian comedy released in 2018 - doesn't seem like a lucrative prospect for investors. In a largely scathing review,Variety magazine critic Jay Weissberg said,externalthe film ""can generously be called a pleasant comic bauble"", panning its script as lacking ""cohesion"" and trying too hard to be ""as blandly populist as possible"". The tone of the review is reflected in the film's 43% critics' ratingon the Rotten Tomatoes website,external. Still, with the backing of major streaming platforms, the film theoretically had potential to make money. At least that's what investors told prosecutors they were led to believe by Mr Horwitz. Mr Horwitz was arrested at his home in Beverlywood, Los Angeles From 2015, he promised investors that his company, 1inMM Capital LLC, would use their funds to buy the rights to distribute films in Latin America, Africa and New Zealand. Distribution deals had been struck with Netflix and HBO, Mr Horwitz allegedly told investors. Through these deals, backers were promised returns of at least 35% within a year. But in reality, 1inMM had no business relationship with either company, prosecutors say. Mr Horwitz allegedly showed investors fabricated agreements and emails regarding the purported deals with HBO and Netflix. ""I believed that if HBO was involved, my investment was safe,"" one investor was quoted as saying in the criminal complaint. At some points, Mr Horwitz was able to pay some investors, using funds raised from other investors to do so. But prosecutors say the scheme collapsed in 2019 when 1inMM Capital began defaulting on payments. The criminal complaint alleges Mr Horwitz ""deposited or transferred at least some investor funds to his personal bank accounts"". Some of the payments listed in the complaint include $691,800 to a celebrity interior decorator,  $165,408 for luxury cars, $137,072 for chartered jets flights and f $54,600 for a watch subscription service. At a court appearance on Tuesday, a judge set Mr Horwitz's bond, or bail, at $1m.

"The Philippines and Australia are the latest countries to limit the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in younger people It follows the UK regulator's announcement that the under-30s in the UK will receive an alternative over very rare blood clots The number of weekly coronavirus deaths in England and Wales has fallen by 92% from the second wave peak, the ONS says 712 deaths involving Covid-19 occurred in the week to 19 March, down from 8,945 weekly deaths in January Today's statistics see 53 further deaths recorded in the UK, and a further 3,030 new cases More than 500,000 vaccinations have been given in 24 hours - 408,396 of them were second jabs The number of people who have had both doses of a vaccine in the UK has now passed six million Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she'll be happy to have the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine next week The French Open tennis is being delayed by a week in the hope more fans can attend after France's lockdown Edited by George Bowden Thank you for joining us for coronavirus updates today. They were written by Alex Therrien, Becky Morton, George Wright, and Jennifer Meierhans, and edited by George Bowden and James Clarke. We will have more updates for you tomorrow, have a good evening. We're drawing our live coverage of today's coronavirus developments in the UK and around the world to a close, thanks for joining us. Here's a re-cap:  The African Union (AU) has dropped plans to secure coronavirus vaccines from the Serum Institute of India and is instead exploring options with the US drug maker, Johnson & Johnson. The head of Africa's Centres for Disease Control, John Nkengasong, says reliable supplies of vaccines were vital - and Indian restrictions on exports have complicated things for Africa. He says the AU has already signed a deal for up to 400 million single dose jabs from Johnson & Johnson. India's Serum Institute is licensed to make global supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab but Delhi has commandeered stocks to deal with surging infections. Nkengasong says the AU's decision has nothing to do with the possible link to blood clots in rare cases involving the AstraZeneca vaccine, which will still be supplied to Africa through the UN's Covax scheme. Restrictions preventing people in residential care over the age of 65 in England from taking trips outside the home appear to have been dropped from government guidance. John's Campaign, which fights for relatives to have better access to their loved ones while they are in care, launched a legal challenge last week over the rule. Campaigners branded the guidance ""discriminatory"" and spoke of their ""anger and heartbreak"" at being apart from loved ones who, despite being vaccinated, had ""no hope of visits out"". The ""visits out of care homes"" guidance on the government's website, that was updated on Wednesday, now has no reference to an age restriction. It is understood the change was not in response to any campaign, but part of the ongoing review of guidance. John's Campaign said it would ""continue to press"" the government to drop rules which mean anyone who leaves a care home must self-isolate for 14 days upon their return. The Scottish health secretary has told the BBC that her government ""made a mistake"" in failing to protect elderly people during the pandemic. In an interview for the podcastPolitical Thinking with Nick Robinson, Jeane Freeman says: ""We didnât take the right precautions to make sure that older people leaving hospital going into care homes were as safe as they could be and that was a mistake."" There have been more than 10,000 covid related deaths in Scotland, a third of which occurred in care homes. In the first wave of the pandemic, more than 1,300 elderly people were discharged from hospitals to care homes in Scotland before a testing regime was in place. The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross says the Scottish Governmentâs mistakes had âcost livesâ. Read morehere. The airshow usually attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators One of Europe's largest free annual airshows will be cancelled again this year due to the pandemic. The Sunderland Airshow - said to be Europe's biggest - was called off last year and will be postponed once more over Covid fears. Hundreds of thousands of people attend the three day event - which is normally held in July - with aircraft performing displays over the North Sea. Fiona Brown at Sunderland City Council said the news was ""disappointing"" but safety was ""paramount"". It follows the cancellation of the air show in Blackpool. Read morehere. Around one-in-five workers at older adult care homes in England have not received a first dose of coronavirus vaccine, new figures show. Data from NHS England shows that 78.9% of eligible staff had been given a first jab by 4 April - compared with 94.1% of eligible residents. This is up on the last set of figures which showed that by 14 February 69% of eligible staff at older adult care homes had received a first dose. NHS England sent out a survey,externalwith a deadline of 5 March ""to improve understanding of why some social care staff have
not come forward for vaccination"". Suggested reasons included concerns around fertility, side effects of the vaccine, the time taken to develop the vaccine and religious reasons. This video can not be played In the United States, a person's willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19 varies by religious affiliation. White evangelicals are the least likely demographic to get the vaccine, the Pew Research Centre has found. Psychologist Jamie Aten told BBC World News that for some people Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy could stem from political views or a sign of tribalism in the same way that some people refuse to wear masks. Rod Moore was ""always happy, joking around all the time"" More than 10,000 people in Scotland have now died with coronavirus.The BBC has written about some of those who have lost their lives. Rod Moore spent 40 years with the ambulance service, working as a technician, a paramedic, a trainer and then in managerial roles before returning to the front line and the job he loved. The football fan from Falkirk was married to Clare for 31 years and they had a son, Craig. ""He was my best friend, he was always happy, joking around all the time, he was so funny... he made me laugh every day,"" Clare told BBC Scotland. And he was so close to their son ""you wouldn't have got a sheet of paper between them"", she added. Although they were not able to see Rod for four weeks while he was treated in hospital for Covid, they we allowed one final visit to say goodbye before he died on 21 November, aged 63.

Killian NgalaBBC News, YaoundÃ© President Biya had given ""the high instruction"" that an investigation should be carried out Cameroon's President Paul Biya has ordered an investigation into the use of Covid-19 funds following allegations of financial embezzlement. Human Rights Watch raised concern last month about what it called the ""scant transparency"" in the management of funds, although transparency was a pre-condition for getting loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to tackle the pandemic. In April 2020, the health minister announced a $105m (Â£76m) response plan. The following month, the IMF approved a $256m emergency loan to help finance it. In October, it approved a further loan of $156m to finance the health system and help businesses and households affected by the pandemic. The IMF now wants accountability on the use of these funds. Some 5.5 million Covid rapid lateral flow tests were taken
in England in the week to March 31, according to the latest NHS Test and Trace
figures. That's down from 7.1 million in the previous week. By contrast, 996,728 laboratory (PCR) tests were conducted
in the same week.
It is the first week since the seven days to September 30 last year that fewer
than a million PCR tests have been carried out. Lateral flow tests give results within 30 minutes, while PCR
tests are processed in a laboratory. Everyone in England will be given access to two rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday. Investigations are taking place into whether cases of a rare type of blood clot are connected to the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. The link between the vaccine and these rare clots - known as CVSTs - is not yet proven but experts say evidence is ""firming up"". So how do the clots happen and how can you tell if you have one? Our health reporter Smitha Mundasad explains morehere. In the UK, those most at risk from Covid-19, including front-line health and social care staff and older people, were offered the vaccine first. The jab is now being offered to over-55s in England and Scotland, over-50s in Wales and over-45s in Northern Ireland, as well as over-16s with some underlying health conditions which increase their risk from the virus. After this, younger people will be vaccinated in order of age and the government says it is on track to offer all adults a first dose by the end of July.

Neil Astles died on Sunday, weeks after being vaccinated The sister of a man who died from a blood clot on the brain after having the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine says she ""strongly believes"" people should keep having the Covid jab. Neil Astles, 59, a solicitor from Warrington, Cheshire, died on Sunday. He was vaccinated on 17 March. Pharmacist Alison Astles told the BBC that doctors were ""99.9% sure"" the clot was due to the jab. But she said he was ""extraordinarily unlucky"" and the risk was ""very low"". On Wednesday, UK vaccine advisers recommended healthy under-30s in the UK should be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots.

The Maltby test site near Rotherham had to close early after staffcame under fire by ""local youths"", police say.

South Yorkshire Police say several youths have been identified and spoken to about recent attacks at the site. We've got more on this storyhere. For anyone not already prescribed aspirin by a doctor, Prof Beverly Hunt, medical director of Thrombosis UK, strongly advises against this. ""We know if you take aspirin and you don't need to take aspirin, the benefits aren't very good,"" she told the BBC. However, anyone who has already been prescribed aspirin by a doctor should continue to take it before their jab, says blood specialist Prof Adrian Newland. Anyone on anti-coagulant medicines (such as Warfarin) - or people who have clotting disorders - should speak to their doctors before having the jab, he says. They should also let vaccinators know about any blood thinning medications. We've answered more of your questions about the coronavirus vaccinehere. Bus services in England should return to pre-pandemic levels by Monday, according to industry body CPT. Passenger levels were at about 40% just before Easter, says CPT, which represents the bus and coach sector.

first time. Wuhan was the original epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.
There were more than 50,000 confirmed cases in the city, more than half of
Chinaâs total cases. People there spent 76 days in full lockdown in order to control
the outbreak. On 23 January 2020, Wuhan closed its borders and people were
ordered to stay within their homes. The city, which has a population of 11
million people, became a ghost town. But today, state media is full of footage showing the cityâs
streets returning to their former vitality. Praise is being given to people for
staying in their homes during a period of great uncertainty. The lockdown had a significant impact on peopleâs mental health. A psychology professor tells Xinhua: âWhen the epidemic was at its
worst, we answered more than 300 calls a day.â And other specialists have warned there needs to be continued
attention in the city with regards âfeelings of uncertainty, PTSD haunting
front-line medics, and discrimination against former Covid-19 patientsâ. Getting a coronavirus vaccine is safer than driving or cycling to work, a UK government scientific adviser says. Professor Stephen Reicher says having a Covid-19 jab is ""actually one of the safer things you do in the day"". The risk of developing a rare blood clot is about four people in a million who receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said. Prof Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, tells BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Something like 30 or 40 people drown in the bath every year, something like 1,000 people die falling down the stairs, something like 200 die from choking on their breakfast, and that's many, many more deaths than we get from these vaccines. ""So actually taking the vaccine is actually one of the safer things you do in the day, it's definitely safer than cycling or driving to work. So these are incredibly rare events."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Philippines and Australia are the latest countries to limit the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in younger people It follows the UK regulator's announcement that the under-30s in the UK will receive an alternative over very rare blood clots The number of weekly coronavirus deaths in England and Wales has fallen by 92% from the second wave peak, the ONS says 712 deaths involving Covid-19 occurred in the week to 19 March, down from 8,945 weekly deaths in January Today's statistics see 53 further deaths recorded in the UK, and a further 3,030 new cases More than 500,000 vaccinations have been given in 24 hours - 408,396 of them were second jabs The number of people who have had both doses of a vaccine in the UK has now passed six million Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she'll be happy to have the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine next week The French Open tennis is being delayed by a week in the hope more fans can attend after France's lockdown Edited by George Bowden Thank you for joining us for coronavirus updates today. They were written by Alex Therrien, Becky Morton, George Wright, and Jennifer Meierhans, and edited by George Bowden and James Clarke. We will have more updates for you tomorrow, have a good evening. We're drawing our live coverage of today's coronavirus developments in the UK and around the world to a close, thanks for joining us. Here's a re-cap:  The African Union (AU) has dropped plans to secure coronavirus vaccines from the Serum Institute of India and is instead exploring options with the US drug maker, Johnson & Johnson. The head of Africa's Centres for Disease Control, John Nkengasong, says reliable supplies of vaccines were vital - and Indian restrictions on exports have complicated things for Africa. He says the AU has already signed a deal for up to 400 million single dose jabs from Johnson & Johnson. India's Serum Institute is licensed to make global supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab but Delhi has commandeered stocks to deal with surging infections. Nkengasong says the AU's decision has nothing to do with the possible link to blood clots in rare cases involving the AstraZeneca vaccine, which will still be supplied to Africa through the UN's Covax scheme. Restrictions preventing people in residential care over the age of 65 in England from taking trips outside the home appear to have been dropped from government guidance. John's Campaign, which fights for relatives to have better access to their loved ones while they are in care, launched a legal challenge last week over the rule. Campaigners branded the guidance ""discriminatory"" and spoke of their ""anger and heartbreak"" at being apart from loved ones who, despite being vaccinated, had ""no hope of visits out"". The ""visits out of care homes"" guidance on the government's website, that was updated on Wednesday, now has no reference to an age restriction. It is understood the change was not in response to any campaign, but part of the ongoing review of guidance. John's Campaign said it would ""continue to press"" the government to drop rules which mean anyone who leaves a care home must self-isolate for 14 days upon their return. The Scottish health secretary has told the BBC that her government ""made a mistake"" in failing to protect elderly people during the pandemic. In an interview for the podcastPolitical Thinking with Nick Robinson, Jeane Freeman says: ""We didnât take the right precautions to make sure that older people leaving hospital going into care homes were as safe as they could be and that was a mistake."" There have been more than 10,000 covid related deaths in Scotland, a third of which occurred in care homes. In the first wave of the pandemic, more than 1,300 elderly people were discharged from hospitals to care homes in Scotland before a testing regime was in place. The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross says the Scottish Governmentâs mistakes had âcost livesâ. Read morehere. The airshow usually attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators One of Europe's largest free annual airshows will be cancelled again this year due to the pandemic. The Sunderland Airshow - said to be Europe's biggest - was called off last year and will be postponed once more over Covid fears. Hundreds of thousands of people attend the three day event - which is normally held in July - with aircraft performing displays over the North Sea. Fiona Brown at Sunderland City Council said the news was ""disappointing"" but safety was ""paramount"". It follows the cancellation of the air show in Blackpool. Read morehere. Around one-in-five workers at older adult care homes in England have not received a first dose of coronavirus vaccine, new figures show. Data from NHS England shows that 78.9% of eligible staff had been given a first jab by 4 April - compared with 94.1% of eligible residents. This is up on the last set of figures which showed that by 14 February 69% of eligible staff at older adult care homes had received a first dose. NHS England sent out a survey,externalwith a deadline of 5 March ""to improve understanding of why some social care staff have
not come forward for vaccination"". Suggested reasons included concerns around fertility, side effects of the vaccine, the time taken to develop the vaccine and religious reasons. This video can not be played In the United States, a person's willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19 varies by religious affiliation. White evangelicals are the least likely demographic to get the vaccine, the Pew Research Centre has found. Psychologist Jamie Aten told BBC World News that for some people Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy could stem from political views or a sign of tribalism in the same way that some people refuse to wear masks. Rod Moore was ""always happy, joking around all the time"" More than 10,000 people in Scotland have now died with coronavirus.The BBC has written about some of those who have lost their lives. Rod Moore spent 40 years with the ambulance service, working as a technician, a paramedic, a trainer and then in managerial roles before returning to the front line and the job he loved. The football fan from Falkirk was married to Clare for 31 years and they had a son, Craig. ""He was my best friend, he was always happy, joking around all the time, he was so funny... he made me laugh every day,"" Clare told BBC Scotland. And he was so close to their son ""you wouldn't have got a sheet of paper between them"", she added. Although they were not able to see Rod for four weeks while he was treated in hospital for Covid, they we allowed one final visit to say goodbye before he died on 21 November, aged 63.

Killian NgalaBBC News, YaoundÃ© President Biya had given ""the high instruction"" that an investigation should be carried out Cameroon's President Paul Biya has ordered an investigation into the use of Covid-19 funds following allegations of financial embezzlement. Human Rights Watch raised concern last month about what it called the ""scant transparency"" in the management of funds, although transparency was a pre-condition for getting loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to tackle the pandemic. In April 2020, the health minister announced a $105m (Â£76m) response plan. The following month, the IMF approved a $256m emergency loan to help finance it. In October, it approved a further loan of $156m to finance the health system and help businesses and households affected by the pandemic. The IMF now wants accountability on the use of these funds. Some 5.5 million Covid rapid lateral flow tests were taken
in England in the week to March 31, according to the latest NHS Test and Trace
figures. That's down from 7.1 million in the previous week. By contrast, 996,728 laboratory (PCR) tests were conducted
in the same week.
It is the first week since the seven days to September 30 last year that fewer
than a million PCR tests have been carried out. Lateral flow tests give results within 30 minutes, while PCR
tests are processed in a laboratory. Everyone in England will be given access to two rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday. Investigations are taking place into whether cases of a rare type of blood clot are connected to the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. The link between the vaccine and these rare clots - known as CVSTs - is not yet proven but experts say evidence is ""firming up"". So how do the clots happen and how can you tell if you have one? Our health reporter Smitha Mundasad explains morehere. In the UK, those most at risk from Covid-19, including front-line health and social care staff and older people, were offered the vaccine first. The jab is now being offered to over-55s in England and Scotland, over-50s in Wales and over-45s in Northern Ireland, as well as over-16s with some underlying health conditions which increase their risk from the virus. After this, younger people will be vaccinated in order of age and the government says it is on track to offer all adults a first dose by the end of July.

Caroline DaviesBBC transport correspondent Malta has proved popular over the weekend, according to EasyJet Several travel companies have reported increased bookings and interest in countries with strong Covid vaccination programmes. Tui said that week on week, it has seen bookings for Florida increase by 220%, Jamaica by 70% and Portugal by 200% . The firm's top three countries for bookings remain Greece, Spain and Turkey. EasyJet said that Malta - where 42% of adult have had a least one dose of a vaccine, according to the country's health minister - and Israel proved popular over the weekend. British Airways said it has seen increased in interest in trips to the US, Caribbean and UAE. You can read more about when we might be able to go on holiday abroadhere. Neil Astles died on Sunday, weeks after being vaccinated The sister of a man who died from a blood clot on the brain after having the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine says she ""strongly believes"" people should keep having the Covid jab. Neil Astles, 59, a solicitor from Warrington, Cheshire, died on Sunday. He was vaccinated on 17 March. Pharmacist Alison Astles told the BBC that doctors were ""99.9% sure"" the clot was due to the jab. But she said he was ""extraordinarily unlucky"" and the risk was ""very low"". On Wednesday, UK vaccine advisers recommended healthy under-30s in the UK should be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots.

The Maltby test site near Rotherham had to close early after staffcame under fire by ""local youths"", police say. Local MP Alexander Stafford has described the attack as ""an absolute disgrace"" and is calling for police to establish a base at the centre to deter criminals. South Yorkshire Police say several youths have been identified and spoken to about recent attacks at the site. We've got more on this storyhere. For anyone not already prescribed aspirin by a doctor, Prof Beverly Hunt, medical director of Thrombosis UK, strongly advises against this. ""We know if you take aspirin and you don't need to take aspirin, the benefits aren't very good,"" she told the BBC. However, anyone who has already been prescribed aspirin by a doctor should continue to take it before their jab, says blood specialist Prof Adrian Newland. Anyone on anti-coagulant medicines (such as Warfarin) - or people who have clotting disorders - should speak to their doctors before having the jab, he says. They should also let vaccinators know about any blood thinning medications. We've answered more of your questions about the coronavirus vaccinehere. Bus services in England should return to pre-pandemic levels by Monday, according to industry body CPT. Passenger levels were at about 40% just before Easter, says CPT, which represents the bus and coach sector. But companies are expecting more people to be travelling as lockdown measures ease further from 12 April, with shops and outdoor hospitality reopening. In Wales services are at 80% of normal levels, while in Scotland they are at 95%, according to CPT. A spokesman says: ""The industry will be closely monitoring passenger demand as restrictions ease to ensure that services are at a level that allows passengers to travel safely."" Read morehere.

"The gates of one of Belfast's so-called peace walls were prised open before being set alight Rioting in Belfast on Wednesday night was on a scale not seen in Northern Ireland for years, police have said. During several hours of violence, police officers were attacked, petrol bombs were thrown and a bus was burnt. Eight officers were injured at an interface between loyalist and nationalist areas in west Belfast. Senior police sources now say there was no evidence of UVF organisational involvement in last night's trouble in west Belfast. Earlier the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had suspected that individuals within the paramilitary group had encouraged some of the trouble. However, following the progress of an investigation, police are now satisfied the group and its leadership was not involved. This video can not be played Police officers were attacked, petrol bombs were thrown and a bus was burnt during rioting in Belfast Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive said it was ""gravely concerned"" by recent street violence and has called for calm to be restored. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also condemned the disorder. How Northern Ireland's violence unfolded Disorder on previous occasions - in south Belfast, Newtownabbey and Londonderry - has been connected to the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). More than 50 officers have been hurt in violence in several areas since the end of last month Earlier, PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said it was likely that paramilitary organisations were involved and had planned the rioting on Wednesday night. ""Last night was at a scale we haven't seen in Belfast or further afield in Northern Ireland for a number of years,"" he said. This video can not be played Youths attacked a bus which had been hijacked ""We are very, very lucky no-one was seriously injured or killed last night given in particular the large number of petrol bombs thrown."" Police officers were called in from other parts of Northern Ireland to help to deal with the rioting. LIVE: Reaction to wave of violence in Northern Ireland More than 50 officers have been hurt in violence in several areas since the end of last month. The bus driver whose double-decker was attacked and burned is ""very shaken by the incident but is physically unhurt"", according to the public transport provider Translink. The PSNI is concerned at the potential for further trouble in the days ahead. According to police, Wednesday night's trouble involved ""equally large numbers on both sides"" of the peaceline at Lanark Way. It is believed the PSNI will be paying close attention to interface areas and the risk of further clashes between communities. The activities of dissident Republicans are monitored as routine and the police are wary of any attempt to escalate the situation. Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts was asked at a press conference if he feared weapons could come on to the streets. ""Given the history of Northern Ireland, it is something always in the back of our minds,"" he said. This video can not be played Belfast rioting reaction: 'We're lucky there wasn't a fatality' Meanwhile, a group linked to the south Belfast UDA has issued a statement urging calm. ""The way forward must be through politics alone,"" the message from the Ulster Political Research Group read. ""Rioting, street disturbances and the destruction of property will not change what must be solved by our political representatives."" It cited the Irish Sea border and policing as the main problems. The group is associated with the Jackie McDonald, the man widely regarded as the UDA leader in south Belfast. The Loyalist Communities Council, an umbrella body which includes representatives of the UDA and UVF, was due to meet on Thursday. It has not issued any public statements since it published a letter it sent to Boris Johnson in March warning of the danger created by the Irish Sea Border. Some unionists have linked the violence in recent days to thedecision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to prosecute anyone who attended the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey in June 2020. It was attended by 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid-19 restrictions were in place. They have also linked it to simmeringloyalist tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal. In recent days10 people have been arrestedas a result of rioting by gangs of people, some as young as 13. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a statement, the White House said it was ""concerned by the violence in Northern Ireland"" and joined other leaders in their ""steadfast"" support of ""a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard won peace peace"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis travelled to Belfast on Thursday to meet political parties. Mr Lewis said he was aware of unionist concerns in recent months and he had been ""engaging and listening"" them. He denied that the UK government has abandoned unionists through the new Brexit arrangements. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer said the violence was ""completely unacceptable"" and he called on Mr Johnson to ""step up"" and ""show leadership"". The disorder at the Shankill and Springfield Road areas lasted for several hours Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin wrote on social media: ""Now is the time for the two governments and leaders on all sides to work together to defuse tensions and restore calm."" The taoiseach and prime minister spoke on Thursday afternoon. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told BBC News NI that political leaders need to come together to make a ""clear and strong statement that violence is not the answer"". ""This is a time for unity in the face of violence and concern across Northern Ireland in terms of what's been happening,"" he said. All of the main political parties in Northern Ireland have criticised the disorder but they are divided over its causes. What is behind the violence in Northern Ireland? However, after an emergency meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive, a joint statement was issued from ministers, saying they were ""gravely concerned"" by the recent disorder. ""Attacks on police officers, public services and communities are deplorable and they must stop,"" they said. A bus was hijacked and left to freewheel along a road before it was set on fire ""Destruction, violence and the threat of violence are completely unacceptable and unjustifiable, no matter what concerns may exist in communities. ""Those who would seek to use and abuse our children and young people to carry out these attacks have no place in our society."" The violence has been brought on by a combination of factors. Northern Ireland politics and bigger events like Brexit are all in play here but there is no single straightforward reason. There is a lot of fury over the attendance of Sinn FÃ©in politicians at a funeral of a former IRA leader last summer which appeared to blatantly flout Covid-19 rules. Sinn FÃ©in's most senior politicians, among long lines of former IRA members, walked through the streets behind a cortege at a time when many people missed attending funerals for their own loved ones. ""Republicans do what they like and get away with it"" has broadly become one of the narratives being used to justify trouble against the police. However there were also loyalist funerals which broke rules during the pandemic. Brexit has beencreating tension in loyalist communities for months, with the growing realisation over just how differently Northern Ireland is now being treated from the rest of the UK. Signs of anger over the new Irish Sea trade border are plastered on walls and lampposts in unionist and loyalist areas. Loyalists have been angered by the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland In these areas it feels that Boris Johnson has betrayed Northern Ireland and there is a backlash. But that isn't all - there are much more localised issues too. Loyalist paramilitaries have been subject to a series of raids and arrests for their criminal activities and police believe in some areas these are the figures in the background helping to encourage trouble. Unionist political leaders - including Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader and First Minister Arlene Foster - have said PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne should resign over the force's handling of the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey in June 2020. Last week a decision was madenot to prosecute senior Sinn FÃ©in members who attendedthe funeral. Mrs Foster tweeted on Thursday morning that she had spoken to Mr Byrne in the wake of the violence, as did Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald. The first minister had faced criticism for not speaking to the chief constable after the violence on previous days. Mr Byrne briefed both the Stormont executive and individual parties. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and the Alliance Party have accused unionist politicians of ramping up rhetoric in recent days by calling for Mr Byrne to stand down. Council workers cleared the debris from the peace wall gates on Thursday morning Mark Lindsay, the chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said removing the chief constable ""in the middle of a crisis"" would not be helpful, although he said there were ""serious issues that need to be addressed"". On Thursday the Northern Ireland Assemblywas recalled for politicians to consider a motion calling for an ""immediate and complete end"" to violence in loyalist areas. WATCH: Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History Mrs Foster said the violent scenes were unacceptable, and Northern Ireland is ""faced with a number of deep and significant political challenges in the time ahead, and collectively we must work through those challenges"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in said the violence in Belfast on Wednesday night was a ""dangerous escalation"" of events. Bus drivers hold a protest at Belfast City Hall in support for a colleague whose bus was burnt Meanwhile, Education Minister Peter Weir has confirmed the further reopening of some youth services in response to the violence. Mr Weir said it would apply in areas of ""heightened community tensions"". Did you witness the violence? Do you live in the area? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Online fashion group Asos has said the pandemic forced it to ""rip up the playbook"" as its young customers came to terms with being cooped up at home. Chief executive Nick Beighton said its 20-something core market normally bought clothes for going out. But the company's swift ""pivot"" to casual clothing paid off, with surging sales, profits and customer numbers. Asos added one and a half million customers in the past six months, giving it a total of 24.9 million. Sales rose 24% in the six months to 28 February, with profits jumping to Â£106.4m, up from Â£30.1m a year earlier. Mr Beighton told a conference call that under lockdown, there had been a greater emphasis on activewear, casual wear and beauty products. Asos had ""quickly pivoted the customer offer to meet demand"" in those areas, he said, with jersey tops and casual bottoms proving strong sellers. Mr Beighton said Asos was expecting a ""shift back to occasion wear"" as lockdown restrictions eased. This would begin with daywear, then evening wear, he said. ""During that time, flexibility will be vital for us,"" he added. Shoppers are returning fewer items, says Asos Asos said its integration ofTopshop and other Arcadia brands, which Asos bought in February, was ""progressing to plan"". As well as Topshop, Asos also acquired the Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands in a Â£295m deal, but not their network of about 70 shops. The company said its latest ""record results"" had been driven by ""exceptional execution"". In the UK, where Asos now has more than seven million customers, sales were particularly strong, climbing by 39%. As an online-only business, Asos is one of the few retailers that have benefited from lockdown. ""For a long, long time, e-commerce has been growing,"" Mr Beighton told the BBC. ""What we've seen over the last 12 months is a step-change in e-commerce as a mix of total sales. So we don't think this is a high point, e-commerce is here to stay, but it can sit happily alongside stores."" In the company's results statement, Mr Beighton said he was ""delighted"" with the ""exceptional first-half performance"". ""Looking ahead, while we are mindful of the short-term uncertainty and potential economic consequences of the continuing pandemic, we are confident in the momentum we have built and excited about delivering on our ambition of being the number one destination for fashion-loving 20-somethings."" Asos said it was still cautious about the outlook in the short term, because of uncertain economic prospects for its youthful target group. Risks included possible further Covid-19 peaks, as well as the timetable for the easing of global pandemic restrictions. However, it added that it was ""well positioned to capture demand for event-led product when lifestyles normalise"". Arlene Ewing, investment manager at Brewin Dolphin, said Asos had beaten analysts' expectations on profits. ""The business is in great shape, with cash on its balance sheet and the acquisition and integration of brands such as Topshop yet to be fully reflected in performance,"" she added. ""With greater geographical diversification and investment in customer fulfilment over the last year or so, Asos is in a very strong position - a fact demonstrated by the more than 400% increase to its share price since the start of the pandemic."" Asos confirmed that customers were still sending back fewer items than expected while coronavirus restrictions were in force, saying ""returns-related tailwinds in warehouse and distribution costs"" had given the firm a Â£48.5m boost. But Chloe Collins, senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said that a post-pandemic resurgence of occasion wear and going-out styles could mean that customers resumed their old practice of returning more clothes. She added: ""Though there is light at the end of the Covid-19 tunnel and Asos will be ready for increased demand for its more fashion-forward, dressy designs, shoppers' desire for more comfortable and versatile clothing is expected to be a long-term switch. ""Therefore, it should ensure that these styles retain a high presence on its social media platforms and that it showcases how items can be styled to suit multiple end uses."" Thousands of jobs at risk after Asos Arcadia deal Asos adds 3m customers as profits soar in pandemic Shoppers are returning fewer items, says Asos Asos to repay furlough cash as lockdown sales rise Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"Susan Lowe says she struggled to get pain relief medication for her mother, Sheila (pictured) Unpaid carers looking after terminally ill friends and relatives during the pandemic struggled to access pain relief, with some patients dying in unnecessary pain, a survey has found. The survey of 995 unpaid carers by Marie Curie also found people had difficulties getting personal care and respite nursing for loved ones. Figures show the number of people dying at home rose by 42% in the past year. The government said it had taken action to support unpaid carers. Nearly two-thirds of carers surveyed by the charity said their loved one did not get all the pain relief they needed when they were dying. Susan Lowe, from Solihull, cared for her mother Sheila before she died with bowel cancer in April last year, aged 74. She said caring for her mum during lockdown was hard as ""the system was just under so much pressure that we had to manage largely on our own"". Sheila Lowe with daughter Susan The public health worker says she struggled to get the right pain relief medication for her mother in her final weeks and spent hours travelling to different chemists. Susan, 50, told the BBC: ""My biggest regret is that my mum died in pain - more pain than she needed to be. She really wanted to be comfortable at the end. She knew she was dying. ""What she really wanted - and this is what she was assured would happen - was to be comfortable. She was told she would get the drugs that she needed for it to be as bearable as possible. ""I remember breaking down in tears a couple of times in the pharmacy when I was told the medication mum needed wasn't in stock."" Michele Chilvers, looked after her wife Terri, 49, who had been diagnosed with incurable bowel cancer. The 53-year-old, from Hull, struggled to get access to respite care due to support nursing staff being furloughed. She said: ""I was sleeping on the sofa for the last 10 days. Terri was very restless and very noisy and quite agitated so I didn't get much sleep. When I asked if I could have a night sitter, I was told they were going to try and get me one but this was difficult because by this point, we were in lockdown. ""They eventually got me two nights. And on the second night when the sitter arrived, I had to tell her Terri had died five minutes earlier. It was really lonely, and really hard."" Although she struggled to get enough respite care, Ms Chilvers, who works in a school as a head of year, stressed that she ""could not fault"" the nursing staff who treated her wife. Michele Chilvers (left) looked after her wife, Terri Hospices also experienced shortages of essential PPE, medicines, equipment and staff, separate research compiled by Marie Curie, the University of Cambridge, University of Hull and Kings College London says. It adds that palliative care was not classified as ""frontline NHS"" in the pandemic and as such it has been compromised. Marie Curie said that the past year has been a stress test for community-based palliative care in homes. ""Many people will not be able to forget the deaths we have experienced this last year and it is vital that the government, local health and social care leaders, and providers learn vital lessons from the pandemic,"" its chief executive, Matthew Reed, said. ""It's heartbreaking to see that people dying at home and their carers struggled behind closed doors. ""The government must now ensure that end of life care is seen as essential and not a forgotten after-thought ... no-one should be allowed to die in pain and without the essential care they need."" The charity is calling for the government to sustainably fund end-of-life care, with a particular emphasis on ensuring people dying at home always receive the support they need. The Office for National Statistics figures showed the number of those dying in their own homes rose by 42% in England, Scotland and Wales in the year to March 2021. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Unpaid carers continue to perform an incredibly important role and throughout the pandemic we have taken action to support them. ""This includes funding through a number of charities, tailored guidance, and ongoing work to help carers access the support they need, with many prioritised for vaccination.""

"The gates of one of Belfast's so-called peace walls were prised open before being set alight Rioting in Belfast on Wednesday night was on a scale not seen in Northern Ireland for years, police have said. During several hours of violence, police officers were attacked, petrol bombs were thrown and a bus was burnt. Eight officers were injured at an interface between loyalist and nationalist areas in west Belfast. Senior police sources now say there was no evidence of UVF organisational involvement in last night's trouble in west Belfast. Earlier the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) had suspected that individuals within the paramilitary group had encouraged some of the trouble. However, following the progress of an investigation, police are now satisfied the group and its leadership was not involved. This video can not be played Police officers were attacked, petrol bombs were thrown and a bus was burnt during rioting in Belfast Northern Ireland's power-sharing executive said it was ""gravely concerned"" by recent street violence and has called for calm to be restored. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also condemned the disorder. How Northern Ireland's violence unfolded Disorder on previous occasions - in south Belfast, Newtownabbey and Londonderry - has been connected to the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). More than 50 officers have been hurt in violence in several areas since the end of last month Earlier, PSNI Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts said it was likely that paramilitary organisations were involved and had planned the rioting on Wednesday night. ""Last night was at a scale we haven't seen in Belfast or further afield in Northern Ireland for a number of years,"" he said. This video can not be played Youths attacked a bus which had been hijacked ""We are very, very lucky no-one was seriously injured or killed last night given in particular the large number of petrol bombs thrown."" Police officers were called in from other parts of Northern Ireland to help to deal with the rioting. LIVE: Reaction to wave of violence in Northern Ireland More than 50 officers have been hurt in violence in several areas since the end of last month. The bus driver whose double-decker was attacked and burned is ""very shaken by the incident but is physically unhurt"", according to the public transport provider Translink. The PSNI is concerned at the potential for further trouble in the days ahead. According to police, Wednesday night's trouble involved ""equally large numbers on both sides"" of the peaceline at Lanark Way. It is believed the PSNI will be paying close attention to interface areas and the risk of further clashes between communities. The activities of dissident Republicans are monitored as routine and the police are wary of any attempt to escalate the situation. Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts was asked at a press conference if he feared weapons could come on to the streets. ""Given the history of Northern Ireland, it is something always in the back of our minds,"" he said. This video can not be played Belfast rioting reaction: 'We're lucky there wasn't a fatality' Meanwhile, a group linked to the south Belfast UDA has issued a statement urging calm. ""The way forward must be through politics alone,"" the message from the Ulster Political Research Group read. ""Rioting, street disturbances and the destruction of property will not change what must be solved by our political representatives."" It cited the Irish Sea border and policing as the main problems. The group is associated with the Jackie McDonald, the man widely regarded as the UDA leader in south Belfast. The Loyalist Communities Council, an umbrella body which includes representatives of the UDA and UVF, was due to meet on Thursday. It has not issued any public statements since it published a letter it sent to Boris Johnson in March warning of the danger created by the Irish Sea Border. Some unionists have linked the violence in recent days to thedecision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to prosecute anyone who attended the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey in June 2020. It was attended by 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid-19 restrictions were in place. They have also linked it to simmeringloyalist tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal. In recent days10 people have been arrestedas a result of rioting by gangs of people, some as young as 13. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a statement, the White House said it was ""concerned by the violence in Northern Ireland"" and joined other leaders in their ""steadfast"" support of ""a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard won peace peace"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis travelled to Belfast on Thursday to meet political parties. Mr Lewis said he was aware of unionist concerns in recent months and he had been ""engaging and listening"" them. He denied that the UK government has abandoned unionists through the new Brexit arrangements. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer said the violence was ""completely unacceptable"" and he called on Mr Johnson to ""step up"" and ""show leadership"". The disorder at the Shankill and Springfield Road areas lasted for several hours Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin wrote on social media: ""Now is the time for the two governments and leaders on all sides to work together to defuse tensions and restore calm."" The taoiseach and prime minister spoke on Thursday afternoon. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told BBC News NI that political leaders need to come together to make a ""clear and strong statement that violence is not the answer"". ""This is a time for unity in the face of violence and concern across Northern Ireland in terms of what's been happening,"" he said. All of the main political parties in Northern Ireland have criticised the disorder but they are divided over its causes. What is behind the violence in Northern Ireland? However, after an emergency meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive, a joint statement was issued from ministers, saying they were ""gravely concerned"" by the recent disorder. ""Attacks on police officers, public services and communities are deplorable and they must stop,"" they said. A bus was hijacked and left to freewheel along a road before it was set on fire ""Destruction, violence and the threat of violence are completely unacceptable and unjustifiable, no matter what concerns may exist in communities. ""Those who would seek to use and abuse our children and young people to carry out these attacks have no place in our society."" The violence has been brought on by a combination of factors. Northern Ireland politics and bigger events like Brexit are all in play here but there is no single straightforward reason. There is a lot of fury over the attendance of Sinn FÃ©in politicians at a funeral of a former IRA leader last summer which appeared to blatantly flout Covid-19 rules. Sinn FÃ©in's most senior politicians, among long lines of former IRA members, walked through the streets behind a cortege at a time when many people missed attending funerals for their own loved ones. ""Republicans do what they like and get away with it"" has broadly become one of the narratives being used to justify trouble against the police. However there were also loyalist funerals which broke rules during the pandemic. Brexit has beencreating tension in loyalist communities for months, with the growing realisation over just how differently Northern Ireland is now being treated from the rest of the UK. Signs of anger over the new Irish Sea trade border are plastered on walls and lampposts in unionist and loyalist areas. Loyalists have been angered by the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland In these areas it feels that Boris Johnson has betrayed Northern Ireland and there is a backlash. But that isn't all - there are much more localised issues too. Loyalist paramilitaries have been subject to a series of raids and arrests for their criminal activities and police believe in some areas these are the figures in the background helping to encourage trouble. Unionist political leaders - including Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader and First Minister Arlene Foster - have said PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne should resign over the force's handling of the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey in June 2020. Last week a decision was madenot to prosecute senior Sinn FÃ©in members who attendedthe funeral. Mrs Foster tweeted on Thursday morning that she had spoken to Mr Byrne in the wake of the violence, as did Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald. The first minister had faced criticism for not speaking to the chief constable after the violence on previous days. Mr Byrne briefed both the Stormont executive and individual parties. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and the Alliance Party have accused unionist politicians of ramping up rhetoric in recent days by calling for Mr Byrne to stand down. Council workers cleared the debris from the peace wall gates on Thursday morning Mark Lindsay, the chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said removing the chief constable ""in the middle of a crisis"" would not be helpful, although he said there were ""serious issues that need to be addressed"". On Thursday the Northern Ireland Assemblywas recalled for politicians to consider a motion calling for an ""immediate and complete end"" to violence in loyalist areas. WATCH: Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History Mrs Foster said the violent scenes were unacceptable, and Northern Ireland is ""faced with a number of deep and significant political challenges in the time ahead, and collectively we must work through those challenges"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in said the violence in Belfast on Wednesday night was a ""dangerous escalation"" of events. Bus drivers hold a protest at Belfast City Hall in support for a colleague whose bus was burnt Meanwhile, Education Minister Peter Weir has confirmed the further reopening of some youth services in response to the violence.

You can continue to follow updates on the BBC News NI website, on BBC Radio Ulster and on BBC Newsline at 22:30 BST on BBC One. We leave you with this upbeat image by a local artist. Goodnight. After another night of violence on Wednesday it was a busy day on the political scene in Northern Ireland. Jordan KennyBBC News NI Northern Ireland has seen 10 days of sporadic violence, with crowds of predominantly young people rioting in towns and cities almost nightly since the end of March. Armed with bricks, bars, fireworks and petrol bombs, people as young as 12 have attacked police in Londonderry, Belfast, Carrickfergus, Ballymena and Newtownabbey. BBC News NI charts how the violence has unfolded. To view the timeline,click here. Amy Gribbin works for Forthspring Inter Community Group which has been operating on the peace line since it was built in 1997. She told Evening Extra that the recent violence has been a ""massive step back"" for their cross-community work. ""Our youth project has been working very hard across the interface division to build strong and meaningful cross-community relationships,"" she said. ""Our young people have worked hard for the extensions of interface gate opening times to ensure they can access shared youth provision for longer but what happened last night and in the lead up may impact the possibility of the gates opening longer,"" she said. ""We're youth workers, we're not police, we're not armed or protected, we're going out in red coats with good intentions. She added that young people need to have a ""sense of pride and ownership in their community"" and a ""parental role plays another huge part."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin have spoken about the violence of recent nights in Northern Ireland. A statement from the Irish government said they stressed that violence is unacceptable and called for calm. A spokesperson added: ""The way forward is through dialogue and working the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. ""They agreed that the two Governments would continue to stay in contact.""  Green Party councillor Brian Smyth said the ""failure of politicians to address the root causes"" was to blame for the recent violence. ""How can you tell young people who believe they have nothing, no future, poor educational outcomes, unemployed and canât afford a bus into the city centre and youâre telling them they canât travel to America? [if they get a criminal record]"" he said. ""That's at the root of this and we are trying to communicate with young people who have little to no hope, trying to sell them a dream but thereâs no reality for that on the ground."" ""Itâs heartbreaking and the failure of politicians to address the root causes, poverty, inequality, poor health outcomes, poor educational outcomes, youth services stripped back - all they [young people] have known is austerity, they may not know what austerity means but theyâve lived through it,"" he said. ""Thereâs no investment, no hope."" Julian O'NeillBBC News NI Home Affairs Correspondent The Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) is suspected of involvement inthe worst night of rioting Northern Ireland has seen in years, according to police sources. It is said to have âencouragedâ the trouble at a Belfast
interface, although a loyalist source has disputed the police belief of UVF involvement. It means the fingerprints of both main loyalist paramilitary
groups are on separate incidents of street violence which have erupted since
last Friday. Disorder on previous occasions â in south Belfast,
Newtownabbey and Londonderry â is connected to the Ulster Defence Association (UDA). Enda McClaffertyBBC News NI political editor NI Secretary Brandon Lewis has denied that the UK government has abandoned unionists through the new Brexit arrangements. He was responding to concerns raised by loyalist community workers who said the new Irish Sea border created by the Northern Ireland protocol had left unionists feeling disconnected from the rest of the UK. It followed a night of rioting on Thursday at an interface in Belfast during which police were pelted with petrol bombs. Mr Lewis returned to Northern Ireland today to speak to political leaders and the police. Speaking to the BBC he denied the government had played a part in the unrest. âWe recognise the issues around identity and are working to make sure UK citizens in Northern Ireland have the same experience as UK citizens living in Great Britain,"" he said. He added that the government was working with the EU to address concerns raised over the protocol. He insisted there were a range of âcomplicatedâ issues which had been flagged up including criminal gangs, which according to the PSNI were behind much of the trouble in Northern Ireland this week. âWhatever the concerns, violence is not the answer,â he said He also welcomed the cross party condemnation of lasts night violence through a joint statement issued by the Northern Ireland Executive. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has said he is ""absolutely"" open to visiting the site of some of the worst violence Northern Ireland has seen in years. Mr Lewis landed in Northern Ireland for emergency talks with Stormont's main parties this afternoon. Asked by the BBC's Evening Extra programme if he would speak to people on the Shankill Road, he said: ""I have been talking to people in that community and community leaders already, so I am absolutely prepared to continue doing that. ""I'm really keen as well to see the EU play its part."" Asked to respond to comments he had been ""missing in action"" while violence erupted in Northern Ireland, he said he had been talking to political leaders and the Police Service of Northern Ireland ""over the past couple of days"". He said he was unaware of claims he had been ""missing."" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said she does not believe her attendance at Bobby Storey's funeral last summer has anything to do with the violence in recent days. Last week unionist politicians reacted with anger after the Public Prosecution Service said nobody who attended the funeral would be prosecuted over alleged breaches of Covid-19 regulations - including Ms O'Neill. Speaking to Evening Extra on BBC Radio Ulster she said: ""There's no justification whatsoever - and no equivocation in myself attending a funeral - for people attempting to murder a police officer and wreck their community. ""If people have issues with my attendance at a funeral there are avenues and ways which people can express concerns, we should not allow discontent with any situation to spill out into violence on our streets."" ""Iâm worried that any child thinks it's the right thing to do to go out and lift a petrol bomb and attack their community."" She said the PSNI had confirmed that organised criminal gangs were ""using young people to go out on the streets to carry out criminal activity detrimental to their community and to themselves. ""We must call on all young people not to be used and abused by these criminal gangs."" Some youth services will reopen after children joined in recent riots in Northern Ireland. Education Minister Peter Weir says it will apply in areas of unrest. In a statement this afternoon, he says the aim was to ""divert"" young people from becoming involved in violence. âAs a society we should all be appalled at witnessing young people and even children being involved in the recent violence on our streets. âAt this time it is even more important that youth services are able to meet the needs of young people in these areas.â It has been agreed that all youth centres and provisions in areas where there is heightened community tensions can maximise the use of their facilities and services with immediate effect. This includes educational visits and overnight stays when there is significant risk of harm or criminalisation of children and young people. A Shankill Road pastor said his ""heart sank"" seeing young children riot in the streets. Church of God pastor Stephen Reynolds, who is also chairman of Conway Youth Centre, said the young people involved were encouraged by ""sinister elements"" in the community. ""To think young children are out on the streets rioting, and throwing petrol bombs, bricks, all sorts of things like that, it was just heartbreaking,"" he said. ""This was something that we've known in the past, it's not something we want today or going forward for our children and young people, so my heart just sank when I saw it all. ""I think the main reason why they're getting involved in all this kind of activity is due to sinister elements within the community, who are encouraging them to get involved."" He says the violence forced some shops to close early and halted bus services and some food delivery vans were cancelled because of fears for workers' safety. Sir Keir Starmer says the violence witnessed in west Belfast was ""completely
unacceptable"" and calls on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to ""step
up"" and ""show leadership"". Speaking in an interview during a visit
to Bristol, the Labour leader says he is ""very concernedâ by the street violence
and believes âthe prime minister needs to convene all-party talks"". He adds: ""This is
about leadership and the prime minister can't be absent"". Sir Keir says ""everybody with responsibility, in and for Northern
Ireland, needs to condemn the violence in no uncertain terms"". A community worker in Londonderry says people on the ground have been working to ease tensions in the Waterside following repeated incidents of violence, but believes there has been a lack of political leadership. Brian Dougherty, who is from the North West Cultural Partnership, tells BBC Radio Foyle many unionists feel forgotten about. ""The leadership has raised a lot of questions within loyalism generally over how the protocol was handled and how it has manifested itself here now as well."" He adds: ""At a time when leadership is required, we are not seeing it at that elected level"". Mr Dougherty says ""more pressure"" is being put on community groups to take on that responsibility. Police responded to an incident in the Waterside on Monday where cars were set alight and surrounding roads blocked with fires In the latest incidents in Derry on Monday, petrol bombs were thrown at police and vehicles set alight in the Waterside. On Tuesday, PSNI district commander Darrin Jones said twelve officers were injured in the north west during seven nights of unrest, but all have since returned to work. There has never been so much anger toward a unionist party
than there is now directed at the DUP, a former Progressive Unionist Party councillor has said. Julie-Anne Corr-Johnston said there was a ""growing disconnect"" between unionism and its base. She said people were mislead about the consequences of Brexit - a charge echoed by formerNorthern Ireland Secretary Lord Hain on the same programme. She told the BBC: ""Violence can never ever be justified but it can be explained ""I have never experienced as much anger towards a party within
unionism then I have at this point in time towards the DUP.""  Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Eileen Weir, a community activist in Belfast, told Talkback that community workers on the ground are ""burnt out."" ""Theyâre dealing with the pandemic, now theyâre dealing with violence within the interfaces which is very sad but people in west and north Belfast are not our enemies, that is not where we should be taking our frustrations out,"" she said. ""We need the language coming from our political leaders be positive and forceful so the communities can get their trust back in their political leaders."" ""I was 15 when the troubles started and the propaganda within communities makes you get up and do something, that propaganda within communities is there and if youâre young and a teenager youâre going to act and react, which is wrong,"" she said. ""Let's get back to what the Good Friday Agreement was about, peaceful means, not to wreck their own communities and put more hardship on those areas already suffering."" Bus drivers gathered at Belfast City Hall earlier to protest the hijacking of a bus on the Shankill Road yesterday evening. Michael Dornan, chairman of the Unite Union for Metro bus drivers, said a crowd stopped the bus before crowding around it. ""They started pelting the bus with bricks etc, forced the doors open and then he and the passengers were allowed off and then they petrol-bombed the bus. ""It all happened within a matter of seconds. ""We're just lucky there wasn't a fatality there last night."" Michael HirstBBC News NI While there are no clear indications the unrest is being orchestrated by an organised group, the violence has been concentrated in areas where criminal gangs linked to loyalist paramilitaries have significant influence. Unionist leaders have linked the violence to simmeringloyalist tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal. The new trading border is the result of the Northern Ireland Protocol, introduced to avoid the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland. Some unionist leaders have also attributed the violence to the decision not to prosecute leaders of Sinn FÃ©in for breaching Covid regulationsat the funeral of a former IRA intelligence chief last June. There have been calls for the PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne to resign over the police's handling of Bobby Storey's funeral, however Mr Byrne has refused to step down. He says he is ""open to dialogue with anyone who is willing to work with me to resolve the issues facing our community"". Read morehere.

He adds that the people of Northern Ireland ""deserve better than a continuation of the violence and disorder that we have witnessed in recent days"". ""Those engaged in this destruction and disorder do not represent Northern Ireland."" He says the strength of the Good Friday Agreement lay in providing a framework for all communities, through mutual respect and tolerance, to live and work together.

The PSNI is concerned at the potential for further trouble in the days ahead. According to police, Wednesday night's trouble involved ""equally large numbers on both sides"" of the peaceline at Lanark Way. It is believed the PSNI will be paying close attention to interface areas and the risk of further clashes between communities. The activities of dissident Republicans are monitored as routine and the police are wary of any attempt to escalate the situation. Assistant Chief Constable Jonathan Roberts was asked at a press conference if he feared weapons could come on to the streets. ""Given the history of Northern Ireland, it is something always in the back of our minds,"" he said. This video can not be played Belfast rioting reaction: 'We're lucky there wasn't a fatality' Meanwhile, a group linked to the south Belfast UDA has issued a statement urging calm. ""The way forward must be through politics alone,"" the message from the Ulster Political Research Group read. ""Rioting, street disturbances and the destruction of property will not change what must be solved by our political representatives."" It cited the Irish Sea border and policing as the main problems. The group is associated with the Jackie McDonald, the man widely regarded as the UDA leader in south Belfast. The Loyalist Communities Council, an umbrella body which includes representatives of the UDA and UVF, was due to meet on Thursday. It has not issued any public statements since it published a letter it sent to Boris Johnson in March warning of the danger created by the Irish Sea Border. Some unionists have linked the violence in recent days to thedecision by the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) not to prosecute anyone who attended the funeral of former IRA man Bobby Storey in June 2020. It was attended by 2,000 mourners - including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill - at a time when Covid-19 restrictions were in place. They have also linked it to simmeringloyalist tensions over the Irish Sea border imposed as a result of the UK-EU Brexit deal. In recent days10 people have been arrestedas a result of rioting by gangs of people, some as young as 13. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""The way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a statement, the White House said it was ""concerned by the violence in Northern Ireland"" and joined other leaders in their ""steadfast"" support of ""a secure and prosperous Northern Ireland in which all communities have a voice and enjoy the gains of the hard won peace peace"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis travelled to Belfast on Thursday to meet political parties. Mr Lewis said he was aware of unionist concerns in recent months and he had been ""engaging and listening"" them. He denied that the UK government has abandoned unionists through the new Brexit arrangements. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer said the violence was ""completely unacceptable"" and he called on Mr Johnson to ""step up"" and ""show leadership"". The disorder at the Shankill and Springfield Road areas lasted for several hours Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin wrote on social media: ""Now is the time for the two governments and leaders on all sides to work together to defuse tensions and restore calm."" The taoiseach and prime minister spoke on Thursday afternoon. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told BBC News NI that political leaders need to come together to make a ""clear and strong statement that violence is not the answer"". ""This is a time for unity in the face of violence and concern across Northern Ireland in terms of what's been happening,"" he said. All of the main political parties in Northern Ireland have criticised the disorder but they are divided over its causes. What is behind the violence in Northern Ireland? However, after an emergency meeting of the Northern Ireland Executive, a joint statement was issued from ministers, saying they were ""gravely concerned"" by the recent disorder. ""Attacks on police officers, public services and communities are deplorable and they must stop,"" they said. A bus was hijacked and left to freewheel along a road before it was set on fire ""Destruction, violence and the threat of violence are completely unacceptable and unjustifiable, no matter what concerns may exist in communities. ""Those who would seek to use and abuse our children and young people to carry out these attacks have no place in our society."" The violence has been brought on by a combination of factors. Northern Ireland politics and bigger events like Brexit are all in play here but there is no single straightforward reason. There is a lot of fury over the attendance of Sinn FÃ©in politicians at a funeral of a former IRA leader last summer which appeared to blatantly flout Covid-19 rules. Sinn FÃ©in's most senior politicians, among long lines of former IRA members, walked through the streets behind a cortege at a time when many people missed attending funerals for their own loved ones. ""Republicans do what they like and get away with it"" has broadly become one of the narratives being used to justify trouble against the police. However there were also loyalist funerals which broke rules during the pandemic. Brexit has beencreating tension in loyalist communities for months, with the growing realisation over just how differently Northern Ireland is now being treated from the rest of the UK. Signs of anger over the new Irish Sea trade border are plastered on walls and lampposts in unionist and loyalist areas. Loyalists have been angered by the post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland In these areas it feels that Boris Johnson has betrayed Northern Ireland and there is a backlash. But that isn't all - there are much more localised issues too. Loyalist paramilitaries have been subject to a series of raids and arrests for their criminal activities and police believe in some areas these are the figures in the background helping to encourage trouble. Unionist political leaders - including Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader and First Minister Arlene Foster - have said PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne should resign over the force's handling of the funeral of senior republican Bobby Storey in June 2020. Last week a decision was madenot to prosecute senior Sinn FÃ©in members who attendedthe funeral. Mrs Foster tweeted on Thursday morning that she had spoken to Mr Byrne in the wake of the violence, as did Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald. The first minister had faced criticism for not speaking to the chief constable after the violence on previous days. Mr Byrne briefed both the Stormont executive and individual parties. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, and the Alliance Party have accused unionist politicians of ramping up rhetoric in recent days by calling for Mr Byrne to stand down. Council workers cleared the debris from the peace wall gates on Thursday morning Mark Lindsay, the chairman of the Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said removing the chief constable ""in the middle of a crisis"" would not be helpful, although he said there were ""serious issues that need to be addressed"". On Thursday the Northern Ireland Assemblywas recalled for politicians to consider a motion calling for an ""immediate and complete end"" to violence in loyalist areas. WATCH: Spotlight on the Troubles: A Secret History Mrs Foster said the violent scenes were unacceptable, and Northern Ireland is ""faced with a number of deep and significant political challenges in the time ahead, and collectively we must work through those challenges"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in said the violence in Belfast on Wednesday night was a ""dangerous escalation"" of events. Bus drivers hold a protest at Belfast City Hall in support for a colleague whose bus was burnt Meanwhile, Education Minister Peter Weir has confirmed the further reopening of some youth services in response to the violence. Mr Weir said it would apply in areas of ""heightened community tensions"". Did you witness the violence? Do you live in the area? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"The Philippines and Australia are the latest countries to limit the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in younger people It follows the UK regulator's announcement that the under-30s in the UK will receive an alternative over very rare blood clots The number of weekly coronavirus deaths in England and Wales has fallen by 92% from the second wave peak, the ONS says 712 deaths involving Covid-19 occurred in the week to 19 March, down from 8,945 weekly deaths in January Today's statistics see 53 further deaths recorded in the UK, and a further 3,030 new cases More than 500,000 vaccinations have been given in 24 hours - 408,396 of them were second jabs The number of people who have had both doses of a vaccine in the UK has now passed six million Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she'll be happy to have the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine next week The French Open tennis is being delayed by a week in the hope more fans can attend after France's lockdown Edited by George Bowden Thank you for joining us for coronavirus updates today. They were written by Alex Therrien, Becky Morton, George Wright, and Jennifer Meierhans, and edited by George Bowden and James Clarke. We will have more updates for you tomorrow, have a good evening. We're drawing our live coverage of today's coronavirus developments in the UK and around the world to a close, thanks for joining us. Here's a re-cap:  The African Union (AU) has dropped plans to secure coronavirus vaccines from the Serum Institute of India and is instead exploring options with the US drug maker, Johnson & Johnson. The head of Africa's Centres for Disease Control, John Nkengasong, says reliable supplies of vaccines were vital - and Indian restrictions on exports have complicated things for Africa. He says the AU has already signed a deal for up to 400 million single dose jabs from Johnson & Johnson. India's Serum Institute is licensed to make global supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab but Delhi has commandeered stocks to deal with surging infections. Nkengasong says the AU's decision has nothing to do with the possible link to blood clots in rare cases involving the AstraZeneca vaccine, which will still be supplied to Africa through the UN's Covax scheme. Restrictions preventing people in residential care over the age of 65 in England from taking trips outside the home appear to have been dropped from government guidance. John's Campaign, which fights for relatives to have better access to their loved ones while they are in care, launched a legal challenge last week over the rule. Campaigners branded the guidance ""discriminatory"" and spoke of their ""anger and heartbreak"" at being apart from loved ones who, despite being vaccinated, had ""no hope of visits out"". The ""visits out of care homes"" guidance on the government's website, that was updated on Wednesday, now has no reference to an age restriction. It is understood the change was not in response to any campaign, but part of the ongoing review of guidance. John's Campaign said it would ""continue to press"" the government to drop rules which mean anyone who leaves a care home must self-isolate for 14 days upon their return. The Scottish health secretary has told the BBC that her government ""made a mistake"" in failing to protect elderly people during the pandemic. In an interview for the podcastPolitical Thinking with Nick Robinson, Jeane Freeman says: ""We didnât take the right precautions to make sure that older people leaving hospital going into care homes were as safe as they could be and that was a mistake."" There have been more than 10,000 covid related deaths in Scotland, a third of which occurred in care homes. In the first wave of the pandemic, more than 1,300 elderly people were discharged from hospitals to care homes in Scotland before a testing regime was in place. The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross says the Scottish Governmentâs mistakes had âcost livesâ. Read morehere. The airshow usually attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators One of Europe's largest free annual airshows will be cancelled again this year due to the pandemic. The Sunderland Airshow - said to be Europe's biggest - was called off last year and will be postponed once more over Covid fears. Hundreds of thousands of people attend the three day event - which is normally held in July - with aircraft performing displays over the North Sea. Fiona Brown at Sunderland City Council said the news was ""disappointing"" but safety was ""paramount"". It follows the cancellation of the air show in Blackpool. Read morehere. Around one-in-five workers at older adult care homes in England have not received a first dose of coronavirus vaccine, new figures show. Data from NHS England shows that 78.9% of eligible staff had been given a first jab by 4 April - compared with 94.1% of eligible residents. This is up on the last set of figures which showed that by 14 February 69% of eligible staff at older adult care homes had received a first dose. NHS England sent out a survey,externalwith a deadline of 5 March ""to improve understanding of why some social care staff have
not come forward for vaccination"". Suggested reasons included concerns around fertility, side effects of the vaccine, the time taken to develop the vaccine and religious reasons. This video can not be played In the United States, a person's willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19 varies by religious affiliation. White evangelicals are the least likely demographic to get the vaccine, the Pew Research Centre has found. Psychologist Jamie Aten told BBC World News that for some people Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy could stem from political views or a sign of tribalism in the same way that some people refuse to wear masks. Rod Moore was ""always happy, joking around all the time"" More than 10,000 people in Scotland have now died with coronavirus.The BBC has written about some of those who have lost their lives. Rod Moore spent 40 years with the ambulance service, working as a technician, a paramedic, a trainer and then in managerial roles before returning to the front line and the job he loved. The football fan from Falkirk was married to Clare for 31 years and they had a son, Craig. ""He was my best friend, he was always happy, joking around all the time, he was so funny... he made me laugh every day,"" Clare told BBC Scotland. And he was so close to their son ""you wouldn't have got a sheet of paper between them"", she added. Although they were not able to see Rod for four weeks while he was treated in hospital for Covid, they we allowed one final visit to say goodbye before he died on 21 November, aged 63.

Killian NgalaBBC News, YaoundÃ© President Biya had given ""the high instruction"" that an investigation should be carried out Cameroon's President Paul Biya has ordered an investigation into the use of Covid-19 funds following allegations of financial embezzlement. Human Rights Watch raised concern last month about what it called the ""scant transparency"" in the management of funds, although transparency was a pre-condition for getting loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to tackle the pandemic. In April 2020, the health minister announced a $105m (Â£76m) response plan. The following month, the IMF approved a $256m emergency loan to help finance it. In October, it approved a further loan of $156m to finance the health system and help businesses and households affected by the pandemic. The IMF now wants accountability on the use of these funds. Some 5.5 million Covid rapid lateral flow tests were taken
in England in the week to March 31, according to the latest NHS Test and Trace
figures. That's down from 7.1 million in the previous week. By contrast, 996,728 laboratory (PCR) tests were conducted
in the same week.
It is the first week since the seven days to September 30 last year that fewer
than a million PCR tests have been carried out. Lateral flow tests give results within 30 minutes, while PCR
tests are processed in a laboratory. Everyone in England will be given access to two rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday. Investigations are taking place into whether cases of a rare type of blood clot are connected to the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. The link between the vaccine and these rare clots - known as CVSTs - is not yet proven but experts say evidence is ""firming up"". So how do the clots happen and how can you tell if you have one? Our health reporter Smitha Mundasad explains morehere. In the UK, those most at risk from Covid-19, including front-line health and social care staff and older people, were offered the vaccine first. The jab is now being offered to over-55s in England and Scotland, over-50s in Wales and over-45s in Northern Ireland, as well as over-16s with some underlying health conditions which increase their risk from the virus. After this, younger people will be vaccinated in order of age and the government says it is on track to offer all adults a first dose by the end of July.

Caroline DaviesBBC transport correspondent Malta has proved popular over the weekend, according to EasyJet Several travel companies have reported increased bookings and interest in countries with strong Covid vaccination programmes. Tui said that week on week, it has seen bookings for Florida increase by 220%, Jamaica by 70% and Portugal by 200% . The firm's top three countries for bookings remain Greece, Spain and Turkey. EasyJet said that Malta - where 42% of adult have had a least one dose of a vaccine, according to the country's health minister - and Israel proved popular over the weekend. British Airways said it has seen increased in interest in trips to the US, Caribbean and UAE. You can read more about when we might be able to go on holiday abroadhere. Neil Astles died on Sunday, weeks after being vaccinated The sister of a man who died from a blood clot on the brain after having the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine says she ""strongly believes"" people should keep having the Covid jab. Neil Astles, 59, a solicitor from Warrington, Cheshire, died on Sunday. He was vaccinated on 17 March. Pharmacist Alison Astles told the BBC that doctors were ""99.9% sure"" the clot was due to the jab. But she said he was ""extraordinarily unlucky"" and the risk was ""very low"". On Wednesday, UK vaccine advisers recommended healthy under-30s in the UK should be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots.

The Maltby test site near Rotherham had to close early after staffcame under fire by ""local youths"", police say. Local MP Alexander Stafford has described the attack as ""an absolute disgrace"" and is calling for police to establish a base at the centre to deter criminals. South Yorkshire Police say several youths have been identified and spoken to about recent attacks at the site. We've got more on this storyhere. For anyone not already prescribed aspirin by a doctor, Prof Beverly Hunt, medical director of Thrombosis UK, strongly advises against this. ""We know if you take aspirin and you don't need to take aspirin, the benefits aren't very good,"" she told the BBC. However, anyone who has already been prescribed aspirin by a doctor should continue to take it before their jab, says blood specialist Prof Adrian Newland. Anyone on anti-coagulant medicines (such as Warfarin) - or people who have clotting disorders - should speak to their doctors before having the jab, he says. They should also let vaccinators know about any blood thinning medications. We've answered more of your questions about the coronavirus vaccinehere. Bus services in England should return to pre-pandemic levels by Monday, according to industry body CPT. Passenger levels were at about 40% just before Easter, says CPT, which represents the bus and coach sector. But companies are expecting more people to be travelling as lockdown measures ease further from 12 April, with shops and outdoor hospitality reopening. In Wales services are at 80% of normal levels, while in Scotland they are at 95%, according to CPT. A spokesman says: ""The industry will be closely monitoring passenger demand as restrictions ease to ensure that services are at a level that allows passengers to travel safely."" Read morehere. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Vendors arrange vegetables in Wuhan today Today, people across China are marking a year since the central
city of Wuhan ended lockdown. For the Chinese people, this was one of the most powerful and
emotional moments of the countryâs Covid-19 outbreak. People today are
revisiting footage of a city clock tower striking midnight, symbolising that
the cityâs 11 million people were safe enough to leave their homes for the
first time. Wuhan was the original epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.
There were more than 50,000 confirmed cases in the city, more than half of
Chinaâs total cases. People there spent 76 days in full lockdown in order to control
the outbreak. On 23 January 2020, Wuhan closed its borders and people were
ordered to stay within their homes. The city, which has a population of 11
million people, became a ghost town. But today, state media is full of footage showing the cityâs
streets returning to their former vitality. Praise is being given to people for
staying in their homes during a period of great uncertainty. The lockdown had a significant impact on peopleâs mental health. A psychology professor tells Xinhua: âWhen the epidemic was at its
worst, we answered more than 300 calls a day.â And other specialists have warned there needs to be continued
attention in the city with regards âfeelings of uncertainty, PTSD haunting
front-line medics, and discrimination against former Covid-19 patientsâ. Getting a coronavirus vaccine is safer than driving or cycling to work, a UK government scientific adviser says. Professor Stephen Reicher says having a Covid-19 jab is ""actually one of the safer things you do in the day"". The risk of developing a rare blood clot is about four people in a million who receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said. Prof Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, tells BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Something like 30 or 40 people drown in the bath every year, something like 1,000 people die falling down the stairs, something like 200 die from choking on their breakfast, and that's many, many more deaths than we get from these vaccines. ""So actually taking the vaccine is actually one of the safer things you do in the day, it's definitely safer than cycling or driving to work. So these are incredibly rare events."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Neil Astles died on Sunday, weeks after being vaccinated The sister of a man who died from a blood clot on the brain after having the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine says she ""strongly believes"" people should keep having the Covid jab. Neil Astles, 59, a solicitor from Warrington, Cheshire, died on Sunday. He was vaccinated on 17 March. Pharmacist Alison Astles told the BBC that doctors were ""99.9% sure"" the clot was due to the jab. But she said he was ""extraordinarily unlucky"" and the risk was ""very low"". On Wednesday, UK vaccine advisers recommended healthy under-30s in the UK should be offered an alternative Covid vaccine to the AstraZeneca jab due to the evidence linking it to rare blood clots.

For anyone not already prescribed aspirin by a doctor, Prof Beverly Hunt, medical director of Thrombosis UK, strongly advises against this. ""We know if you take aspirin and you don't need to take aspirin, the benefits aren't very good,"" she told the BBC. However, anyone who has already been prescribed aspirin by a doctor should continue to take it before their jab, says blood specialist Prof Adrian Newland. Anyone on anti-coagulant medicines (such as Warfarin) - or people who have clotting disorders - should speak to their doctors before having the jab, he says. They should also let vaccinators know about any blood thinning medications. We've answered more of your questions about the coronavirus vaccinehere. Bus services in England should return to pre-pandemic levels by Monday, according to industry body CPT. Passenger levels were at about 40% just before Easter, says CPT, which represents the bus and coach sector. But companies are expecting more people to be travelling as lockdown measures ease further from 12 April, with shops and outdoor hospitality reopening. In Wales services are at 80% of normal levels, while in Scotland they are at 95%, according to CPT.

Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Vendors arrange vegetables in Wuhan today Today, people across China are marking a year since the central
city of Wuhan ended lockdown. For the Chinese people, this was one of the most powerful and
emotional moments of the countryâs Covid-19 outbreak. People today are
revisiting footage of a city clock tower striking midnight, symbolising that
the cityâs 11 million people were safe enough to leave their homes for the
first time. Wuhan was the original epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic.
There were more than 50,000 confirmed cases in the city, more than half of
Chinaâs total cases. People there spent 76 days in full lockdown in order to control
the outbreak. On 23 January 2020, Wuhan closed its borders and people were
ordered to stay within their homes. The city, which has a population of 11
million people, became a ghost town. But today, state media is full of footage showing the cityâs
streets returning to their former vitality. Praise is being given to people for
staying in their homes during a period of great uncertainty. The lockdown had a significant impact on peopleâs mental health. A psychology professor tells Xinhua: âWhen the epidemic was at its
worst, we answered more than 300 calls a day.â And other specialists have warned there needs to be continued
attention in the city with regards âfeelings of uncertainty, PTSD haunting
front-line medics, and discrimination against former Covid-19 patientsâ. Getting a coronavirus vaccine is safer than driving or cycling to work, a UK government scientific adviser says. Professor Stephen Reicher says having a Covid-19 jab is ""actually one of the safer things you do in the day"". The risk of developing a rare blood clot is about four people in a million who receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has said. Prof Reicher, a member of the Scientific Pandemic Insights Group on Behaviours, tells BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""Something like 30 or 40 people drown in the bath every year, something like 1,000 people die falling down the stairs, something like 200 die from choking on their breakfast, and that's many, many more deaths than we get from these vaccines. ""So actually taking the vaccine is actually one of the safer things you do in the day, it's definitely safer than cycling or driving to work. So these are incredibly rare events."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"This coat was advertised for Â£99 at Coast, left and Â£79 at Oasis Identical clothing was sold at different prices across Boohoo's brands due to a ""genuine mistake and not business practice"", the retailer says. The same coat was sold byDorothy Perkins at Â£55 and Coast at Â£89and the Coast item had the brand name cut off. Joanna Sikora ordered a skirt fromKaren Millen and found it had an Oasis labelwith that branding crossed out. Boohoo said it had not realised its companies had bought the same items and branded and priced them differently. It comes as the BBC was sent further examples of coats on the Oasis and Coast websites at different prices. Jess, who asked us not to use her last name, spotted the khaki coats pictured, which have since been removed from both sites. She said: ""You buy a brand in good faith that what you are getting is exclusive to the company. I initially assumed that the previous instances were a slight mix up, however after finding these myself I now realise that this is common practice in Boohoo. It doesn't speak well for the company if fooling the customer is their main method for turning a profit."" This coat was advertised at different prices on the Oasis website, left and Coast right Boohoo said these coats were part of an issue that arose when the coronavirus pandemic hit. The closure of non-essential stores to stop the spread of Covid sawthousands of High Street fashion chains shut their shops for good. Boohoo bought up the online businesses of some of the fashion brands that went into administration. Most recently, it boughtDorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton from Arcadia.It acquiredKaren Millen and Coast in August 2019. Retailers that were forced to close their doors cancelled their orders with suppliers, a statement from Boohoo said. These suppliers then offered products they had already made for sale to other retailers that were still trading, it said. Some of Boohoo's brands bought some of this excess stock to fill gaps in their ranges as clothing stock began to run down. ""Our mistake was not realising that some of our brands had purchased the same items from suppliers,"" the statement said. ""Therefore we failed to make sure prices were the same across our group of brands."" Boohoo said the problem affected ""about 10 lines out of thousands"", it was confident the issue was fixed and has apologised to customers. Boohoo and BoohooMan Coast Karen Millen Dorothy Perkins Warehouse Oasis Wallis Burton Debenhams PrettyLittleThing NastyGal MissPap It is not an offence for different retailers to sell the same item at different prices even if they are owned by the same company. But ""it could be misleading if consumers think they are buying a particular brand, when this is not the case,"" said Sylvia Rook, a lead officer from the Chartered Trading Standards institute. ""Consumers may expect that items from one retail outlet are superior to another, and therefore be willing to pay a premium for this,"" she said. A trader could be in breach of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 if an advert misleads consumers and causes them, either to make a purchase they would not have made, or to pay a higher price,"" she explained. Boohoo to probe price differences for same clothes Boohoo clothes pricing: 'I felt lied to' Boohoo slashes UK supplier network after Leicester failings Oli Townsend, assistant deals and features editor at MoneySavingExpert.com said irregular pricing was not unique to one group. In 2019, an MSE investigation foundshoppers were paying up to 34% more for the exact same item at Littlewoods compared to Very,external- even though both are owned by the same company. Mr Townsend said: ""There's a question of ethics when there's such a price disparity between retailers under the same parent company - especially when in some cases they may share the same warehouse, courier and returns department. ""These brands risk their customers feeling ripped off and losing trust in that brand."" He said MSE encouraged shoppers to do price comparisons online to make sure they were getting the best deal. ""But if some retailers are cutting off or obscuring the original brand name, it makes this difficult and puts consumers at a disadvantage,"" he said. Adam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said customers would ""understandably see this practice as dishonest"".

"The Philippines and Australia are the latest countries to limit the use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab in younger people It follows the UK regulator's announcement that the under-30s in the UK will receive an alternative over very rare blood clots The number of weekly coronavirus deaths in England and Wales has fallen by 92% from the second wave peak, the ONS says 712 deaths involving Covid-19 occurred in the week to 19 March, down from 8,945 weekly deaths in January Today's statistics see 53 further deaths recorded in the UK, and a further 3,030 new cases More than 500,000 vaccinations have been given in 24 hours - 408,396 of them were second jabs The number of people who have had both doses of a vaccine in the UK has now passed six million Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she'll be happy to have the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine next week The French Open tennis is being delayed by a week in the hope more fans can attend after France's lockdown Edited by George Bowden Thank you for joining us for coronavirus updates today. They were written by Alex Therrien, Becky Morton, George Wright, and Jennifer Meierhans, and edited by George Bowden and James Clarke. We will have more updates for you tomorrow, have a good evening. We're drawing our live coverage of today's coronavirus developments in the UK and around the world to a close, thanks for joining us. Here's a re-cap:  The African Union (AU) has dropped plans to secure coronavirus vaccines from the Serum Institute of India and is instead exploring options with the US drug maker, Johnson & Johnson. The head of Africa's Centres for Disease Control, John Nkengasong, says reliable supplies of vaccines were vital - and Indian restrictions on exports have complicated things for Africa. He says the AU has already signed a deal for up to 400 million single dose jabs from Johnson & Johnson. India's Serum Institute is licensed to make global supplies of the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab but Delhi has commandeered stocks to deal with surging infections. Nkengasong says the AU's decision has nothing to do with the possible link to blood clots in rare cases involving the AstraZeneca vaccine, which will still be supplied to Africa through the UN's Covax scheme. Restrictions preventing people in residential care over the age of 65 in England from taking trips outside the home appear to have been dropped from government guidance. John's Campaign, which fights for relatives to have better access to their loved ones while they are in care, launched a legal challenge last week over the rule. Campaigners branded the guidance ""discriminatory"" and spoke of their ""anger and heartbreak"" at being apart from loved ones who, despite being vaccinated, had ""no hope of visits out"". The ""visits out of care homes"" guidance on the government's website, that was updated on Wednesday, now has no reference to an age restriction. It is understood the change was not in response to any campaign, but part of the ongoing review of guidance. John's Campaign said it would ""continue to press"" the government to drop rules which mean anyone who leaves a care home must self-isolate for 14 days upon their return. The Scottish health secretary has told the BBC that her government ""made a mistake"" in failing to protect elderly people during the pandemic. In an interview for the podcastPolitical Thinking with Nick Robinson, Jeane Freeman says: ""We didnât take the right precautions to make sure that older people leaving hospital going into care homes were as safe as they could be and that was a mistake."" There have been more than 10,000 covid related deaths in Scotland, a third of which occurred in care homes. In the first wave of the pandemic, more than 1,300 elderly people were discharged from hospitals to care homes in Scotland before a testing regime was in place. The Scottish Conservative leader, Douglas Ross says the Scottish Governmentâs mistakes had âcost livesâ. Read morehere. The airshow usually attracts hundreds of thousands of spectators One of Europe's largest free annual airshows will be cancelled again this year due to the pandemic. The Sunderland Airshow - said to be Europe's biggest - was called off last year and will be postponed once more over Covid fears. Hundreds of thousands of people attend the three day event - which is normally held in July - with aircraft performing displays over the North Sea. Fiona Brown at Sunderland City Council said the news was ""disappointing"" but safety was ""paramount"". It follows the cancellation of the air show in Blackpool. Read morehere. Around one-in-five workers at older adult care homes in England have not received a first dose of coronavirus vaccine, new figures show. Data from NHS England shows that 78.9% of eligible staff had been given a first jab by 4 April - compared with 94.1% of eligible residents. This is up on the last set of figures which showed that by 14 February 69% of eligible staff at older adult care homes had received a first dose. NHS England sent out a survey,externalwith a deadline of 5 March ""to improve understanding of why some social care staff have
not come forward for vaccination"". Suggested reasons included concerns around fertility, side effects of the vaccine, the time taken to develop the vaccine and religious reasons. This video can not be played In the United States, a person's willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19 varies by religious affiliation. White evangelicals are the least likely demographic to get the vaccine, the Pew Research Centre has found. Psychologist Jamie Aten told BBC World News that for some people Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy could stem from political views or a sign of tribalism in the same way that some people refuse to wear masks. Rod Moore was ""always happy, joking around all the time"" More than 10,000 people in Scotland have now died with coronavirus.The BBC has written about some of those who have lost their lives. Rod Moore spent 40 years with the ambulance service, working as a technician, a paramedic, a trainer and then in managerial roles before returning to the front line and the job he loved. The football fan from Falkirk was married to Clare for 31 years and they had a son, Craig. ""He was my best friend, he was always happy, joking around all the time, he was so funny... he made me laugh every day,"" Clare told BBC Scotland. And he was so close to their son ""you wouldn't have got a sheet of paper between them"", she added. Although they were not able to see Rod for four weeks while he was treated in hospital for Covid, they we allowed one final visit to say goodbye before he died on 21 November, aged 63.

Killian NgalaBBC News, YaoundÃ© President Biya had given ""the high instruction"" that an investigation should be carried out Cameroon's President Paul Biya has ordered an investigation into the use of Covid-19 funds following allegations of financial embezzlement. Human Rights Watch raised concern last month about what it called the ""scant transparency"" in the management of funds, although transparency was a pre-condition for getting loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to tackle the pandemic. In April 2020, the health minister announced a $105m (Â£76m) response plan. The following month, the IMF approved a $256m emergency loan to help finance it. In October, it approved a further loan of $156m to finance the health system and help businesses and households affected by the pandemic. The IMF now wants accountability on the use of these funds. Some 5.5 million Covid rapid lateral flow tests were taken
in England in the week to March 31, according to the latest NHS Test and Trace
figures. That's down from 7.1 million in the previous week. By contrast, 996,728 laboratory (PCR) tests were conducted
in the same week.
It is the first week since the seven days to September 30 last year that fewer
than a million PCR tests have been carried out. Lateral flow tests give results within 30 minutes, while PCR
tests are processed in a laboratory. Everyone in England will be given access to two rapid coronavirus tests a week from Friday. Investigations are taking place into whether cases of a rare type of blood clot are connected to the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine. The link between the vaccine and these rare clots - known as CVSTs - is not yet proven but experts say evidence is ""firming up"". So how do the clots happen and how can you tell if you have one? Our health reporter Smitha Mundasad explains morehere. In the UK, those most at risk from Covid-19, including front-line health and social care staff and older people, were offered the vaccine first. The jab is now being offered to over-55s in England and Scotland, over-50s in Wales and over-45s in Northern Ireland, as well as over-16s with some underlying health conditions which increase their risk from the virus. After this, younger people will be vaccinated in order of age and the government says it is on track to offer all adults a first dose by the end of July.

"Bitcoin mining in China is so carbon intensive that it could threaten the country's emissions reduction targets, according to new research. China wants its emissions to peak in 2030, and has plans to be carbon neutral by 2060. The cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's ten largest cities, the study found.

China wants its emissions to peak in 2030, and has plans to be carbon neutral by 2060. The cryptocurrency's carbon footprint is as large as one of China's ten largest cities, the study found. China accounts for more than 75% of bitcoin mining around the world, researchers said. The study was written by academics from the University of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tsinghua University, Cornell University and the University of Surrey. It was published by the peer-reviewed journal Nature Communications. ""Without appropriate interventions and feasible policies, the intensive bitcoin blockchain operation in China can quickly grow as a threat that could potentially undermine the emission reduction effort taken place in the country,"" it warned. Tesla cars can be bought in Bitcoin Bitcoin surges past $60,000 for first time Buyer defends paying $2.9m for 'Mona Lisa' of tweets Some rural areas in China are popular among bitcoin miners, mainly due to the cheaper electricity prices and undeveloped land to house the servers. Miners play a dual role, effectively auditing bitcoin transactions in exchange for the opportunity to acquire the digital currency. The process requires enormous computing power, and in turn consumes huge amounts of energy. Already, bitcoin-related emissions in China exceed the total emissions of the Czech Republic and Qatar in 2016.

By 2024, China's bitcoin operations will exceed the total energy consumption of Italy and Saudi Arabia, and would rank 12th among nations. At its peak, it could account for about 5.41% of China's electricity generation emissions. The researchers said a carbon tax would be relatively ineffective for bitcoin, and suggested ""site regulation"" policies instead. The researchers said the ""attractive financial incentive of bitcoin mining"" has caused an arms race in dedicated mining hardware The price of the cryptocurrency surged during the pandemic, rising from $7,000 last April to pass $60,000 in March before hitting a period of volatility. Bitcoin's price increase was pushed higher by well-known companies adopting it as a method of payment, including electric carmaker Tesla. The Covid-19 pandemic also likely played a part, with more people shopping online and moving further away from physical currencies. Critics have long charged that in addition to its environmental impact, its main use is as a financial speculation tool rather than as a currency. They also worry that it is prone to market manipulation by a few large players.

"Susan Lowe says she struggled to get pain relief medication for her mother, Sheila (pictured) Unpaid carers looking after terminally ill friends and relatives during the pandemic struggled to access pain relief, with some patients dying in unnecessary pain, a survey has found. The survey of 995 unpaid carers by Marie Curie also found people had difficulties getting personal care and respite nursing for loved ones. Figures show the number of people dying at home rose by 42% in the past year. The government said it had taken action to support unpaid carers. Nearly two-thirds of carers surveyed by the charity said their loved one did not get all the pain relief they needed when they were dying. Susan Lowe, from Solihull, cared for her mother Sheila before she died with bowel cancer in April last year, aged 74. She said caring for her mum during lockdown was hard as ""the system was just under so much pressure that we had to manage largely on our own"". Sheila Lowe with daughter Susan The public health worker says she struggled to get the right pain relief medication for her mother in her final weeks and spent hours travelling to different chemists. Susan, 50, told the BBC: ""My biggest regret is that my mum died in pain - more pain than she needed to be. She really wanted to be comfortable at the end. She knew she was dying. ""What she really wanted - and this is what she was assured would happen - was to be comfortable. She was told she would get the drugs that she needed for it to be as bearable as possible. ""I remember breaking down in tears a couple of times in the pharmacy when I was told the medication mum needed wasn't in stock."" Michele Chilvers, looked after her wife Terri, 49, who had been diagnosed with incurable bowel cancer. The 53-year-old, from Hull, struggled to get access to respite care due to support nursing staff being furloughed. She said: ""I was sleeping on the sofa for the last 10 days. Terri was very restless and very noisy and quite agitated so I didn't get much sleep. When I asked if I could have a night sitter, I was told they were going to try and get me one but this was difficult because by this point, we were in lockdown. ""They eventually got me two nights. And on the second night when the sitter arrived, I had to tell her Terri had died five minutes earlier. It was really lonely, and really hard."" Although she struggled to get enough respite care, Ms Chilvers, who works in a school as a head of year, stressed that she ""could not fault"" the nursing staff who treated her wife. Michele Chilvers (left) looked after her wife, Terri Hospices also experienced shortages of essential PPE, medicines, equipment and staff, separate research compiled by Marie Curie, the University of Cambridge, University of Hull and Kings College London says. It adds that palliative care was not classified as ""frontline NHS"" in the pandemic and as such it has been compromised. Marie Curie said that the past year has been a stress test for community-based palliative care in homes. ""Many people will not be able to forget the deaths we have experienced this last year and it is vital that the government, local health and social care leaders, and providers learn vital lessons from the pandemic,"" its chief executive, Matthew Reed, said. ""It's heartbreaking to see that people dying at home and their carers struggled behind closed doors. ""The government must now ensure that end of life care is seen as essential and not a forgotten after-thought ... no-one should be allowed to die in pain and without the essential care they need."" The charity is calling for the government to sustainably fund end-of-life care, with a particular emphasis on ensuring people dying at home always receive the support they need. The Office for National Statistics figures showed the number of those dying in their own homes rose by 42% in England, Scotland and Wales in the year to March 2021. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Unpaid carers continue to perform an incredibly important role and throughout the pandemic we have taken action to support them. ""This includes funding through a number of charities, tailored guidance, and ongoing work to help carers access the support they need, with many prioritised for vaccination.""

"The number of shoppers visiting retail parks and essential shops in March shows consumers have missed bricks-and-mortar shops, says Springboard. The analyst predicts a 48% rise in sales when lockdown restrictions are lifted on 12 April. While footfall was still lower in March, the annual decline had halved in retail parks by the end of the month. Springboard said it indicated there was ""pent up demand"". Between the first and last weeks of March, shopping centres saw the decline in footfall move up from -69% to -62.5%, compared with the same period in 2019. Meanwhile, a -29.8% annual drop in footfall at retail parks shrank to -14.8% just before the Easter weekend. Retailers call for 'Shop Out to Help Out' scheme Shops in England can open until 10pm post-lockdown Retail sales stage partial recovery in February And during the four-day bank holiday, footfall in central London and other large British cities was three times greater than for the same period in March 2020, which was just after the first coronavirus lockdown began. Springboard says that the fact more consumers are visiting these locations to buy from those essential shops allowed to stay open indicates a ""pent up demand"" to make shopping decisions in person in bricks and mortar stores, rather than online. ""Footfall in UK retail destinations has increased from week to week for 10 of the past 11 weeks despite all but non-essential stores being closed,"" said Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard. ""This is the longest period of sustained increases in footfall since the lead up to the reopening of non-essential retail stores in June 2020 when footfall rose for a consecutive six weeks."" New window displays being created by staff at a store on Regent Street in London in preparation for reopening on 12 April Meanwhile, latest data from consultants PwC's Consumer Sentiment Index shows that consumer confidence is now at its highest level since the tracking of the data began in 2008. PwC says the figures show there are consumers with more disposable income and ""a pent up demand to spend after a year of lockdown restrictions"". It says a big reason for the optimism stems from the coronavirus vaccination rollout and the fact that people over 65 and many of those over 55 have already received their first jabs. The consultants added that it saw a ""never before seen"" jump in leisure-spending intentions, rising from -7% to -16% in February, to a positive 25-32% in April. ""Forced savings during lockdown have led to record levels of optimism and a number of 'firsts' such as all regions being positive since we started the survey in 2008,"" said PwC's consumer markets lead Lisa Hooker. ""Consumers have missed their favourite activities such as shopping, eating out and going on holiday and so there is ample opportunity, over the spring and into the summer, for operators to maximise this appetite to spend.""

"Beijing added 33 billionaires last year, according to Forbes Beijing is now home to more billionaires than any other city in the world, according to the latest Forbes' annual rich list. The Chinese capital added 33 billionaires last year and now hosts 100, said the business magazine. This narrowly beats New York City, which hosts 99 and has held the top ranking for the last seven years. China's quick containment of Covid-19, the rise of its technology firms and stock markets helped it gain top spot. Although Beijing now has more billionaires than the Big Apple, the combined net worth of New York City's billionaires remained US$80bn (Â£58bn) greater than that of their counterparts in Beijing. Chinaâs new richest person is a bottled water tycoon Kim Kardashian West joins billionaires' club Billionaire fortunes hit record high during pandemic Beijing's richest resident was Zhang Yiming, the founder of video-sharing app TikTok and chief executive of its parent firm ByteDance. He saw his net worth double to $35.6bn. In contrast, New York City's richest resident, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, had a fortune worth $59bn. China, along with the US, has seen its technology giants become even bigger during the pandemic as more people shopped online and looked for sources of entertainment. This saw the massive creation of personal wealth for the founders and shareholders of these tech titans. This video can not be played So what is Jeff Bezos going to do now? China, whose figure included Hong Kong and Macao in the Forbes count, added more billionaires to the list than any other country globally, with 210 newcomers. Half of China's new billionaires made their fortunes from manufacturing or technology ventures, including female billionaire Kate Wang, who made her money from e-cigarettes. With 698 billionaires, China is closing in on the US, which still leads with 724 billionaires. A record 493 newcomers joined the list globally last year, roughly one new billionaire every 17 hours, according to Forbes. India had the third-highest number of billionaires, with 140. In total, the 1,149 billionaires from Asia Pacific were worth $4.7tn, compared with the US billionaires' $4.4 tn. Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, remains the world's richest person for the fourth consecutive year. His net worth grew by $64bn to $177bn last year.
