"Jose Mourinho has shown off his rarely-seen skills on the pitch by starring in a charity football match for people affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. The Manchester United boss came on as a sub goalkeeper in the Game4Grenfell match between two teams of celebrities and ex-players at QPR's Loftus Road. His team lost 5-3 on penalties in the match, in which multiple Olympic gold medallist Sir Mo Farah scored a goal. At least 80 people died in the tower block blaze in west London on 14 June. Homeland's Damian Lewis played against former footballers Chris Sutton and Jamie Redknapp Sport stars, celebrities and former footballers all took part in the charity match Celebrities including actor Damian Lewis, Olly Murs and Wretch 32 featured in the game which saw two teams managed by Les Ferdinand and Alan Shearer battle it out at the stadium, just a mile from the tower block in North Kensington. All ticket money went to the Evening Standard's fund for those affected by the tragedy, although 2,000 complimentary tickets were given to survivors, their families, volunteers who helped in the aftermath of the blaze and the emergency services. Grenfell fire: Terms of reference published Notting Hill Carnival opens with doves released for Grenfell victims Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? During half-time, singers Rita Ora, Emeli Sande and Marcus Mumford entertained the crowd with a live performance. Singer Rita Ora performed during half time Mourinho, who previously managed Chelsea and still has a home in west London, made his entrance midway through the second half when he replaced former England goalkeeper David James to a noisy reception. Although he was the son of a professional goalkeeper in his native Portugal, Mourinho himself never played above the semi-professional level and was a midfielder. But the 54-year-old showed some useful touches between the posts, making a crucial early save as he battled to maintain his side's slender 2-1 lead at that stage of the match. In typically combative style, Mourinho was centre of attention for much of the time he was on the pitch - being booked for time-wasting, arguing the equalising goal was offside and even scoring a penalty in the shoot-out. Sir Mo Farah's team-mates did his trademark Mobot to celebrate the Olympian's goal Players from Team Shearer celebrate Trevor Sinclair's goal On the 80th minute mark, four Grenfell survivors and two firefighters who tackled the blaze came on together in a mass substitution and received the loudest reception of the day from the sell-out crowd at the 20,000-capacity stadium. The match went to penalties after it ended 2-2 with ex-QPR star Trevor Sinclair and Kasabian's Chris Edwards joining Sir Mo on the scoresheet. And despite Mourinho's best efforts, he was unable to prevent a defeat for his side as Olly Murs scored the winning goal during the penalty shoot-out. Grenfell survivor Paul Menacer said being given the chance to play in the match ""means the world to me"". ""We met people who want to talk and actually care about us. Someone as big as Jose Mourinho coming down and talking to us is just an amazing thing."" Jose Mourinho failed to stop any goals during the penalty shoot-out Grenfell volunteer Omar Salha, who also scored a penalty against the Manchester United boss, said he felt shivers of ""goose bumps"" when his goal went in. He said: ""He tried some mind tricks - I'm definitely going to play it back when I get home."" Speaking after the game, Mourinho joked that he had chosen to play as a goalkeeper so he didn't ""have to run so much"". Asked whether he enjoyed playing the role of the day's ""pantomime villain"", he said he wanted to bring ""something fun and different"" to the charity match.

"Two-year degrees could cut graduate debt, the report argues Universities have been accused of running a ""cartel"" and failing to offer enough two-year bachelor's degrees, by a right of centre think tank. The UK 2020 report argues that fast-track degrees could cut student debt. It is backed by Labour's Lord Adonis and Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, which offers two-year degrees. But the umbrella group Universities UK said uptake of existing two-year courses had been limited. And a spokesman pointed out thatofficial investigations,externalhave previously found that competition in the sector was largely working well. ""Several universities have been offering two-year, fast-track degrees for a number of years, but the demand from students has been limited under the current fees and loans system in England,"" said UUK in a statement. Plans toboost two-year degreeswere announced by Universities Minister Jo Johnson in February. TheUK 2020 report,external, co-authored by businessman and Leave.EU co-funder Richard Tice, says fast-track degrees could cut student debt, enhance choice and relieve pressured housing stocks. It argues that tuition fees, reaching Â£9,250 this year, have failed to deliver real choice or competition for students in England and describes mounting student anger about debt and interest rates as a ""timebomb"" beneath the system. It says most universities charge the maximum fees allowed and have acted as a cartel to slow reforms and freeze out private sector competition. ""Price competition is the area where most notoriously the universities have failed to deliver,"" says the report. ""In the long term, smarter ways of funding students will have to be found."" The authors argue that students promised a better experience by the increase in tuition fees were ""sold a lie"", while vice-chancellors with massive pay packets are the biggest beneficiaries. The report estimates that two-year degrees could reduce individual graduate debt by up to Â£20,000, with major savings in accommodation costs. Mr Tice said complaints of poor value for money from friends who were parents of university students prompted him to write the report. ""Investigating the truth behind these stories has shocked me, the powerful university cartel, interwoven with parts of the establishment care lots about money and little about students."" Lord Adonis, in a joint foreword with Conservative MP and UK 2020 chairman Owen Paterson, said: ""It is not often that politicians from such different parts of the spectrum come together on a major question of such national importance. ""But we are united in our desire to find a solution to the crisis in how students and universities are funded."" Sir Anthony said the report did ""an excellent service in channelling the debate on higher education towards the contemporary structure and its antiquated provision"". In its statement, Universities UK said it expected three-year undergraduate degrees to remain the preferred option for many students. ""But if changes can be made to the funding and fees system in England that help increase the flexibility of provision and are in the interest of students, this is a good thing."" Chris Husbands, vice-chancellor of Sheffield Hallam University, added: ""Two-year degrees may make financial sense for some students. ""However, due to the compressed nature of a two-year degree there would be a significant reduction in opportunities for students to do part-time and vacation work which many students from lower or average income households rely on to help fund their university life. ""It is also less likely that a student would have the opportunity to carry out work placements or work-based learning in their chosen subject or area of study. ""This means their skills and readiness for the workplace could suffer as part of a two-year degree. ""The real need is for a funding regime which encourages more part-time study and study alongside work.""

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""As tough as this was, it's been a wonderful thing"" US President Donald Trump has praised the relief response to Hurricane Harvey on his second visit to flood-hit states. ""Things are working out well,"" he said of the efforts, as he and wife Melania met victims and volunteers in Texas. ""As tough as this was, it's been a wonderful thing,"" he added. ""I think even for the country to watch and for the world to watch."" The devastating hurricane made landfall in the state a week ago. Some residents have been allowed to return to their homes but flood waters are still rising in other areas. Harvey has been blamed for at least 47 deaths, and about 43,000 people are currently housed in shelters. President Trump and the first lady visited Texas earlier in the week but stayed clear of the disaster zone, saying they did not want to divert resources from rescue work. However, the president was criticised for not meeting victims of the flooding and for focusing largely on the logistics of the government response. Uninsured and anxious, victims return home How hard has Harvey hit the local economy? Visiting Texas again on Saturday, Mr and Mrs Trump made a point of meeting flood survivors and volunteers in Houston. They took part in food distribution at a shelter, handing out packed lunches, and posed for photographs with victims when they requested it. During a tour of a shelter, the president said: ""I think people appreciate what's been done. It's been done very efficiently, very well, and that's what we want. We've very happy with the way things are going. A lot of love. There's a lot of love."" The president and his wife then travelled to Lake Charles, Louisiana, which also suffered flash floods, before flying back to Washington. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump greeted children at a centre for flood survivors in Houston Amid the destruction, stories have been shared of people opening their homes and businesses to others, andforming human chainsto save people from treacherous rising waters. However, many are also now returning to destroyed homeswithout the insurance to fix them. Experts estimate that only about 20% of those in Houston's worst hit areas have flood insurance. This video can not be played Flood victims have been returning to inspect the damage Mr Trump has asked Congress for $7.8bn (Â£6bn) as an initial payment to help with recovery efforts following the flooding in both Texas and Louisiana, which has also hit production at America's main petrol and oil refining centre. The White House said on Saturday that the president had authorised an increase in the level of federal funding available for debris removal and emergency protective measures. Governor of Texas Greg Abbott has said the state may need more than $125bn in aid. The president has declared Sunday a ""National Day of Prayer,external"" for victims of Hurricane Harvey. Administration officials say there will be further requests for funds when the full impact of Hurricane Harvey becomes known. Harvey dumped an estimated 20 trillion gallons of rain on the Houston area. Why was Houston not evacuated? Hurricane Harvey: The climate link Governor Abbott has warned that the recovery programme will be a ""multi-year project"". ""This is going to be a massive, massive clean-up process,"" he told ABC News. The Environmental Protection Agency has warned that floodwater can contain bacteria and other contaminants from overflowing sewers. It said the biggest threat to public health was access to safe drinking water. Authorities in flood-hit Orange County, east of Beaumont, imposed a curfew on Saturday night to give its residents ""peace of mind"", officials said. Looting in Houston earlier in the week led to a curfew being implemented. This video can not be played Man plays piano in flooded Texas home - footage courtesy of Greg Aylor Thousands of homes and businesses remain without power, and many schools are expected to remain closed in the coming days. Meanwhile, the Houston Astros, the city's Major League Baseball team, returned home to take on the New York Mets on Saturday. Tributes were paid to those killed ahead of the game. The team abandoned their home stadium this week, playing three games in Florida against the Texas Rangers.

"This video can not be played People in intensive care and premature babies were the first to be moved Patients at hospitals in Frankfurt have been moved to prepare for the controlled explosion of a huge bomb left over from World War Two. The 1.4 tonne British bomb, found on a building site on Wednesday, will be made safe on Sunday. About 65,000 people must leave their homes and police have said they will imprison anyone who refuses to go. It is Germany's biggest post-war evacuation. A smaller one took place on Saturday in Koblenz. In the city 110km (68 miles) west of Frankfurt, 22,000 people had to leave their homes for four hours while experts disposed of a World War Two bomb that had been found during preparations for building a new kindergarten. Thousands of unexploded bombs from the war are still found in Germany every year. Last month a kindergarten was evacuated after the teacher found an unexploded World War Two bomb on a shelf. Police said a child had found it on a woodland walk and brought it inside. How much of a threat are unexploded bombs? A councillor in Frankfurt, which is Germany's financial hub, told Reuters news agency that more than 100 patients from two hospitals were moved on Saturday. He said they included premature babies and people in intensive care. The fire brigadetweeted,external(in German) that 500 more would be moved from care homes early on Sunday. Fire and police chiefs in the city warned that an uncontrolled explosion of the HC 4000 bomb would be powerful enough to flatten an entire street. The site where the bomb is waiting for explosion has become a draw for locals and tourists The operation will take at least 12 hours and evacuees will have to leave their homes by 08:00 local time (06:00 GMT). Police helicopters will carry heat detecting cameras to detect anyone who had not left the area before the bomb disposal experts begin their task. Police also said they would guard empty houses and apartments from burglars. The evacuation area includes 20 retirement homes, an opera house, and Germany's central bank where half the country's gold reserves are stored. The city has opened shelters for evacuees to spend the day, and most museums are opening their doors for free. An average of about 2,000 tonnes of unexploded ordnance are found each year in Germany. It's estimated that about half the 2.7 million tonnes of bombs dropped by Allied powers during World War Two landed on German soil (compared to about 74,000 tonnes of bombs dropped on the UK by Germany). Many of the bombs were equipped with malfunctioning time-delay fuses, and many never went off. Adding to the problem are Russian artillery shells, German hand grenades and tank mines, as well as Russian munitions from training facilities in post-war East Germany. The problem is so widespread that Germany has a bomb-disposal unit, the Kampfmittelbeseitigungsdienst (KMBD), dedicated to the problem. Its technicians are among the busiest in the world, deactivating a bomb every two weeks or so - and they estimate their work will continue for decades to come. Dozens of bomb-disposal technicians and hundreds of civilians died from uncontrolled explosions in the decades following the war. The rate of fatalities has slowed since, with 11 technicians said to have been killed in Germany since 2000. But experts warn that the devices that remain could be getting more unstable as the munitions age and their fuses grow more brittle, and as bombs are discovered in more built-up, harder-to-reach areas. The problem is also worse in certain parts of Germany. Oranienburg, just outside Berlin, has the dubious distinction of being the ""most dangerous town in Germany"". Under Adolf Hitler, it contained an armaments hub, aircraft plant, railway junction and a nuclear research facility - so it was a key target for the Allies, who gave it an aerial pounding. Almost 200 bombs have been defused in the town since the end of the war, and residents are well-drilled in the evacuation procedure. But with experts estimating that some 350-400 bombs remain buried, the task is far from complete.

"It is 250 years since America's Mason-Dixon Line was completed. Hailed as a groundbreaking technical achievement, it came to symbolise the border between the Civil War North and South, separating free Pennsylvania from slave-owning Maryland. But who were the two British men who created it? ""It was the equivalent of the moon landings today,"" according to Mason-Dixon Line expert David Thaler. Baker's son Charles Mason and lapsed Quaker Jeremiah Dixon were established scientists when commissioned to settle a land dispute in the pre-revolutionary America of 1763. For 80 years the Calvert family of Maryland and the Penns of Pennsylvania had been locked in a bloody dispute over the boundary between the two colonies they had been granted by the English Crown. ""The stakes were very high,"" said Mr Thaler, trustee of the Maryland Historical Society in Baltimore and an expert on the Mason-Dixon project. ""There was about 4,000 sq miles of territory that was in dispute and nobody knew who to pay taxes to. Warfare regularly broke out along the border."" No portraits of either man remain, but US artist Adrian Martinez produced this interpretation of how Mason, seated left, and Dixon, also seated, might have looked during the project Outdated maps meant fresh measurements were needed, but colonial surveyors had proved inaccurate. So the families hired Mason and Dixon, who were known in England as master surveyors and astronomers. The Mason-Dixon Line was drawn in two parts. An 83-mile (133.5km) north-south divide between Maryland and Delaware and the more recognised 233-mile (375km) west to east divide between Pennsylvania and Maryland, stretching from just south of Philadelphia to what is now West Virginia. Mr Thaler said: ""This was the most outstanding scientific and engineering achievement, not only of its day, but of theAmerican Enlightenment,external. ""It was so advanced for its time. The brains were the best and the technology was the best."" Mason and Dixon brought with them some of the most advanced surveying equipment of the day, including tools by renownedinstrument maker John Bird,,externalwho, like Dixon, hailed from County Durham. This video can not be played Mason-Dixon Line accuracy hailed as 'extraordinary' ""The map they produced is one of the most important historical documents we have here in America. It's almost the equivalent of the Declaration of Independence,"" added Mr Thaler. ""The accuracy is so extraordinary that even today it continues to astound. It represents the firstgeodetic survey,externalin the New World."" Miner's son Dixon from Cockfield, near Bishop Auckland, and Mason, from Oakridge Lynch, near Stroud in Gloucestershire, originally came together in 1761 to mapthe Transit of Venus- making it easier to calculate the Earth's distance from the Sun. It would take them almost five years - lugging their equipment across hundreds of miles of wilderness - to complete the survey and cement their place in the timeline of the United States. Yet despite their groundbreaking achievement, both ended up in unmarked graves thousands of miles apart and remain virtually unknown in their home country. Milestones were marked with M for Maryland and P for Pennsylvania Dixon's great-great-great-great-great-nephew, John Dixon, still lives in County Durham and is proud of his connection to a ""marvellous man"" who was of ""great significance"" in his lifetime. ""Jeremiah was a Quaker and from a mining family. He showed a talent early on for maths and then surveying. ""He went down to London to be taken on by the Royal Society, just at a time when his social life was getting a bit out of hand. ""He was a bit of a lad by all accounts, not your typical Quaker, and never married. ""He enjoyed socialising and carousing and was actually expelled from the Quakers for his drinking and keeping loose company."" This video can not be played Jeremiah Dixon relative reveals rift with Quakers An entry in the Quaker minute book of Raby in County Durham, dated October 1760, reads: ""Jery Dixon, son of George and Mary Dixon of Cockfield, disowned for drinking to excess."" Mr Dixon added: ""Nevertheless, it's marvellous to be connected to such a prominent man."" Mason's early life was more sedate by comparison. At the age of 28 he was taken on by the Royal Observatory in Greenwich as an assistant. Noted as a ""meticulous observer of nature and geography"" he later became a fellow of the Royal Society. Mason chronicled his arrival in Philadelphia in his journal Mason and Dixon signed a contract to begin the survey in 1763 ""Not too much is known about his younger days, but we know his family was not terribly well off and that they ran a baking business,"" said Royal Society librarian Keith Moore. ""He had a school education, but didn't go to university. However, he did have some local connections and knewJames Bradley,external, who was a very famous astronomer and also from Gloucestershire. ""Bradley got him a job at the Royal Observatory, which is really the start of his career as an astronomer and surveyor. ""While at the Royal Society, he was asked to undertake Transit of Venus observations and recruited Dixon as his assistant."" This video can not be played Star observations were used to measure the Mason-Dixon Line The pair arrived in Philadelphia to begin work in November 1763. They used Bird's instruments to calculate their path by the stars and had to combat hostile Native Americans, mountains, dense forest, rivers and wild animals. Limestone markers measuring up to 5ft (1.5m) high - quarried and transported from England - were placed at every mile and marked with a P for Pennsylvania and M for Maryland on each side. So-called Crown stones were positioned every five miles and engraved with the Penn family's coat of arms on one side and the Calvert family's on the other. ""No-one really knows why the stones were shipped from England,"" said Todd Babcock, of the Mason and Dixon Line Preservation Partnership. ""But we know there were nearly 400 of them."" He added: ""At the time all Mason and Dixon had in front of them was wilderness. ""There were some settlements, but west of the Susquehanna River and approaching the Allegheny Mountains there were very few roads. It was all mature forest so they had to come through and cut a vista about 30ft wide. ""That required axe-men to cut down the trees, pack mule drivers to get the trees out of the way as well as cows for milk, chain carriers, instrument bearers and tent bearers. It was like a small army moving through the woods. ""They started off with a crew of five, but by the time they got towards the end of the survey the party had grown to about 115. ""When they came into this I think they thought it would take a year or two, but it ended up taking five."" Yet while their achievement has been rightly hailed, modern technology has shown the line was not as accurate as Mason and Dixon thought. It took Mason and Dixon five years to complete their survey Adrian Martinex also imagined Mason and Dixon visiting a Pennsylvania tavern with some of their party a year into the survey Crown stones were placed at five-mile intervals along the line Mr Babcock said: ""They thought at the end of the survey that the stones were accurate to within 50ft of where they should be. But what we're finding is that some of them are as much as 900ft off the intended line of latitude. ""Using modern GPS equipment we found they progressively went to the south and then started to come back to the north. The reason for that is not because they were inaccurate or because the equipment was faulty. It was actually gravity. ""Gravity had an impact on the plumb bob they were using. They had a 6ft telescope and it used a plumb bob on a fine wire to set it to true zero so they could measure directly overhead. But gravity varied from location to location because of the influence of things like mountains. ""We have found there was a direct correlation between the local variations in gravity and how far north or south of the line they were. ""The distances between the stones is supposed to be a mile, but what we're finding is that they are anything up to 15ft longer than a mile in places. ""That said, the idea of trying to stay on a line of latitude for 230 miles through the wilderness with equipment that had never been used before is just incredible.""

The bill for the Mason-Dixon Line came to just over Â£3,500 A plaque marks the spot close to where Mason and Dixon began their survey The Mason-Dixon Line took on an enduring symbolism in part because of the American Civil War Mason and Dixon are unlikely to have seen their names directly associated with their achievement, as the official report on the survey did not mention them. The term ""Mason-Dixon Line"" would become more widely used when theMissouri Compromise,externalwas passed in 1820 to allow slave-owning Missouri and free Maine to join the union. And of course the line's enduring symbolism was firmly established after the outbreak of theAmerican Civil Warin 1861, representing that demarcation between the North and South - and freedom over enslavement. Mason and Dixon are buried thousands of miles apart in unmarked graves After the mammoth project was completed, Mason returned to England to work again at the Greenwich Observatory but he ended his days virtually penniless back in America in 1786. ""Many years after the Mason-Dixon line was made, Mason returned to Philadelphia, but became sick during the journey,"" said John Hopkins, who oversees the burial ground at the city's Christ Church. ""When he got here he knew pretty much that he was close to death, so he wrote toBenjamin Franklin, who he knew, and asked him to give him a place to be buried so he didn't have to burden his wife and family. ""We don't know where he is. If he had a stone it's been lost over time. ""We have a plaque that a bunch of surveyors from around the country paid for with text close to what the inscription might have been at that time."" Charles Mason was friends with Benjamin Franklin, according to John Hopkins of Christ Church Dixon returned to County Durham to ply his trade. ""For the last 10 years of his life he did work for Lord Barnard at Raby Castle and surveyed Auckland Castle for the Bishop of Durham,"" his relative John Dixon said: ""He died at the young age of 45 in 1779. There was no death certificate. We know he'd been quite a steady drinker through his life and there were rumours he died from pneumonia. ""We presume that after having been put out of the Quakers they reconciled and accepted him back. He is buried in the Quaker burial ground at Staindrop.

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""As tough as this was, it's been a wonderful thing"" US President Donald Trump has praised the relief response to Hurricane Harvey on his second visit to flood-hit states. ""Things are working out well,"" he said of the efforts, as he and wife Melania met victims and volunteers in Texas. ""As tough as this was, it's been a wonderful thing,"" he added. ""I think even for the country to watch and for the world to watch."" The devastating hurricane made landfall in the state a week ago. Some residents have been allowed to return to their homes but flood waters are still rising in other areas. Harvey has been blamed for at least 47 deaths, and about 43,000 people are currently housed in shelters. President Trump and the first lady visited Texas earlier in the week but stayed clear of the disaster zone, saying they did not want to divert resources from rescue work. However, the president was criticised for not meeting victims of the flooding and for focusing largely on the logistics of the government response. Uninsured and anxious, victims return home How hard has Harvey hit the local economy? Visiting Texas again on Saturday, Mr and Mrs Trump made a point of meeting flood survivors and volunteers in Houston. They took part in food distribution at a shelter, handing out packed lunches, and posed for photographs with victims when they requested it. During a tour of a shelter, the president said: ""I think people appreciate what's been done. It's been done very efficiently, very well, and that's what we want. We've very happy with the way things are going. A lot of love. There's a lot of love."" The president and his wife then travelled to Lake Charles, Louisiana, which also suffered flash floods, before flying back to Washington. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump greeted children at a centre for flood survivors in Houston Amid the destruction, stories have been shared of people opening their homes and businesses to others, andforming human chainsto save people from treacherous rising waters. However, many are also now returning to destroyed homeswithout the insurance to fix them. Experts estimate that only about 20% of those in Houston's worst hit areas have flood insurance. This video can not be played Flood victims have been returning to inspect the damage Mr Trump has asked Congress for $7.8bn (Â£6bn) as an initial payment to help with recovery efforts following the flooding in both Texas and Louisiana, which has also hit production at America's main petrol and oil refining centre. The White House said on Saturday that the president had authorised an increase in the level of federal funding available for debris removal and emergency protective measures. Governor of Texas Greg Abbott has said the state may need more than $125bn in aid. The president has declared Sunday a ""National Day of Prayer,external"" for victims of Hurricane Harvey. Administration officials say there will be further requests for funds when the full impact of Hurricane Harvey becomes known. Harvey dumped an estimated 20 trillion gallons of rain on the Houston area. Why was Houston not evacuated? Hurricane Harvey: The climate link Governor Abbott has warned that the recovery programme will be a ""multi-year project"". ""This is going to be a massive, massive clean-up process,"" he told ABC News. The Environmental Protection Agency has warned that floodwater can contain bacteria and other contaminants from overflowing sewers. It said the biggest threat to public health was access to safe drinking water. Authorities in flood-hit Orange County, east of Beaumont, imposed a curfew on Saturday night to give its residents ""peace of mind"", officials said. Looting in Houston earlier in the week led to a curfew being implemented. This video can not be played Man plays piano in flooded Texas home - footage courtesy of Greg Aylor Thousands of homes and businesses remain without power, and many schools are expected to remain closed in the coming days. Meanwhile, the Houston Astros, the city's Major League Baseball team, returned home to take on the New York Mets on Saturday. Tributes were paid to those killed ahead of the game. The team abandoned their home stadium this week, playing three games in Florida against the Texas Rangers. ""We hope that these games can serve as a welcome distraction for our city that is going through a very difficult time,"" Astros president Reid Ryan said.

" By Sonia Oxley & Andrew Aloia Bounce back. It sounds so easy. As if inflating your tummy to 20 times its normal size, growing an actual human being in there and then delivering all 8lbs of it safely into the world through a small hole leaves your body exactly the same as it was nine months earlier. As simple as chucking a new football against a wall and watching it bounce back as perfectly round as when it left your hands. When, in fact, you’ll be lucky if it comes back even remotely looking like a battered rugby ball. With Serena Williams having had her baby, attention is now focused on when the former world number one will return to tennis and start adding to her 23 Grand Slam singles titles. She has been training through pregnancy and there are plenty of examples of athletes winning less than a year after having a baby - such as Jessica Ennis-Hill’s world heptathlon gold and Paula Radcliffe’s New York Marathon victory. But how exactly do they get to that point if their well-honed bodies have been stretched, torn and flooded by hormones? This is not about juggling night feeds, nappies and a career - the things a male athlete who is a parent can also go through. This is about running while being kicked in the ribs, dashing to the loo during training and swapping a six-pack for a big balloon while still managing to do squats. This is about having stitches in your nether regions and wet patches on your vest that haven’t come from sweat. This is about keeping your mind focused on a gold medal while you can’t see your toes over your belly. Sarah Storey, the swimmer turned cyclist and Britain’s most successful Paralympian, is expecting her second child in the autumn. “I don’t think you have maternity leave as an athlete,"" she said. ""It’s completely impractical to be off training for as long as a year, so you are continuing to train towards that goal of Tokyo [2020 Paralympics] in this case. “But you are adjusting your training load according to your circumstance, just as you would if you had another physical challenge like injury.” The first 12 weeks are when you are most likely to suffer with morning sickness, have sore breasts, a surge in the hormone that relaxes ligaments and increases blood flow (relaxin) - and yet no bump that gives the game away to others. “My boobs were really tender. That was the first sign that I was pregnant with [first child] Isla. I’m used to not really needing to bother with a sports bra so I did have to do that,” world marathon record holder Paula Radcliffe told BBC Sport. I thought: ‘Oh no, everyone’s going to know I’m pregnant, they just need to look at me.' Some might not even know they are pregnant at this stage, with Ennis-Hill training as normal for around the first two months as she had no idea she was expecting. Others change their approach from the moment they decide to try for a baby. “I treated myself the same way as if I was pregnant,” said 2014 European 10,000m champion and mum of two Jo Pavey. “I wouldn’t want to be pushing myself to the absolute maximum - where you are lying on the floor at the end of each session - if I’m aware that there could be a developing foetus.” NHS guidelines state that exercise during pregnancy can be beneficial in terms of helping women cope with labour and get back into shape afterwards. The advice is not to exhaust yourself or get overheated and not suddenly take up strenuous exercise if you were not active before. But what if you are used to pushing yourself to your physical limit? Michael Dooley, consultant gynaecologist at King Edward VII's Hospital in London, said: “The question you are asking is, ‘what is the difference between driving around the streets of London on a Sunday jaunt compared to being a Formula 1 driver racing at Silverstone?’ “You are doing the same thing, but you are doing it at a different level. You are at a different level of training, physical ability, mental ability and risk. “They are both cars but are completely different - and because they are completely different you have to have different ways of handling them. “The machine has to be much more finely tuned; an elite athlete, in her own body has to be more finely tuned. She is going to be much more aware of her body because she is going to be listening to her body, just as a Formula 1 car would have more monitors on it than a Fiat would be going around town.” Take heart rate, for example. The formula often used to calculate a woman’s maximum heart rate is 206 minus 88% of their age, so a 30-year-old woman’s maximum rate would be around 180 beats per minute (bpm). However, Radcliffe - who was 33 when she had Isla - was advised that during pregnancy the level she could work at was up to 180bpm because she had a maximum heart rate of 205bpm as an elite athlete. While foetal heart rates are impossible to monitor during training, International Olympic Committee studies have concluded there is little risk of an abnormal response if athletes exercise at less than 90% of their maximum heart rates in the second and third trimesters. To ‘ordinary people’, the levels of training elite athletes do during pregnancy may seem mind-blowing. Radcliffe ran twice a day - for about 45 minutes in the mornings and 30-40 minutes in the afternoons - all the way through her second pregnancy, while Storey cycles for about three hours a day. Footballer Sarah Wiltshire was playing for Yeovil Town all the way through her first trimester last July, while Storey said she was “a little bit pregnant” when she did the National Track Championships at the end of January this year. “I’d already committed to a few road time trial events due to start racing before the 12 weeks when you would normally tell people, so I did race during that period,” said Storey. ""I played up to 13 weeks and the last game - I knew it was time,"" added Wales striker Wiltshire. ""It was a tough game physically and there were a few fouls on me. I thought, ‘no, this needs to stop here’. ""I was in constant contact with the club doctor and went off what he was advising as well.” Many women wait until their 12-week scan - the first scan routinely offered on the NHS - to share the news they are pregnant, but for a sportswoman this approach could be dangerous, according to Dooley. “If they then had an accident there can be unknown danger,” he said. ""I was involved in one case where they had a horrendous riding accident, the conception was concealed. “Thank goodness everything was all right, but if she had become unconscious we would have not have known she was pregnant - she could have had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy and we could have run into all sorts of problems and completely missed the diagnosis. ""What we don’t want is athletes concealing. What I’ve had a few times in competition is people who were terrified about telling the team that they were pregnant because they may lose their position. Dooley, who worked with Radcliffe during her pregnancies, said the main thing is to treat an athlete’s pregnancy as a “normal event” and for the women to tell their coaches confidentially about it and devise a strategy. “All governing bodies should have a policy, but sadly this is not the case,” said Dooley. Falls from bikes and horses, and collisions in football and rugby are all obvious risks, while there is also the potential of injury in any sport because of the relaxin hormone that increases the stretchiness of tendons and ligaments. “You know it because you can feel the way your ankle moves and you don’t want it to separate,” said Storey. “If the gears are too big and you get out of the saddle and try to put in too much of an acceleration the hormone can potentially cause damage to joints that are a bit vulnerable.” Those issues aside, early pregnancy can provide some performance benefits. Professor Greg Whyte, a physical activity expert and author of pregnancy exercise book 'Bump It Up', said: “There is an increase in blood volume, increase in blood cell mass - red blood cells carry oxygen so actually you can improve your aerobic capacity. “In the first trimester, when the foetus is tiny, there are no real changes in weight and no biomechanical changes. They can increase aerobic capacity, they can run faster, swim faster, cycle faster.” None of this is much use, though, if you are feeling tired, sick and moody - making it, in Dooley's words, “performance neutral”. Morning sickness - just as likely to hit in the afternoon - requires hospital treatment for some women, and is suppressible with a snack for others. “Some people who don’t eat when they are hungry maybe feel sick more frequently but I’ve never been afraid to eat,” said Storey. “I know that’s a real taboo subject with a lot of athletes. “Your race weight is 6kg to 8kg lighter than the average person of your build in ‘real life’. Any weight you are putting on is just to get you to the normal - you have to accept you’re in the super-skinny category, so you have to be really careful that you don’t give yourself a hard time. In my first pregnancy, I was 66kg when I raced in London and Rio, but I came out of hospital with a baby and I was still 92kg! “But I was fit and healthy. Some of that weight was extra muscle - as I trained right the way through pregnancy, I gained muscle in my legs.” Putting on weight and changing shape when you are used to strictly monitoring body fat percentages, water and muscle mass can take some getting used to, but for some athletes pregnancy is instead a liberating experience. Psychologist Britt Tajet-Foxell, who has worked with the Norwegian Olympic Association and various ballet troupes, said: “They step into this world of being pregnant that every other woman who has been pregnant also steps into. Maybe that period is the first very normal period they go through. “If they have been top of their game for a period of time, them going into pregnancy is something that most seem to enjoy.” “My gynaecologist scared the hell out of me when we met when I was five months,” said Radcliffe. “We were filling in forms and she said: ‘What do you do now?’ I’m a marathon runner. ‘But you’re not training now?’ Well, yeah, actually I was at the track this morning doing some easy 400s. “’Oh no, that’s really irresponsible, you’re going to have shortened your cervix, you’re going to give birth really early’ and all these scare stories. ‘Please come back tonight and I’m going to measure the length of your cervix to make sure’. “Everything was A perfect. She was really nice and when I gave birth she came into the ward and said: ‘I want to apologise for scaring you then - I’m now going to tell all my mothers who are active to carry on with some modification of that activity.’” There are plenty of examples of sportswomen still competing at this stage of pregnancy. Dutchwoman Anky van Grunsven won Olympic dressage gold while five months pregnant in 2004, while images of Alysia Montano competing in the USA Track and Field Championships at the same stage in 2014 are also an amazing illustration of this. Five months after Williams won the Australian Open, Mandy Minella appeared in the first round of Wimbledon while four and a half months pregnant. However, by now many athletes are just focused on keeping up their fitness. “You want to maintain, you wouldn’t want to put on an excessive amount of weight,” said sports gynaecologist Dooley, who is teaming up with colleagues to set up a national institute for women’s health and performance. “The biggest problem we see in non-elite athletes is ‘I’m eating for two’. They then have the baby and are 10 pounds overweight and they never lose it again. There is increased risk of type 2 diabetes, increased risk of hypertension, increased risks of all sorts of problems.” Maintaining fitness during pregnancy can throw up challenges though. “I’d just have to find a bush or tree,” said Pavey, remembering the desperate-for-the-loo feeling that pregnancy so often brings as baby and organs vie for space in a crowded area near the bladder. To make sure she and her baby stayed comfortable in other ways during training, she wore a heart rate monitor, trained at cooler times of the day, made sure she was hydrated, took a phone and energy gel with her and avoided rough ground to minimise the risk of falling. In some ways, athletes lead the ideal lifestyle for pregnancy. “They are not smokers, they are not drinkers, they do have a healthier diet, they are physically active and, to some extent, they have a very stable environment in which they live,” said Whyte, a two-time Olympian and World and European Championship medallist in modern pentathlon. Effectively, they are not making any major changes to their lifestyle. What they are doing is maintaining their lifestyle. Even their cravings sound healthy. “I just couldn’t be hungry, I ate a lot of fruit,” said Radcliffe. “I had a bit more of a chocolate craving with [second child] Raphael and also Marmite. ""I must’ve been craving B vitamins. I used to sleep with a banana by the side of my bed so if I woke up hungry I could have a couple of bites.” Williams' fiance Alexis Ohanian revealed in August that his partner's pregnancy cravings included courgette, asparagus and artichoke. For elite athletes, it is more about listening to their bodies and adapting the tools for their job than making lifestyle changes - tweaking the settings on their bikes, altering their pace, getting a sports bra, lifting lighter weights at the gym or wearing a sacroiliac belt to support the bump. “I’m very much into pregnancy pace now,” Storey said when she was about five months pregnant. “My handle bars have come up on the stacker, so you are basically accommodating the bump. With that you have to be careful on descent because you’ve not got as much weight on the front wheel, so the handling of the bike changes.” The second trimester is when women usually start to feel the baby move and the growing bump can begin to affect balance. “It’s more the muscular balance that you’ll feel,” said Radcliffe. “Your glutes might work harder one day and you change a bit in terms of how you throw your arms out - but it’s not because of the weight, it’s because the baby moves. “Depending on how they are sitting it’s a totally different sensation so you just have to be very adaptable about it and relaxed. With Isla, I used to wake up in the morning and see what kind of position she was in and what kind of training I was going to do.” According to professor Whyte, around 80-90% of pregnant women complain of lower-back pain because of their change in posture, caused by the bump and bigger breasts - breasts that, according to Dooley, travel quite some distance if unrestrained. If you run a mile [without a bra], your breasts move up and down 100 yards. “If they are training, proper sports bras and proper training kit are important as there is soreness they may experience.” While maternity sportswear does exist, some athletes choose to improvise. “I tended to wear cycling-type shorts. Sometimes I’d just roll them down a bit so that the band was under the bump if it wasn’t stretchy enough,” said runner Pavey. “And I’d wear two or three crop tops - larger size ones. Sometimes I wore three it was so painful. I started off wearing large T-shirts but then it just got to me wearing my husband’s running T-shirt. “I needed to use a lot of Vaseline around the crop tops. They [breasts] still bounce up and down - it was just rubbing holes in my skin.” “You’d get people shouting: ‘You’re so selfish, why would you think of doing that?’"" said Radcliffe, who ran right up to her due date and for the two weeks she went over with her first. “You do just want to turn round and say: ‘Actually, it might be healthier than the one who is sitting at home with her feet up eating ice cream for the whole pregnancy.’ But you can’t. “But most people are quite supportive. I got a lot of double-takes as I was running in the park.” She said she was once doing hill reps in the park when she was stopped by a man walking a dog. “’Does your doctor know you are doing this?’ Yes, it’s OK, they know. ‘If it’s all the same to you, I’m going to wait until you’ve finished to make sure you are OK.’ “I had to take Isla back to see him and we still see him and she says: ‘That’s the man who was worried about me when I was in your tummy.’” She also raised eyebrows in the gym. “I was doing squats. If you walked in behind you wouldn’t see anything - and then I’d rack the bar and turn round and they would freak out. I wasn’t lifting heavy.” Radcliffe said she had extra scans during her first pregnancy - one every month from five months - to make sure everything was going well, but she just had the usual 12-week and 20-week scans during her second. “Training through the second one is much easier because you’ve had that reassurance and kind of belief that what you did was right,” she said. “They slept when I ran. I would feel the kicking afterwards and that’s very reassuring. Occasionally I’d get a kick in the ribs [while running] which really, really hurts. If they kicked, I’d just walk for a bit until they got comfortable.” With the focus now turning to the impending birth, athletes will be considering the type of birth they might want from both a personal and professional point of view. “Some sports are quite keen on Caesarean sections because if you are sitting down - maybe riding a bike or a horse - and you have a badly damaged perineum, it may be difficult,” said consultant Dooley. “Having a Caesarean section should not be thought of as being detrimental if that is the right thing for them and the baby. When you are looking after an athlete you are dealing with a mother and child. Not a mother, child and athlete. Recovery from a C-section is usually longer than from a vaginal birth - you cannot drive for six weeks - and some athletes are keen to avoid one so they can resume training sooner. “I was pretty blinkered the first time round. I really wanted to not have a Caesarean but because I have a narrow pelvis I was on the watch list for one,” said Radcliffe, who was induced for her first baby. She ended up having an epidural because, although she was only 1.5cm dilated, she was having the type of contractions more usual at 9cm. And she believes that was because she was an athlete. “I didn’t want to do that [have an epidural] because I was scared of losing the feeling down my legs. I had to sit cross-legged for 14 hours overnight just to let the muscles relax and dilate enough for her to be able to get out. “Because I was a Caesarean risk they would not let me eat or drink - I had an IV drip. “They said to me: ‘Imagine it’s a marathon, you can’t have anything until you finish.’ And I was like: ‘No, you can drink every 5k!’ “Because I was an athlete, my muscles were so tight and she was struggling to get out - but I had more stamina and more endurance to be able to push to get her out.” After 26 hours, an episiotomy - a cut between the vagina and anus sometimes given to avoid a tear - and a low ventouse, Radcliffe delivered Isla. Storey ended up with a C-section, which put paid to her original idea that she might be able to compete at the World Championships two months after giving birth. She hopes it will be different this time round. “There are no real reasons why I would need another one unless something went wrong. I have no desire to go through another section, but if that’s the way it happens then that’s the way it happens,” she said. Footballer Wiltshire, meanwhile, was back on the football pitch less than two months after having her baby daughter. “I knew that having a natural birth would play a big part,” she said. “The C-section is a major operation. I started running about three weeks later so that’s the difference really. If it had been a C-section I wouldn’t have been able to do anything for six weeks.” Being in labour has often been likened to running a marathon, so if anyone can shed light on whether this is true, it is Radcliffe. “It doesn’t compare at all,” she said. “It’s a completely different type of pain. “When you’re running you are trying to push your body as hard as you can and switch off everything that’s telling you it hurts - but you know that at any moment, if it gets too much, you can just stop. You can’t do that when you’re giving birth, you’ve got to get the baby out. “It’s a lower level of pain but it’s sustained for much longer. It was only when pushing I thought this is kind of similar - you get into a rhythm and you can push with rhythm. Breathing techniques you learn for pain management while you’re running or getting physio really help when you’re giving birth.” Athletes can be better prepared for delivery because they are so fit, says professor Whyte. “There is a lot of talk about the pelvic floor. It is fundamental. What athletes have is a very good control over the muscle,” he said. “If you have maintained your core strength and stability through pregnancy, when a midwife says push, the amount of force you produce is greater.” Because no-one knows what their labour and birth is going to be like, it is hard to plan what happens next. Ennis-Hill’s coach Toni Minichiello said he was never convinced she was coming back to competition, despite her insistence throughout her pregnancy that she would. “I didn’t believe her, let’s put it that way,” he said. “I know you’re telling me at this moment in time - but not even you can answer that question until the little one arrives. “It also depends on how straightforward the birth is. We had an expression: it just depends whether the baby comes out of the tunnel or out of the chute!” While a Caesarean is a major abdominal operation, a vaginal delivery can also cause significant damage. Third and fourth degree perineal tears - requiring a significant number of stitches - can leave women with both permanent and temporary bladder and bowel incontinence, while merely sitting down on a sofa can be agony for weeks. At this point, a bike saddle might seem like a medieval torture device. Minichiello said Ennis-Hill was benefiting aerobically from the increased blood volume and in the range of movement in her joints as a result of the relaxin, which stays in the body for up to a year post-childbirth. Studies indicate that elite athletes who train during and after pregnancy may see a 5-10% increase in their maximal oxygen consumption in the months after giving birth, though this was not observed in recreational athletes. What Ennis-Hill had lost, however, was speed. Speed is not the only thing that may have been damaged. “When I got back I noticed my bowel took time [to get back to normal],” said Radcliffe, who returned to running 12 days after delivering her daughter and 10 days after giving birth to her son, having had an episiotomy with both. “It took some time before I could do a half-hour run before running back into the house. It did take a good six weeks to get back. I thought it was the relaxin causing it.” For some, the damage to the body from giving birth can be permanent. “Somebody I know who was a very good runner actually doesn’t want to run any more in retirement because she hasn’t got any confidence because of stress incontinence caused by childbirth,” said Pavey. How soon an athlete is ready to return to training will depend on how their birth went and how well they have settled into family life. The worst thing you can do is have them not listen to their body. You don’t want them to say I will train tomorrow, then the baby wants to breastfeed and they have sore nipples. Experts say the key areas to strengthen after pregnancy are the pelvic floor and the core. All women are advised by the NHS to do their pelvic floor exercises - some are so discreet no-one knows you are doing them, some use obtrusive and hi-tech gadgets inserted into the parts that may still be tender from just having pushed out a baby. There are apps that help you remember to squeeze, which suggests perhaps not everyone is diligently following the advice. However, for an athlete used to following instructions, it's just another part of the training regime. “If you tell an athlete they need to do pelvic floor exercises three times a day, they will do pelvic floor exercises three times a day. They might even do it six times a day because they have the mentality that more is better,” said Whyte. Similarly, if they have had separation of the abdominal muscles - a common problem that sometimes is never entirely fixed - they will work hard to knit them back together. Yeovil Town player Wiltshire followed an online core stability programme, and Radcliffe did a lot of slow, sustained crunches. “Since Raphael, I’ve got a lump that pops out here,” said Radcliffe, pulling up her vest to show her tummy. “I can feel it. It’s only the size of a broad bean or something, but I can see it when I get back from a run now. If I am more dehydrated I can see this little lump. It’s just one tiny bit that hasn’t meshed together. It doesn’t look great in a bikini but other than that…” Whether you get stretch marks or not depends on your skin type and how elastic it is, the NHS says, and not how fit you are. Even if they feel ready to return, athletes can sometimes pay the price for doing too much too soon. “At eight or nine weeks post-birth I was getting to 80-90 miles a week. Then I got the stress fracture in my sacrum [triangular bone at base of spine] and that then forced me to sit out. I built up too quickly,” said Radcliffe. “Once that healed I was able to build back strongly. I learned you need to make sure your body catches up even if you feel great.” She went on to win the 2007 New York Marathon 10 months after giving birth. And she is not the only one to come back strongly, with Pavey’s career rejuvenated after becoming a mum, as well as victories in their sport’s major tournaments for the likes of tennis player Kim Clijsters and golfer Catriona Matthew. “Athletes at the top level are very much like the best ballet dancers in the world. When they have a baby, they actually come back stronger,” said psychologist Tajet-Foxell. “They have extraordinary coping mechanisms that allow them to get back and get to an even higher level. Storey says it is up to those around the athletes to discourage them from overdoing it in their bid to return to the top of their sport. “It’s about having a governing body that will almost hold them back a little bit and not make them start too soon,” she said. “I remember having a conversation with [former British Cycling performance director] Dave Brailsford where he said: ‘You don’t have to come back that quick - enjoy it, take your time.’ I realise now that’s a good thing. You know you’ll come back stronger if you do it the right way. Whether you are breastfeeding or not can have an impact on your training, with Storey, who breastfed her daughter until she was a toddler, saying she found her energy levels depleted when she was doing both. ""When I was feeding and training, it was like in those three hours I’d done four and a half – it was like time and a half! ""When I was doing mixed feeding, the slight reduction in milk gave me extra energy.” For some, breastfeeding can make training hard for other reasons. “I wasn’t used to having a full bust. It was, should I say, leaky,” said Wiltshire, who was back scoring goals a few weeks after giving birth and breastfed for four weeks. “I felt very heavy running around. She struggled to breastfeed so it made sense for both of us to go to a bottle.” And then there are the breastfeeding injuries that no-one warns you about. “I did a lot of expressing - I wanted to breastfeed them both to six months because I’m asthmatic. I got tenosynovitis in my wrist from pumping,” said Radcliffe, who stockpiled expressed milk in the freezer to make sure there was always some available if she was not around. While some mums who return to work struggle with the guilt of not seeing their children as much as they would like or the logistics of pick-ups and drop-offs, some athletes see their careers as very child-friendly. “I go training with my kids,” said Pavey, who won her first major gold medal 10 months after having her second child. “My little boy goes on the bike. My husband goes on the bike with our little girl on the back. Or we run and we use the running buggy. I’m starting doing a bit of running with my son. “We’ve never used a nursery for either of my children, we’ve been able to juggle it between us.” Radcliffe agreed, saying she was able to spend 22 hours a day with her daughter after she was born, but later faced a difficult decision of career versus child when she suffered the stress fracture. “They [doctors] were telling me that if you want to heal you’re going to have to stop breastfeeding,” she said. “I felt like I was making the choice [to stop at five months] because of my career.” Williams and Laura Kenny have continued to train during pregnancy, committed to a return to the very top of tennis and cycling post-birth. If they need any encouragement, they could learn from Radcliffe’s words: “I was asked: ‘How can you run, you can’t see where you’re going [over your bump]?’ You don’t have to suddenly look down at your feet, you are used to looking ahead.” Built with Shorthand",Negative,2.5452348e-08
"Even in refugee camps life must go on, and when a man and a woman decide to marry the rare chance for a big celebration may be seized with both hands. In one camp in northern Iraq, beautician Rozhin Ahmed-Hussein - herself a Syrian Kurdish refugee - finds that she is rarely short of work. ""Most of the people in the camp are poor, and Syrian refugees like me, so when I do a beautiful bride, usually I'll dance out of the door with her because I feel so happy,"" says Rozhin Ahmed-Hussein. A dusty refugee camp north of Mosul may not be the first place you'd expect to find a beauty salon and gown-hire shop, with frothy white frocks and diamante winking through the windows in the fierce sunlight - and slinky party dresses in vivid fuchsia and turquoise hanging from the rails. In this camp, makeshift homes are separated by vast stretches of light brown gravel paths, which kick up dust in the wind and feel hot even through shoes in the 47C (117F) heat. There are 41,000 Syrian refugees living in two neighbouring camps here. The situations they've fled from are often desperate but that doesn't stop people falling in love. And when that happens, they do what people everywhere do, they get married. Rozhin's salon isn't the only one in the camp, but it may be the most stylish. Small details, such as a coral sink placed next to a coral chair and proper reclining seats, let you know that Rozhin is not new to the business. She herself is immaculate, with no make-up. ""I do make-up all day, it's like work for me,"" she says. Her five daughters aged from one to seven often wear matching outfits. ""I like to look glamorous, I'm always like this,"" she says. Rozhin and her family fled Qamishli, a Kurdish town in Syria in 2012, as the civil war picked up pace. ""In Syria I had a normal life, a normal job as a beautician, and then when we came here it was too hard, too tough to adjust to the environment,"" she says. She cried a lot, she says, because her daughter fell ill and she was homesick. ""I kept begging my husband to go back, even though it was dangerous, but he refused. In time, I adapted to the situation and my daughter got better."" It helped that she was able to open her business. The shop was initially a grocery run by her husband, but after it failed to make enough money, Rozhin saw her opportunity. She borrowed some money from her uncle and turned it into a salon. After spotting the demand for wedding gowns and party dresses, she started stocking those too. Now the shop has been going for five years. It's named Tulin, after her daughter. Aside from regulars coming in wanting a haircut, an eyebrow shape or a catch-up, Rozhin does up to 30 weddings a year. Many of her customers are Kurdish, and it cannot be overstated how lavish these weddings are. The two suitable halls in the camp host 300-400 guests, which is - everyone in the room jumps in to explain - extremely small by Kurdish standards. One thousand guests would be more typical, they say. At Kurdish weddings, even the guests are made up exquisitely with flicked eyeliner, I'm told, thickly applied pale foundation, bum-length hair extensions or hijabs patterned with designer logos. Because of the heat and sheer quantity of make-up needed, usually Rozhin does the bride's hair first and the make-up is done last to reduce the risk of it melting on the bride's face. Weddings usually take place at 7pm or 8pm when the air has cooled, but in the summer the temperature will still be in the 30s - which you have to factor in when the wedding make-up is as thick as face paint. Each bride takes around two-and-a-half hours to get ready, but it's not just the brides. The whole wedding party may want their hair and makeup done, and sometimes Rozhin has two weddings to do in one day. Fortunately she has friends on hand to help. The International Medical Corps runs a programme training survivors of gender-based violence to do hair and make-up, so she brings them in to lend a hand. ""There's a lot of work to do with the bridal party,"" says Rozhin. ""When I call them to come and help they're so happy - we are all sisters and we have confidence in each other. After the job is done we drink tea and coffee together."" The majority of Rozhin's brides are very young. ""Usually I don't ask how old they are, but from their faces they are 18 or 19 on average. ""I don't know why they get married in every case, but when you're 18 years old and you're living here with your family - what else is there to do?"" It also means having a big party. This is important for people coming to terms with a difficult past, and everyday refugee camp life - which means 20 people to one latrine, makeshift housing and constant vigilance against disease. ""For every single woman this is one special day to have a big glamorous dress and make-up,"" says Rozhin. ""Just one day to feel special. No-one will be hurt by this."" While some brides might relish the experience of being made to feel glamorous, a mural showing a bride holding a teddy bear is painted outside the shop. It's a sobering reminder of the problem of young girls being married off to much older men - something which is particularly rampant in refugee camps. A mural outside the shop warns against child marriage But the shop is a place for escapism, even if the women can't forget their problems altogether. ""In the salon we try out new techniques with make-up, but we are always thinking about our friends and relatives."" Thinking about them, and often worrying about them. Rozhin is the main breadwinner of the family. Her husband, Ahmed, finds work some days, but the next day there be no work to be had, and he stays at home. ""I am the one who brings money to the family and my husband does not have any problem with this. Usually the men here don't like that, for a woman to be in charge. But he says, 'If we're getting money that's OK.'"" Business has been up and down. Having her twin girls recently meant she had to close up for a few months, allowing her rivals in the camp to pick up some of her regular customers, but now things are getting better. ""There are another three that have a lot of customers,"" Rozhin says. Many of the families in the camp have been living here for at least as long as Rozhin has. Communities build up, neighbours get to know each other, people fall in love. Getting married means having a stake in the future, even when that future is uncertain. If you look carefully at the wedding dresses in Rozhin's shop, you can see the hems are lightly stained the same colour as the gravelly paths of the camp. How many women have worn these dresses, and made the same journey to the same hall, careful not to mess up their hair and make-up, and wondering what comes next?

"""I don't know where to start"" - Herman Washington and his wife Mary Woodard found their home wrecked As the water recedes in Houston, three families return home to survey the damage from Hurricane Harvey.Like so many others, theyhave no flood insurance and no way of paying for repairs. At each house it was the same: a neat line, visible from the street, that showed where the flood finally abated. The lines ringed the small, one-storey homes in northeast Houston, where three bayous wind through the streets carrying water to the bay. For many of those returning home for the first time, the line would separate what was salvageable from what was lost. At James and Rose Hert's house, a few hundred yards from the Greens Bayou, the line crossed the screen door about 5 ft from the ground. The water came in so fast it was up to Rose's neck by the time they waded onto the front lawn on Saturday, she said. At 59, recently recovered from thyroid cancer, and with arthritis that forces her to walk with a cane, Rose can't move fast. Neither can James, who's 63 and has nerve damage to his right leg and partial vision in his left eye. The couple first made their way to a neighbour's house, on higher ground, but that too filled with water. Eventually they were pulled from the flood by a man with a truck, who drove them to a bus which took them to the mass shelter at the downtown convention centre. ""I was terrified for my life,"" said Rose. ""But that man was like an angel sent from heaven."" Their small, two-bedroom house, part-clapboard and part-brick, was a wedding anniversary present for Rose, purchased 23 years into the marriage and paid for with nearly all the money they had. Rose called it her castle. With the money left over she bought furniture - two couches, an armchair, a wooden dining table and a new refrigerator. The most important piece of furniture though was an old one - an antique secretary desk handed down through three generations of women in Rose's family. She planned to pass it on to her daughter. She cried at the shelter when she thought about it. She couldn't face going back to the house, she said, so when James returned for the first time on Thursday he went without her. When he turned the key in the lock, the door wouldn't budge. It would be the same at other houses, the first sign that the furniture inside had been picked up by the water and soaked and dumped back down where it didn't belong. He couldn't have known, as he forced the door, that it was Rose's secretary desk in the way, toppled onto its back, one leg already broken, but the glass, miraculously, intact. As the door inched open, the rank odour of the water hit. It had seeped into the couches and the carpets and pooled between the floorboards. Underneath the water line, the walls were stained and Rose's prize furniture lay tumbled about. The fridge was on its side, blocking off the kitchen. None of it was salvageable. Above the water line, the couple's marriage certificate hung unscathed in a frame, alongside James's army discharge and diploma, and a picture of Rose's late mother. ""I guess that's something,"" James said. Earlier, at the shelter, as he kissed Rose goodbye, his eyes had filled with tears. He was not given easily to emotion, she said. Maybe for a two-tour veteran of Vietnam, with 12 years service, the flood did not seem too tough. Later, at the back of the house, where the water line was 7 ft high and the deck was caked in mud, he paused for a cigarette and stood in silence looking down towards the bayou. ""There's $20,000, $30,000 worth of damage here,"" he said, looking back. ""We just don't have it. We don't."" James Hert bought a house to mark his 25th wedding anniversary. Two years later, he will have to sell Insurance experts estimate that only about 20% of those in Houston's worst hit areas have flood insurance. The Herts don't have any. The premiums were too high, they said. They live off $1,100 dollars a month in disability payments. After their other bills and outgoings, that leaves about $100 spare. The number of homeowners across Houston with flood insurance dropped 9% over the past five years and as much as 23% in some counties. Harris County, where James and Rose live, has 25,000 fewer flood-insured properties than it did in 2012, according to an Associated Press review of government data. Mary Woodard and her husband Herman couldn't afford the insurance either. The floodwater that washed through their house, a few miles south of the Herts in a low-income neighbourhood by the Hunter Bayou, was the latest in a long list of financial and personal hardships for the couple. Herman, who's 63, had to retire from his work as a removals man last year after a stroke badly affected his right side. Mary, who's 59, worked 14 years in the local courthouse before retiring in 2011, after a diagnosis of osteoarthritis. In maps: Houston and Texas flooding Why was Houston not evacuated? Four key effects of Houston floods ""It's the stink that gets you,"" Mary said as she pushed open the front door, entering her home for the first time after six nights in two different shelters. The tiled floor was slick with mud, the furniture soaked, the bases of the wooden cabinets warped. Food had floated out of the lower drawers and off the shelves and begun to rot on the floor. Mary didn't really care about what was beneath the water line, she wanted to know if the pictures of her first son and her first daughter had survived. ""I lost him when he was only eight years old,"" she said, fighting back tears. ""That's when he got drowned in the pool. And my daughter, she got killed just about 12 years ago now. Her boyfriend killed her. That's why I was so glad to see those pictures. That was very important to me that they survived. Very important."" Much of Mary's income had been diverted to helping raise her daughter's four sons, as well as to taking care of her other three children. It didn't leave much for savings to help her and Herman through retirement. Like the Herts, they have about $100 spare each month. ""We don't have the insurance or anything,"" she said. ""The few companies we did talk to, they were either too high or they didn't carry the flood insurance."" There was no money to pay for repairs, she said, they would have to move on. ""We'll salvage what we can. I probably couldn't stay in this house anyhow, not after this."" ""It's much worse than I thought,"" said Mary Woodard when she saw her house for the first time The only hope for couples like the Woodards and the Herts is the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Fema will give money to uninsured homeowners to cover repairs and emergency costs. The grants are capped at a maximum of $33,300, but most will get significantly less. At the convention centre in Houston, a long line of people formed early every morning, waiting for hours to find out if they can claim. Mary and Herman had spoken to a Fema agent on Wednesday and he told them someone would be in touch within 10 days. By that point, they'd been in the shelter for five sleepless nights. ""I've had maybe eight hours sleep since I got there,"" said Mary. ""You get an hour here, an hour there. There are people walking all around you and people fighting. It's a lot of chaos. It's 2am before it starts to get quiet."" The first call from Fema will tell Mary and Herman whether they are eligible. Then they will have to wait up to 30 days for an adjustor to visit the property and assess how much they can claim. In the meantime, they hope Fema will pay for a hotel room. Mary's eldest son and her elderly mother both live in Houston but they both flooded just the same as Mary. ""Eventually we all winded up at the convention centre,"" she said. Mary Woodard and her husband Herman found their grandson's toys floating across the road James and Rose had been told they needed to go online to apply for relief. They had spent five days in borrowed clothes - James in an old sweatshirt and tracksuit bottoms, Rose in a pink nightgown - and they were overwhelmed. Three attempts to apply on a borrowed smartphone had failed as the Fema website repeatedly crashed. Rose sat in the cavernous hallway of the convention centre and wept. She looked exhausted. She was still recovering from her brother's suicide last year, she said, and the loss of her mother two years before that. And now this. Two years after moving in, her dream home was gone. ""We put a tin roof on, we put new flowers in, we painted it,"" she said. ""We fixed it up. It was my little castle, like no one else could describe it. It was all I ever wanted."" But it was cheap, too, partly because it needed fixing up, partly because it sits on low ground near the bayou, and that puts a significant premium on the flood insurance. Just over the road, where the ground is higher, flood insurance costs about $200 a year. On the Herts' side of the road, the premiums can run into the thousands of dollars. Texas law stipulates that anyone in a Special Flood Hazard Area must have flood insurance, but only if you have a mortgage, people who own their homes are exempt. And the vast majority of those flooded by Hurricane Harvey fall outside the hazard zones and they never expected to see water washing through their homes. ""There's a lot of people here that have never been flooded,"" said Mark Hanna, from the Insurance Council for Texas. ""And if you don't have to have flood insurance, and you've never been flooded before, a lot people say 'Hey, the water's have never been this high, we'll be OK'. ""People weren't prepared for a thousand-year flood. Who is?"" Rose Hert called her home her castle. She couldn't bear to see it after the flood Frank and Melvin Lee Rogers never thought it would happen. The two brothers had been flooded once before, when Storm Alison came through in 2001, but it was nothing like this. They escaped on Saturday with just the clothes on their back and one of their cats, a tiny kitten called Squeaky. Frank, 70, and Melvin Lee, 63, live in the Lakewood neighbourhood by the Halls Bayou, which cuts across the bottom of the street on its way to the Buffalo Bayou further south. The water had washed through the trees, leaving detritus in the branches as it went, including an old manual lawnmower which hung tangled 10 ft off the ground. ""I live down on the corner there, the white house with the blue trim,"" said Frank, as they crossed the bayou on foot on the way home. ""You can see the dirt on the side of the house. That's the water line right there."" At the front door, the smell was so strong it seeped out of the building. Inside, a floating couch had punched a hole in the wall and smashed through a glass coffee table. Scores of worms and a small snake lay dead on the carpet. A wall calendar, neatly marked off for each day before Saturday, was cut in half by the water line, the last two weeks of the month underwater. Frank Rogers stands in his kitchen on his first visit home, with the waterline visible behind him Frank, a Vietnam veteran who settled in Houston and became a plastics mould operator, called out for Goldy, their five-year-old cat, who they couldn't find when the water began coming in through the walls. ""No Goldy,"" he said. ""She's gone, or dead."" Outside, his car had drifted 6 ft and was hanging off the edge of the driveway, with a film of mud over the body and the motor flooded. The mailbox was just high enough. He pulled the catch to one side and looked in. ""We've got mail!"" he said, cheered at finding something dry. Around him, those neighbours who had returned, mostly Hispanic families, played music and shouted to each other as they threw furniture, carpeting and wet sheetrock out onto the front lawns. Frank stood back and surveyed the damage. They would have to sell up, he said. But about $20,000 in repairs lay between them and a sellable house. ""I don't have that kind of money,"" he said. ""That's the point, I don't have the money. And it's hard to go to the bank and borrow money when your house is flooded. They'll tell you you're a risk."" It wasn't so much the money that prevented them getting flood insurance in the first place, said Melvin Lee, Frank's younger brother by seven years. ""We just didn't see this coming,"" he said. ""We had no idea it would be this bad. I don't think anyone thought it would be this bad."" Melvin Lee Rogers surveys the damage outside the home he shares with his brother Five days after the flood washed away his mobile phone, Frank reached his sister. She told him she would collect him and Melvin Lee from the house. They set their few possessions down outside - a handful of dry clothes in a clear plastic bag, and Squeaky, in a carrier donated by the shelter - and began to wait. Back at the convention centre, Mary and Herman were getting ready to bed down for a sixth night on their cots, surrounded by thousands of others. Mary was making sure to keep her phone charged at the charging station, so she wouldn't miss a call or an email from Fema. They were relieved to have seen the home, they said, despite the state of it. James was relieved too. It seemed like knowing was better than not knowing, no matter how bad the damage. As he took one last look around his house and got ready to leave, he flicked a light switch absentmindedly. The bulb over the dining table caught him by surprise. ""We have light!"" he said. ""That's a start!"" On the drive back from the house he was upbeat. He told the story of how he first met Rose. ""I was fixing her boyfriend's car, so I had my shirt off and in those days I was still pretty well built. Anyway, it wasn't long after that I was working on another guy's car near her house, and she had a nice tree there I could use for pulling motors. She jumped up on the truck to help get some bolts out and that was that."" At the shelter, Rose waited anxiously for James to return. When he found her, he told her about the house. It wasn't bad at all, he said. The glass in the secretary desk was intact and the power was still on. The two dogs next door, which Rose loved, had survived, and the picture of her mother was hanging exactly where she left it. She cried with relief. James took her arm and walked her back to their cots, before getting in line again to speak to Fema. ""I can wait another few hours,"" he said. ""I've got time."" .

"Attack bots scan net address ranges looking for vulnerable servers Cyber-criminals start attacking servers newly set up online about an hour after they are switched on, suggests research. The servers were part of an experiment the BBC asked a security company to carry out to judge the scale and calibre of cyber-attacks that firms face every day. About 71 minutes after the servers were set up online they were visited by automated attack tools that scanned them for weaknesses they could exploit, found security firm Cybereason. Once the machines had been found by the bots, they were subjected to a ""constant"" assault by the attack tools. The servers were accessible online for about 170 hours to form a cyber-attack sampling tool known as a honeypot, said Israel Barak, chief information security officer at Cybereason. The servers were given real, public IP addresses and other identifying information that announced their presence online. ""We set out to map the automatic attack activity,"" said Mr Barak. To make them even more realistic, he said, each one was also configured to superficially resemble a legitimate server. Each one could accept requests for webpages, file transfers and secure networking. The attack bots look for well-known weaknesses in widely used web applications ""They had no more depth than that,"" he said, meaning the servers were not capable of doing anything more than providing a very basic response to a query about these basic net services and protocols. ""There was no assumption that anyone was going to go in and probe it and even if they did, there's nothing there for them to find,"" he said. 'Easy to expose secret web habits' Power firms alerted on hacker threat Deceitful data helps to thwart hackers Rehab for teenage hackers The servers' limited responses did not deter the automated attack tools, or bots, that many cyber-thieves use to find potential targets, he said. A wide variety of attack bots probed the servers seeking weaknesses that could be exploited had they been full-blown, production machines. Many of the code vulnerabilities and other loopholes they looked for had been known about for months or years, he said. However, added Mr Barak, many organisations struggled to keep servers up-to-date with the patches that would thwart these bots potentially giving attackers a way to get at the server. During the experiment: 17% of the attack bots were scrapers that sought to suck up all the web content they found 37% looked for vulnerabilities in web apps or tried well-known admin passwords 10% checked for bugs in web applications the servers might have been running 29% tried to get at user accounts using brute force techniques that tried commonly used passwords 7% sought loopholes in the operating system software the servers were supposedly running ""This was a very typical pattern for these automatic bots,"" said Mr Barak. ""They used similar techniques to those we've seen before. There's nothing particularly new."" As well as running a bank of servers for the BBC, Cybereason also sought to find out how quickly phishing gangs start to target new employees. It seeded 100 legitimate marketing email lists with spoof addresses and then waited to see what would turn up. Phishing gangs were quick to find new email addresses and start sending booby-trapped messages After 21 hours, the first booby-trapped phishing email landed in the email inbox for the fake employees, said Mr Barak. It was followed by a steady trickle of messages that sought, in many different ways, to trick people into opening malicious attachments. About 15% of the emails contained a link to a compromised webpage that, if visited, would launch an attack that would compromise the visitor's PC. The other 85% of the phishing messages had malicious attachments. The account received booby-trapped Microsoft Office documents, Adobe PDFs and executable files. We use a lots of honeypots in a lot of different ways. The concept really scales to almost any kind of thing where you can create a believable fake or even a real version of something. You put it out and see who turns up to hit it or break it. There are honeypots, honey-nets, honey-tokens, honey anything. When a customer sees a threat that's hit hundreds of honeypots that's different to when they see one that no-one else has. That context in terms of attack is very useful. Some are thin but some have a lot more depth and are scaled very broadly. Sometimes you put up the equivalent of a fake shop-front to see who turns up to attack it. If you see an approach that you've never seen before then you might let that in and see what you can learn from it. The most sophisticated adversaries are often very targeted when they go after specific companies or individuals. Mr Barak said the techniques used by the bots were a good guide to what organisations should do to avoid falling victim. They should harden servers by patching, controls around admin access, check apps to make sure they are not harbouring well-known bugs and enforce strong passwords Criminals often have different targets in mind when seeking out vulnerable servers, he said. Some were keen to hijack user accounts and others sought to take over servers and use them for their own ends. Honeypots have become a useful tool for security firms keen to understand hack attack techniques Cyber-thieves would look through the logs compiled by attack bots to see if they have turned up any useful or lucrative targets. There had been times when a server compromised by a bot was passed on to another criminal gang because it was at a bank, government or other high-value target. ""They sell access to parts of their botnet and offer other attackers access to machines their bots are active on,"" he said. ""We have seen cases where a very typical bot infection turns into a manual operation."" In those cases, attackers would then use the foothold gained by the bots as a starting point for a more comprehensive attack. It's at that point, he said, hackers would take over and start to use other digital attack tools to penetrate further into a compromised organisation. He said: ""Once an adversary has got to a certain level in an organisation you have to ask what will they do next?"" In a bid to explore what happens in those situations, Cybereason is now planning to set up more servers and give these more depth to make them even more tempting targets. The idea is, he said, to get a close look at the techniques hackers use when they embark on a serious attack. ""We'll look for more sophisticated, manual operations,"" he said. ""We'll want to see the techniques they use and if there is any monetisation of the method.""

"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""As tough as this was, it's been a wonderful thing"" US President Donald Trump has praised the relief response to Hurricane Harvey on his second visit to flood-hit states. ""Things are working out well,"" he said of the efforts, as he and wife Melania met victims and volunteers in Texas. ""As tough as this was, it's been a wonderful thing,"" he added. ""I think even for the country to watch and for the world to watch."" The devastating hurricane made landfall in the state a week ago. Some residents have been allowed to return to their homes but flood waters are still rising in other areas. Harvey has been blamed for at least 47 deaths, and about 43,000 people are currently housed in shelters. President Trump and the first lady visited Texas earlier in the week but stayed clear of the disaster zone, saying they did not want to divert resources from rescue work. However, the president was criticised for not meeting victims of the flooding and for focusing largely on the logistics of the government response. Uninsured and anxious, victims return home How hard has Harvey hit the local economy? Visiting Texas again on Saturday, Mr and Mrs Trump made a point of meeting flood survivors and volunteers in Houston. They took part in food distribution at a shelter, handing out packed lunches, and posed for photographs with victims when they requested it. During a tour of a shelter, the president said: ""I think people appreciate what's been done. It's been done very efficiently, very well, and that's what we want. We've very happy with the way things are going. A lot of love. There's a lot of love."" The president and his wife then travelled to Lake Charles, Louisiana, which also suffered flash floods, before flying back to Washington. President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump greeted children at a centre for flood survivors in Houston Amid the destruction, stories have been shared of people opening their homes and businesses to others, andforming human chainsto save people from treacherous rising waters. However, many are also now returning to destroyed homeswithout the insurance to fix them. Experts estimate that only about 20% of those in Houston's worst hit areas have flood insurance. This video can not be played Flood victims have been returning to inspect the damage Mr Trump has asked Congress for $7.8bn (Â£6bn) as an initial payment to help with recovery efforts following the flooding in both Texas and Louisiana, which has also hit production at America's main petrol and oil refining centre. The White House said on Saturday that the president had authorised an increase in the level of federal funding available for debris removal and emergency protective measures. Governor of Texas Greg Abbott has said the state may need more than $125bn in aid. The president has declared Sunday a ""National Day of Prayer,external"" for victims of Hurricane Harvey. Administration officials say there will be further requests for funds when the full impact of Hurricane Harvey becomes known. Harvey dumped an estimated 20 trillion gallons of rain on the Houston area. Why was Houston not evacuated? Hurricane Harvey: The climate link Governor Abbott has warned that the recovery programme will be a ""multi-year project"". ""This is going to be a massive, massive clean-up process,"" he told ABC News. The Environmental Protection Agency has warned that floodwater can contain bacteria and other contaminants from overflowing sewers. It said the biggest threat to public health was access to safe drinking water. Authorities in flood-hit Orange County, east of Beaumont, imposed a curfew on Saturday night to give its residents ""peace of mind"", officials said. Looting in Houston earlier in the week led to a curfew being implemented.

Meanwhile, the Houston Astros, the city's Major League Baseball team, returned home to take on the New York Mets on Saturday. Tributes were paid to those killed ahead of the game. The team abandoned their home stadium this week, playing three games in Florida against the Texas Rangers.

"This photo is from Bangladesh in 1971 but is being shared on social media to describe Rohingya people in Myanmar as terrorists A recent surge inviolence in the northern part of Myanmar's Rakhine statehas been accompanied by a slew of misleading images being shared on social media. Photos and video purporting to be from the conflict have been circulated widely. Much of it is gruesome and inflammatory, and much of it is wrong. Deep-seated mistrust and rivalry between Rohingya Muslims and the majority Buddhist population in Rakhine have led to deadly communal violence in the past. The Rohingya have faced decades of persecution in Myanmar where they are denied citizenship. WARNING: This article contains images some people may find upsetting. Information is very sketchy and journalists have very limited access to this region. Even those who have managed to reach the area have found that the volatile situation and intense hostility towards the Rohingyas makes it very difficult to gather information. Here is what we know about what is happening in Rakhine: Last week, after weeks of rising tension, militants from a new group calling itself the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army attacked at least 25 police posts Clashes were reported in many other areas, sometimes involving Rohingya villagers joining the militants to fight the security forces But in many cases the security forces, sometimes backed by armed Buddhist civilians, burned Rohingya villages and opened fire on their inhabitants, according to reports Buddhist communities have also been attacked, and some of their inhabitants killed The UN estimates 40,000 Rohingyahave crossed the border to Bangladesh, bringing stories of appalling abuses On 29 August, the Turkish Deputy Prime Minister, Mehmet Simsek, tweeted four photographs, urging the international community to stop the ethnic cleansing of Rohingyas. His post was retweeted more than 1,600 times, and liked by more than 1,200 readers. But he was quickly criticised about the authenticity of the photographs. Three days after his tweet, with many people challenging the images, Mr Simsek deleted it. The BBC has blurred parts of these images because they are too distressing to show The first photograph, showing a number of bloated corpses, has been the hardest to track down. A number of Burmese who have challenged Mr Simsek for the tweet have suggested they are victims of the devastating Cyclone Nargis in May 2008. Others suggested they are victims of river boat accidents in Myanmar. No similar photographs can be found related to those events. But the image does appear on a several websites dated last year (we have not linked to these sites due to the graphic content). This suggests the image is not from the recent violence in Rakhine state. The BBC has ascertained that the second photograph, of a woman mourning a dead man tied to a tree, was taken in Aceh, Indonesia, in June 2003, by a photographer working for Reuters. The third photograph, of two infants crying over the body of their mother, is from Rwanda in July 1994. It was taken by Albert Facelly for Sipa, and was one of series of photos that won a World Press Award. It has also been difficult to track down the fourth image, of people immersed in a canal, but it can be found on awebsite appealing for funds,externalto help victims of recent flooding in Nepal. There is now a frenzied social media war around the Rohingyas as the rival stories of each side battle for supremacy. I have personally been bombarded with gruesome images, purporting to show victims of massacres, most of which are difficult to verify. But some of the images are clearly wrong. One image I was sent (below), supposedly showing Rohingya militants training with rifles, turned out to be aphotograph of Bangladeshi volunteers fighting in the 1971 independence war,external.

Earlier this year, when a team from theUnited Nations Human Rights Commission carried out research,externalinto alleged human rights violations in Rakhine state, it refused to use any photographs or video it had not taken itself, because of the problem of authenticating such material. Their report gives meticulous details of their methodology. Yet its findings, of ""devastating cruelty"" towards the Rohingya community, and actions it said could amount to crimes against humanity, were rejected by the Myanmar government, which then refused to issue visas for a fact-finding mission to Rakhine state. The information we are piecing together from different sources on the current situation in Rakhine state paints a clear picture of a serious conflict, with large-scale human casualties. There appear to have been atrocities committed by both sides, but the situation for the Rohingya, now under sustained attack by the security forces and armed civilians, appears to be far worse. Obtaining an accurate picture of what is happening, though, will take a long time, given how little access neutral observers have to the area. But the social media disinformation campaigns will harden attitudes on both sides, and quite possibly make the conflict worse.

"Taylor Swift is spilling some tea in her new song Taylor Swift has stormed the charts with her comeback single, Look What You Made Me Do,breaking several streaming recordsin the process. As you'll no doubt be aware, the lyrics concern her long and tedious feud with Kanye West, which began when the rapper rushed on stage during Swift's acceptance speech at the MTV Awards. The song comes hot on the heels of Katy Perry's Swish Swish, allegedly about her own beef with Team Taylor and itself a riposte to Swift's song Bad Blood. None of these songs, it has to be said, are among their authors' best work - which got me wondering whether pop feuds had ever resulted in noteworthy songs. I put the question to Twitter last week,external, and instantly received dozens of brilliant replies. So here are seven of the best verses with vendettas. In his youth, Neil Young had a very dim view of the American South. He wrote two songs -Southern Man,externalandAlabama,external- which criticised white citizens for building their wealth on the back of slave labour, asking: ""When will you pay them back?"" Lynyrd Skynyrd singer Ronnie Van Zant was incensed. ""We thought Neil was shooting all the ducks in order to kill one or two,"" he said, pointing out that many people had opposed racism and segregation. His riposte came inSweet Home Alabama,external, where he sang: ""Well, I hope Neil Young will remember / A Southern Man don't need him around."" The song became a huge hit, and even Young loved it. ""Alabama richly deserved the shot Lynyrd Skynyrd gave me in their greatest song,"" he wrote in his 2012 memoir. ""I don't like my words when I listen to it. They are accusatory and condescending, not fully thought out, and too easy to misconstrue."" When girl group Destiny's Child lost three members in quick succession, commentators compared the band to the rotating cast of US reality show Survivor. That prompted Beyonce into the studio, where she penned a strident anthem to empowerment and resilience. ""Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better,"" she castigated her former bandmates. ""You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold nine million."" Survivor,externalwon a Grammy, but two of those former bandmates, Letoya Luckett and LaTavia Roberson,sued Destiny's Child,externalover the lyrics, contending they made derisive comments about them, in violation of a previous settlement which prevented either party from making ""any public comment of a disparaging nature concerning one another"". The case was eventually dropped - and Beyonce went on to become Beyonce. Written as a response to the turmoil in his personal life after the mania surrounding Purple Rain,Old Friends 4 Sale,externalwas one of the most scathing songs Prince ever composed. It was triggered, in part, by the betrayal of his trusted bodyguard ""Big"" Chick Huntsberry (above left), who sold a fictitious story about Prince to the National Enquirer, allegedly to fund his cocaine habit. Prince also takes aim at two former friends ""who got stuck in the snow"" - another cocaine reference - before concluding: ""Some things are better left unsaid / And some people are better left untrusted."" It's a mournful, sombre song, unlike almost anything else in Prince's back catalogue - but it was either too personal or too painful to be released. Prince sat on it until 1991, at which point he re-recorded the vocals, neutering the most caustic lyrics out of sympathy for Huntsberry, who had died a year earlier. Sadly, that inferior version is the only one that's been officially released, appearing on the 1999 compilation The Vault: Old Friends 4 Sale. My original plan was to exclude break-up songs from this list - otherwise the entire thing would be the tracklisting for Fleetwood Mac's Rumours - but Feargal Sharkey's story is too good not to tell (thanks to Penny Andrews forbringing it to my attention,external). A Good Heart,externalwas a number one single for the former Undertones frontman in 1985, but it was written by Maria ""Show Me Heaven"" McKee about the end of her relationship with Benmont Tench, the keyboard player in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. As break-up songs go, it's fairly anodyne - but it prompted a furious response from Tench, who dashed off a red ink reply and sent it to Sharkey. CalledYou Little Thief,external, it contains one of the coldest lyrics in pop: ""You little dream / You little nightmare / You little nothing / You little girl"". The poison darts keep coming for a full five minutes, until Tench rounds off his rant with the devastating couplet: ""There's no hard feelings / There's no feelings at all."" Sharkey released You Little Thief as his next single, and placed the tracks side-by-side on his album - effectively becoming the mouthpiece for this lovers' quarrel. Interestingly, Tench recently denied writing You Little Thief about McKee, rewriting this slice of pop history. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Perhaps The Libertines' best song,You Can't Stand Me Now,externalwas written in a two-star Parisian hotel, just after Pete Doherty was released from prison for burgling guitarist Carl Barat's flat. The lyrics are a thinly veiled account of their love/hate relationship, with references to Doherty's heroin addiction and his ""light fingers"". The first verse finds them apportioning blame. ""You twist and tore our love apart,"" accuses Barat, ""You know you've got it the wrong way round,"" retorts Doherty, reprimanding his bandmate for getting him locked up. By the chorus, they're trading the line ""You can't stand me now"". Although the song is shot through with affection, the relationship couldn't withstand Doherty's addictions, and the Libertines split six months later. ""Mariah, what ever happened to us, why did we have to break up?"" rapped Eminem on his 2009 track Bagpipes From Baghdad. Mariah's response? ""You're delusional, boy, you're losing your mind"". The pair had allegedly dated for six months in 2001, with Eminem referencing their dalliance in several of his later songs. Mariah always denied the relationship, telling Maxim she'd ""hung out"" with Eminem ""a total of four times. And I don't consider that dating somebody"". So when he continued to write about Mariah, she snapped. ""Why you so obsessed with me?"" she sang in abarely disguised tirade,external. ""Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows  / It's clear that you're upset with me."" Then came the sucker punch: ""Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress."" Robbie's departure from Take That was notoriously rocky. They issued him an ultimatum - ""clean up your act or quit the band"" - and he called their bluff by quitting to become the UK's biggest pop star. But he still harboured a long-standing grudge against Gary Barlow, saying in 2010: ""I wanted to crush him. I wanted to crush the memory of the band - and I didn't let go."" The anger spilled out onNo Regrets,external, the second single from Williams' second solo album, I've Been Expecting You. The backing vocals (performed by Neil Tennant) recount his bandmates' criticisms - from the banal ""we've been told you stay up late"", to the cruel, ""you're too short to carry weight"". ""I don't want to hate but that's all you've left me with,"" Robbie seethes, before declaring: ""I guess the love we had is officially dead"". They've patched things up since - even performing the song together on Take That's 2011 Progress tour. When Robbie sings it now, the closing lyric is rewritten to say: ""The love we have is officially alive."" Taylor Swift, take note.

"Money is short and school uniforms are needed for the new term, or there are Christmas wishes are to be fulfilled. At the door is a friendly face, often a neighbour, offering an expensive but convenient and immediate cash loan. The deal is done and the relationship between customer and agent begins. ""We would come to know everything about them,"" says one agent. ""By the second month, we would know what colour clothes they wore on a Friday."" ""They could call us and we would go and do a loan. Our customers would come to rely on it. But we would also keep them on the straight and narrow."" Whatever the moral viewpoint of this model it was undoubtedly a very successful one for Provident Financial, the 137-year-old door-to-door lender that says it has delivered a profit every year since listing on the UK stock market in 1962. But then the Bradford-based company replaced these self-employed agents by hiring ""customer experience managers"". Clients jumped ship, profit warnings were issued, the company's share price plummeted, and its chief executive resigned. The reasons for this business decision are complex, with regulation and accountability part of the equation. Yet, back on the doorstep, those in financial strife remain. So who are these millions of customers, what will they do, and is the door-to-door lending model damaged? Most of the self-employed agents were women as, they say, were their customers. There were single mums, tenants and people living on the breadline, but there were also professionals such as teachers and builders who may have had credit issues in the past which blocked them from the mainstream market. Their loans have been relatively expensive. Somebody borrowing Â£200, and paying it back over 26 weeks, would generally pay interest of more than Â£100. Former agents - many of whom are angry at the way they were moved out by the company - say that the personal touch, as much as the convenience, was the key selling point for these doorstep loans. ""Somebody is coming to the door. A few of my customers didn't see anybody, so they liked the wee interaction,"" former agent Daniel Miskelly told BBC Radio 5 Live. Two ex-agents, who wished to remain anonymous, say that on the odd occasion, understanding the sensitivity of borrowing, this personal touch extended to picking up repayments in secret from a rubbish bin. It also meant they could talk some customers out of loans they thought might get them into financial trouble. They still receive calls from their old customers. There were ""cuddles and tears"" when they stopped working for Provident. The company has ""taken the personal"" out of Provident, they say. Provident Financial shakes up management How much can I get for my false teeth? Reality Check: Has personal debt been growing? How life has changed for a Provident agent Even though it may have been a positive for the company, those personal relationships may have actually been a weakness for many customers, according to debt charities. StepChange says that customers struggling with repayments may feel more of an obligation to keep repaying doorstep loans, owing to that personal relationship, when they should instead be concentrating on repaying priority debts such as rent, or council tax. Rolled over loans tend to lock people into long-term debt, it adds, and many of those who sought help from the charity also had other forms of high-cost credit. For example, 54% of the charity's clients who had doorstep loans also owed an average Â£2,681 in total on more than two credit cards. Another charity - Citizens Advice - says that some doorstep loan customers might not get such a friendly service from providers in general. ""Although some customers like the personalised experience of a doorstep loan, where a lending agent visits their house each week to collect a repayment, for other customers it can cause big problems,"" it says. ""Citizens Advice has seen many cases where lending agents use high-pressure sales tactics, carry out inadequate affordability checks to issue a loan, and use aggressive practices to collect repayments."" One borrower, who did not want to be named, says she was sold a loan while suffering from depression. Although the agent was ""pleasant"", she says, she never really wanted anyone to come to the door. ""That loan should never have been made. They put the money in front of me,"" she says. Eventually the debt was written off. Mick McAteer, founder of the Financial Inclusion Centre, says that the temptation provided by high-cost lenders as a whole has caused wider financial difficulties. ""These lenders made it incredibly easy to borrow money. It is quick to borrow money, whereas it takes time and effort to save and years to see the benefits,"" he says. ""[High-cost credit customers] see money in their hand very quickly. It is immediate gratification."" He says that the strict regulation of the payday lending industry had been one of the most effective developments of recent years, creating a gap in the market which he hopes will be filled by credit unions. There is little evidence of that so far, nor do these not-for-profit credit unions appear to have filled the gap left by Provident Financial's woes. Earlier this week, Provident's major competitor, Morses Club, said its loan book had increased by 12% in the six months to the end of August, and that the number of customers had also grown by 12% to 233,000. It has hired a number of Provident's old agents. Its chief executive, Paul Smith, said the firm had ""capitalised on market conditions"" but that its growth had been ""accelerated by Provident's current position, rather than caused by its position"". It will take much longer to know whether the customers themselves are able to capitalise too.
