"Michel Barnier said EU leaders needed to be ready for Mr Johnson to ""heap pressure"" on EU unity Top European officials have rebuffed the Brexit policy of Boris Johnson after his first speech to UK MPs. The new prime minister said he was committed to ""getting rid"" of the Irish border backstop, which has long been a bone of contention in negotiations. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said removing the backstop guarantee was unacceptable. Mr Johnson also spoke on the phone with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Mr Juncker reiterated the EU's position that the already-negotiated withdrawal agreement was the best one possible â though he said the commission would be available over the coming weeks if the UK wanted to hold talks. Boris Johnson gave his first statement in the House of Commons since becoming prime minister, and set out his position on Brexit, which he has promised to complete by 31 October. The backstop is a key piece of the deal negotiated by his predecessor's government, dictating what will happen to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is a last resort that guarantees a frictionless border if no better solution is devised in time - by maintaining close ties between the UK and the EU until such a solution is found. ""No country that values its independence, and indeed its self-respect, could agree to a treaty which signed away our economic independence and self-government as this backstop does,"" Mr Johnson said. Responding to questions from MPs, he said he was committed to ""getting rid"" of the backstop, describing it as ""divisive"" and ""anti-democratic"".

""[It] poses that appalling choice to the British government and the British people - to the United Kingdom - of losing control of our trade, losing control of our regulation or else surrendering the government of the United Kingdom,"" he added. After the speech, Mr Barnier sent a note to European leaders, repeating the EU's position that getting rid of the backstop was  ""of course unacceptable"", and labelling Mr Johnson's speech ""rather combative"". Boris Johnson promises start of 'golden age' Does a new UK PM mean a new Brexit plan in Brussels? Does the UK owe the EU Â£39bn? But he added that despite disagreements over the backstop, the EU was prepared to ""work constructively, within our own mandate"", and was prepared to analyse ""any UK idea on withdrawal issues that are compatible with the existing withdrawal agreement"". Concerning the possibility of a no deal, he said it would not be ""the EU's choice"" but ""we have to be ready for a situation where he [Mr Johnson] gives priority to the planning for 'no deal', partly to heap pressure on the unity of the EU27."" ""In any case, what remains essential on our side is to remain calm, stick to our principles and guidelines and show solidarity and unity of the 27."" He added that he would ""remain available throughout the summer for talks with the UK"". Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Downing Street did not respond directly to Mr Barnier's comments, but the prime minister's official spokesman said the PM would be ""energetic in the pursuit"" of a deal. But he added that Theresa May's withdrawal agreement had ""been rejected three times"" by MPs and was ""clearly not acceptable to them"". However, at a news conference in County Donegal, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said, ""without the backstop there is no withdrawal agreement, there's no transition phase, there's no implementation phase, and there will be no free trade agreement until all those matters are resolved"". Alberto Costa has campaigned for the rights of EU citizens in the UK to be guaranteed Meanwhile, Mr Johnson is coming under pressure from one of his own MPs to introduce a law guaranteeing the rights of EU citizens living in the UK. The prime minister said EU citizens would have ""absolute certainty"" of their right to live and remain in the country. Alberto Costa - who resigned as a parliamentary aide over the issue - welcomed the statement, but said the promise should be ""underpinned by law"". Does the UK owe the EU Â£39bn?

"Amjad al-Abdullah scrambled to rescue his two young daughters trapped below him when their building was struck in an air strike A striking picture of a five-year-old girl grabbing her dangling sister's T-shirt after air strikes in northern Syria has circulated on social media. The girls' horrified father is shown scrambling to rescue his daughters from the building's rubble in Ariha, Idlib, after government bombing of the town on Wednesday. ""He [the photographer] couldn't see anything at first because of the rubble and dust - but then he heard the sounds of babies, children, and the father,"" media outlet SY-24 told BBC News. Warning: This article contains a distressing image and video It has brought attention back to the war in Syria, where the Russian-backed government is trying to recapture Idlib from rebels and jihadists. The UN said last week that more than 350 civilians had been killed and 330,000 forced to flee their homes since fighting in northern Syria escalated on 29 April. A wheelchair in the rubble of destroyed buildings in Ariha on Wednesday Journalist Bashar al-Sheikh filmed the family trapped in the rubble when covering the air strikes on Ariha, before stopping to help them. Moments later, the building collapsed, further injuring the trapped children, five-year-old Riham and seven-month-old Tuqa. Five-year-old Riham died after grabbing on to her baby sister, Tuqa, after their building was struck in air strikes The girls were freed from the ruins and after being taken initially to a local clinic, they were transferred to a larger hospital in Idlib. Why does the battle for Idlib matter? Why is there a war in Syria? Who's in control of Idlib? Riham died from her injuries and her baby sister remains in the intensive care unit, according to SY-24. Their father has been identified as Amjad al-Abdullah, from Ariha. His wife, Asmaa Naqouhl, was killed at the scene. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Syria Civil Defence, whose volunteer first responders are widely known as the White Helmets, said they rescued another young man from the ruins of his house. On Wednesday, 20 civilians, including five children, died in air strikes on at least three areas of the province,  according to the UK-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Russian air strikes had killed 10 people from one family, including three children, in Khan-Sheikun, it said. It is unclear how the group identified the attacking planes as Russian.

Idlib, northern Hama and western Aleppo province make up the last opposition stronghold in Syria after eight years of civil war. It is supposedly covered by a truce brokered in September by Russia and opposition-backer Turkey that spared the 2.7 million civilians living there from a major government offensive. The photograph is the latest in a series of shocking pictures that have focused the world's attention on Syria. Pictures of drowned toddler Alan Kurdi on a beach in Turkey shocked the world in 2015, leading to promises from global leaders to address the Syrian refugee crisis. In 2016a photograph of five-year-old Omran Daqneeshbloodied and stunned in the back of ambulance during the battle for northern city Aleppo caused outrage. He has since beenpictured in his new home with his family. Los Angeles mayor to give update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Alphabet's Google is a dominant force in online advertising Google-parent Alphabet and the online retail giant Amazon have both reported a near 20% rise in revenues for the latest quarter. Alphabet said advertisers were spending more on its search and YouTube services. However Amazon reported profits that were lower than expected, as it invests to speed up delivery times. Both firms are under scrutiny from authorities in the US over their market dominance, alongside other tech firms. Amazon, which is shifting away from buying and selling products itself, and focusing on its role as a marketplace for other merchants, reported revenues for the latest quarter of $63.4bn (Â£51bn). ""Customers are responding to Prime's move to one-day delivery â we've received a lot of positive feedback and seen accelerating sales growth,"" Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and chief executive, said in Thursday's news release. Amazon's profit for the quarter, at $2.6bn, were below Wall Street's expectations and the firm said profits would slip slightly in the current quarter. Will the US break up the tech giants? Facebook 'rocked to its very foundations' After-tax profits at Alphabet, the firm that owns YouTube and Google, tripled compared to a year ago to $9.9bn, beating analysts' expectations. Alphabet's revenues rose 19% compared to a year earlier, to $38.9bn. Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, said both its traditional services and new technology such as artificial intelligence were fuelling the firm's  growth. ""From improvements in core information products such as Search, Maps and the Google Assistant, to new breakthroughs in AI and our growing cloud and hardware offerings, I'm incredibly excited by the momentum across Google's businesses,"" he said. But the strong financial performance comes at time when regulators are beginning to flex their muscles around the tech giants. The EU has imposed three fines on Google over the last two years over competition issues, totalling more than $9bn. Brussels has also just launched an investigation into whether Amazon's use of data on its marketplace breaches EU competition rules. The US Department of Justice (DoJ) announced earlier this week it was opening a broad investigation of major digital technology firms in what one analyst described as a ""major shot across the bows"" of those companies. While the DoJ did not identify specific firms by name, the scope of the investigation is widely believed to include Alphabet and Amazon as well as Facebook and potentially Apple. The DoJ said its review would consider ""whether and how market-leading online platforms have achieved market power and are engaging in practices that have reduced competition, stifled innovation or otherwise harmed consumers"".

"ASAP Rocky has been charged with assault US President Donald Trump has demanded that Sweden ""give ASAP Rocky his freedom"" in a series of tweets. The musician, real name Rakim Myers, has been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm in Stockholm. He will remain in custody until a trial takes place. Mr Trump said on Twitter that Sweden had ""let our African American community down"". ASAP was arrested on 3 July following a fight that was captured on video. Two other men who were with them at the time have also been charged with assault. The musician says that his group was being followed by a group of men and he acted in self-defence. Donald Trump said last week that he had spoken to Swedish prime minister Stefan Lofven about ASAP's case.

"The UK government has said it will provide a Royal Navy escort for British-flagged ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz - amid increasing diplomatic tensions in the Gulf. Ship owners are being advised to give details of their route so they can be escorted by the frigate HMS Montrose. The move follows the seizure of the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero by Iran's Revolutionary Guard on Friday. The ship's ownersaid the crew is safeand co-operating with officials. Shipping firm Stena Bulk said its 23 crew members - who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino - had been able to talk directly to their families for a limited time. The decision to provide a military escort to merchant shipping follows a meeting of Downing Street's emergency Cobra committee to discuss the situation in the Gulf. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? ""The Royal Navy has been tasked to accompany British-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz, either individually or in groups, should sufficient notice be given of their passage,"" a government spokesman said. ""Freedom of navigation is crucial for the global trading system and world economy, and we will do all we can to defend it,"" he added. ""This move will provide some much needed safety and reassurance to our shipping community in this uncertain time."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman added that the government was focused on securing the release of the detained Stena Impero tanker and its crew, while ""de-escalating current tensions"" with Iran. The UK Chamber of Shipping said it welcomed the government's decision, calling the announcement ""an encouraging step"". Stena Bulk has said it is discussing the release of the tanker and has asked ""local authorities"" for access to the vessel. On Wednesday night, the MoD said HMS Montrose escorted two merchant vessels travelling together through the strait. HMS Montrose, centre, escorts the British-flagged Stena Important (front) and Sea Ploeg oil tanker through the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world's oil travels HMS Montrose is currently deployed to the region to provide reassurance for British ships, andearlier this month the MoD said it was forced to move between three Iranian boatsthat were trying to impede an oil tanker. Iran denied the incident happened and said there had been no confrontation with any foreign vessels. First contact made with tanker crew by owner Gulf crisis uniquely difficult moment for UK US-Iran relations: A brief history UK to send second warship to the Gulf That incident followed the UK's decision to seize an Iranian tanker, Grace 1, which London alleges was carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. Iran has denied the claim. On Monday, the then Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs that the UK would seek to create a European-led mission to ensure safe passage of international vessels in the Gulf. The new scheme would have a mandate to ensure freedom of navigation of international ships, the Foreign Office has said. But, while the mission would be implemented ""as quickly as possible"", Mr Hunt insisted it would not include the US as part of President Trump's policy of ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran. In April, the US tightened its own sanctions on Iran, which it had re-imposed after it withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal. The UK government has remained committed to the deal, which curbs Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions. In a joint statement issued earlier this month, UK, French and German leaders said they were ""deeply troubled"" by events in the Gulf. They added: ""We believe the time has come to act responsibly and seek a path to stop the escalation of tensions and resume dialogue.""

"This video can not be played Alister Jack: ""If we have to leave without a deal, if I feel we have prepared for that, then we will leave without a deal. That will be a Cabinet decision and that is what we all have signed up to."" Leaving the EU without a deal would not be ""seriously damaging"" if the UK prepares for it properly, the new Scottish Secretary has claimed. Alister Jack said there would be ""some bumps along the way"", but said the UK could do ""great things"" after Brexit. He has taken over as Scottish Secretary afterDavid Mundell was sackedby Boris Johnson, the new prime minister. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a no-deal Brexit would be ""catastrophic"" and would cost thousands of jobs. She wrote to Mr Johnson saying it was ""essential"" that Scotland have an ""alternative option"", and wants to hold a new independence referendum in the second half of 2020. Mr Jack said this should ""absolutely not"" happen, saying that ""we decided that in 2014"". Who is new Scottish Secretary Alister Jack? Sturgeon: Indyref2 'more essential than ever' Mr Johnson has targeted leaving the European Union at the end of the current extension to the negotiating period, on 31 October. Although he said he was confident a deal could be done, he stressed that the UK would leave on that date ""no ifs, no buts"". Ms Sturgeon highlighted Scottish government analysis that this could cost 100,000 jobs in Scotland alone. However Mr Jack told BBC Scotland that having the option of leaving without a deal ""on the table"" would help the UK ""hold our opponent's feet to the fire"" in talks. He said that it would be in the EU's interest to do a deal with the UK, but said that the whole cabinet had signed up to leave without one if necessary. Boris Johson's new-look cabinet has backed his goal of leaving the EU by October 31 He said: ""I don't think a no deal Brexit will be seriously damaging if we prepare for it properly. ""I think there will be bumps along the way, I'm realistic about that. But I think there are great opportunities for us as a nation on the other side of Brexit. ""One thing I'd like to see is a strong deal with our European partners, a free trade agreement. But we could do great free trade agreements elsewhere. ""There may be some bumps if we end up with no deal, it's not my preferred option. But I think as the fifth strongest economy in the world, we can do great things."" Mr Jack's position runs directly against that of Ms Sturgeon - and of Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford, who penned a joint letter with his Scottish counterpart urging Mr Johnson to rule out a no-deal exit. They said that while work would continue to prepare as much as possible for such a Brexit, ""there should be no doubt that the consequences would be catastrophic for all parts of the UK"". They wrote: ""It would be unconscionable for a UK Government to contemplate a chaotic no-deal exit, and we urge you to reject this possibility clearly and unambiguously as soon as possible. ""We are also clear that the decision on EU exit must now be put back to the people. ""It is the policy of both governments that the UK parliament should legislate for a further referendum. If such a referendum is held we will argue strongly that the UK should remain in the EU."" Questioned about the warnings from the two first minsters, Mr Jack said ""they're both remainers, they would say that"".

"The RNLI and Coastguard brought members of the public back from East Beach Emergency services evacuated 30 people from a beach in Lossiemouth following concerns they would become stranded. The footbridge to East Beach was closed on Wednesday when structural engineers ruled it was unsafe. People wanting to reach the beach waded across the river to avoid a detour. But the beachgoers were brought back from the beach by the RNLI and the Coastguard for their safety, following concern they would be stranded when the tide changed. Members of the public had waded across the River Lossie to reach East Beach Moray Council said an inspection of the crossing to East Beach in Lossiemouth was carried out on Wednesday afternoon following concerns raised by members of the public. The bridge was seen to be leaning to one side. The council said the sheer number of people crossing the footbridge had led to its condition deteriorating. Signage now tells members of the public not to use the bridge The local authority said East Beach was still accessible via Lossiemouth forest car park - known as Arthur's Bridge - three miles away, and Kingston, seven miles away. The advice was for people not to wade across if there is a risk of them becoming stranded when the tide changes, but if they made that decision then they did so at their own risk. Thursday's high temperatures meant dozens flocked to Lossie Beach, and Burghead Coastguard team and Buckie's lifeboat crew assisted them back across their water for their own safety. Moray Council Convener Shona Morrison, said: ""Moray Council has obligations to ensure public safety. This includes a requirement to close any structures that appear unsafe, hence the decision was taken to close the bridge, which was the responsible course of action. ""Elected members and council officers are liaising with Lossiemouth Community Council, Lossiemouth Community Development Trust and Lossiemouth Business Association to consider future action. ""This is likely to require independent structural engineering advice. ""Meantime I would urge people to refrain from climbing on or attempting to access the bridge as we have had some reports of this since the closure. It is not currently safe for this kind of activity."" A survey commissioned by Lossiemouth Community Trust in 2017 had warned work would be needed to be carried out. 30 members of the public were picked up by emergency services Call for joint effort to tackle St Giles Centre closure blow Snow warning extended following widespread disruption St Giles Centre closure: Locals cite 'scared staff' and 'little to no investment' Fresh plans for derelict Stonehaven gasworks could see affordable homes built near harbour St Giles closure would âtake the heart out of townâ Power cut affects town centre properties Los Angeles mayor to give update on wildfires as more residents told to evacuate What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

New appointees included former leadership contender Sajid Javid as chancellor, and leading Brexiteers Dominic Raab and Priti Patel as foreign secretary and home secretary. Thursday's appointments are for more junior positions - meaning they will not attend the weekly cabinet meetings in Downing Street - but they will still have responsibility for specific policy areas, such as rail and prisons. Other new appointments include: ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey - promoted within Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs George Eustice - environment minister Conor Burns - international trade minister Chris Pincher and Andrew Stephenson - foreign ministers Chris Skidmore - health minister Chris Heaton Harris - transport minister Ministers remaining in their posts include: Jesse Norman - financial secretary to the Treasury Nick Gibb - schools minister Mark Lancaster - defence minister Andrew Murrison - foreign and international development minister Justin Tomlinson - work and pensions minister Caroline Dinenage - health minister And those who have lost their jobs include: Stephen Hammond - health minister George Hollingbery - international trade minister Harriett Baldwin - foreign and international development minister Mr Johnson held his first cabinet meeting on Thursday morning with his senior team, who he said had all committed to leaving the EU on or before 31 October, ""no ifs, no buts"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Britain would be âclean, green, prosperous, united, confident and ambitiousâ. This was followed by his first statement as prime minister to the Commons, where he outlined some of his key policies. Much of the speech focused on Brexit, and how his government would throw itself into negotiations with energy, with no-deal planning a ""top priority"". He also said EU citizens living in the UK would have their rights protected, although Downing Street was unable to confirm if there would be any new laws to underpin the commitment. And he underlined his pledge to remove the backstop - a mechanism to avoid physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in case of a no-deal Brexit - from any withdrawal agreement. But after Mr Johnson's appearance at the dispatch box, the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said eliminating the backstop was ""unacceptable"". The EU Commission's President, Jean-Claude Juncker, also underlined the EU's position in a call with Mr Johnson, saying the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the bloc and Mrs May was ""the best and only agreement possible"" for Brexit. A No 10 spokesman said Mr Johnson told him he would be ""energetic in pursuit of finding a way forward"", but that the way to a deal goes by way of the abolition of the backstop. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn gives a warning to the people who will ""lose out"" in a no-deal Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the country was ""deeply worried the new prime minister overestimates himself"". Replying to Mr Johnson in the Commons, he added: ""People do not trust this prime minister to make the right choices for the majority of the people in this country when he's also promising tax giveaways to the richest of big business - his own party's funders [a policy Mr Johnsonproposed during the leadership campaign]"".

"Amjad al-Abdullah scrambled to rescue his two young daughters trapped below him when their building was struck in an air strike A striking picture of a five-year-old girl grabbing her dangling sister's T-shirt after air strikes in northern Syria has circulated on social media. The girls' horrified father is shown scrambling to rescue his daughters from the building's rubble in Ariha, Idlib, after government bombing of the town on Wednesday. ""He [the photographer] couldn't see anything at first because of the rubble and dust - but then he heard the sounds of babies, children, and the father,"" media outlet SY-24 told BBC News. Warning: This article contains a distressing image and video It has brought attention back to the war in Syria, where the Russian-backed government is trying to recapture Idlib from rebels and jihadists. The UN said last week that more than 350 civilians had been killed and 330,000 forced to flee their homes since fighting in northern Syria escalated on 29 April. A wheelchair in the rubble of destroyed buildings in Ariha on Wednesday Journalist Bashar al-Sheikh filmed the family trapped in the rubble when covering the air strikes on Ariha, before stopping to help them. Moments later, the building collapsed, further injuring the trapped children, five-year-old Riham and seven-month-old Tuqa. Five-year-old Riham died after grabbing on to her baby sister, Tuqa, after their building was struck in air strikes The girls were freed from the ruins and after being taken initially to a local clinic, they were transferred to a larger hospital in Idlib. Why does the battle for Idlib matter? Why is there a war in Syria? Who's in control of Idlib? Riham died from her injuries and her baby sister remains in the intensive care unit, according to SY-24. Their father has been identified as Amjad al-Abdullah, from Ariha. His wife, Asmaa Naqouhl, was killed at the scene. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Syria Civil Defence, whose volunteer first responders are widely known as the White Helmets, said they rescued another young man from the ruins of his house. On Wednesday, 20 civilians, including five children, died in air strikes on at least three areas of the province,  according to the UK-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Russian air strikes had killed 10 people from one family, including three children, in Khan-Sheikun, it said. It is unclear how the group identified the attacking planes as Russian. This video can not be played Dr Murhaf: ""We need to know more about surgery for war zone children"" On Monday,at least 31 civilians were killed in rebel-held town Maarat al-Numanwhen warplanes targeted a market and residential areas. Idlib, northern Hama and western Aleppo province make up the last opposition stronghold in Syria after eight years of civil war. It is supposedly covered by a truce brokered in September by Russia and opposition-backer Turkey that spared the 2.7 million civilians living there from a major government offensive. The photograph is the latest in a series of shocking pictures that have focused the world's attention on Syria. Pictures of drowned toddler Alan Kurdi on a beach in Turkey shocked the world in 2015, leading to promises from global leaders to address the Syrian refugee crisis. In 2016a photograph of five-year-old Omran Daqneeshbloodied and stunned in the back of ambulance during the battle for northern city Aleppo caused outrage.

"The Sunderland plant opened in 1986 Japanese car giant Nissan has said it will cut 12,500 jobs around the world, more than double the amount previously announced. It will reduce its production capacity and the number of models it produces by 10% by the end of 2022, but it did not say where the cuts will fall. It comes as the firm tries to shore up its finances amid weakening sales. Union sources said they were hopeful Nissan's Sunderland car plant would escape the cuts. In May, it announced job losses of 4,800, which are included in the new total. Nissan cuts two models from Sunderland plant Nissan boss was too powerful, report finds Carlos Ghosn: Former Nissan boss hit with fresh charge On Thursday, the firm announced a 94.5% fall in net profit for the first quarter of 2019 - one of its worst quarterly performances in a decade. Nissan has been struggling in the US, a key market, where it has been heavily discounting to keep up with sales by rivals. It also reported first-quarter sales falls in Europe, Asia and Oceania, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. The firm is reining in its operations after years of expansion under former chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was ousted last year after being accused of financial crimes. In a news conference, chief executive Hiroto Saikawa said the job cuts would account for a ""big portion"" of the savings it was trying to make. Of the 12,500 job losses, 6,400 have already been implemented at eight locations, he said. Nissan plans to shed another 6,100 jobs between the 2020 and 2022 financial years at six locations. He did not specify which models would be targeted for production cuts, but said they would be likely to affect ""compact cars and its Datsun range"". The cuts will fall on unprofitable models, Mr Saikawa added. Nissan's Sunderland plant makes profitable lines and also manufactures the Leaf electric car. Part of the firm's broader strategy is a focus on electric vehicles. However, in February it announced it would build its new X-Trail model in Japan, instead of Sunderland, citing business reasons and Brexit uncertainty. A month later, itsaid it planned to end the production of two of its Infiniti cars at Sunderland. Theo Leggett, international business correspondent Battered by scandal, and struggling to curb falling sales, Nissan is taking dramatic steps. It now plans to cut 12,500 jobs worldwide and close or reduce capacity at up to 14 factories as it tries to reduce excess capacity and cut costs. In the three months to the end of June, the company made an operating profit of just Â£12m ($14m), compared with more than Â£800m ($1bn) in the same period last year - a decline of 98%. Sales in the US, one of its biggest markets, have declined sharply, while there have also been concerns in Europe. Last year, the company's former chairman, Carlos Ghosn, was dismissed, following his arrest in Japan on charges of financial misconduct. He denies the charges and has blamed a conspiracy among Nissan executives for his downfall.

Director Robert Nisbet said the heat was affecting metal track and overhead cables, with 20 out of 26 operators impacted. He said: âWe believe there could be
roll-on impacts tomorrow, because many of the trains will be in the wrong
places, many of the rail staff will be in the wrong places and it will take
time to re-set, to stabilise the timetable again. ""We could see disruption up

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Britain would be âclean, green, prosperous, united, confident and ambitiousâ. Boris Johnson has promised the ""beginning of a new golden age"", as he made his first Commons statement as PM. Speaking to MPs, Mr Johnson said his government would throw itself into Brexit negotiations with energy, while Michael Gove would lead on no-deal planning as a ""top priority"". He also said EU citizens living in the UK would have their rights protected. But Downing Street was unable to confirm if there would be any new laws to underpin the commitment. Tory MP Alberto Costa - who has campaigned for EU citizens' rights after Brexit - welcomed Mr Johnson's pledge, but said ""the devil, as ever, is in the detail"" and he would be ""scrutinising how that guarantee comes forward"". Replying to his statement in the Commons, Jeremy Corbyn said people ""do not trust"" the new PM to deliver on his promises. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas written to Mr Johnsonto say it is ""essential"" her country has an alternative option to his Brexit plan. Barnier attacks 'combative' Johnson speech Does the UK owe the EU Â£39bn? Prime Minister Boris Johnson: Who's in his cabinet? Live updates as Boris Johnson addresses MPs Who are Boris Johnson's key advisers? The statement came after the first meeting of Mr Johnson's new cabinet, who he said had all committed to leaving the EU on or before 31 October, ""no ifs, no buts"". New secretaries of state include former leadership contender Sajid Javid as chancellor, and leading Brexiteers, with Dominic Raab as foreign secretary and Priti Patel as home secretary. More junior ministers are expected to be announced later, with further reshuffling on Friday. Mr Johnson has also held his first calls with other foreign leaders - including Dutch PM Mark Rutte and Australian PM Scott Morrison - and is due to speak to the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker later. Much of Mr Johnson's statement focused on his plans for Brexit. Despite emphasising the importance of preparing for no deal, the new prime minister said he would ""much prefer"" to leave the EU with an agreement, saying he would work ""flat out to make it happen"". Boris Johnson gave his first statement to the Commons as PM, flanked by his new Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab (l), and his new Chancellor, Sajid Javid However, he told MPs the withdrawal agreement his predecessor, Theresa May, had negotiated with the EU was ""unacceptable to this Parliament and to this country"". That plan was voted down three times by MPs, with one of the controversial parts being the Northern Ireland backstop - a mechanism to avoid physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in case no trade deal is agreed between the UK and the EU by the end of the transition period. Mr Johnson has pledged to scrap this element of the plan, saying alternative arrangements to keep checks away from the border were ""perfectly compatible"" with the Good Friday Agreement - the peace agreement signed in 1998. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said eliminating the backstop from the withdrawal agreement was ""unacceptable"", and after Mr Johnson's ""rather combative speech"", the bloc would have to ""be ready for all scenarios"". The EU Commission's President, Jean-Claude Juncker, also underlined the EU's position in a call with Mr Johnson, saying the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the bloc and Mrs May was ""the best and only agreement possible"" for Brexit. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn gives a warning to the people who will ""lose out"" in a no-deal Brexit. Addressing MPs, Mr Johnson also said he would be looking into changing the UK's immigration system,as per his leadership campaign pledge. He wants to bring in a points-based system, similar to that used by Australia, and he said he would be asking the Migration Advisory Committee to conduct a review, ""the first step in a radical rewriting"" of the policy. The PM's spokesman later said that further details of Mr Johnson's plans would be revealed ""in the coming days and weeks"". How much would PM's shopping list cost? In Pictures: Boris Johnson becomes UK's new PM Labour's leader said the country was ""deeply worried the new prime minister overestimates himself"". Mr Corbyn added: ""People do not trust this prime minister to make the right choices for the majority of the people in this country when he's also promising tax giveaways to the richest of big business - his own party's funders [a policy Mr Johnsonproposed during the leadership campaign]"". He also asked the PM to rule out ""once and for all"" the NHS would form part of a trade deal with the US, following comments made by President Donald Trump on his visit to the UK in June. Mr Johnson said: ""Under no circumstances would we agree to any free-trade deal that put the NHS on the table."" After a raft of resignations, sackings and appointments on Wednesday night, Mr Johnson addressed his cabinet for the first time as prime minister early on Thursday. He told the cabinet they had ""a momentous task ahead"", as he repeated his commitment for the UK to leave the EU on 31 October - calling it ""a pivotal moment in our country's history"". He said the new team respected the ""depth and breadth of talent in our extraordinary party"", who were ""not going to wait until 31 October to get on with a fantastic new agenda for our country... delivering the priorities of the people"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson holds his first cabinet meeting since becoming prime minister. The appointments have already faced criticism from the opposition, with the chair of the Labour Party, Ian Lavery, calling it ""a cabinet of hard-line conservatives who will only represent the privileged few"". He comments were echoed by independent MP Nick Boles - who resigned the Conservative whip over Brexit - saying the ""few elements remaining of the liberal one-nation Conservative style are neutered captives in this cabinet"". But the new Leader of the House, Mr Rees-Mogg, who led the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group (ERG), denied there had been a ""Leave"" takeover of the cabinet. ""Boris is bringing the country together, the party together, through his cabinet appointments,"" he said. Jacob Rees-Mogg held his first business questions on Thursday after his appointment as Leader of the House The newly appointed Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has tabled an early day motion expressing a lack of confidence in the prime minister - although such motions are rarely debated and generally used to draw attention to an issue.  31ministers entitled to attend - up from 29 under Theresa May 48average age - down from 51 26%female - down from 31% 12Leave supporters (in 2016) - up from six These are the decisions of a prime minister in a hurry. One who is aware that he's up against the clock. One who has to pull off - within a few months - what his predecessor could not manage over years. The team surrounding Boris Johnson has been put together with one goal in mind - to help him keep the promise he's made, to see the country leave the European Union in good time. No 10 believes it shows strength of purpose - a new administration determined and willing to take decisions after years of drift and disappointment. Brexit believers have the top roles. But it is not a cabinet made up purely of the most burning Eurosceptics.

"Michel Barnier said EU leaders needed to be ready for Mr Johnson to ""heap pressure"" on EU unity Top European officials have rebuffed the Brexit policy of Boris Johnson after his first speech to UK MPs. The new prime minister said he was committed to ""getting rid"" of the Irish border backstop, which has long been a bone of contention in negotiations. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said removing the backstop guarantee was unacceptable. Mr Johnson also spoke on the phone with EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. Mr Juncker reiterated the EU's position that the already-negotiated withdrawal agreement was the best one possible â though he said the commission would be available over the coming weeks if the UK wanted to hold talks. Boris Johnson gave his first statement in the House of Commons since becoming prime minister, and set out his position on Brexit, which he has promised to complete by 31 October. The backstop is a key piece of the deal negotiated by his predecessor's government, dictating what will happen to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is a last resort that guarantees a frictionless border if no better solution is devised in time - by maintaining close ties between the UK and the EU until such a solution is found. ""No country that values its independence, and indeed its self-respect, could agree to a treaty which signed away our economic independence and self-government as this backstop does,"" Mr Johnson said.

"Ms Sturgeon wants to hold an independence referendum within the next two years Scotland's first minister has said an independence referendum is more important than ever as she urged Boris Johnson to ""change course"" on Brexit. In a letter to the new prime minister, Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Johnson on his appointment. But she warned that leaving the EU on 31 October without an exit deal being agreed would cause ""lasting harm"". And she said it was essential that Scotland was able to choose an ""alternative option"". In his first speech as prime minister on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Johnson said he was confident a Brexit deal could be agreed before the UK's departure date of 31 October. However, he insisted the country would be leaving on that date, ""no ifs, not buts"". Boris Johnson promises start of 'golden age' A prime minister in a hurry Johnson sacks Mundell as Scottish secretary Mr Johnson insisted in the Commons on Thursday that a ""fantastic, sensible and progressive Brexit"" would kill off calls for independence. But the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, predicted Mr Johnson would be the ""last prime minister of the United Kingdom"". Ms Sturgeon used her letter to highlight previous Scottish government research which suggested a no-deal Brexit could cost 100,000 jobs in Scotland. The research also claimed that even a free trade agreement could see a fall in Scottish national income of about Â£1,600 per person compared with continuing EU membership. Mr Johnson hosted the first meeting of his new ministerial team on Thursday morning Ms Sturgeon said: ""I urge you to study this analysis closely so that you understand the implications for Scotland of the policy you are pursuing on Brexit and why it is therefore imperative that you change course immediately to avoid causing lasting harm to the people of Scotland. ""However, given your public comments about leaving the EU on 31 October with or without a deal, 'come what may' and 'do or die', it is now - more than ever - essential that in Scotland we have an alternative option. ""In line with the democratic mandate given to us in 2016, the Scottish government will continue to make preparations to give people in Scotland the choice of becoming an independent country."" Ms Sturgeon also said it was a ""basic democratic principle"" that the people of Scotland should be able to ""determine their own future"". Ruth Davidson is said to be ""livid"" over the sacking of David Mundell as Scottish secretary The first minister announced in April of this year that she wanted to hold indyref2 by 2021, although she conceded that she would need the consent of the UK government before that could happen. Mr Johnson pledged during the Conservative leadership contest that he would be ""minister for the Union"" as well as prime minister. He used his speech outside 10 Downing Street on Wednesday to describe the nations of the UK as the ""awesome foursome that are incarnated in that red, white, and blue flag"". And he said that the United Kingdom made all four nations ""so much more than the sum of their parts, and whose brand and political personality is admired and even loved around the world"". Alisrter Jack has been appointed as the new Scottish secretary Mr Johnson sacked Scottish Secretary David Mundell - who has openly criticised him in the past - as he carried out a major overhaul of the cabinet, with Dumfries and Galloway MP Alister Jack taking over the role. Mr Mundell told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that he would have been willing to remain in Mr Johnson's cabinet so he could work with the prime minister to ""secure Scotland's place in the Union and to deliver Brexit."" BBC Scotland understands there is anger among some Scottish Conservatives over his sacking - with a source saying that party leader Ruth Davidson is ""absolutely livid"". Ms Davidson, a close political ally of Mr Mundell, said earlier this week that she wanted him to remain in the job, and that the new prime minister ""would do well to take David's advice on Scotland"". She added: ""If the prime minister chose to keep on David Mundell, I would be very happy with that."" The source also claimed that the possibility of the Scottish Conservatives breaking away from the UK party was ""high and growing"", and was likely to be ""the first and possibly the only item on the agenda"" during an ""away day"" for Tory MSPs at the end of August. Who is new Scottish Secretary Alister Jack? David Mundell: The Remainer who had to go Mr Jack used his first public statement to defend the Union, and promised to stand up for the majority of Scots who voted to remain part of the UK in the 2014 referendum ""against those who would try to impose unwanted and divisive constitutional change"". He said: ""We need to continue to defend the Union against those who would seek to tear it apart. In 2014, the people of Scotland voted to remain part of a strong United Kingdom. ""We will stand up for their decision against those who would try to impose unwanted and divisive constitutional change."" Mr Jack attended the first meeting of Mr Johnson's new Cabinet on Thursday morning. The SNP manifesto ahead of its victory in the last Holyrood election saida referendum should be held if there was a ""significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will"". Ms Sturgeon said immediately after the EU referendum that the 2015 manifesto pledge gave her a mandate to hold another referendum in the autumn of 2018 or spring of 2019. She put her plans on hold after the SNP lost 21 seats in the 2017 general election, withthe first minister admitting that the prospect of an independence referendum was a factor in the result- which saw her party's share of the vote drop from 50% to 37%. But the SNP and Scottish Greens continue to form a pro-independence majority in the Scottish Parliament.

"The UK has had its hottest July day on record - with temperatures reaching 38.1C in Cambridge on Thursday. The all-time record in the UK still stands at 38.5C recorded at Faversham, Kent, in 2003. So just how does the current hot spell compare? Only three of the top 10 hottest temperatures in the UK have been recorded in July, according to Met Office figures, the others were all in August. Records could also be broken elsewhere. Northern Ireland has the lowest record high temperature - 30.8C reached in June 1976 and again in July 1983, at Knockarevan, in County Fermanagh, and Shaw's Bridge, Belfast, respectively. Temperatures have also been high overnight, approaching the all-time record of 23.9C, set in August 1990. Met Office forecasters say temperatures overnight on Friday could hit a record-breaking 24C. The high temperatures have triggered thunderstorms - with the UK hit by more than 40,000 lightning strikes overnight on 23-24 July. More thunderstorms are expected from Thursday afternoon onwards - and a severe-weather warning has been issued for large parts of the UK. This summer still has a long way to go before it can be compared with the summer of 1976 - when the UK was sweltering under temperatures above 30C for 18 days running and on 15 of those days temperatures topped 32C. But heatwaves are becoming more common. Last year's blazing summer in the UK was said by the Met Office to have been made 30 times more likely because of climate change. Temperatures have also been soaring across Europe. After the hottest June on record, several European countries are expected to hit new highs in the next couple of days. The French city of Bordeaux has already hit its highest temperature since records began, registering 41.2C (106.1F) in the south-western city on Tuesday. More records are expected to be broken in Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands, when the mercury is expected to reach 40C. Summer 2018 in the UK was the equal-second warmest since 1910. Both June and July 2018 saw daytime temperatures well above average, with readings above 30C in various parts of the country, as well as more sunshine than usual. Last year also saw record high temperatures in many places across the world amid an unusually prolonged spell of hot weather.

The second hottest temperature was reached in Kebili, Tunisia, where the thermometer showed 55C in July 1931. But the third and fourth hottest world temperatures have been measured in more recent years - in Mitribah, Kuwait, on 21 July 2016, and Turbat, Pakistan, on 28 May 2017, when the heat measured 53.9 and 53.7C respectively.

"Epstein is awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges Wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein was found semi-conscious in his prison cell on Thursday, US media reports say. The 66-year-old, who is awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, was reportedly found sprawled on the floor with injuries to his neck on Wednesday. The cause is unclear - neither suicide attempt nor assault has been ruled out. He has been at the New York facility since being denied bail last week. Epstein has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. The US Bureau of Prisons issued a statement saying that Epstein was, as of noon local time (16:00 GMT), at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center and ""not in a local hospital as has been reported"". But it was not clear if he had been treated for injuries either at a hospital or the prison, with officials saying ""we do not share information on an inmate's medical status or their conditions of confinement"". Who is Jeffrey Epstein? Jeffrey Epstein: What are his friends saying? He was taken to a nearby hospital in Manhattan, reports say, but his condition has not been made public. Investigators are working to establish what happened. According to the indictment, the financier is accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. Epstein, who was arrested on 6 July after landing in New Jersey on his private jet, avoided similar charges in a controversial secret plea deal in 2008, and instead pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. That plea deal has come under increasing scrutiny and, earlier this month,US Labor Secretary Alex Acosta resigned over his role in it. Epstein's mansion in New York City Prosecutors also accuse Epstein of paying large amounts of money to two potential witnesses during the forthcoming trial. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. If convicted, he faces up to 45 years in prison. He was denied bail last Thursdaybut his lawyers have appealed against the decision. New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections. He has long been surrounded by the rich and powerful, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and the UK's Prince Andrew. In a 2002 profile in New York Magazine,Mr Trump referred to Epstein as a ""terrific guy"",external. ""He's a lot of fun to be with,"" he said. ""It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.""

"The UK government has said it will provide a Royal Navy escort for British-flagged ships passing through the Strait of Hormuz - amid increasing diplomatic tensions in the Gulf. Ship owners are being advised to give details of their route so they can be escorted by the frigate HMS Montrose. The move follows the seizure of the British-flagged tanker Stena Impero by Iran's Revolutionary Guard on Friday. The ship's ownersaid the crew is safeand co-operating with officials. Shipping firm Stena Bulk said its 23 crew members - who are Indian, Russian, Latvian and Filipino - had been able to talk directly to their families for a limited time. The decision to provide a military escort to merchant shipping follows a meeting of Downing Street's emergency Cobra committee to discuss the situation in the Gulf. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? ""The Royal Navy has been tasked to accompany British-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz, either individually or in groups, should sufficient notice be given of their passage,"" a government spokesman said. ""Freedom of navigation is crucial for the global trading system and world economy, and we will do all we can to defend it,"" he added. ""This move will provide some much needed safety and reassurance to our shipping community in this uncertain time."" UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman added that the government was focused on securing the release of the detained Stena Impero tanker and its crew, while ""de-escalating current tensions"" with Iran. The UK Chamber of Shipping said it welcomed the government's decision, calling the announcement ""an encouraging step"". Stena Bulk has said it is discussing the release of the tanker and has asked ""local authorities"" for access to the vessel. On Wednesday night, the MoD said HMS Montrose escorted two merchant vessels travelling together through the strait. HMS Montrose, centre, escorts the British-flagged Stena Important (front) and Sea Ploeg oil tanker through the Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world's oil travels HMS Montrose is currently deployed to the region to provide reassurance for British ships, andearlier this month the MoD said it was forced to move between three Iranian boatsthat were trying to impede an oil tanker. Iran denied the incident happened and said there had been no confrontation with any foreign vessels. First contact made with tanker crew by owner Gulf crisis uniquely difficult moment for UK US-Iran relations: A brief history UK to send second warship to the Gulf That incident followed the UK's decision to seize an Iranian tanker, Grace 1, which London alleges was carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. Iran has denied the claim. On Monday, the then Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs that the UK would seek to create a European-led mission to ensure safe passage of international vessels in the Gulf. The new scheme would have a mandate to ensure freedom of navigation of international ships, the Foreign Office has said. But, while the mission would be implemented ""as quickly as possible"", Mr Hunt insisted it would not include the US as part of President Trump's policy of ""maximum pressure"" on Tehran. In April, the US tightened its own sanctions on Iran, which it had re-imposed after it withdrew from a 2015 nuclear deal. The UK government has remained committed to the deal, which curbs Iran's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of sanctions. In a joint statement issued earlier this month, UK, French and German leaders said they were ""deeply troubled"" by events in the Gulf. They added: ""We believe the time has come to act responsibly and seek a path to stop the escalation of tensions and resume dialogue.""

A European Commission spokesperson says Boris Johnson and outgoing Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker have spoken on the phone. Mr Juncker reiterated the EU's longstanding position that the current withdrawal deal is the only agreement possible with the UK. Mr Juncker added that the commission would analyse ideas put forward by the UK, as long as they are compatible with the existing withdrawal deal. He also told the PM the commission remained open to changing the language of the non-binding political declaration on future relations.

"Boris Johnson has made a series of spending promises both before and after becoming prime minister. How much would all of this cost? The plan:Immediate funds to help prepare the UK for a possible no-deal Brexit on 31 October. What it means:Just over a week after Mr Johnson become prime minister, the Treasury announced that Â£2.1bn would be spent bolstering border and customs operations, stockpiling critical medical supplies and supporting UK nationals abroad. Money will also be spent on a public awareness campaign ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit outcome. The cost:Ramping up no deal preparations will cost Â£2.1bn. This is on top of the Â£4.2bnTheresa May's previous government had already allocated on preparing for Brexit,external- with or without a deal. In total, the Treasury has now made Â£6.3bn available since 2016. The plan:Â£1.85bn for upgrades and new equipment at hospitals in England. What it means:The funding,externalis divided into two parts - Â£1bn will be available immediately to fund existing upgrade projects and tackle urgent needs. The Nuffield Trust has argued that this Â£1bn is money that NHS providers were promised in return for making savings over the past three years and then told they couldn't spend. But it is nonetheless a pot of money that the NHS did not have available to spend before this announcement, which it now can spend. The other Â£850m will be shared over the next five years between 20 hospitals in England to fund things like a new adult mental health inpatient unit in Manchester and four new hospital wards in Norwich. The cost:Successive governments havefailed to spendthe amount they said they would on capital projects, but if this government does manage to spend the full Â£1.85bn over five years, the Barnett formula would also require it to allocate Â£180m for Scotland, Â£110m for Wales and Â£60m for Northern Ireland, taking the total to Â£2.2bn. The plan:Hire an extra 20,000 police officers by 2022. What it means:There are 122,000 police officers in England and Wales, down from 143,000 in 2010 when Theresa May became home secretary. Mr Johnson repeated in Downing Street his plan to reverse almost all of those cuts. There has been some dispute about the link between police numbers and levels of violent crime, with Theresa May saying there was not a direct link. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said there is ""some link"" between the two. The cost:Mr Johnson has given a figure of Â£1.1bn. For police officers outside London,the lowest pay,externalwas about Â£25,400 in 2016 (although this differs from force to force). That comes to Â£500m a year but these costs will increase once they complete training, which takes about two years. Typically, after four years, the pay will increase to Â£33,700 (again outside London) - so almost Â£700m but this doesn't account for training costs. The Nottinghamshire police force,externalestimated recruitment and training to be about Â£13,000 per officer in 2012 (not including salary received during training). This would come in at about Â£258m for 20,000 new officers but again this would differ from force to force. Conservative MP Kit Malthouse, who supports Mr Johnson, says part-time special constables, who already have police training, would be recruited to become police officers, to help alleviate training costs. The plan:Create an extra 10,000 prison places in England and Wales. What it means:Michael Gove announced,externalthe building of 10,000 new prison places in 2015 and it was a commitment in the Conservative Party's manifesto for the 2017 election. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has now told BBC News that the government is only planning to create about 3,500 of those and that the extra 10,000 will start from now - so about 6,500 of the previously announced places have clearly been scrapped. ""By the end of the programme in the mid-2020s we'll have delivered about 13,500 extra prison places,"" he said. The first new prison will be built at HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire where there is already a maximum security prison. The new prison at Full Sutton was previouslyannounced in 2017. The cost:The programme is supposed to cost ""up to Â£2.5bn"" by the mid-2020s. That's the cost of building or refurbishing cells, not the ongoing cost of running them, which has not yet been announced. The justice secretary maintains that ""this is new money"", but it is not clear how much of the Â£1.3bn previously allocated to building 10,000 new prison places has been spent so far. If Â£2.5bn is actually spent then underthe Barnett formulaabout an extra Â£300m would need to be allocated to Scotland and Northern Ireland. The plan:It is currently government policy,externalto have full-fibre broadband across the UK by 2033 - Mr Johnson says he will have it done by 2025. What it means:Having full-fibre broadband means getting high-speed optical cables going into buildings so there is no use of copper cables. The telecoms regulatorOfcom said,externalthat in May only 7% of UK properties had full-fibre broadband. Increasing that to 100% in six years would be a big project and there has been no detail so far of how Mr Johnson plans to do it. The cost:Mr Johnson has said that government money would be needed to make this happen but has not specified how much. Commercial operators could be expected to fund this work in densely populated areas where they could expect to get a decent rate of return. But in more remote areas, there may have to be government subsidies. The government's current plan,externalestimates that getting full-fibre broadband to the most remote 10% of properties will require it to spend between Â£3bn and Â£5bn - it is reasonable to assume that doing it in six years instead of 14 years would increase that cost. Figures of about Â£30bn have been cited but it is not clear how much of that would be government money and how much would come from commercial investment. The plan:Level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools in England What it means:Mr Johnson wants to make sure per pupil funding is at least Â£5,000 in secondary schools across the country. He also said he wanted to increase funding in primary schools. And there were hints during the leadership campaign that he would reverse previous cuts to school spending, which would be considerably more expensive. MPs on the education select committee saidthat ""a multi-billion cash injection"" was needed. The cost:Taking per pupil funding to Â£5,000 in secondary schools would be relatively cheap - about Â£50m a year. Reversing previous cuts to spending was estimated during the campaign to cost about Â£4.6bn, although teaching unions have said that schools need an extra Â£12.6bn. The plan:Raise the higher income tax rate from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. What it means:At the moment,individuals have to pay 40% income tax on any earnings above Â£50,000,external. So, a person earning Â£55,000 a year, pays 40% on Â£5,000. Under Mr Johnson's plan - outlined during the leadership campaign but not set out in detail since - the point at which the 40% higher rate kicks in would be raised to Â£80,000. This would not benefit Scottish workers because the Scottish government sets its own income tax rates and bands. Mr Johnson also wants to raise the point at which people start paying National Insurance, absorbing some of the cost by also raising the point at which they stop paying NI. National Insurance is a separate tax. It's paid for by workers and companies and is meant to fund state benefits, such as the NHS. Under this new tax regime, someone earning Â£60,000 a year could benefit by Â£1,000 a year, while someone on Â£80,000 or more would gain a maximum of Â£3,000 (because some of the benefits would be lost because of National Insurance increases). What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Laura Kuenssberg: 'Hard part' begins as Johnson wins contest Is there a Brexit war chest? But it's wealthy pensioners who stand to benefit the most - up to Â£6,000 each, according to analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That's because pensioners don't pay National Insurance to begin with. So, if someone already receives a generous work pension, not only would they be subject to less income tax (up to the new threshold), they also would not be affected by the changes to National Insurance. The cost:Changing the tax system in this way would cost about Â£10bn a year, according to Mr Johnson. He says the bill could be funded from Â£26.6bn of ""fiscal headroom"". This ""headroom"" refers to government borrowing, which came in lower than originally expected and had been earmarked by the chancellor for no-deal Brexit planning. However, if Mr Johnson chooses to fund his tax changes with this Â£26.6bn, it would not amount to a permanent solution. That's because the money can be spent once only. So, to pay for the policy in the long term, Mr Johnson would need to raise taxes elsewhere, announce spending cuts or continue to fund it from government borrowing. The plan:Mr Johnson has spoken favourably about cutting corporation tax but has not been specific about how much he would like to cut it by. What it means:The corporation tax rate, which is the tax companies pay on their profits, has been cut from 28% in 2010 to the current rate of 19%. It is due to fall again, to 17%, next year. While the other candidate in the leadership election, Jeremy Hunt, wanted to cut the rate further to 12.5%, Mr Johnson was not as specific. The cost:Mr Johnson claimed at a hustings in Darlington that every time corporation tax has been cut in this country, the amount of revenue raised has increased. That is not the case.While there have been occasions since 2010 when corporation tax has been cut and revenue has risen, in the years after the rate was cut in 2008, revenue fell. The government currently estimates that an extra one percentage point cut in corporation tax would cost Â£3.1bn in 2022-23. In the longer term, some of that money would be clawed back in extra investment, wages or consumption.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Britain would be âclean, green, prosperous, united, confident and ambitiousâ. Boris Johnson has promised the ""beginning of a new golden age"", as he made his first Commons statement as PM. Speaking to MPs, Mr Johnson said his government would throw itself into Brexit negotiations with energy, while Michael Gove would lead on no-deal planning as a ""top priority"". He also said EU citizens living in the UK would have their rights protected. But Downing Street was unable to confirm if there would be any new laws to underpin the commitment. Tory MP Alberto Costa - who has campaigned for EU citizens' rights after Brexit - welcomed Mr Johnson's pledge, but said ""the devil, as ever, is in the detail"" and he would be ""scrutinising how that guarantee comes forward"". Replying to his statement in the Commons, Jeremy Corbyn said people ""do not trust"" the new PM to deliver on his promises. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas written to Mr Johnsonto say it is ""essential"" her country has an alternative option to his Brexit plan. Barnier attacks 'combative' Johnson speech Does the UK owe the EU Â£39bn? Prime Minister Boris Johnson: Who's in his cabinet? Live updates as Boris Johnson addresses MPs Who are Boris Johnson's key advisers? The statement came after the first meeting of Mr Johnson's new cabinet, who he said had all committed to leaving the EU on or before 31 October, ""no ifs, no buts"". New secretaries of state include former leadership contender Sajid Javid as chancellor, and leading Brexiteers, with Dominic Raab as foreign secretary and Priti Patel as home secretary. More junior ministers are expected to be announced later, with further reshuffling on Friday. Mr Johnson has also held his first calls with other foreign leaders - including Dutch PM Mark Rutte and Australian PM Scott Morrison - and is due to speak to the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker later. Much of Mr Johnson's statement focused on his plans for Brexit. Despite emphasising the importance of preparing for no deal, the new prime minister said he would ""much prefer"" to leave the EU with an agreement, saying he would work ""flat out to make it happen"". Boris Johnson gave his first statement to the Commons as PM, flanked by his new Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab (l), and his new Chancellor, Sajid Javid However, he told MPs the withdrawal agreement his predecessor, Theresa May, had negotiated with the EU was ""unacceptable to this Parliament and to this country"". That plan was voted down three times by MPs, with one of the controversial parts being the Northern Ireland backstop - a mechanism to avoid physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in case no trade deal is agreed between the UK and the EU by the end of the transition period. Mr Johnson has pledged to scrap this element of the plan, saying alternative arrangements to keep checks away from the border were ""perfectly compatible"" with the Good Friday Agreement - the peace agreement signed in 1998. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said eliminating the backstop from the withdrawal agreement was ""unacceptable"", and after Mr Johnson's ""rather combative speech"", the bloc would have to ""be ready for all scenarios"". The EU Commission's President, Jean-Claude Juncker, also underlined the EU's position in a call with Mr Johnson, saying the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the bloc and Mrs May was ""the best and only agreement possible"" for Brexit. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn gives a warning to the people who will ""lose out"" in a no-deal Brexit. Addressing MPs, Mr Johnson also said he would be looking into changing the UK's immigration system,as per his leadership campaign pledge. He wants to bring in a points-based system, similar to that used by Australia, and he said he would be asking the Migration Advisory Committee to conduct a review, ""the first step in a radical rewriting"" of the policy. The PM's spokesman later said that further details of Mr Johnson's plans would be revealed ""in the coming days and weeks"". How much would PM's shopping list cost? In Pictures: Boris Johnson becomes UK's new PM Labour's leader said the country was ""deeply worried the new prime minister overestimates himself"". Mr Corbyn added: ""People do not trust this prime minister to make the right choices for the majority of the people in this country when he's also promising tax giveaways to the richest of big business - his own party's funders [a policy Mr Johnsonproposed during the leadership campaign]"". He also asked the PM to rule out ""once and for all"" the NHS would form part of a trade deal with the US, following comments made by President Donald Trump on his visit to the UK in June. Mr Johnson said: ""Under no circumstances would we agree to any free-trade deal that put the NHS on the table."" After a raft of resignations, sackings and appointments on Wednesday night, Mr Johnson addressed his cabinet for the first time as prime minister early on Thursday. He told the cabinet they had ""a momentous task ahead"", as he repeated his commitment for the UK to leave the EU on 31 October - calling it ""a pivotal moment in our country's history"". He said the new team respected the ""depth and breadth of talent in our extraordinary party"", who were ""not going to wait until 31 October to get on with a fantastic new agenda for our country... delivering the priorities of the people"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson holds his first cabinet meeting since becoming prime minister. The appointments have already faced criticism from the opposition, with the chair of the Labour Party, Ian Lavery, calling it ""a cabinet of hard-line conservatives who will only represent the privileged few"". He comments were echoed by independent MP Nick Boles - who resigned the Conservative whip over Brexit - saying the ""few elements remaining of the liberal one-nation Conservative style are neutered captives in this cabinet"". But the new Leader of the House, Mr Rees-Mogg, who led the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group (ERG), denied there had been a ""Leave"" takeover of the cabinet. ""Boris is bringing the country together, the party together, through his cabinet appointments,"" he said. Jacob Rees-Mogg held his first business questions on Thursday after his appointment as Leader of the House The newly appointed Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson, has tabled an early day motion expressing a lack of confidence in the prime minister - although such motions are rarely debated and generally used to draw attention to an issue.  31ministers entitled to attend - up from 29 under Theresa May 48average age - down from 51 26%female - down from 31% 12Leave supporters (in 2016) - up from six These are the decisions of a prime minister in a hurry. One who is aware that he's up against the clock. One who has to pull off - within a few months - what his predecessor could not manage over years. The team surrounding Boris Johnson has been put together with one goal in mind - to help him keep the promise he's made, to see the country leave the European Union in good time. No 10 believes it shows strength of purpose - a new administration determined and willing to take decisions after years of drift and disappointment. Brexit believers have the top roles.

Mr Juncker added that the commission would analyse ideas put forward by the UK, as long as they are compatible with the existing withdrawal deal. He also told the PM the commission remained open to changing the language of the non-binding political declaration on future relations.

At a news conference after a meeting of his cabinet in County Donegal, Mr Varadkar said: ""I hope the new UK prime minister hasn't chosen no deal, but that will be up to them."" Asked if he thought Boris Johnson was bluffing about no deal, Mr Varadkar replied: ""I don't know."" He repeated that the position of Ireland and the EU ""had not changed"" and that ""without the backstop there is no withdrawal agreement"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson's first speech as UK PM: ""Never mind the backstop, the buck stops here"" Boris Johnson has given key cabinet roles to leading Brexiteers after becoming the UK's new prime minister. Dominic Raab and Priti Patel return to government as foreign secretary and home secretary respectively. Sajid Javid has been named as the new chancellor as more than half of Theresa May's old cabinet, including leadership rival Jeremy Hunt, quit or were sacked. Earlier, Mr Johnson said the Brexit ""doomsters and gloomsters"" were wrong and the UK would leave on 31 October. Speaking outside No 10, he said the UK would meet that deadline ""no ifs, no buts"", adding: ""The buck stops with me."" Who is in Boris Johnson's cabinet? Mr Johnson then turned his attention to a radical overhaul of the government, with 17 of Mrs May's former senior ministers being axed or stepping down. Announcing his departure, Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt said he had been offered an alternative role but had turned it down. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt, a leading Brexiteer who is popular across the party, was the most surprising departure. She has been replaced by Ben Wallace, a former soldier and longstanding ally of Mr Johnson's. Another prominent Brexiteer, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox, was also ousted, along with Business Secretary Greg Clark - a vocal opponent of a no-deal Brexit. All three supported Mr Hunt in the Tory leadership contest. Sajid Javid is moving from the Home Office to the Treasury Education Secretary Damian Hinds,Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley,Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes, Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright and Communities Secretary James Brokenshire have also gone, along with Chris Grayling, whose record as Transport Secretary was much criticised. Scottish Secretary David Mundell, who has left his position after four years,joked whether there would be ""room"" on the backbenches after all the dismissals. Allow Twitter content?

This comes on top of the earlier resignations of four leading ministers, including Chancellor Philip Hammond, Justice Secretary David Gauke and Cabinet Office minister David Lidington. Conservative MP Nigel Evans described the changes as a ""summer's day massacre"". Do Boris Johnson's tax and spend plans add up? And what is his Brexit plan? The BBC's chief political correspondent Vicki Young said the sackings suggested Mr Johnson wasn't looking to build bridges across the party. Instead, she said, he was focused above all else on assembling the team he thought would bring about the results he needed, even if that was controversial. As the upheaval in government was happening, hundreds of people gathered outside the gates of Downing Street in protest against Mr Johnson's appointment. Downing Street was locked down as anti-Boris Johnson protesters gathered on Whitehall Former Home Secretary Sajid Javid - a banker before entering politics - has been given the key role of chancellor, having thrown his weight behind Boris Johnson after being eliminated from the leadership race himself. Priti Patel - whoquit as international development secretary in 2017after holding unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials - succeeds Mr Javid at the Home Office, where she said she would focus on keeping the UK country safe and fighting ""the scourge of crime"". Dominic Raab is a former Brexit secretary, but quit over Mrs May's handling of the process. He said he was ""hugely humbled"" by his appointment and said the UK needed to ""bring finality"" to Brexit so it could focus on the other big challenges. Other figures involved in the Vote Leave referendum campaign have also been rewarded. Michael Gove leaves behind his environment brief to become Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, a more senior ministerial role but one without a specific portfolio. Meanwhile, Jacob Rees-Mogg becomes leader of the House of Commons - his first government role. This video can not be played Jacob Rees-Mogg learns of new role from the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Priti Patel was forced to quit her previous cabinet post in 2017, but is back in a key post Ben Wallace is the new defence secretary Liz Truss moves from second in command at the Treasury to head the Department for International trade while Steve Barclay has been re-appointed as Brexit Secretary. Health Secretary Matt Hancock and Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd are among the few ministers who backed Remain who have kept their jobs. Ms Rudd also takes on the women and equalities brief. Meanwhile, there is a speedy return to office for Gavin Williamson as education secretary. He was sacked as defence secretary less than three months agoafter No 10 concluded he was responsible for the leaking of unauthorised information from a National Security Council meeting - which he denied. Mr Johnson's team has promised a record number of women in the cabinet. Nicky Morgan, Theresa Villiers and Andrea Leadsom have all returned to top jobs, taking on the culture, environment and business briefs respectively. There are also promotions for Robert Buckland (justice) and Alok Sharma (international development) while former party chairman Grant Shapps, a key member of Boris Johnson's leadership campaign team, makes a comeback at transport. Former Chief Whip Julian Smith is the new Northern Ireland Secretary, while Dumfries and Galloway MP Alister Jack, who was only elected to Parliament last year, is expected to become Scottish Secretary. Alun Cairns remains as Welsh Secretary. Earlier, in a 13-minute speech outside Downing Street, Mr Johnson listed a wide range of domestic ambitions, chiefly a promise to sort out care for the elderly ""once and for all"". Reforms to the social care sector have eluded previous governments because of their cost and complexity. ""We will fix it once and for all with a clear plan we have prepared to give every older person the dignity and security they deserve,"" he insisted. Boris Johnson's battles Bouquets and brickbats: May's final PMQs A solemn start in No 10 Mr Johnson also pledged to improve infrastructure, recruit 20,000 new police officers and ""level up"" school spending. He promised reforms to ensure the Â£20bn in extra funding earmarked for the NHS ""really gets to the front line"". And he pledged to boost the UK's biotech and space science sectors, change the tax rules to provide incentives for investment, and do more to promote the welfare of animals. Carrie Symonds, Mr Johnson's partner, was among those greeting him at Downing Street Setting out his priorities for office, the former London mayor hit out at the ""pessimists"" who did not believe Brexit could be delivered and called for an end to three years of indecision. ""The people who bet against Britain are going to lose their shirts because we are going to restore trust in our democracy,"" he said. ""The time has come to act, to take decisions and change this country for the better."" He said he had ""every confidence"" the UK would leave the EU in 99 days time with a deal, but preparations for the ""remote possibility"" of a no-deal Brexit would be accelerated. Mr Johnson vowed to bring all four nations of the United Kingdom - or what he described as the ""awesome foursome"" - together in the task of strengthening a post-Brexit country. ""Though I am today building a great team of men and women, I will take personal responsibility for the change I want to see,"" he concluded. ""Never mind the backstop, the buck stops here."" Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said Mr Johnson's speech was ""all rhetoric"". New Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said she would welcome a cross-party push to find a solution on social care, but attacked Mr Johnson's ""bluster and bravado"" over Brexit. Climate protesters blocked Mr Johnson's route to the palace Officials welcomed the new prime minister to Downing Street Mr Johnson took over after Theresa May handed in her resignation to the Queen. Earlier, as she relinquished power after three years,Mrs May said being prime minister had been ""the greatest honour""and wished her successor well. During his journey to Buckingham Palace, Mr Johnson's car was briefly held up by protesters from Greenpeace, who formed a human chain across The Mall.

"Boris Johnson has made a series of spending promises both before and after becoming prime minister. How much would all of this cost? The plan:Immediate funds to help prepare the UK for a possible no-deal Brexit on 31 October. What it means:Just over a week after Mr Johnson become prime minister, the Treasury announced that Â£2.1bn would be spent bolstering border and customs operations, stockpiling critical medical supplies and supporting UK nationals abroad. Money will also be spent on a public awareness campaign ahead of a possible no-deal Brexit outcome. The cost:Ramping up no deal preparations will cost Â£2.1bn. This is on top of the Â£4.2bnTheresa May's previous government had already allocated on preparing for Brexit,external- with or without a deal. In total, the Treasury has now made Â£6.3bn available since 2016. The plan:Â£1.85bn for upgrades and new equipment at hospitals in England. What it means:The funding,externalis divided into two parts - Â£1bn will be available immediately to fund existing upgrade projects and tackle urgent needs. The Nuffield Trust has argued that this Â£1bn is money that NHS providers were promised in return for making savings over the past three years and then told they couldn't spend. But it is nonetheless a pot of money that the NHS did not have available to spend before this announcement, which it now can spend. The other Â£850m will be shared over the next five years between 20 hospitals in England to fund things like a new adult mental health inpatient unit in Manchester and four new hospital wards in Norwich. The cost:Successive governments havefailed to spendthe amount they said they would on capital projects, but if this government does manage to spend the full Â£1.85bn over five years, the Barnett formula would also require it to allocate Â£180m for Scotland, Â£110m for Wales and Â£60m for Northern Ireland, taking the total to Â£2.2bn. The plan:Hire an extra 20,000 police officers by 2022. What it means:There are 122,000 police officers in England and Wales, down from 143,000 in 2010 when Theresa May became home secretary. Mr Johnson repeated in Downing Street his plan to reverse almost all of those cuts. There has been some dispute about the link between police numbers and levels of violent crime, with Theresa May saying there was not a direct link. But Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has said there is ""some link"" between the two. The cost:Mr Johnson has given a figure of Â£1.1bn. For police officers outside London,the lowest pay,externalwas about Â£25,400 in 2016 (although this differs from force to force). That comes to Â£500m a year but these costs will increase once they complete training, which takes about two years. Typically, after four years, the pay will increase to Â£33,700 (again outside London) - so almost Â£700m but this doesn't account for training costs. The Nottinghamshire police force,externalestimated recruitment and training to be about Â£13,000 per officer in 2012 (not including salary received during training). This would come in at about Â£258m for 20,000 new officers but again this would differ from force to force. Conservative MP Kit Malthouse, who supports Mr Johnson, says part-time special constables, who already have police training, would be recruited to become police officers, to help alleviate training costs. The plan:Create an extra 10,000 prison places in England and Wales. What it means:Michael Gove announced,externalthe building of 10,000 new prison places in 2015 and it was a commitment in the Conservative Party's manifesto for the 2017 election. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland has now told BBC News that the government is only planning to create about 3,500 of those and that the extra 10,000 will start from now - so about 6,500 of the previously announced places have clearly been scrapped. ""By the end of the programme in the mid-2020s we'll have delivered about 13,500 extra prison places,"" he said. The first new prison will be built at HMP Full Sutton in Yorkshire where there is already a maximum security prison. The new prison at Full Sutton was previouslyannounced in 2017. The cost:The programme is supposed to cost ""up to Â£2.5bn"" by the mid-2020s. That's the cost of building or refurbishing cells, not the ongoing cost of running them, which has not yet been announced. The justice secretary maintains that ""this is new money"", but it is not clear how much of the Â£1.3bn previously allocated to building 10,000 new prison places has been spent so far. If Â£2.5bn is actually spent then underthe Barnett formulaabout an extra Â£300m would need to be allocated to Scotland and Northern Ireland. The plan:It is currently government policy,externalto have full-fibre broadband across the UK by 2033 - Mr Johnson says he will have it done by 2025. What it means:Having full-fibre broadband means getting high-speed optical cables going into buildings so there is no use of copper cables. The telecoms regulatorOfcom said,externalthat in May only 7% of UK properties had full-fibre broadband. Increasing that to 100% in six years would be a big project and there has been no detail so far of how Mr Johnson plans to do it. The cost:Mr Johnson has said that government money would be needed to make this happen but has not specified how much. Commercial operators could be expected to fund this work in densely populated areas where they could expect to get a decent rate of return. But in more remote areas, there may have to be government subsidies. The government's current plan,externalestimates that getting full-fibre broadband to the most remote 10% of properties will require it to spend between Â£3bn and Â£5bn - it is reasonable to assume that doing it in six years instead of 14 years would increase that cost. Figures of about Â£30bn have been cited but it is not clear how much of that would be government money and how much would come from commercial investment. The plan:Level up per pupil funding in primary and secondary schools in England What it means:Mr Johnson wants to make sure per pupil funding is at least Â£5,000 in secondary schools across the country. He also said he wanted to increase funding in primary schools. And there were hints during the leadership campaign that he would reverse previous cuts to school spending, which would be considerably more expensive. MPs on the education select committee saidthat ""a multi-billion cash injection"" was needed. The cost:Taking per pupil funding to Â£5,000 in secondary schools would be relatively cheap - about Â£50m a year. Reversing previous cuts to spending was estimated during the campaign to cost about Â£4.6bn, although teaching unions have said that schools need an extra Â£12.6bn. The plan:Raise the higher income tax rate from Â£50,000 to Â£80,000. What it means:At the moment,individuals have to pay 40% income tax on any earnings above Â£50,000,external. So, a person earning Â£55,000 a year, pays 40% on Â£5,000. Under Mr Johnson's plan - outlined during the leadership campaign but not set out in detail since - the point at which the 40% higher rate kicks in would be raised to Â£80,000. This would not benefit Scottish workers because the Scottish government sets its own income tax rates and bands. Mr Johnson also wants to raise the point at which people start paying National Insurance, absorbing some of the cost by also raising the point at which they stop paying NI. National Insurance is a separate tax. It's paid for by workers and companies and is meant to fund state benefits, such as the NHS. Under this new tax regime, someone earning Â£60,000 a year could benefit by Â£1,000 a year, while someone on Â£80,000 or more would gain a maximum of Â£3,000 (because some of the benefits would be lost because of National Insurance increases). What is Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Laura Kuenssberg: 'Hard part' begins as Johnson wins contest Is there a Brexit war chest? But it's wealthy pensioners who stand to benefit the most - up to Â£6,000 each, according to analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). That's because pensioners don't pay National Insurance to begin with. So, if someone already receives a generous work pension, not only would they be subject to less income tax (up to the new threshold), they also would not be affected by the changes to National Insurance. The cost:Changing the tax system in this way would cost about Â£10bn a year, according to Mr Johnson. He says the bill could be funded from Â£26.6bn of ""fiscal headroom"". This ""headroom"" refers to government borrowing, which came in lower than originally expected and had been earmarked by the chancellor for no-deal Brexit planning. However, if Mr Johnson chooses to fund his tax changes with this Â£26.6bn, it would not amount to a permanent solution. That's because the money can be spent once only. So, to pay for the policy in the long term, Mr Johnson would need to raise taxes elsewhere, announce spending cuts or continue to fund it from government borrowing. The plan:Mr Johnson has spoken favourably about cutting corporation tax but has not been specific about how much he would like to cut it by. What it means:The corporation tax rate, which is the tax companies pay on their profits, has been cut from 28% in 2010 to the current rate of 19%. It is due to fall again, to 17%, next year. While the other candidate in the leadership election, Jeremy Hunt, wanted to cut the rate further to 12.5%, Mr Johnson was not as specific. The cost:Mr Johnson claimed at a hustings in Darlington that every time corporation tax has been cut in this country, the amount of revenue raised has increased. That is not the case.While there have been occasions since 2010 when corporation tax has been cut and revenue has risen, in the years after the rate was cut in 2008, revenue fell. The government currently estimates that an extra one percentage point cut in corporation tax would cost Â£3.1bn in 2022-23. In the longer term, some of that money would be clawed back in extra investment, wages or consumption.

"Pictures of Mr Cummings leaving No 10 dominated newspaper front pages Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year. But the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times. Rarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister. His critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10. Mr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. Cummings: I discussed ousting PM after 2019 election PM resisted lockdown as only over-80s dying - Cummings Agree with him or not, Cummings's words matter Thousands died needlessly after mistakes - Cummings He left his Downing Street rolefollowing an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare. In his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a Â£40,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. There was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, theUK's new ""high risk"" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects. But he appears to have a different career path in mind. In February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm,according to Companies House,external, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. But in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government. The BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg. And he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal. But he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter. He plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but ""more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc"" will only be available to subscribers who pay Â£10 a month. He is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that ""slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project"". This new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials. In a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. But he adds: ""It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments. ""Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation. ""Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules."" There are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however. Little was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April. After being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April. As well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make aseries of accusations against the PMand questioned his ""competence and integrity"". The following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson ""unfit for the job"", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns. He also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying. This sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations. It thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time sincehis now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year. This video can not be played Cummings challenged over lockdown trip to Durham While staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London. This revelation - at a specially-convened press conference in the Downing Street garden - made Mr Cummings a household name and led to furious allegations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out ""Do I feel OK driving?"" He also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London. Asked why he had given a story that was ""not the 100% truth"" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that ""the way we handled the whole thing was wrong"". This video can not be played Cummings says he drove to Barnard Castle to test vision Boris Johnson stood by his adviser throughout the Barnard Castle episode - to the consternation of some of his supporters, who feared it was undermining his attempts to hold the country together during a national crisis. Cummings accuses government of Covid secrecy Kuenssberg: What led to Cummings' departure? Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Some said the episode burned through the political capital the prime minister had generated months earlier during the 2019 general election. This video can not be played Boris Johnson defends his senior adviser Dominic Cummings in May 2020 But it is hard to overstate how important Mr Cummings was to the Johnson project. The two are very different characters - Mr Johnson likes to be popular, Mr Cummings appears indifferent to such concerns - but they formed a strong bond in the white heat of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU, which Mr Cummings led as campaign director. The combination of Mr Johnson, the flamboyant household-name frontman, with Mr Cummings, the ruthless, data-driven strategist, with a flair for an eye-catching slogan, proved to be unbeatable. Mr Cummings was credited with formulating the ""take back control"" slogan that appears to have struck a chord with so many referendum voters, changing the course of British history. Yet some were surprised when Mr Cummings was brought into the heart of government as Mr Johnson's chief adviser, given his past record of rubbing senior Tory politicians up the wrong way. It proved to be a shrewd move. It was Mr Cummings who devised the high-risk strategy of pushing for the 2019 election to be fought on a ""Get Brexit Done"" ticket, focusing on winning seats in Labour heartlands, something no previous Tory leader had managed to do in decades. Many of the policy ideas that have shaped the Johnson government's agenda have his fingerprints all over them. ""Levelling up"" - moving power and money out of London and the South East of England - is a Cummings project, as are plans to shake-up the civil service, take on the judiciary and reform the planning system. The team that surrounded Mr Cummings at Downing Street, some of whom are Vote Leave veterans, were fiercely loyal to him and shared a sense that they were outsiders in Whitehall, battling an entrenched ""elite"". Lee Cain, the former Downing Street and Vote Leave communications chief, left No 10 just before Mr Cummings did. Mr Cummings watches the PM in action at a coronavirus briefing There had been rumours of a rift between the Vote Leave veterans and other No 10 aides, who didn't like Mr Cummings's and Mr Cain's abrasive style. There were tales of crackdowns on special advisers suspected of leaking to the media and angry, dismissive behaviour towards Tory MPs, civil servants and even secretaries of state. None of this will have come as much of a surprise to veteran Cummings watchers. Mr Cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the Conservative Party for nearly two decades, and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and challenging the established order. But he has never been a member of the Conservative Party, or any party, and appears to have little time for most MPs. A longstanding Eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group, Mr Cummings's other passion is changing the way government operates. He grabbed headlines when heposted an advert on his personal blogfor ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to work in government, arguing that the civil service lacked ""deep expertise"" in many policy areas.

His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist. He went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with an ill-fated attempt to launch an airline, among other projects. He is married to Spectator journalist Mary Wakefield, the daughter of aristocrat Sir Humphry Wakefield, whose family seat isChillingam Castle,external, in Northumberland. After a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, Mr Cummings spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who fired him. He played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native North East. In what turned out to be a dry run for the Brexit campaign, the North East Says No team won the referendum with a mix of eye-catching stunts - including an inflatable white elephant - and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing anti-politics mood among the public. He is then said to have retreated to his father's farm, in County Durham, where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world. Mr Cummings facing questions from the media outside his home He re-emerged in 2007 as a special adviser to Michael Gove, who became education secretary in 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit. The pair would rail against what they called ""the blob"" - the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers' unions that sought, in their opinion, to frustrate their attempts at reform. He left of his own accord to set up a free school, having alienated a number of senior people in the education ministry and the Conservative Party. He once described former Brexit Secretary David Davis as ""thick as mince"" and as ""lazy as a toad"" and irritated David Cameron, the then prime minister, who called him a ""career psychopath"". Benedict Cumberbatch was widely praised for his portrayal of Dominic Cummings in Brexit: The Uncivil War His appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign - dramatised in Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War - was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy. Vote Leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the Electoral Commission and Mr Cummings was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. Like most advisers, he shunned media interviews when he was in government, and his rare appearances before MPs were characterised by animosity on both sides. All that has changed in recent weeks, but it would be a brave person who said he had now joined the ranks of the former Westminster insiders who make their living as pundits - a class he appears to view with as much disdain as he does his former colleagues in government.

"O2 has announced it plans to turn on its 5G mobile network in October. It intends to launch the next-generation service in Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, London, Slough and Leeds and then expand to a total of 50 towns and cities by summer 2020. It will be the last of the UK's network coverage providers to roll out 5G. However, it will be the only one to do so without using equipment from the embattled Chinese telecoms equipment-maker Huawei. O2 is owned by Spain's Telefonica, which has used Huawei's infrastructure in some of its other networks. Moreover, O2 trialled some of Huawei's 5G radio access network gear at cell towers in the UK before deciding to opt for rival products from two vendors it had already used to deliver 4G. ""We respect all three operators, they were thorough in their submissions,"" O2's chief executive Mark Evans told the BBC. ""But we were convinced that the best choices for us at this time are our current partners, which are Ericsson and Nokia."" 5G: Finally, it's here in the UK - so what is it? Does 5G pose health risks? Nokia distances itself from boss's warning over Huawei The announcement comes the same week that the UKformally postponed a decision on whether to ban or allow Huaweito be used within any of the UK's 5G networks. The US has been putting pressure on the government to exclude the Chinese firm claiming that it poses a risk to national security - something that Huawei denies. In April, it had seemed that former Prime Minister Theresa May had decided thatany threat could be managed. But a move by Washington to restrict other companies' trade with Huawei and the anticipation of Boris Johnson's cabinet reshuffle led to agovernment report into the future of UK's telecoms sector being publishedwithout a final decision having been taken on the matter. O2 said that Huawei's involvement in the bidding process had helped it strike a more competitive deal with Ericsson and Nokia, but it had not closed the door on buying 5G products from the Shenzhen-based company in the future. ""The least we need is clarity of who we can work with and under what circumstances,"" added Mr Evans. ""Not having that clarity is frustrating because that undoubtedly could slow us down in either our decision making or our execution. ""So, I would still encourage the government to conclude their review and finalise their judgement ASAP."" O2 would also be affected by the decisionsince it plans to share some of Vodafone's 5G cell sites,external, where Huawei products are being used. O2 has said that it will initially focus on providing 5G to sites where capacity is stretched. These will include train stations, entertainment and sports venues -  including the O2 Arena in London - and popular retail destinations, such as Edinburgh's Princes Street and Leeds' White Rose Shopping Centre. Edinburgh's city centre will be among the first places to be offered 5G by O2 It said consumers can expect faster download speeds and greater reliability if they purchase a compatible handset. But Mr Evans said O2 also hopes companies will be early adopters, and had already struck a deal with Northumbrian Water. ""We're working with them on 5G smart sensors so that they can use that to detect leakage and water quality, and manage their network better,"" he said. BT and Vodafone already offer 5G services of their own and Three is set to follow in August. O2 will offer handsets from Samsung and Xiaomi among its initial range of 5G-compatible phones But one industry-watcher said that O2 should not be at a disadvantage by being the last to act. ""There's been a lot of talk about speed, but actually there aren't the apps and services there for customers to tap into that in any great way yet,"" said Kester Mann from the consultancy CCS Insight. ""So, these are just the very first steps in a 5G marathon."" O2's 5G news coincided with the release of its first-half results. They revealed a 5.1% annual rise in sales, totalling Â£2.98bn ($3.8bn). Its number of customers - including those signed to Giffgaff, Tesco Mobile, Sky Mobile and Lycamobile, which piggyback O2's network - rose by 3.6% to 33.3 million accounts. Mr Evans also used the opportunity to criticise Ofcom's departing chief, Sharon White. He said the regulator should have ensured 5G wave-bands were divided up so that each operator got a contiguous block of spectrum rather than holding auctions that are set to leave most firms with fragmented frequency ranges. The result, he explained, was that 5G's performance might not be as good as it could have been. ""The regulator hasn't got the balance right for our sector,"" he added. ""[She] has been very much focused, understandably, on providing customers value. ""I do believe, though, however, that the regulator should also look at how they can support or enable the industry to accelerate investment and make the best use of what we have."" He acknowledged, however, that Ofcom is at least consulting on whether the spectrum can be ""defragmented"" byencouraging the networks to trade the blocks among themselves,externalpost-auction.

"Pictures of Mr Cummings leaving No 10 dominated newspaper front pages Dominic Cummings was never going to go quietly after being forced out of Downing Street at the end of last year. But the number, and seriousness, of his claims about what went on at the heart of government, as ministers battled to get on top of the coronavirus crisis, are unprecedented in modern times. Rarely has a former adviser made so many potentially damaging revelations about a sitting prime minister. His critics say Mr Cummings is motivated by revenge against Boris Johnson, and will not rest until the PM has been removed from No 10. Mr Cummings insists he is driven by a desire to make what he views as a broken and chaotic government machine work better in future. Cummings: I discussed ousting PM after 2019 election PM resisted lockdown as only over-80s dying - Cummings Agree with him or not, Cummings's words matter Thousands died needlessly after mistakes - Cummings He left his Downing Street rolefollowing an internal power struggle, amid claims the PM's then-fiancee had blocked the promotion of one of his allies, Lee Cain, after months of internal warfare. In his final year at Downing Street, Mr Cummings had a Â£40,000 pay rise, taking his salary to between Â£140,000 and Â£144,999. There was speculation that the 49-year-old would seek a post-politics career as the first head of Aria, theUK's new ""high risk"" science agency, which had been one of his pet projects. But he appears to have a different career path in mind. In February, he started a technology consultancy firm, Siwah Ltd. He is the sole director of the firm,according to Companies House,external, and it is registered at an address in his native Durham, in north-east England. This would appear to be a successor to Dynamic Maps, his previous tech consultancy. But in recent months, most of his time appears to have been taken up with spilling the beans on his time in government. The BBC did not pay Mr Cummings for his exclusive interview with political editor Laura Kuenssberg. And he has not yet taken the time-honoured route of selling his story to a newspaper, or signing a book deal. But he has found a way of generating income through online platform Substack, where he has launched a newsletter. He plans to give out information on the coronavirus pandemic and his time in Downing Street for free, but ""more recondite stuff on the media, Westminster, 'inside No 10', how did we get Brexit done in 2019, the 2019 election etc"" will only be available to subscribers who pay Â£10 a month. He is also offering his marketing and election campaigning expertise, for fees that ""slide from zero to lots depending on who you are / your project"". This new venture has incurred the wrath of Whitehall watchdog Lord Pickles, who chairs the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba), which vets jobs taken by former ministers and top officials. In a letter to Cabinet Office Minister Micheal Gove, he says Mr Cummings has sought advice on working as a consultant. But he adds: ""It appears that Mr Cummings is offering various services for payment via a blog hosted on Substack, the blog for which he is also receiving subscription payments. ""Mr Cummings has failed to seek the committee's advice on this commercial undertaking, nor has the committee received the courtesy of a reply to our letter requesting an explanation. ""Failure to seek and await advice before taking up work is a breach of the government's rules."" There are few repercussions for failing to consult Acoba, however. Little was heard from Mr Cummings for several months after his departure from Downing Street - but that all changed in April. After being named in media reports as the source of government leaks, he launched a scathing attack on Mr Johnson via a 1,000-word blog post in April. As well as denying he was behind the leaks, he went on to make aseries of accusations against the PMand questioned his ""competence and integrity"". The following month, Mr Cummings expanded on his criticisms at a seven-hour select committee appearance, declaring Boris Johnson ""unfit for the job"", and claiming he had ignored scientific advice and wrongly delayed lockdowns. He also turned his fire on then-health secretary Matt Hancock, who he said should have been fired for lying. This sparked a bitter war of words with Mr Hancock, who flatly denied all of Mr Cummings's allegations. It thrust Mr Cummings back into the spotlight for the first time sincehis now infamous visit to County Durham, four days after the start of the first national lockdown, in March last year. This video can not be played Cummings challenged over lockdown trip to Durham While staying with his family at his father's farm, he made a 30-mile road journey to Barnard Castle, which he later said had been to test his eyesight before the 260-mile drive back to London. This revelation - at a specially-convened press conference in the Downing Street garden - made Mr Cummings a household name and led to furious allegations of double standards at a time when the government had banned all but essential long-distance travel. In an interview with BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Cummings said that, during the Barnard Castle trip, he had been trying to work out ""Do I feel OK driving?"" He also said he had decided to move his family to County Durham before his wife fell ill with suspected Covid because of security concerns over his home in London. Asked why he had given a story that was ""not the 100% truth"" when he held a special press conference in the Downing Street rose garden on 25 May, Mr Cummings admitted that ""the way we handled the whole thing was wrong"". This video can not be played Cummings says he drove to Barnard Castle to test vision Boris Johnson stood by his adviser throughout the Barnard Castle episode - to the consternation of some of his supporters, who feared it was undermining his attempts to hold the country together during a national crisis. Cummings accuses government of Covid secrecy Kuenssberg: What led to Cummings' departure? Dominic Cummings launches attack on PM's integrity Some said the episode burned through the political capital the prime minister had generated months earlier during the 2019 general election. This video can not be played Boris Johnson defends his senior adviser Dominic Cummings in May 2020 But it is hard to overstate how important Mr Cummings was to the Johnson project. The two are very different characters - Mr Johnson likes to be popular, Mr Cummings appears indifferent to such concerns - but they formed a strong bond in the white heat of the 2016 Vote Leave campaign to get Britain out of the EU, which Mr Cummings led as campaign director. The combination of Mr Johnson, the flamboyant household-name frontman, with Mr Cummings, the ruthless, data-driven strategist, with a flair for an eye-catching slogan, proved to be unbeatable. Mr Cummings was credited with formulating the ""take back control"" slogan that appears to have struck a chord with so many referendum voters, changing the course of British history. Yet some were surprised when Mr Cummings was brought into the heart of government as Mr Johnson's chief adviser, given his past record of rubbing senior Tory politicians up the wrong way. It proved to be a shrewd move. It was Mr Cummings who devised the high-risk strategy of pushing for the 2019 election to be fought on a ""Get Brexit Done"" ticket, focusing on winning seats in Labour heartlands, something no previous Tory leader had managed to do in decades. Many of the policy ideas that have shaped the Johnson government's agenda have his fingerprints all over them. ""Levelling up"" - moving power and money out of London and the South East of England - is a Cummings project, as are plans to shake-up the civil service, take on the judiciary and reform the planning system. The team that surrounded Mr Cummings at Downing Street, some of whom are Vote Leave veterans, were fiercely loyal to him and shared a sense that they were outsiders in Whitehall, battling an entrenched ""elite"". Lee Cain, the former Downing Street and Vote Leave communications chief, left No 10 just before Mr Cummings did. Mr Cummings watches the PM in action at a coronavirus briefing There had been rumours of a rift between the Vote Leave veterans and other No 10 aides, who didn't like Mr Cummings's and Mr Cain's abrasive style. There were tales of crackdowns on special advisers suspected of leaking to the media and angry, dismissive behaviour towards Tory MPs, civil servants and even secretaries of state. None of this will have come as much of a surprise to veteran Cummings watchers. Mr Cummings has been in and around the upper reaches of government and the Conservative Party for nearly two decades, and has made a career out of defying conventional wisdom and challenging the established order. But he has never been a member of the Conservative Party, or any party, and appears to have little time for most MPs. A longstanding Eurosceptic who cut his campaigning teeth as a director of the anti-euro Business for Sterling group, Mr Cummings's other passion is changing the way government operates. He grabbed headlines when heposted an advert on his personal blogfor ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills"" to work in government, arguing that the civil service lacked ""deep expertise"" in many policy areas. Leave.EU fined Â£70,000 for breaking electoral law during referendum Vote Leave's Dominic Cummings 'in contempt of Parliament' Review: Brexit - The Uncivil War starring Benedict Cumberbatch The Vote Leave bus was one of its most notable campaign tactics Mr Cummings is a native of Durham, in the North East of England. His father, Robert, was an oil rig engineer and his mother, Morag, a teacher and behavioural specialist. He went to a state primary school and was then privately educated at Durham School. He graduated from Oxford University with a first-class degree in modern history and spent some time in Russia, where he was involved with an ill-fated attempt to launch an airline, among other projects. He is married to Spectator journalist Mary Wakefield, the daughter of aristocrat Sir Humphry Wakefield, whose family seat isChillingam Castle,external, in Northumberland. After a stint as campaign director for Business for Sterling, Mr Cummings spent eight months as chief strategy adviser to then Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, who fired him. He played a key role in the 2004 campaign against an elected regional assembly in his native North East. In what turned out to be a dry run for the Brexit campaign, the North East Says No team won the referendum with a mix of eye-catching stunts - including an inflatable white elephant - and snappy slogans that tapped into the growing anti-politics mood among the public. He is then said to have retreated to his father's farm, in County Durham, where he spent his time reading science and history books in an effort to attain a better understanding of the world. Mr Cummings facing questions from the media outside his home He re-emerged in 2007 as a special adviser to Michael Gove, who became education secretary in 2010 and turned out to be something of a kindred spirit. The pair would rail against what they called ""the blob"" - the informal alliance of senior civil servants and teachers' unions that sought, in their opinion, to frustrate their attempts at reform. He left of his own accord to set up a free school, having alienated a number of senior people in the education ministry and the Conservative Party. He once described former Brexit Secretary David Davis as ""thick as mince"" and as ""lazy as a toad"" and irritated David Cameron, the then prime minister, who called him a ""career psychopath"". Benedict Cumberbatch was widely praised for his portrayal of Dominic Cummings in Brexit: The Uncivil War His appointment as head of the Vote Leave campaign - dramatised in Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War - was seen as a risk worth taking by those putting the campaign together but he left a controversial legacy. Vote Leave was found to have broken electoral law over spending limits by the Electoral Commission and Mr Cummings was held in contempt of Parliament for failing to respond to a summons to appear before and give evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee. Like most advisers, he shunned media interviews when he was in government, and his rare appearances before MPs were characterised by animosity on both sides. All that has changed in recent weeks, but it would be a brave person who said he had now joined the ranks of the former Westminster insiders who make their living as pundits - a class he appears to view with as much disdain as he does his former colleagues in government.

"As a teenager in the 1980s, Sajid Javid, the UK's new chancellor, was an ardent admirer of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the country's first female premier. He even has a portrait of the ""Iron Lady"" in his office. So as he packs his things at the Home Office ready for the move to Treasury, that may be one of the things he takes with him, along with the sense that, like her, he is breaking new ground. He was the first home secretary from an ethnic minority when he took the post last year. Now he will be the UK's first chancellor from the immigrant community. He grew up being taunted with racist names, and hearing his parents' stories of how they arrived here with a pound in their pocket and a determination to work hard. He's told the stories many times, although it is not yet clear how - or whether - those experiences will translate into policies, once he has his feet under the desk at Number 11 Downing Street. How much would PM's shopping list cost? Prime Minister Boris Johnson: Who's in his cabinet? The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), representing UK employers, has already sent round a long wish-list for the new administration, including calls to make it easier for firms to recruit workers from overseas. Mr Javid has talked of creating a Â£100bn national infrastructure fund and investing heavily in house building, but the CBI would also like confirmation that big public infrastructure projects such as HS2 will go ahead. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) would like to see the new chancellor focus on increasing real wages and investment in public services, the relaxation of austerity that has been trailed by Mr Javid's predecessor, Philip Hammond. But before breaking the mould politically, Mr Javid was already confounding expectations for a state school boy from one of the least affluent parts of Bristol, by rapidly climbing the ranks in international banking. He worked first for Chase Manhattan Bank and then Deutsche Bank, where by the age of 40, he was a senior managing director in charge of global credit trading, whereaccording to the Financial Times,externalhe earned Â£3m a year. So Miles Celic, chief executive at CityUK, the body representing the financial services industry, hopes that Mr Javid's knowledge and experience of the sector will make him see things from their perspective. ""He's someone who knows the industry, he's worked in the industry, but most importantly he was city minister previously,"" says Mr Celic. ""He's familiar with our issues, our challenges."" Who is Sajid Javid? Born in Rochdale, Lancashire 49-year-old son of immigrant parents from Pakistan Attended state comprehensive in Bristol Studied politics and economics at Exeter University, where he joined the Conservatives Home secretary in Theresa May's government 2018-2019 A Eurosceptic who backed Remain in the referendum with a ""heavy heart and no enthusiasm"" What the City would like most of all, of course, is certainty and continuity in the UK's relationship with the EU. That may be hard for Mr Javid to deliver, his room for manoeuvre determined by the new occupant next door at Number 10. Mr Celic believes Mr Javid will want to build on the plans his predecessor Philip Hammond put in place, trying to negotiate a deal with the EU. But the new chancellor has previously said he would be prepared to take Britain out of the EU without a deal if necessary. He has spoken of preparing an ""emergency Budget"" including tax cuts to smooth the way. Tax cuts won't be popular with everyone. ""In the leadership election, we heard a lot about increasing funding for public services and making sure public servants get a pay rise. It's something we hope they'd be taking seriously,"" says Kate Bell, head of economics at the TUC. ""We heard other - worrying - things about tax cuts for higher earners which shouldn't be the priority at this stage."" During that election race, Mr Javid said his priority would be to cut the basic rate, buthe told the Telegraph,externalhe would consider scrapping the top rate of income tax altogether, if he thought it would inject more ""dynamism"" into the economy.

"ASAP Rocky has been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm in Sweden and will remain in custody until a trial takes place. The rapper, real name Rakim Mayers, was arrested in Stockholm in early July. The two men arrested with him have also been charged with assault. His arrest followed a fight that was captured on video, with ASAP claiming he had acted in self-defence against men who were following his group. The trial is due to start on 30 July. The Swedish prosecutor in charge says he decided a crime had been committed - despite claims of self-defence and provocation - after ""studying the videos made available to the inquiry"". ""My evidence consists partly of a number of films that I will play in court. Some are known to the public and some are not,"" Daniel Suneson told Radio 1 Newsbeat, referencing CCTV footage. He added that the alleged victim's statement was supported by witness statements. Assault causing actual bodily harm carries a maximum prison sentence of two years in Sweden. ASAP Rocky has been held in custody since 3 July following an alleged assault which took place on 30 June. ""From the perspective of the individuals in this case it is of course an extremely long time - three weeks - in jail,"" Mr Suneson said. The prosecutor says his focus has been investigating the case ""as quickly as possible"" and that ""three weeks of investigation time for an assault with three suspects"" isn't a long time. The rapper's detention in Sweden has attracted the attention of US President Donald Trump, who said he'd spoken to the Swedish Prime Minister after requests to intervene from Kanye West and his wife Kim Kardashian West.

Mr Suneson felt there was ""an obvious risk that these three suspects would leave the country if they were released"". ""I can see the damage they would suffer from being detained, I can understand that, but it did not outweigh the risk that they would leave the country,"" he said. Asked specifically about Donald Trump's intervention into the case, Mr Suneson said he hadn't spoken to any White House representatives, or any representatives of the Swedish government, while investigating. ASAP Rocky's mumrecently pleaded for his release, saying he ""isn't really eating properly"" and suggesting he's being made an example of. Some have accused Swedish prosecutors of racism in relation to the case, including ASAP Rocky's mum, but that's something officials have denied, saying they have ""no hidden agenda"". White rapper G-Eazy claimed recently that ASAP Rocky's three-week stay in a Swedish prison was an example of systemic racism. G-Eazy was arrested in Sweden last year for assault, possession of drugs and use of narcotics. After pleading guilty he was sentenced to probation, given a $10k fine, and released after a day-and-a-half. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""I can see why that case only took a couple of days... you can't compare them,"" he said. A video published online appears to show ASAP Rocky punching another man in the street. In videos posted to ASAP Rocky's Instagram afterwards, he and the people he's with repeatedly tell a pair of men to stop following them. One of the men accuses the 30-year-old's team of breaking his headphones. In the caption for the first video ASAP Rocky writes: ""We don't know these guys and we didn't want trouble. They followed us for four blocks."" In the second, he accuses the man of hitting his security guard ""in the face with headphones"". The 30-year-old was in Stockholm to perform at Smash festival. But he's spent the past month at Kronoberg prison while the alleged assault was investigated. The prison's boss defended conditions at the jail, after claims that walking into Kronoberg prison is like ""walking into a toilet"". He told Radio 1 Newsbeat ASAP Rocky was being held in ""good conditions"". Swedish prosecutors were twice granted more time to investigate, and had until 25 July to decide whether ASAP Rocky should be charged or released. It's led to multiple cancelled festival appearances and threats to boycott Sweden from some of his fellow artists. There were initially two alleged victims in the case, but the prosecutor has dropped one of their cases due to a lack of evidence. An alleged victim - who was also being investigated on suspicion of abuse, assault, and attempted assault - had his case closed on 22 July.

"Boeing is warning that it might have to halt production of the 737 Max if grounding continues much longer. The company reported its largest-ever quarterly loss of $3.4bn (Â£2.7bn) on Wednesday due to the troubled plane. If hurdles with regulators worldwide continue, Boeing said it would consider reducing or shutting down production of the 737 Max entirely. However, Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg is confident the plane will be back in the air by October. ""As our efforts to support the 737 Max's safe return to service continue, we will continue to assess our production plans,"" Mr Muilenburg told investors in a conference call. ""Should our estimate of the anticipated return to service change, we might need to consider possible further rate reductions or other options, including a temporary shutdown of the Max production."" Boeing's entire fleet of flagship 737 Max planeswas grounded in Marchafter issues with the model were linked to an Ethiopian Airlines flight crash that killed 157 people. Five months earlier, 189 people were killed when a Boeing 737 Max operated by Lion Air crashed. Asinvestigations into the two crashes continue, Boeing has been working on fixes for itsMcas anti-stall flight control software, as well asother issues identified by regulators, including the US Federal Aviation Administration. Boeing, which has customers in 150 countries, is still waiting for approval from regulators. Mr Muilenberg said the planemaker had been holding weekly technical calls with operators of the 737 Max, while the modified software had so far been tested in 225 flight simulator sessions. This video can not be played The Mcas system explained ""These are challenging times, first and foremost, for the families and loved ones who are affected by these recent events, and also for our dedicated people, who work tirelessly to deliver on our mission to connect, protect, explore and inspire the world, all with a relentless focus on quality and safety and doing so with the utmost integrity,"" he stressed. ""This is a defining moment for Boeing and we're committed to coming through this challenging time better and stronger as a company."" After the two crashes, production of the 737 Max was reduced from 52 to 42 aircraft per month, Mr Muilenburg said. The knock-on effect of this move is that Boeing has to pay more for plane parts than before, which are priced according to the volume purchased by the planemaker. Having to suspend deliveries of new 737 Max planes to airlines has also hit Boeing's cash flow and profit margins. Grounded Boeing 737 MAX aeroplanes stored near Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington Further reducing production of the plane would compound these problems, which could lead Boeing to halt production of the 737 Max completely - a move the company has not taken since it halted production of the 747 for 20 days in 1997, when demand outstripped supply of parts. The grounding of the 737 Max and the cuts in production have both affected Boeing's customers and are likely to continue to cause plane delivery delays in the future, Mr Muilenberg acknowledged. ""I want to personally thank everyone who continues to be our partner in this journey; from our airline customers and their pilots, flight attendants and others who have been impacted by these groundings, representatives from all levels of government who share our commitment to safety for the flying public and everyone in the aviation community impacted by these events,"" he said.

""This is a defining moment for Boeing and we're committed to coming through this challenging time better and stronger as a company."" After the two crashes, production of the 737 Max was reduced from 52 to 42 aircraft per month, Mr Muilenburg said. The knock-on effect of this move is that Boeing has to pay more for plane parts than before, which are priced according to the volume purchased by the planemaker. Having to suspend deliveries of new 737 Max planes to airlines has also hit Boeing's cash flow and profit margins. Grounded Boeing 737 MAX aeroplanes stored near Boeing Field in Seattle, Washington Further reducing production of the plane would compound these problems, which could lead Boeing to halt production of the 737 Max completely - a move the company has not taken since it halted production of the 747 for 20 days in 1997, when demand outstripped supply of parts. The grounding of the 737 Max and the cuts in production have both affected Boeing's customers and are likely to continue to cause plane delivery delays in the future, Mr Muilenberg acknowledged. ""I want to personally thank everyone who continues to be our partner in this journey; from our airline customers and their pilots, flight attendants and others who have been impacted by these groundings, representatives from all levels of government who share our commitment to safety for the flying public and everyone in the aviation community impacted by these events,"" he said. ""We are grateful for your support and we will continue striving to earn and re-earn your trust.""

"As a teenager in the 1980s, Sajid Javid, the UK's new chancellor, was an ardent admirer of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, the country's first female premier. He even has a portrait of the ""Iron Lady"" in his office. So as he packs his things at the Home Office ready for the move to Treasury, that may be one of the things he takes with him, along with the sense that, like her, he is breaking new ground. He was the first home secretary from an ethnic minority when he took the post last year. Now he will be the UK's first chancellor from the immigrant community. He grew up being taunted with racist names, and hearing his parents' stories of how they arrived here with a pound in their pocket and a determination to work hard. He's told the stories many times, although it is not yet clear how - or whether - those experiences will translate into policies, once he has his feet under the desk at Number 11 Downing Street. How much would PM's shopping list cost? Prime Minister Boris Johnson: Who's in his cabinet? The Confederation of British Industry (CBI), representing UK employers, has already sent round a long wish-list for the new administration, including calls to make it easier for firms to recruit workers from overseas. Mr Javid has talked of creating a Â£100bn national infrastructure fund and investing heavily in house building, but the CBI would also like confirmation that big public infrastructure projects such as HS2 will go ahead. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) would like to see the new chancellor focus on increasing real wages and investment in public services, the relaxation of austerity that has been trailed by Mr Javid's predecessor, Philip Hammond. But before breaking the mould politically, Mr Javid was already confounding expectations for a state school boy from one of the least affluent parts of Bristol, by rapidly climbing the ranks in international banking. He worked first for Chase Manhattan Bank and then Deutsche Bank, where by the age of 40, he was a senior managing director in charge of global credit trading, whereaccording to the Financial Times,externalhe earned Â£3m a year. So Miles Celic, chief executive at CityUK, the body representing the financial services industry, hopes that Mr Javid's knowledge and experience of the sector will make him see things from their perspective. ""He's someone who knows the industry, he's worked in the industry, but most importantly he was city minister previously,"" says Mr Celic. ""He's familiar with our issues, our challenges."" Who is Sajid Javid? Born in Rochdale, Lancashire 49-year-old son of immigrant parents from Pakistan Attended state comprehensive in Bristol Studied politics and economics at Exeter University, where he joined the Conservatives Home secretary in Theresa May's government 2018-2019 A Eurosceptic who backed Remain in the referendum with a ""heavy heart and no enthusiasm"" What the City would like most of all, of course, is certainty and continuity in the UK's relationship with the EU. That may be hard for Mr Javid to deliver, his room for manoeuvre determined by the new occupant next door at Number 10. Mr Celic believes Mr Javid will want to build on the plans his predecessor Philip Hammond put in place, trying to negotiate a deal with the EU. But the new chancellor has previously said he would be prepared to take Britain out of the EU without a deal if necessary. He has spoken of preparing an ""emergency Budget"" including tax cuts to smooth the way. Tax cuts won't be popular with everyone. ""In the leadership election, we heard a lot about increasing funding for public services and making sure public servants get a pay rise. It's something we hope they'd be taking seriously,"" says Kate Bell, head of economics at the TUC. ""We heard other - worrying - things about tax cuts for higher earners which shouldn't be the priority at this stage."" During that election race, Mr Javid said his priority would be to cut the basic rate, buthe told the Telegraph,externalhe would consider scrapping the top rate of income tax altogether, if he thought it would inject more ""dynamism"" into the economy.

"ASAP Rocky has been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm in Sweden and will remain in custody until a trial takes place. The rapper, real name Rakim Mayers, was arrested in Stockholm in early July. The two men arrested with him have also been charged with assault. His arrest followed a fight that was captured on video, with ASAP claiming he had acted in self-defence against men who were following his group. The trial is due to start on 30 July. The Swedish prosecutor in charge says he decided a crime had been committed - despite claims of self-defence and provocation - after ""studying the videos made available to the inquiry"". ""My evidence consists partly of a number of films that I will play in court. Some are known to the public and some are not,"" Daniel Suneson told Radio 1 Newsbeat, referencing CCTV footage. He added that the alleged victim's statement was supported by witness statements. Assault causing actual bodily harm carries a maximum prison sentence of two years in Sweden. ASAP Rocky has been held in custody since 3 July following an alleged assault which took place on 30 June. ""From the perspective of the individuals in this case it is of course an extremely long time - three weeks - in jail,"" Mr Suneson said. The prosecutor says his focus has been investigating the case ""as quickly as possible"" and that ""three weeks of investigation time for an assault with three suspects"" isn't a long time. The rapper's detention in Sweden has attracted the attention of US President Donald Trump, who said he'd spoken to the Swedish Prime Minister after requests to intervene from Kanye West and his wife Kim Kardashian West.

Mr Suneson felt there was ""an obvious risk that these three suspects would leave the country if they were released"". ""I can see the damage they would suffer from being detained, I can understand that, but it did not outweigh the risk that they would leave the country,"" he said. Asked specifically about Donald Trump's intervention into the case, Mr Suneson said he hadn't spoken to any White House representatives, or any representatives of the Swedish government, while investigating. ASAP Rocky's mumrecently pleaded for his release, saying he ""isn't really eating properly"" and suggesting he's being made an example of. Some have accused Swedish prosecutors of racism in relation to the case, including ASAP Rocky's mum, but that's something officials have denied, saying they have ""no hidden agenda"". White rapper G-Eazy claimed recently that ASAP Rocky's three-week stay in a Swedish prison was an example of systemic racism. G-Eazy was arrested in Sweden last year for assault, possession of drugs and use of narcotics. After pleading guilty he was sentenced to probation, given a $10k fine, and released after a day-and-a-half. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Mr Suneson said he didn't know all of the details of G-Eazy's arrest, but suggested it was a ""totally different case"". ""He admitted most of the things that he was accused of. ""I can see why that case only took a couple of days... you can't compare them,"" he said. A video published online appears to show ASAP Rocky punching another man in the street. In videos posted to ASAP Rocky's Instagram afterwards, he and the people he's with repeatedly tell a pair of men to stop following them. One of the men accuses the 30-year-old's team of breaking his headphones. In the caption for the first video ASAP Rocky writes: ""We don't know these guys and we didn't want trouble. They followed us for four blocks."" In the second, he accuses the man of hitting his security guard ""in the face with headphones"". The 30-year-old was in Stockholm to perform at Smash festival. But he's spent the past month at Kronoberg prison while the alleged assault was investigated. The prison's boss defended conditions at the jail, after claims that walking into Kronoberg prison is like ""walking into a toilet"". He told Radio 1 Newsbeat ASAP Rocky was being held in ""good conditions"". Swedish prosecutors were twice granted more time to investigate, and had until 25 July to decide whether ASAP Rocky should be charged or released. It's led to multiple cancelled festival appearances and threats to boycott Sweden from some of his fellow artists. There were initially two alleged victims in the case, but the prosecutor has dropped one of their cases due to a lack of evidence. An alleged victim - who was also being investigated on suspicion of abuse, assault, and attempted assault - had his case closed on 22 July.

MPs are now officially on their summer break, and are due back in Westminster in September. A European Commission spokesperson says Boris Johnson and outgoing Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker have spoken on the phone. Mr Juncker reiterated the EU's longstanding position that the current withdrawal deal is the only agreement possible with the UK. Mr Juncker added that the commission would analyse ideas put forward by the UK, as long as they are compatible with the existing withdrawal deal. He also told the PM the commission remained open to changing the language of the non-binding political declaration on future relations.

"The Sunderland plant opened in 1986 Nissan workers around the world are braced for the Japanese car giant to announce thousands of job cuts as it attempts to shore up its image and its finances after recent troubles. According to media reports, the firm will announce more than 10,000 job losses on Thursday amid weakening sales at the company. In the UK, union sources said they hoped the cuts would not affect workers at Nissan's Sunderland plant. Nissan declined to comment. The firm is also expected to announce an around-90% fall in profits for the first quarter of 2019, which would represent one of the one of the carmaker's worst quarterly performances in a decade. Nissan cuts two models from Sunderland plant Nissan boss was too powerful, report finds Carlos Ghosn: Former Nissan boss hit with fresh charge The job cuts are expected to be implemented over several years and would include 4,800 already announced in May, according to the Reuters news agency. The carmaker is reining in its operations after years of expansion under former chairman Carlos Ghosn, who was ousted last year after being accused of financial crimes. It is trying to improve weak profit margins in the US, which is a key market, after years of discounting to boost sales. ""Deteriorating performance in the US is a big issue that we're facing,"" Motoo Nagai, chairman of Nissan's audit committee, said on Wednesday. ""For a long time we were concerned with increasing volume [of sales]. We were chasing numbers. Now it's time to enhance the brand."" The expected job cuts would total more than 7% of Nissan's 138,000-strong workforce, Reuters reported. Regions which could be affected include India and Brazil, where the firm has factories. Nissan boss Hiroto Saikawa faces a number of challenges, including fractured relations with French alliance partner Renault following the arrest of Mr Ghosn, their shared former chairman. Mr Ghosn has denied all the charges against him. Mr Saikawa, who was appointed by Mr Ghosn, kept his job in a vote at an annual shareholders meeting last month, but Nissan has formed a nominations committee to find his successor.

"Epstein is awaiting trial on sex-trafficking and conspiracy charges Wealthy financier Jeffrey Epstein was found semi-conscious in his prison cell on Thursday, US media reports say. The 66-year-old, who is awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, was reportedly found sprawled on the floor with injuries to his neck on Wednesday. The cause is unclear - neither suicide attempt nor assault has been ruled out. He has been at the New York facility since being denied bail last week. Epstein has pleaded not guilty to sex trafficking and conspiracy charges. The US Bureau of Prisons issued a statement saying that Epstein was, as of noon local time (16:00 GMT), at New York's Metropolitan Correctional Center and ""not in a local hospital as has been reported"". But it was not clear if he had been treated for injuries either at a hospital or the prison, with officials saying ""we do not share information on an inmate's medical status or their conditions of confinement"". Who is Jeffrey Epstein? Jeffrey Epstein: What are his friends saying? He was taken to a nearby hospital in Manhattan, reports say, but his condition has not been made public. Investigators are working to establish what happened. According to the indictment, the financier is accused of paying girls under the age of 18 to perform sex acts at his Manhattan and Florida mansions between 2002 and 2005. Epstein, who was arrested on 6 July after landing in New Jersey on his private jet, avoided similar charges in a controversial secret plea deal in 2008, and instead pleaded guilty to a lesser charge. That plea deal has come under increasing scrutiny and, earlier this month,US Labor Secretary Alex Acosta resigned over his role in it. Epstein's mansion in New York City Prosecutors also accuse Epstein of paying large amounts of money to two potential witnesses during the forthcoming trial. He has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. If convicted, he faces up to 45 years in prison. He was denied bail last Thursdaybut his lawyers have appealed against the decision. New York-born Epstein worked as a teacher before moving into finance. Prior to the criminal cases against him, he was best known for his wealth and high-profile connections. He has long been surrounded by the rich and powerful, including President Donald Trump, former President Bill Clinton and the UK's Prince Andrew. In a 2002 profile in New York Magazine,Mr Trump referred to Epstein as a ""terrific guy"",external. ""He's a lot of fun to be with,"" he said. ""It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side."" This video can not be played In July 2019, President Trump sought to distance himself from Jeffrey Epstein However, Mr Trump has said the pair fell out ""12 or 15 years ago"" and reiterated on Friday that he was ""not a fan of Jeffrey Epstein"". Reports of Epstein's current wealth vary, with his Virgin Islands-based firm generating no public records. 2002:The earliest allegations of abuse covered by the current case take place. October 2002:Donald Trump tells New York magazine he has known Epstein for 15 years,external, and that he is a ""terrific guy.... it is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side"". 2005:One of Epstein's alleged victims, aged 14, reports him to the police in Palm Beach - sparking the first investigation. May 2006:Epstein is charged with unlawful sex acts with a minor. Later in the year, the case is referred to the FBI. 2007:A plea deal is struck with Alex Acosta, the US attorney in Florida. Instead of facing federal sex-trafficking charges, he pleads guilty to two charges of soliciting prostitution, including with a minor. June 2008:Epstein is sentenced to 13 months in prison - a private wing of a county jail. He is also allowed to leave for work - up to 12 hours a day, six days a week. he does, however, have to register as a sex offender. April 2017:Alex Acosta is appointed labor secretary by now-President Donald Trump.

"Samsung's first foldable smartphone will go on sale in September after problems with the device delayed its initial release. The April launch of the Galaxy Fold was postponed after early reviewers reported broken screens. Samsung said it had made ""improvements"" to the nearly $2,000 (Â£1,603) device which would be sold in ""select markets"". The firm has been racing to launch a folding smartphone before its rivals. ""Samsung has taken the time to fully evaluate the product design, make necessary improvements and run rigorous tests,""the company said in a statement.,external Improvements include extending a protective layer to make it clear it is not meant to be removed, as well as strengthening the hinge area with new protection caps. One explanation for the broken screensappears to have been that some reviewers removed a film which they thought was a typical protective layer that came with the phone when first bought. This video can not be played WATCH: Hands-on with the Samsung Galaxy Fold The defects with the device proved a source of embarrassment for Samsung which has seen declining smartphone sales and faces growing competition from rivals including China's Huawei. Huawei became the second largest smartphone seller in the world last year andplans to launchits folding smartphone in September. The company also pushed back the release of its foldable phone, saying it wanted to conduct extra tests following the screen problems with Samsung's Galaxy Fold.

"Ms Sturgeon wants to hold an independence referendum within the next two years Scotland's first minister has said an independence referendum is more important than ever as she urged Boris Johnson to ""change course"" on Brexit. In a letter to the new prime minister, Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Mr Johnson on his appointment. But she warned that leaving the EU on 31 October without an exit deal being agreed would cause ""lasting harm"". And she said it was essential that Scotland was able to choose an ""alternative option"". In his first speech as prime minister on Wednesday afternoon, Mr Johnson said he was confident a Brexit deal could be agreed before the UK's departure date of 31 October. However, he insisted the country would be leaving on that date, ""no ifs, not buts"". Boris Johnson promises start of 'golden age' A prime minister in a hurry Johnson sacks Mundell as Scottish secretary Mr Johnson insisted in the Commons on Thursday that a ""fantastic, sensible and progressive Brexit"" would kill off calls for independence. But the SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, predicted Mr Johnson would be the ""last prime minister of the United Kingdom"". Ms Sturgeon used her letter to highlight previous Scottish government research which suggested a no-deal Brexit could cost 100,000 jobs in Scotland. The research also claimed that even a free trade agreement could see a fall in Scottish national income of about Â£1,600 per person compared with continuing EU membership. Mr Johnson hosted the first meeting of his new ministerial team on Thursday morning Ms Sturgeon said: ""I urge you to study this analysis closely so that you understand the implications for Scotland of the policy you are pursuing on Brexit and why it is therefore imperative that you change course immediately to avoid causing lasting harm to the people of Scotland. ""However, given your public comments about leaving the EU on 31 October with or without a deal, 'come what may' and 'do or die', it is now - more than ever - essential that in Scotland we have an alternative option. ""In line with the democratic mandate given to us in 2016, the Scottish government will continue to make preparations to give people in Scotland the choice of becoming an independent country."" Ms Sturgeon also said it was a ""basic democratic principle"" that the people of Scotland should be able to ""determine their own future"". Ruth Davidson is said to be ""livid"" over the sacking of David Mundell as Scottish secretary The first minister announced in April of this year that she wanted to hold indyref2 by 2021, although she conceded that she would need the consent of the UK government before that could happen. Mr Johnson pledged during the Conservative leadership contest that he would be ""minister for the Union"" as well as prime minister. He used his speech outside 10 Downing Street on Wednesday to describe the nations of the UK as the ""awesome foursome that are incarnated in that red, white, and blue flag"". And he said that the United Kingdom made all four nations ""so much more than the sum of their parts, and whose brand and political personality is admired and even loved around the world"". Alisrter Jack has been appointed as the new Scottish secretary Mr Johnson sacked Scottish Secretary David Mundell - who has openly criticised him in the past - as he carried out a major overhaul of the cabinet, with Dumfries and Galloway MP Alister Jack taking over the role. Mr Mundell told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that he would have been willing to remain in Mr Johnson's cabinet so he could work with the prime minister to ""secure Scotland's place in the Union and to deliver Brexit."" BBC Scotland understands there is anger among some Scottish Conservatives over his sacking - with a source saying that party leader Ruth Davidson is ""absolutely livid"". Ms Davidson, a close political ally of Mr Mundell, said earlier this week that she wanted him to remain in the job, and that the new prime minister ""would do well to take David's advice on Scotland"". She added: ""If the prime minister chose to keep on David Mundell, I would be very happy with that."" The source also claimed that the possibility of the Scottish Conservatives breaking away from the UK party was ""high and growing"", and was likely to be ""the first and possibly the only item on the agenda"" during an ""away day"" for Tory MSPs at the end of August. Who is new Scottish Secretary Alister Jack? David Mundell: The Remainer who had to go Mr Jack used his first public statement to defend the Union, and promised to stand up for the majority of Scots who voted to remain part of the UK in the 2014 referendum ""against those who would try to impose unwanted and divisive constitutional change"". He said: ""We need to continue to defend the Union against those who would seek to tear it apart. In 2014, the people of Scotland voted to remain part of a strong United Kingdom. ""We will stand up for their decision against those who would try to impose unwanted and divisive constitutional change."" Mr Jack attended the first meeting of Mr Johnson's new Cabinet on Thursday morning. The SNP manifesto ahead of its victory in the last Holyrood election saida referendum should be held if there was a ""significant and material change in the circumstances that prevailed in 2014, such as Scotland being taken out of the EU against our will"". Ms Sturgeon said immediately after the EU referendum that the 2015 manifesto pledge gave her a mandate to hold another referendum in the autumn of 2018 or spring of 2019. She put her plans on hold after the SNP lost 21 seats in the 2017 general election, withthe first minister admitting that the prospect of an independence referendum was a factor in the result- which saw her party's share of the vote drop from 50% to 37%. But the SNP and Scottish Greens continue to form a pro-independence majority in the Scottish Parliament.

There will be plenty of challenges for the new government, andBBC correspondents run through four of the biggest.

By Rebecca Wearn, business reporter, BBC News It is a hot July day in Lancashire and a dozen people are gathering on a dusty farm track two miles outside the market town of Ormskirk.

Feedback Global is one of a handful of campaign groups organising gleans across Britain. It's seen its efforts swell - more than doubling the days in the fields between 2014 and 2018, working with four times as many volunteers and harvesting more than a hundred tonnes of unwanted fruit and vegetables from farms that would otherwise be left to rot.

Mr Juncker reiterated the EU's longstanding position that the current withdrawal deal is the only agreement possible with the UK. Mr Juncker added that the commission would analyse ideas put forward by the UK, as long as they are compatible with the existing withdrawal deal.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says Britain would be âclean, green, prosperous, united, confident and ambitiousâ. Boris Johnson has promised the ""beginning of a new golden age"", as he made his first Commons statement as PM. Speaking to MPs, Mr Johnson said his government would throw itself into Brexit negotiations with energy, while Michael Gove would lead on no-deal planning as a ""top priority"". He also said EU citizens living in the UK would have their rights protected. But Downing Street was unable to confirm if there would be any new laws to underpin the commitment. Tory MP Alberto Costa - who has campaigned for EU citizens' rights after Brexit - welcomed Mr Johnson's pledge, but said ""the devil, as ever, is in the detail"" and he would be ""scrutinising how that guarantee comes forward"". Replying to his statement in the Commons, Jeremy Corbyn said people ""do not trust"" the new PM to deliver on his promises. And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas written to Mr Johnsonto say it is ""essential"" her country has an alternative option to his Brexit plan. Barnier attacks 'combative' Johnson speech Does the UK owe the EU Â£39bn? Prime Minister Boris Johnson: Who's in his cabinet? Live updates as Boris Johnson addresses MPs Who are Boris Johnson's key advisers? The statement came after the first meeting of Mr Johnson's new cabinet, who he said had all committed to leaving the EU on or before 31 October, ""no ifs, no buts"". New secretaries of state include former leadership contender Sajid Javid as chancellor, and leading Brexiteers, with Dominic Raab as foreign secretary and Priti Patel as home secretary. More junior ministers are expected to be announced later, with further reshuffling on Friday. Mr Johnson has also held his first calls with other foreign leaders - including Dutch PM Mark Rutte and Australian PM Scott Morrison - and is due to speak to the European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker later. Much of Mr Johnson's statement focused on his plans for Brexit. Despite emphasising the importance of preparing for no deal, the new prime minister said he would ""much prefer"" to leave the EU with an agreement, saying he would work ""flat out to make it happen"". Boris Johnson gave his first statement to the Commons as PM, flanked by his new Foreign Secretary, Dominic Raab (l), and his new Chancellor, Sajid Javid However, he told MPs the withdrawal agreement his predecessor, Theresa May, had negotiated with the EU was ""unacceptable to this Parliament and to this country"". That plan was voted down three times by MPs, with one of the controversial parts being the Northern Ireland backstop - a mechanism to avoid physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in case no trade deal is agreed between the UK and the EU by the end of the transition period. Mr Johnson has pledged to scrap this element of the plan, saying alternative arrangements to keep checks away from the border were ""perfectly compatible"" with the Good Friday Agreement - the peace agreement signed in 1998. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, said eliminating the backstop from the withdrawal agreement was ""unacceptable"", and after Mr Johnson's ""rather combative speech"", the bloc would have to ""be ready for all scenarios"". The EU Commission's President, Jean-Claude Juncker, also underlined the EU's position in a call with Mr Johnson, saying the withdrawal agreement negotiated between the bloc and Mrs May was ""the best and only agreement possible"" for Brexit. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn gives a warning to the people who will ""lose out"" in a no-deal Brexit. Addressing MPs, Mr Johnson also said he would be looking into changing the UK's immigration system,as per his leadership campaign pledge. He wants to bring in a points-based system, similar to that used by Australia, and he said he would be asking the Migration Advisory Committee to conduct a review, ""the first step in a radical rewriting"" of the policy. The PM's spokesman later said that further details of Mr Johnson's plans would be revealed ""in the coming days and weeks"". How much would PM's shopping list cost? In Pictures: Boris Johnson becomes UK's new PM Labour's leader said the country was ""deeply worried the new prime minister overestimates himself"". Mr Corbyn added: ""People do not trust this prime minister to make the right choices for the majority of the people in this country when he's also promising tax giveaways to the richest of big business - his own party's funders [a policy Mr Johnsonproposed during the leadership campaign]"". He also asked the PM to rule out ""once and for all"" the NHS would form part of a trade deal with the US, following comments made by President Donald Trump on his visit to the UK in June. Mr Johnson said: ""Under no circumstances would we agree to any free-trade deal that put the NHS on the table."" After a raft of resignations, sackings and appointments on Wednesday night, Mr Johnson addressed his cabinet for the first time as prime minister early on Thursday. He told the cabinet they had ""a momentous task ahead"", as he repeated his commitment for the UK to leave the EU on 31 October - calling it ""a pivotal moment in our country's history"". He said the new team respected the ""depth and breadth of talent in our extraordinary party"", who were ""not going to wait until 31 October to get on with a fantastic new agenda for our country... delivering the priorities of the people"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson holds his first cabinet meeting since becoming prime minister. The appointments have already faced criticism from the opposition, with the chair of the Labour Party, Ian Lavery, calling it ""a cabinet of hard-line conservatives who will only represent the privileged few"". He comments were echoed by independent MP Nick Boles - who resigned the Conservative whip over Brexit - saying the ""few elements remaining of the liberal one-nation Conservative style are neutered captives in this cabinet"". But the new Leader of the House, Mr Rees-Mogg, who led the pro-Brexit Tory European Research Group (ERG), denied there had been a ""Leave"" takeover of the cabinet.

One who is aware that he's up against the clock. One who has to pull off - within a few months - what his predecessor could not manage over years. The team surrounding Boris Johnson has been put together with one goal in mind - to help him keep the promise he's made, to see the country leave the European Union in good time. No 10 believes it shows strength of purpose - a new administration determined and willing to take decisions after years of drift and disappointment. Brexit believers have the top roles. But it is not a cabinet made up purely of the most burning Eurosceptics.

"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""You achieve nothing alone and so my final words are of sincere thanks"" Theresa May has delivered a farewell speech in Downing Street before tendering her resignation to the Queen. She wished new Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his government well, adding: ""Their successes will be our country's successes."" Earlier, Mrs May faced MPs' questions for the final time and looked visibly emotional as she left to applause. Mr Johnson will speak outside No 10 too, before announcing several senior cabinet appointments. He is expected to use the opportunity to increase the number of women in full cabinet positions and boost the representation of ethnic minorities.

He asked whether she would consider joining him ""in opposing the reckless plans of her successor"". She, in reply, listed what she felt were her successes, including school improvements, more employment and greater home ownership. ""At its heart, politics isn't about exchanges across these despatch boxes, nor about eloquent speeches or media headlines,"" she said. ""It is about the difference we make every day to the lives of people up and down this country.""

The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg says Mr Johnson's choice of his top team is critical in his efforts to bring the warring factions of his party together. Mr Johnson is resolute that his leadership rival should not stay on at the Foreign Office, but Mr Hunt is firm that he won't accept anything less than his current role - or becoming home secretary, chancellor or deputy prime minister - and considers other moves a demotion. Our political editor says it is a risky decision for the new PM - forcing Mr Hunt out would be a bad move in terms of uniting the party, but giving in to his refusal to budge is a challenge to his authority. This video can not be played Boris Johnson's victory speech Another key decision Mr Johnson faces is who will take over at the Treasury as chancellor. The incumbent,Philip Hammond, handed in his resignation to,externalMrs May, saying the new PM should be free to choose someone ""fully aligned"" with his views on Brexit. Those said to be in the frame to replace him include current Home Secretary Sajid Javid, former Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Liz Truss, Mr Hammond's deputy at the Treasury. Meanwhile, Dominic Cummings, the former chief of the Vote Leave campaign, is expected to become a senior adviser to the new prime minister. Allow Twitter content?

David Frost, a former ambassador and senior official at the Foreign Office, will be appointed as a key negotiator on Brexit. After his victory, Mr Johnson said his priorities were to deliver Brexit, unite the country and defeat Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. Former Prime Minister David Cameron tweeted his congratulations,externalto the new PM and wished him well for the ""great privilege and responsibility"" to come. Boris Johnson's political inheritance has all the makings of a disaster. He has no Commons majority. There is no mandate from the general public - remember this election has only been decided by Tory members. There are policy problems everywhere in sight, whether that's trying to solve the conundrums of Brexit with a reluctant EU and a divided party, or trying to address deep-seated problems at home. And just as among his fans there is genuine excitement that he will, at last, be in Number 10, there is scepticism and disbelief from the opposition parties, and double-sided concerns in his own party. Read Laura's full analysis here Sweeping changes are expected in the wider cabinet, with a number of other ministers, including Justice Secretary David Gauke and Development Secretary Rory Stewart, having said they cannot serve under Mr Johnson due to his determination to leave the EU, with or without a deal, on 31 October. Those tipped for promotion include Employment Minister Alok Sharma and Local Government Minister Rishi Sunak. Boris Johnson: What's his track record? Is belief enough to sustain Johnson as PM? What does a prime minister actually do? A look at Mr Johnson's in-tray First job? Impress the cat Priti Patel could return to the cabinet less than two years after resigning as international development secretary over a row over unauthorised meetings with Israeli officials. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Ms Patel said she did not want to ""speculate"" on a potential cabinet role, but added it was ""important that we have a government that reflects modern Britain"". And former Sports Minister Tracey Crouch, who quit last year in a dispute with the Treasury over fixed-odds betting terminals, could also be in line for a recall. A source close to Mr Johnson said: ""Boris will build a cabinet showcasing all the talents within the party that truly reflect modern Britain."" Meanwhile, Tory donor Sir Mick Davis has resigned as chief executive of the Conservative Party, saying the new leader should be able to choose his own team. In a letter, he urged fellow donors to get behind Boris Johnson, adding the new PM ""can only be effective if a strong and unified party stands behind him"". Mr Johnson will inherit a wafer-thin parliamentary majority and, like his predecessor, will continue to rely on the support of the Democratic Unionists of Northern Ireland to govern. Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP have said they will oppose him over Brexit, although they have stopped short of threatening an immediate vote of no confidence. Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner said ""discussions are ongoing"" between Labour and potential Tory rebels to find out who might support such a vote. He told Radio 4's Today programme it was ""the nuclear option"" which should be ""used carefully"".

Mr Farage said Mr Johnson would need to call an election if he wanted a no-deal Brexit, in order to ""change the arithmetic"" in the Commons. But Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who is part of Mr Johnson's transition team, said the incoming PM didn't want to see an early election. ""There is no way that we are going to have any kind of electoral pact with the Brexit Party and Nigel Farage,"" he told the Today programme. What the US makes of Boris Johnson US President Donald Trump, speaking to a right-wing youth organisation in Washington DC, said Mr Johnson and Mr Farage would do ""tremendous things"" together. A political strategist and adviser known for his bullish style, Mr Cummings is a long-time Eurosceptic. In 2004, he led the campaign against a North East regional assembly, and in 2007 went to work for Conservative MP Michael Gove, first in opposition and then while he served as education secretary. In 2015, Mr Cummings was appointed campaign director of Vote Leave and became a key architect of its messages, including ""take back control"" and the controversial ""Â£350m-a-week for the NHS"" pledge. Since the referendum, Mr Cummings has often been outspoken on the Brexit process, describing it in 2018 as having been ""irretrievably botched"" by the May government. Laura Kuenssberg said some Brexiteers would be pleased with his appointment, seeing it as a strong sign of Mr Johnson's commitment to a 31 October exit. However, she said there was a lot of very angry water under the bridge between him and Tory MPs on the ERG wing because he refused to allow many of them to be involved in Vote Leave. Earlier this year,Mr Cummings was found in contempt of Parliamentfor refusing to give evidence to a committee of MPs investigating ""fake news"". In return, he accused the committee of ""spreading errors and lies"".
