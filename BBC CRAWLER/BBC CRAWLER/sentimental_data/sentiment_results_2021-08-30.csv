"Wales' all-time leading try-scorer Shane Williams made a BBC documentary exploring concussion in 2020 After just one season of rugby players at a professional team saw a decline in both blood flow to the brain and cognitive function, a new study claims The University of South Wales research followed a professional rugby team over the course of a season, testing players pre-season, mid-season and post season. It will be published in Wednesday's September edition of the Journal of Experimental Physiology. Researchers followed a team which plays in the United Rugby Championship. They say more research is needed on the long-term effects. Their study, seen exclusively by the BBC, has found that over just one season a team of professional rugby players saw a decline in blood flow to the brain and cognitive function - the ability to reason, remember, formulate ideas and perform mental gymnastics. The paper also suggests that rather than only concussions, repetitive contacts, or sub concussions, sustained through rugby have caused the declines seen in the players. Steve Thompson in group of ex-rugby union internationals to sue for brain damage World Rugby 'stands with' former players in new welfare plan Rugby 'should follow NFL' to reduce brain injury risk Concussion in sport: Saliva test is 94% accurate in rugby union trial Former Lions and Wales player Shane Williams suffered head injuries himself while playing, and says the risk of a player getting injured increases when they are tired. He has joined calls for a limit on replacements, because fresher players coming on to the pitch could cause more damage. This new study comes as 200 former players - Welsh and English, male and female, professional and amateur - havebegun legal actionin tandem with Rylands Law firm, against the game's governing bodies World Rugby, the Welsh Rugby Union and Rugby Football Union. Some of those former players have been diagnosed with early onset dementia, and they claim the authorities failed to protect them from the risk caused by concussions and head impacts. World Rugby says it welcomes new research, adding: ""World Rugby recently committed to double our investment in player welfare and new concussion research and initiatives."" Former Wales international Shane Williams Former Wales winger Williams took some big hits and head impacts that affected him in his career, none more so than in a thumping but legal tackle by South Africa's Bakkies Botha in 2004. ""It wasn't until I got back to the hotel several hours later that I realised I wasn't very well,"" he told the BBC. ""That was one of the biggest hits I've ever taken really, I think. ""It was a blur getting changed afterwards - seeing the players, seeing family members in the stadium afterwards, I don't remember - it was almost like I'd blacked out for a couple of hours and the next thing I'm in the hotel again sat in the reception thinking: 'Gosh what happened there?'"" When considering the impacts he's taken over the years, Williams has questioned whether his brain has been affected by the game. ""I'm always questioning: Has my memory deteriorated because of my age? I'm forever writing things down anyway - is that because of my age? Or is it because I've taken hits over the years?"" he said. Head Injury Assessments, or HIA protocols, which now are commonplace on the field of play and are there to help decipher whether a player has had a concussion, did not come into force until 2015. Williams feels if the same incident in 2004 happened now - and knowing what he now knows - he would have taken himself off the field. ""I think a big part of it is education - if I'd have been hit like that today I'd have known straight away that something wasn't right,"" he said. ""People still ask 'would I have changed the way I played, would I have not played?' I wouldn't have, because I played a game that I absolutely loved."" Professor Damian Bailey is one of the report's authors Some studies suggest professional rugby players may be exposed to 11,000 contact events per season, and more research is beginning to show evidence that it may not be concussions alone that could impact the brain, but the cumulative effect and volume of contact events too. The peer reviewed University of South Wales study, which is funded by the Royal Society Wolfson Research Fellowship, recorded six concussion incidents among all the players that took part over the course of the year. However, all of those involved in the study saw a decline in blood flow to the brain and cognitive function between pre and post-season results. The team involved plays in the United Rugby Championship - formerly the Pro14 - and has not been named to maintain confidentiality in accordance with research governance guidelines. Professor Damian Bailey, one of the authors of the study, said: ""Even over a short period we're seeing from the rugby players a greater rate of decline in brain function. ""And we're assuming our baseline is a normal healthy baseline but many of these players have already had many years playing the game, so that baseline is probably still impaired."" Further findings include a correlation between an increase in contact amount, playing position and rate of decline on the main measures tested. ""Because the forwards are involved in more contact, as one would expect, we're seeing a greater degree of impairment relative to the backs,"" Prof Bailey explained. This paper focuses on one squad of professional players over the course of one season, so can any comparisons be drawn between the professional level and at grassroots? Prof Bailey says professional players have less opportunity to recover and repair, much bigger physiques, and potentially bigger impacts as a result of contact, but amateurs may have arguably poorer technique and be putting themselves at risk because of that. ""The bigger question and what's really motivating this research is to then look into the future, to have a snapshot of what are the long-term consequences of this reoccurring contact,"" he said. ""We have every reason to believe that the damaging effects could be cumulative over time."" The university team are also working on a similar study, comparing current players and retired players against a control group to determine whether there is a faster rate of decline in brain function in rugby players. They say more research is needed on the long term effects of such a decline. According to the RFU, 20% of all concussions at a professional level occur in training. In American football's NFL in the United States, measures have been put into place to limit the amount of contact during training and between training sessions, something that has been called for by a number of former rugby players. However, others such as Williams say it is difficult to put a cap on contact in training as practising good technique also reduces injuries. Recently a group of former players called for replacements to only be used if players are injured, something Williams also believes could be of benefit, along with education. ""I do believe the game has changed when it comes to the 'finishers' [replacements],"" he said. ""You've got 21-stone players coming on to the field when players are tired and you get injured more when you're tired. ""But another main thing for me is educating the players so that they know when they do have these injuries."" The sport's governing body, World Rugby, says research is ongoing looking at the specific issue of replacements and injury. Players are given Head Injury Assessments to check for concussion In a statement responding to the University of South Wales research, the sport's governing body World Rugby said: ""World Rugby welcomes all research that can inform and support ourrecently launched strategy,externalto cement rugby as the most progressive sport on player welfare. ""It is at the heart of everything that we say and do as a sport. ""World Rugby recently committed to double our investment in player welfare and new concussion research and initiatives. ""We are currently undertaking a wide-ranging evaluation of contact training volume across the game and look forward to the results of the ongoing Otago Rugby Community Head Impact Detection study using instrumented mouthguards, which is the largest study of playing and training head impacts in men's and women's community rugby."" The body added that the Otago study is due for completion imminently.

"Maddie Durdant-Hollamby enjoyed dancing and worked in marketing, her family said Tributes have been paid to a ""kind, caring and thoughtful"" woman who was found dead at a house in Kettering. Maddie Durdant-Hollamby, 22, from Cambridgeshire, was discovered shortly after 13:00 BST on Friday. Northamptonshire Police was called to Slate Drive in the town where the body of Benjamin Green, 41, was also found. Ms Durdant-Hollamby's death is being treated as murder, no arrests have been made anddetectives said they were not looking for anyone else. Police confirmed Mr Green, whose family has paid tribute to ""an extremely loving father,"" lived at the house on Slate Drive. Det Insp Nicole Main said: ""While we await a formal identification of Benjamin, we have taken the step of naming him with the support of his family. ""We understand he and Maddie had been in a relationship, and are working to establish as much as is possible about the circumstances in which they died."" She said both families were ""overwhelmed with sadness and have asked that they be left in peace at this terribly distressing time"". Ms Durdant-Hollamby's body was found by police on Friday In a statement issued through police on Sunday, the family of Ms Durdant-Hollamby, from Wimblington near the town of March, said they were ""absolutely devastated at the loss of Maddie, our beautiful daughter, sister, granddaughter and niece"". ""Our hearts are broken and we cannot begin to imagine life without her. The shock and pain we are feeling is indescribable,"" they said. ""She was a beautiful person both inside and out, who loved nothing more than spending time with her family and friends. ""Maddie was a kind, caring, thoughtful young woman, who touched the lives of everyone she met. ""A talented dancer, her creative talent continued through school and into her career in marketing. Her life has been sadly cut short just as her career was blossoming. ""Our thoughts are with everybody who knew and loved Maddie as much as we did."" Police have appealed for those with information to come forward Police later released a statement from Mr Green's family on Tuesday. It said: ""Ben was an extremely loving father to three extraordinary young children and was a beloved partner to his ex-wife. He was also a loving son, brother, uncle, and nephew. ""There are no words to describe the extremely sad circumstance of this tragic incident and our thoughts and prayers are with Maddie's family, loved ones and friends. ""We would now respectfully request time to grieve in peace, and would ask members of the media to respect our wishes as we have no further comment to make at this devastating time."" Speaking when Ms Durdant-Hollamby's family issued its statement, Det Insp Main added: ""Maddie Durdant-Hollamby was a young woman with a bright future ahead of her, and we are making sure her family are fully supported as we work to answer their questions about how she came to lose her life. ""Our investigation has found no known background of domestic abuse in this case so far, but we continue to appeal to anyone with any information they believe to be relevant to our inquiries to contact us.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Wind gusts of up to 172mph and heavy rain pummelled Louisiana Louisiana residents may be in the dark for weeks as officials take stock of the damage from Hurricane Ida. Ida made landfall on Sunday with 150mph (240km/h) winds, the fifth strongest to ever hit the US mainland. About one million locals remain without power. ""It's going to be a difficult life for quite some time,"" said one local leader in the Greater New Orleans area. About 5,000 National Guard members have been deployed to aid search and rescue. In addition, more than 25,000 workers from around the country have mobilised to support power restoration in the state, according to CNN. At least one person is dead after a tree fell on their home in Ascension Parish, in Louisiana's Baton Rouge area. State and local officials have conceded that number is likely to grow as search and rescue efforts continue, but argued the city had largely ""held the line"". ""The systems we depended on to save lives and protect our city did just that and we are grateful, but there is so much more work to be done,"" said New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell on Monday. She urged residents who had already evacuated their homes to stay put and not return until power and communications have been restored. As the slow-moving Ida continues to move inland, it has weakened to a tropical storm - but the National Hurricane Centre warned that heavy rain could still bring flooding to parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Ida was previously deemed ""life-threatening"", drawing comparisons to Hurricane Katrina, a 2005 storm that had a path similar to Ida and killed 1,800 people. But it seemed that New Orleans' flood defences, strengthened in Katrina's aftermath, have done their job. Governor John Bel Edwards said the levee systems had ""performed magnificently"" and none have thus far been breached. ""But the damage is still catastrophic,"" he acknowledged on Monday. ""We are still in a life saving mode."" In pictures: Hurricane Ida lashes Gulf Coast President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in the state, releasing extra funds for rescue and recovery efforts. On Monday, he pledged that the federal government would ""stand with the people of the Gulf [Coast] for as long as it takes for you to recover"". Entergy, the largest power company in Louisiana, warned that it would take days - and likely weeks in the hardest hit areas - to restore electricity to the more than one million homes without power across the state. This video can not be played Watch Hurricane Ida blow the roof off a Louisiana hospital Ida gathered strength over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico during the weekend. More than 90% of oil production there has been shut down as a result of the storm. On Sunday, Ida made landfall south of New Orleans as a category four hurricane - meaning it would cause severe damage to buildings, trees and power lines.As it moves inland, Ida's winds have dropped to 95mph (153km/h),external, meaning it is now a category one storm. There are still fears of storm surges along the coast - which could be as high as 16ft (4.8m), potentially submerging parts of the low-lying coastline. By Nada Tawfik, BBC News In New Orleans, the sun is now shining. While that might sound lovely, sweltering conditions are less than ideal when residents and businesses lack power and water. With a lengthy wait to restore utilities many residents are now scrambling to make a post-storm evacuation. There has been significant property damage as well. Jazz icon Louis Armstrong's second home, a small brick structure, is now just a pile of bricks. Still, residents talk about how they got lucky after Hurricane Katrina's disastrous death toll. The picture changes once you head to low lying areas outside of New Orleans's hurricane protection system. The situation there is more desperate as people wait atop their roofs and inside their attics to be saved from the water. Some of the roads are impassable and unsafe due to downed power lines and flooding. Reaching the most vulnerable in these conditions will be challenging but resources are now pouring in. In Jefferson Parish, I met Clarence Sinceno, an older man who has lived in his home there for 50 years. He says Ida was the worst storm he's lived through. Throughout the night, he and his family kept moving to different parts of the house as leaks turned into holes. The intense winds tore off sections of his roof and the sheet rock and insulation completely collapsed. Covid-19 has also further complicated efforts to keep people safe. Louisiana hospitals are already under pressure from Covid-19, as the state has the third-highest rate of infections in the US. Normally, hospitals in the predicted path of the hurricane would be evacuated, but this time there are few beds available, even at facilities further inland. ""We don't have any place to bring those patients. Not in state, not out of state,"" Mr Edwards said. Ida came ashore on the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, a category three storm when it made landfall. This video can not be played Storm Ida to bring further heavy rain and strong winds Since then, billions of dollars have been spent on flood defences, known as levees. So far, the levees have held, though a flash flood warning is in place for New Orleans. High winds tore part of the roof off a hospital in the town of Cut Off, Louisiana, just inland from the Gulf of Mexico. The hospital said it had suffered ""significant damage"" but that its patients were safe. Hurricanes: A guide to the world's deadliest storms."" The impact of climate change on the frequency of storms is still unclear, but increased sea surface temperatures warm the air above, making more energy available to drive hurricanes.

"Nike's headquarters in Beaverton Oregon Staff at Nike's corporate headquarters in Oregon have been given a week off to support their mental health, ahead of the return to the office in September. From today until Friday, the US firm will ""power down"" to give employees a rest after a tough year. ""Take the time to unwind, destress and spend time with your loved ones,"" the firm's head of insights Matt Marrazzo said in a message to staff. It follows similar moves from dating app Bumble and Linkedin. A growing number of employees have reported feeling burnt out as the pandemic drags on and many continue to work from home. Big US firms such as Apple, Uber and bank Wells Fargo have also delayed plans for staff to return to the office as infections surge across the US. Making the announcementon Linkedin,externallast week, Mr Marrazzo told Nike staff: ""Do not work"" - adding that the past year had been ""rough"" and they were ""living through a traumatic event"". All Bumble staff given week off to de-stress Citigroup urges staff to go Zoom-free on Fridays ""In a year (or two) unlike any other, taking time for rest and recovery is key to performing well and staying sane. ""It's not just a 'week off' for the team... it's an acknowledgment that we can prioritize mental health and still get work done."" According to reports, it also reflects the fact Nike has had a successful year, with sales up and its stock gaining 20%. Bumble, the dating app where women are in charge of making the first move, told its 700 staff worldwide to switch off and focus on themselves back in June. One senior executive revealed on Twitter that founder Whitney Wolfe Herd had made the move ""having correctly intuited our collective burnout"".

"More than 15,000 people have been evacuated to the UK from Kabul since 14 August An Afghan who had authorisation to fly to the UK, but was unable to make his flight because of crowds at Kabul airport, has pleaded with the British government to help him before it's too late. The UK ended its evacuations at the weekend, but many families who were eligible for evacuation have been left behind. He shared his story with the BBC. We are withholding his identity to protect his safety. I'm currently in hell right now. In the past two weeks I've moved to 15 safe houses with my family because the Taliban are trying to find me. Nowadays when there's a knock on the door, it's the first thing that enters my mind. My heart stops beating because I think ""Is this the Taliban? Have they found me and my family?"" It's not just me, it's hundreds of people who've worked for the government, the media, NGOs, human rights defenders - everyone is currently hiding in different places waiting to see when their turn will come. I am one of those they're looking to detain and to kill. Thousands of people gathered to Kabul airport during Western evacuations The situation is really bad for us. I had authorisation to travel to the UK. When I tried to get to Kabul airport there were four to five thousand people at each and every gate, and we couldn't get ourselves in. I waited there for almost 36 hours. I crossed 11 checkpoints under a burqa, but in the end the Taliban didn't let us past. There were 15 or 16 families there too who were stuck that day. Some were even British passport holders. Now they're also moving from house to house, hoping they can find a way to leave the country. I was close to the airport the night the explosion happened. I was near the gate. My young children were so afraid, they are still panicking in their sleep. I don't know what my options are now. Many borders are closed. I'm trying to send emails asking for help. I'm trying to figure out how I can safely move my family to a secure place. The UK government needs to uphold its promises and keep those who have worked for them a priority. These are people who have given sacrifices for them. Please help us find a way out. If I can't get out in the next few days, I am fearful I'll die. The Taliban have been patrolling Kabul airport and controlling the flow of Afghans trying to fly out I'm not as worried about my own life, I'm worried about my family. I have young children who have seen nothing of this world. Why should they be punished for my sins? the Taliban sees my work as a sin, anyway. We don't have much time, maybe three to four days maximum. My message to the UK government is this: ""We are fighting to stay alive. It's not a matter of hours, not a matter of days - it's a matter of seconds."" A spokesperson for the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office told the BBC more than 15,000 people including British nationals, Afghan staff and others at risk had been evacuated from Afghanistan by the UK since 15 August ""in one of the biggest operations of its kind in history"". ""We will continue to do all we can to deliver on our obligation to get British nationals and eligible Afghans out of the country,"" the spokesman added. On Sunday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab took part in a virtual meeting with members of the G7, Nato, and Turkey and Qatar. He urged his counterparts to work together to give eligible Afghan refugees safe passage. He also stressed the need to protect human rights ""and the gains of the last 20 years"".

"Patrick Harvie (left) and Lorna Slater (right) are joining the government of Nicola Sturgeon (centre) The co-leaders of the Scottish Greens have been given junior ministerial roles in Nicola Sturgeon's government under the SNP-Green power-sharing deal. Patrick Harvie will focus on zero carbon buildings and active travel, while Lorna Slater will be minister for green skills and the circular economy. The first minister said it was right to ""put politics aside to tackle the challenges in front of us decisively"". The appointments will be formally approved by a vote of MSPs on Tuesday. The Conservatives have said they will vote against the move, calling it a ""nationalist gamble"", but the SNP and Greens have a comfortable majority between them in the Holyrood chamber. Who are the new Scottish Green ministers? The deal is done - so what lies ahead? Scottish Greens back historic government deal The two parties have signed off on a power-sharing deal which falls short of a full coalition, but sees Green politicians enter government for the first time anywhere in the UK. The pact between the two pro-independence parties will see Green MSPs back the SNP administration in any confidence votes in parliament, as well as ensuring its budgets pass. They will work together on a range of issues - including climate change, public transport, housebuilding and rent controls. However, the deal allows them to disagree on some other topics, including aviation policy, field sports and the future of fee-paying schools. The appointments of Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater will be approved by MSPs on Tuesday Ms Sturgeon said there had been ""compromise on both sides"" in the talks which led to the agreement, and that the parties had managed to ""find common ground and agree on areas where we can work together to build a better country"". And she said the two new Green ministers would ""contribute greatly to defining Scotland's path forward"" - with the parties aiming to deliver an independence referendum during the current parliamentary term. Mr Harvie - whose full title will be minister for zero carbon buildings, active travel and tenants' rights - said he was ""thrilled at the opportunity to drive forward policies that enhance peoples' lives while supporting the urgent goal of tackling the climate emergency as we emerge from the pandemic"". And Ms Slater - the minister for green skills, circular economy and biodiversity - said her focus would be on delivering a ""just transition"" to a carbon-neutral economy, saying this must support the workforce as well as benefiting the natural environment. The junior ministerial posts will allow the Green co-leaders to attend meetings of Ms Sturgeon's cabinet on occasions when their portfolios are being discussed. And each will serve on a cabinet sub-committee - Ms Slater on one focused on the climate emergency, and Mr Harvie on one looking at legislation. The appointments will be put forward to the Queen for confirmation after they are approved by MSPs in a vote at Holyrood. The Scottish Conservatives have opposed the SNP-Green deal as a ""coalition of chaos"", with MSP Murdo Fraser describing it as ""economic vandalism"". He said: ""Nicola Sturgeon is taking a nationalist gamble with people's jobs - she is bringing in radicals, all in the hopes of ramping up her push for another divisive referendum.""

"Online gamers under the age of 18 will only be allowed to play for an hour on Fridays, weekends and holidays, China's video game regulator has said. The National Press and Publication Administration told state-run news agency Xinhua that game-playing would be only allowed between 8pm to 9pm. It also instructed gaming companies to prevent children playing outside these times. Earlier this month a state media outlet branded online games ""spiritual opium"". Inspections of online gaming companies will also increase, to check that the time limits are being enforced the regulator said. Earlier rules had limited children's online game-playing to 90 minutes per day, rising to three hours on holidays. The move reflects a long running concern about the impact of excessive gaming on the young. A month prior to the latest restrictions, an article published by the state-run Economic Information Daily claimed many teenagers had become addicted to online gaming and it was having a negative impact on them. The article prompted significant falls in the value of shares in some of China's biggest online gaming firms. In July, Chinese gaming giant Tencent announced it was rolling out facial recognition to stop children playing between 22:00 and 08:00. The move followed fears that children were using adult ID's to circumvent rules. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News It's probably a disappointing end of summer for China's tens of millions of young gamers. The Chinese authorities have long been concerned about gaming addiction and other harmful online activities among youth. Beijing appears to show a growing scepticism over the expansion of capital and technology, as well as its potentially adverse impact on the well-being of the country's young generation. The new rule came amid a sweeping crackdown on China's tech giants, such as Alibaba, Didi and Tencent, as well as a series of reforms over activities considered by Beijing as harmful to the young generation, including celebrity fan culture and private tutoring. By imposing these new rules, the Chinese government is hoping to create ""positive energy"" among young people and to educate them with what Beijing considers ""correct values"". While many Chinese parents may applaud the gaming restriction, some on China's social media Weibo criticise the government interference as being ""unreasonable"" and ""arbitrary"". ""Why don't you plan when I go to the toilet, eat meals and go to bed,"" one sarcastic comment read.

"This video can not be played Watch: Wind gusts of up to 172mph and heavy rain pummelled Louisiana Louisiana residents may be in the dark for weeks as officials take stock of the damage from Hurricane Ida. Ida made landfall on Sunday with 150mph (240km/h) winds, the fifth strongest to ever hit the US mainland. About one million locals remain without power. ""It's going to be a difficult life for quite some time,"" said one local leader in the Greater New Orleans area. About 5,000 National Guard members have been deployed to aid search and rescue. In addition, more than 25,000 workers from around the country have mobilised to support power restoration in the state, according to CNN. At least one person is dead after a tree fell on their home in Ascension Parish, in Louisiana's Baton Rouge area. State and local officials have conceded that number is likely to grow as search and rescue efforts continue, but argued the city had largely ""held the line"". ""The systems we depended on to save lives and protect our city did just that and we are grateful, but there is so much more work to be done,"" said New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell on Monday. She urged residents who had already evacuated their homes to stay put and not return until power and communications have been restored. As the slow-moving Ida continues to move inland, it has weakened to a tropical storm - but the National Hurricane Centre warned that heavy rain could still bring flooding to parts of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Ida was previously deemed ""life-threatening"", drawing comparisons to Hurricane Katrina, a 2005 storm that had a path similar to Ida and killed 1,800 people. But it seemed that New Orleans' flood defences, strengthened in Katrina's aftermath, have done their job. Governor John Bel Edwards said the levee systems had ""performed magnificently"" and none have thus far been breached. ""But the damage is still catastrophic,"" he acknowledged on Monday. ""We are still in a life saving mode."" In pictures: Hurricane Ida lashes Gulf Coast President Joe Biden has declared a major disaster in the state, releasing extra funds for rescue and recovery efforts. On Monday, he pledged that the federal government would ""stand with the people of the Gulf [Coast] for as long as it takes for you to recover"". Entergy, the largest power company in Louisiana, warned that it would take days - and likely weeks in the hardest hit areas - to restore electricity to the more than one million homes without power across the state. This video can not be played Watch Hurricane Ida blow the roof off a Louisiana hospital Ida gathered strength over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico during the weekend. More than 90% of oil production there has been shut down as a result of the storm. On Sunday, Ida made landfall south of New Orleans as a category four hurricane - meaning it would cause severe damage to buildings, trees and power lines.As it moves inland, Ida's winds have dropped to 95mph (153km/h),external, meaning it is now a category one storm. There are still fears of storm surges along the coast - which could be as high as 16ft (4.8m), potentially submerging parts of the low-lying coastline. By Nada Tawfik, BBC News In New Orleans, the sun is now shining. While that might sound lovely, sweltering conditions are less than ideal when residents and businesses lack power and water. With a lengthy wait to restore utilities many residents are now scrambling to make a post-storm evacuation. There has been significant property damage as well. Jazz icon Louis Armstrong's second home, a small brick structure, is now just a pile of bricks. Still, residents talk about how they got lucky after Hurricane Katrina's disastrous death toll. The picture changes once you head to low lying areas outside of New Orleans's hurricane protection system. The situation there is more desperate as people wait atop their roofs and inside their attics to be saved from the water. Some of the roads are impassable and unsafe due to downed power lines and flooding. Reaching the most vulnerable in these conditions will be challenging but resources are now pouring in. In Jefferson Parish, I met Clarence Sinceno, an older man who has lived in his home there for 50 years. He says Ida was the worst storm he's lived through. Throughout the night, he and his family kept moving to different parts of the house as leaks turned into holes. The intense winds tore off sections of his roof and the sheet rock and insulation completely collapsed. Covid-19 has also further complicated efforts to keep people safe.

"Online gamers under the age of 18 will only be allowed to play for an hour on Fridays, weekends and holidays, China's video game regulator has said. The National Press and Publication Administration told state-run news agency Xinhua that game-playing would be only allowed between 8pm to 9pm. It also instructed gaming companies to prevent children playing outside these times. Earlier this month a state media outlet branded online games ""spiritual opium"". Inspections of online gaming companies will also increase, to check that the time limits are being enforced the regulator said. Earlier rules had limited children's online game-playing to 90 minutes per day, rising to three hours on holidays. The move reflects a long running concern about the impact of excessive gaming on the young. A month prior to the latest restrictions, an article published by the state-run Economic Information Daily claimed many teenagers had become addicted to online gaming and it was having a negative impact on them. The article prompted significant falls in the value of shares in some of China's biggest online gaming firms. In July, Chinese gaming giant Tencent announced it was rolling out facial recognition to stop children playing between 22:00 and 08:00. The move followed fears that children were using adult ID's to circumvent rules. Zhaoyin Feng, BBC News It's probably a disappointing end of summer for China's tens of millions of young gamers. The Chinese authorities have long been concerned about gaming addiction and other harmful online activities among youth. Beijing appears to show a growing scepticism over the expansion of capital and technology, as well as its potentially adverse impact on the well-being of the country's young generation. The new rule came amid a sweeping crackdown on China's tech giants, such as Alibaba, Didi and Tencent, as well as a series of reforms over activities considered by Beijing as harmful to the young generation, including celebrity fan culture and private tutoring. By imposing these new rules, the Chinese government is hoping to create ""positive energy"" among young people and to educate them with what Beijing considers ""correct values"". While many Chinese parents may applaud the gaming restriction, some on China's social media Weibo criticise the government interference as being ""unreasonable"" and ""arbitrary"". ""Why don't you plan when I go to the toilet, eat meals and go to bed,"" one sarcastic comment read.

Peacock, a gold medallist in London and Rio, shared the bronze medal with Germany's Johannes Floors after a photo finish judged them to have both clocked 10.786 seconds. They had to wait more than three minutes for a decision to be made. ""I didn't think you could share medals in sprints,"" said Peacock, 28. ""I think there's two ways to take it and being positive, 15-year-old Jonnie would have been so happy with this. ""If that's not an advert for Paralympic sport in 11 seconds I don't know what is. ""I expect it to keep going that way. I think the world record is going to be broken very, very soon."" Germany's Felix Streng won gold in a time of 10.76, while Sherman Isidro Guity Guity took silver-Costa Rica's first Paralympic medal - in a 10.78 personal best.

"Perry is known for his pioneering work in dub Tributes have been paid to the legendary Jamaican singer and music producer Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, who has died at the age of 85. He died in hospital in Lucea, north-west Jamaica, local media reported. Perry is known for his pioneering experiments in dub, which revolutionised not only reggae, but also hip hop, dance and other genres. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called him ""unforgettable"" and praised his ""sterling contribution"" to music. The Beastie Boys, who first worked with Perry when he opened for them in Japan in 1996 before they joined forces on the track Dr Lee PhD as party of 1998's Hello Nasty album, hailed the musician's ""pioneering spirit"". ""We are truly grateful to have been inspired by and collaborated with this true legend,""the group said in a tweet,external. Flying Lotus, whose real name is Steven Ellison,wrote on Twitter,external: ""Blessed journey into the infinite. RIP Lee 'Scratch' Perry."" Rapper Lupe Fiasco also remembered Perry,tweeting,external: ""African blood is flowing through I veins so I and I shall never fade away."" Glastonbury Festival's Emily Eavis hailed the singer as a ""musical genius"". Eavis tweeted,external: ""RIP the almighty Lee 'Scratch' Perry, musical genius, free spirit and a regular Glastonbury performer. We shall miss him."" Perry was born in rural Jamaica in 1936 and moved to the capital Kingston in the early 1960s. In a 1984 interview with NME magazine, he said: ""My father worked on the road, my mother in the fields. We were very poor. I went to schoolâ¦ I learned nothing at all. Everything I have learned has come from nature."" He started his music career in the 1950s as an assistant at a reggae music label, before moving up to become a recording artist with the same label. Over the next seven decades Perry went on to work with a number of fellow music legends, including Bob Marley and the Beastie Boys. Perry, pictured in 1984, said everything he learned had ""come from nature"" He also won a Grammy in 2002, was nominated four other times - in 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2014 - and received a Jamaican national honour, the Order of Distinction. In a 2010 interview with Rolling Stone, Keith Richards described Perry as ""the Salvador Dali of music"". ""He's a mystery. The world is his instrument. You just have to listen,"" Richards said. ""More than a producer, he knows how to inspire the artist's soul."" Electronic group The Prodigy shared a photo of Perry on Twitter showing him at a mixing desk. Allow Twitter content?

If Bob Marley was the face and voice of reggae, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry was its soul. He was a towering figure despite his diminutive stature and eccentric appearance, but his influence was much deeper than most reggae fans realise. Much like Nile Rodgers, he was the producer and brains behind many songs more famously sung by other people. And it was his spirit that converted Marley's band - The Wailers - from a rocksteady and ska trio to a much more bass-fuelled, political and spiritual group, a process later accelerated by Chris Blackwell. Shamanistic and reliably stoned, ""Scratch"" nevertheless had a remarkable work ethic. He fell out with many of his collaborators, including the great Studio One boss Coxsone Dodd, and indeed The Wailers, though he and Marley would later reconcile. But by coming to the height of his powers in late 1960s and 1970s Jamaica, he was a charismatic engineer and catalyst for the group of artists who produced much of the best music of the 20th Century.

"The devolved governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have called on the UK government to rethink plans to end the universal credit uplift. Chancellor Rishi Sunak plans to stop the extra Â£20-a-week payment in October - saying it is only temporary measure to help people through the pandemic. But there are growing calls for it to be extended or made permanent. Ministers from Holyrood, Cardiff and Stormont have raised concerns about the impact the cut will have on poverty. They wrote a joint letter to Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey, describing the change as the ""biggest overnight reduction to a basic rate of social security since the modern welfare state began, more than 70 years ago"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last week he wanted the focus to be on better paid jobs, rather than welfare. He was speaking after two Tory MPs joined calls for the uplift to be made permanent. Why are my universal credit payments being reduced? Â£20 universal credit top-up always temporary - Sunak Benefits cut: 'Â£20 is a lifeline, don't take it away' The letter is signed by Scotland's Social Justice Secretary Shona Robison, Welsh Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt and Northern Ireland Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey. They said they were writing to express the ""grave concerns of all three devolved administrations"". The trio added that people would lose more than Â£1,000 a year ""at time when they need financial support the most"", adding that the impact would be heightened by the ""premature end"" ofthe furlough scheme,along withenergy prices rising for millions of people from October. ""We are concerned about the potential impact that reducing universal credit will have on child poverty, poverty levels and the financial health and wellbeing of people. ""We urge the UK government to reverse the decision without delay in order to avoid causing further anxiety."" Universal credit, which is claimed by more than 5.5 million households in the UK, was introduced to replace six benefits and merge them into one benefit payment for working-age people. The Â£20 top-up was extended by six months in March but MPs across the political spectrum, along with charities and campaigners, have called for it to continue beyond the autumn. Last month, the chairs of the four welfare committees from the UK's four parliaments alsowrote a letter calling for the top-up to be made permanent. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation - a charity that researches poverty - has warned that millions of households will face an income loss equivalent to Â£1,040 a year. Extending the uplift would cost around Â£6bn a year - but the government says spending has to be brought under control after unprecedented emergency interventions during the pandemic. A Department for Work and Pensions spokeswoman said the temporary uplift was designed to help claimants through the ""toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so"". She added: ""It's right that we now focus on our Plan for Jobs, helping claimants to increase their earnings by boosting their skills and getting into work, progressing in work or increasing their hours.""

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces.

Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction.

A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"".

People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves.""

Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare.

We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families.""

As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments.

"Perry is known for his pioneering work in dub Tributes have been paid to the legendary Jamaican singer and music producer Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, who has died at the age of 85. He died in hospital in Lucea, north-west Jamaica, local media reported. Perry is known for his pioneering experiments in dub, which revolutionised not only reggae, but also hip hop, dance and other genres. Jamaican Prime Minister Andrew Holness called him ""unforgettable"" and praised his ""sterling contribution"" to music. The Beastie Boys, who first worked with Perry when he opened for them in Japan in 1996 before they joined forces on the track Dr Lee PhD as party of 1998's Hello Nasty album, hailed the musician's ""pioneering spirit"". ""We are truly grateful to have been inspired by and collaborated with this true legend,""the group said in a tweet,external. Flying Lotus, whose real name is Steven Ellison,wrote on Twitter,external: ""Blessed journey into the infinite. RIP Lee 'Scratch' Perry."" Rapper Lupe Fiasco also remembered Perry,tweeting,external: ""African blood is flowing through I veins so I and I shall never fade away."" Glastonbury Festival's Emily Eavis hailed the singer as a ""musical genius"". Eavis tweeted,external: ""RIP the almighty Lee 'Scratch' Perry, musical genius, free spirit and a regular Glastonbury performer. We shall miss him."" Perry was born in rural Jamaica in 1936 and moved to the capital Kingston in the early 1960s. In a 1984 interview with NME magazine, he said: ""My father worked on the road, my mother in the fields. We were very poor. I went to schoolâ¦ I learned nothing at all. Everything I have learned has come from nature."" He started his music career in the 1950s as an assistant at a reggae music label, before moving up to become a recording artist with the same label. Over the next seven decades Perry went on to work with a number of fellow music legends, including Bob Marley and the Beastie Boys. Perry, pictured in 1984, said everything he learned had ""come from nature"" He also won a Grammy in 2002, was nominated four other times - in 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2014 - and received a Jamaican national honour, the Order of Distinction. In a 2010 interview with Rolling Stone, Keith Richards described Perry as ""the Salvador Dali of music"". ""He's a mystery. The world is his instrument. You just have to listen,"" Richards said. ""More than a producer, he knows how to inspire the artist's soul."" Electronic group The Prodigy shared a photo of Perry on Twitter showing him at a mixing desk. Allow Twitter content?

If Bob Marley was the face and voice of reggae, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry was its soul. He was a towering figure despite his diminutive stature and eccentric appearance, but his influence was much deeper than most reggae fans realise. Much like Nile Rodgers, he was the producer and brains behind many songs more famously sung by other people. And it was his spirit that converted Marley's band - The Wailers - from a rocksteady and ska trio to a much more bass-fuelled, political and spiritual group, a process later accelerated by Chris Blackwell. Shamanistic and reliably stoned, ""Scratch"" nevertheless had a remarkable work ethic. He fell out with many of his collaborators, including the great Studio One boss Coxsone Dodd, and indeed The Wailers, though he and Marley would later reconcile. But by coming to the height of his powers in late 1960s and 1970s Jamaica, he was a charismatic engineer and catalyst for the group of artists who produced much of the best music of the 20th Century.
