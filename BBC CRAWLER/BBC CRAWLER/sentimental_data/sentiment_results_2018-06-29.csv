"The jury failed to reach a verdict in the trial of Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, 27, from Luton A jury has been dismissed in the trial of an Uber driver accused of planning a sword attack at Buckingham Palace, after it failed to reach a verdict. Mohiussunnath Chowdhury, 27, from Luton, denies preparing acts of terrorism, claiming he only wanted himself to get killed. Mr Chowdhury drove to the palace on 25 August last year with a samurai sword, the Old Bailey previously heard. The jury were discharged on Friday after nearly 19 hours of deliberations. The prosecutor, Tim Cray, said he would seek a retrial. The trial previously heard that two police officers suffered cuts to their hands as they tried to disarm and arrest Mr Chowdhury outside the royal palace. Mr Chowdhury, of Kirkwood Road, told the Old Bailey that he was upset at the role of the UK government in arming Saudi Arabia and the deaths of innocent people in Yemen. The jury retired to consider their verdict on Tuesday. On Thursday, the judge told them a majority verdict would be acceptable, but on Friday  discharged them after they failed to reach a decision.

"There could be a shortage of lettuce in UK supermarkets as soon as the middle of next week, growers have warned. The unusually high temperatures have boosted demand for leafy salads at the same time as the heat has stopped the UK crop growing. Growers say they may have to import leaves from the US to make up the shortfall at a time when more than 90% of salad leaves is usually UK grown. Broccoli and cauliflower crops have also been affected by the weather. Trade body the British Leafy Salad Growers Association (BLSGA) said the ""soaring"" temperatures were causing ""havoc"" for growers. It said the last week a record 18 million lettuces had been sold, about 40% more than last year. However, it added ""when the mercury hits 30C lettuces can't grow"". BLSGA spokesman Dieter Lloyd said it ""looks entirely likely that there will be shortages"" from the ""middle to end of next week"". And one lettuce grower in East Anglia, who did not want to be named, told the BBC this summer had been ""very challenging"". Normally in good weather the crop grows rapidly, he said. But at the current temperatures the crop effectively stops growing because its ""under stress"". ""I think that if the weather keeps going the way that it's going absolutely we wouldn't be in a position to fulfil the demand that we're seeing with UK-grown produce,"" he added. At this time of peak demand more than 90% of UK leafy salads are usually grown in the UK. The grower had already looked to Germany to try to find alternative supplies, but with similar weather conditions there, farmers there did not have enough spare. ""If this goes on for another five days I wouldn't be surprised if we had to look to the US."" And it is not just lettuce that is affected, he added. Both broccoli and cauliflower crops have been hit by the weather as well. How to cope with the vegetable shortage Why is there a vegetable shortage?

"A new dawn for Port Talbot's steelworks? Port Talbot's steelworks will be owned by Europe's second largest steel firm after metals giant ThyssenKrupp agreed to merge with Tata. Talks, which came after Tata changed its mind about selling up altogether, had been ongoing for more than a year. The deal includes an ambition to avoid compulsory redundancies until 2026. Plans to investin extending the life of Port Talbot's Blast Furnace 5 will also go ahead this year. One union boss says the venture has the potential to safeguards jobs and steelmaking for a generation. Thyssenkrupp boss Heinrich Hiesingersaid,externalthe deal ""will help secure jobs and value chains in European core industries"". Steel firm Thyssenkrupp backs Tata merger Tata 'to invest Â£75m in blast furnace' What's behind the Tata-Thyssenkrupp merger? The agreement means Tata UK plants are merged into a pan-European venture with annual sales of about Â£13bn. It marks another change of ownership for Britain's steel industry, which once led the world, but has shrunk rapidly in the face of cheaper international competition. Steel worker takes a steel sample at a blast furnace run by ThyssenKrupp in Duisburg, Germany Most of the industry was nationalised after World War Two, then re-privatised in 1988 as the British Steel Corporation. It became Corus after a merger with a Dutch rival, Koninklijke Hoogovens, in 1999, and was bought by India's Tata Steel in 2006. However, in 2016 Tata announced it wanted to sell off its entire British operations - before optioning for a merger deal. Almost 7,000 people are employed by Tata in Wales, including at Deeside and more than 4,000 in Port Talbot - which is the largest steelworks in the UK. The uncertainty continues for the 350 Tata workers at itsCogent facility in Newport, which remains up for sale. This video can not be played First Minister Carwyn Jones and Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns give their reaction to the deal It was only last month that the unions at Tata warned they were still ""unconvinced"" about the company's merger with Thyssenkrupp. So what changed their minds? In short they came up with a list of demands and Tata has met many of them. The repair of Blast Furnace Number Five at Port Talbot has long been called for by the unions as a sign of Tata's commitment to the UK's biggest steelworks. That repair could make it operational until 2026 and beyond, which might give workers some security after years of turbulence and uncertainty. The commitment to avoid compulsory redundancies and to invest in the business has clearly been enough to get the unions on board. Tata, Thyssenkrupp and the unions all accept that the merger will mean a company that's in better shape to prosper in a world that's producing far more steel than it needs every year. Steel has been made on the site of the plant in Port Talbot since 1901 Roy Rickhuss, General Secretary of Community, the steelworkers' union, said: ""With a commitment to avoid compulsory redundancies until October 2026, and the first Â£200m of any operating profit being invested back in the business, this joint venture has the potential to safeguards jobs and steelmaking for a generation."" Tony Brady, national officer for Unite union, said: ""The UK plants desperately require a level playing field through investment and commitment to the long term future of steel making at Port Talbot."" Tata Steel UK's pensions deal approved Tata demands 'swift action' on US tariffs GMB national officer Ross Murdoch added: ""We will continue to ensure jobs and investment remain the key underpinning priorities within any final joint venture, which must equate to opportunities for our members in the UK, particularly after the difficult and uncertain recent times they have faced."" The two steel companies had previously warned 4,000 jobs could go. The new company will be called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel and be based in the Netherlands. What the steel plants around Wales do Economy Secretary Ken Skates said the Welsh Government ""broadly welcomed"" the merger and the ""enhanced commitments to jobs until 2026"". But he added there was ""still a long way to go to give our steel industry a sustainable future"". Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""This announcement is a significant and welcome moment for the UK steel industry."" Aberavon MP Stephen Kinnock said: ""For this joint venture to really succeed and to guarantee the longer term future of the plant, and the UK steel industry, sustained investment in the plant is needed over and above the currently committed work on Blast Furnace 5.""

"Campaigners hope these five photographs of England fans will begin to replace the sexualised images of female fans that online searches offer Put ""female football fan"" into a search engine and the image results are a stream of attractive young women in tight shirts and, sometimes, no shirts. Tired of sexualisation and misrepresentation, some fans have decided it's time to level the playing field. ""These images represent everything that's great about this game - how many different kinds of women go to matches and support. We need this realness,"" says Emma Townley, from online community This Fan Girl. She's talking about five images of female England fans taken ahead of this World Cup, which she hopes will start replacing photos of scantily-clad female fans in search engine results. The pictures show the different ages, races and shapes of the women supporting football and the idea is the more they are shared online and used by media outlets, the higher up the search results they will go. Their aim, to ""change the face of female football fans on the internet"". World Cup 2018: Is football still sexist? Women finally allowed in Iranian football stadium Alongside their day jobs, the team behind This Fan Girl have spent the last two years documenting women who support football byphotographing fans at matchesacross the country. The#WeAreFemaleFans,externalcampaign is all about inclusivity and desexualising women in football, Emma says. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

An online image search of ""female rugby fan"", for example, does not feature any sexualised images of women in the top results. Fleur Cousens, 25, the founder of Goal Diggers - a football club for women and non-binary people in north London - says this has a damaging impact on all levels of the game. ""Women are sexualised from grass roots teams to fans. It's so sad. Even just now at training there was a guy that walked past and whistled at us and made comments,"" she says. Emma Townley (front right) wants more ""realness"" when it comes to the depiction of female fans in the media Fleur argues sexualised images undermine women who are already having to prove themselves in an arena still considered ""a man's space"". ""If you play on a mixed team, you basically have to get on the pitch, do a scissor kick and score a goal with your eyes shut before you're taken seriously and that's basically what's happening with the World Cup. ""As a fan, you're often tested by men, you get put on the spot and they want to catch you out because they don't believe it, they smell a rat."" If anyone was in doubt of the attitudes and images fans are up against, this week Getty - one of the world's largest picture agencies - published a photo gallery of ""the hottest fans at the World Cup"". Getty later removed it, adding that it did not meet its editorial standards. But for Emma and many others, this was an all too familiar slip-up which shows how much more progress is needed. ""My initial thoughts were 'do I laugh or cry?',"" Emma says. ""I was fuming. It was blatant misogyny. We've got to stop perpetuating the idea this is ok."" It's not just about appearances, Emma adds, but re-establishing the balance for the next generation of fans and players. ""Teenagers watching this World Cup are seeing the likes of (commentators and pundits) Alex Scott, Vicki Sparks and Eni Aluko. ""There have been some real high points - but some absolute clangers too. We can't sit back just yet."" About those ""clangers""... French footballer Patrice Evra was criticised for patronising behaviour for clapping fellow pundit Eni Aluko's analysis of the Costa Rican team as part of ITV's World Cup coverage. He said he was ""really impressed"" by Aluko - who has 102 caps for England and has recently signed for Juventus - and turned to pundit Henrik Larsson to say ""she knows more about football than us"" On the BBC, Phil Neville - the England Women's coach - was accused of mansplaining to pundit Alex Scott, repeating a point she had made seconds before Meanwhile Vicki Sparks - who became thefirst woman to commentate liveon a televised World Cup match in the UK - was criticised for her ""high-pitched tone"" by Jason Cundy. The ex-Chelsea player apologised for his remarks, adding  there was ""no place for these demeaning attitudes"" For Fleur, the divide between male football fans and female football fans remains. ""Until we're just fans, it's never going to be what it should be and we're always going to have to spend that extra bit of energy to prove that we're a footballer, to do that scissor kick, to answer all the questions about every formation that's ever been at Man United if you're a Man U fan and to sit there like Scott and Aluko and prove that you have the knowledge."" This was a sentiment echoed by Chelsea fan, Anna Cooke, who works for energy drinks company Carabao - the football sponsor which has backed This Fan Girl's campaign. ""We want these women to be seen as proper football fans instead of being objectified,"" she says. World Cup reporter fury at on-camera kiss Russian media call women football fans 'husband-hunters' And recognition is what is at the core of this debate. ""You'll have a woman who's been a season ticket holder for 30 years,"" Emma says. ""To have her photograph taken at a match and published, for her to be recognised as a fan, is so empowering for her."" Emma is optimistic about the future - more so than the success of the England team - which she predicts will get no further than the final 16. Is this World Cup still sexist?

The European Council president said the ""most difficult"" issues were unresolved and ""quick progress"" was needed if agreement was to be reached by October. Talks continue over the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU in March next year. What happens to the Irish border remains a sticking point. The UK says both sides want to see a ""faster pace"" in talks.

She added that the UK would publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail [the] strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"".

"Tata owns the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot Unions have welcomed a merger between Tata Steel and Thyssenkrupp which will create Europe's second-biggest steelmaker. The deal will mean Indian-owned Tata's UK plants are merged into a pan-European venture, which includes the UK's biggest steelworks at Port Talbot. Tata said its ""ambition"" was to not have any compulsory redundancies in the UK as part of the joint venture. The steelworkers' union said the deal may secure jobs and lead to investment. Community general secretary Roy Rickhuss said it had ""the potential to safeguard jobs and steel-making for a generation"". But he also warned the venture would only succeed if there was strategic investment to make sure the business thrived. Merger means investment in Port Talbot blast furnace What's behind the Tata-Thyssenkrupp merger? Tata Steel UK's pensions deal approved German-owned Thyssenkrupp's supervisory board gave the go-ahead to the merger on Friday - the two companies have been in negotiations for more than a year. Between them, they employ about 48,000 workers. The merged group anticipates it will make costs savings of between Â£350m to Â£440m a year. When details of an initial agreement emerged last September, both sides said they expected about 4,000 jobs would go as a result of the merger, half from administration and half from production. In Wales, almost 7,000 people are employed by Tata, including at Deeside and more than 4,000 in Port Talbot. Tata: Turbulent year for UK steel industry Tata had announced in 2016 that it wanted to sell off its entire UK operations - before scrapping plans and optioning for a merger deal. Joe Lynam, BBC business correspondent This merger is a safeguard measure. It protects jobs rather than creates them. And it establishes a pan-European company - better able to face the rigors of world markets. No threat is more immediate than that of a growing tariff war initiated by President Donald Trump. His 25% tariff on all steel being sold in the US has created fears that steel from China, or elsewhere, might be diverted to Europe and sold below what is charged in its home market - a practice known as dumping. And then there's Brexit. When asked what impact that could have on the new Anglo-German firm, Tata Steel UK chief executive Bimlendra Jha said he needed to be able to easily move his products and people across borders. When asked what it would mean if the UK could not secure that outcome, he said that would be ""a sorry state of affairs"". Preserving 7,000 steel jobs in Wales was always going to be the goal, but political events on both sides of the Atlantic may dilute some of the benefits of this merger. While welcoming the deal, unions also wanted an end to uncertainty for workers. Unite union national officer Tony Brady said workers had ""made great sacrifices in working to secure a future for Tata Steel"". ""We will be seeking guarantees over jobs and investment for the UK operations of the joint venture to secure the future of UK steel,"" he added. Ross Murdoch, national officer of the GMB, echoed his comments. Thyssenkrupp chief executive Heinrich Hiesinger has previously said the two companies needed to consolidate and become more efficient because of increasing pressure from imports and an overcapacity within the industry. More recently, European steel makers have faced 25% tariffs on exports to their biggest market, the US. ""The joint venture with Tata Steel is an important milestone for the transformation of Thyssenkrupp to an industrials and service group and will lead to a significant improvement of the financial figures of Thyssenkrupp,""the group said in a statement.,external It added that the ""signing of the definitive agreement is expected shortly"" and that the deal would be subject to clearance in several jurisdictions, including the European Union. Natarajan Chandrasekaran, chairman of Tata Steel, said: ""This is a significant milestone for Tata Steel and we remain fully committed to the long-term interest of the joint venture company. ""We are confident that this company will create value for all stakeholders."" The venture will create the second biggest steel firm in Europe after Arcelor Mittal. The new company, called Thyssenkrupp Tata Steel, would have annual sales of about Â£13bn and be based in the Netherlands.

It's there that the prime minister hopes to find resolution in her team on a more detailed offer to the rest of the EU - easing, if not removing, all the contradictions in the Tories' positions. Any pretence that the cabinet agrees is long gone. The government's promised publication of their choices within days, which if comprehensive and detailed as promised, will mark a big step forward, and in theory allow progress towards a final deal. But if the eventual Brexit white paper is flimsy - still a list of tentative options - patience in Brussels may finally run out. Sources suggest that if there is no clarity from the UK next week, all that will be available to Britain is a simple free trade deal. For many months, Theresa May has held the ring while inside her party brawls over Brexit have raged. If she can't end the fight, by picking a winning side or forcing a persuasive compromise, the EU may call time. In the next seven days the prime minister has hurdles she must clear to secure her future.

"Tata owns the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are close to agreeing terms on a merger that will create Europe's second-biggest steelmaker, after Arcelor Mittal. Senior City sources said the deal - which has been under negotiation for more than a year - could be concluded in the next few days. It will see Tata Steel's UK plants merged into a pan-European venture with annual sales of about Â£13bn. These include the politically sensitive Port Talbot works in Wales. Talks have been held up while the future of Tata Steel's enormous pension scheme - which includes the former British Steel retirement plan - was decided. Three months ago, the pensions regulator approved the creation of a new pension fund after Tata agreed to a Â£550m top-up. More recently, ThyssenKrupp has faced pressure from shareholders to secure better terms from Tata. Elliott Management, the aggressive New York hedge fund that has emerged as a key player in big European takeover battles, recently wrote to Thyssen's board saying that Tata's recent financial results did not warrant it receiving a half-share in the combined business. The deal marks another change of ownership for Britain's steel industry, which once led the world, but has shrunk rapidly in the face of cheaper international competition. Most of the industry was nationalised after World War Two, then re-privatised in 1988 as the British Steel Corporation. It became Corus after a merger with a Dutch rival, Koninklijke Hoogovens, in 1999, and was bought by India's Tata Steel in 2006. The British Steel name was revived two years ago, when investment fund Greybull Capital bought Tata Steel's Scunthorpe-based long-products division. Tata and ThyssenKrupp have both said they are committed to the Port Talbot plant, which is Britain's largest remaining steel plant. But steel industry experts said there remained question marks over the site's long-term future.

"Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel presents Theresa May with a football shirt Two small incidents at this week's EU summit in Brussels shed light on how ridiculously delicate the Brexit process is. The cameras caught a magic moment at the start of the first working session, when the Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel presented Theresa May with a Red Devils shirt. It was to celebrate his national team playing against England in the World Cup on Thursday night. Cue a hundred newspaper stories about the PM being caught with no gift to give in return. Or being tricked into holding up an item of clothing with the word ""Hazard"" on the back (because it was No 10 -  which is Eden Hazard's position.) The Belgian prime minister got his England shirt in the end It turns out to be much more complicated. The plan all along was for BOTH sides to swap shirts. Theresa May even had multiple shirts for members of Mr Michel's family. 'Last call' for deal, Donald Tusk warns UK All eyes now on Cabinet Brexit decision But the Belgian jumped the gun and handed the present over earlier than planned, when Mrs May was empty-handed. An apparent British own-goal had travelled round the world before the truth had even laced up its football boots. Then the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier arrived at the summit on Friday morning, saying that he had invited the UK for a round of Brexit negotiations ""next Monday"" as part of a plan to speed up the talks. After a few texts confirmed that he meant Monday 2 July and not Monday 9 July, there was another friction-filled episode. Michel Barnier arrived at the summit with an invitation for the UK Two possible versions emerged of what might have happened: The UK had already turned down that date and it was an exercise in humiliation by the EU to invite them to a meeting they couldn't make The government had never received an invitation The second is not true. An email was sent on 26 June. I've seen it with my own eyes. But even reports that it might be the case caused outrage at the Commission. And then came claims that the reason the last round of Brexit talks wasn't more productive was because the EU side was under-prepared. ""We always suck it up when the Commission says it's our fault for not making any progress, but not this time,"" a British source complained. None of this has a substantive impact on the Brexit talks but it's juicy evidence of a relationship that's rocky rather than rosy. And neither side seems to mind if you know about it.

"The unions' advisors are concerned about the proposed sale of Cogent, which includes a plant in Newport Unions at Tata remain ""unconvinced"" that the proposed partnership with Thyssenkrupp would be in the ""best interests"" of the firm or its workers. They raised concerns about the ""unwillingness of Thyssenkrupp to engage"" with them. The unions' advisors also proposed a rethink of the decision to sell Tata's Cogent electrical steel business, which includes a plant in Newport. Tata said it was committed to avoiding compulsory redundancies. The Cogent electrical steel plant in Newport, which employs 350 people,was put up for sale last month. Almost 7,000 workers are employed by Tata in Wales, including about 4,000 in Port Talbot. The unions' Tata Steel European Works Council (EWC) are considering a number of recommendations put forward by their advisors Syndex. These included the proposal that more support from the EWC for the joint venture should be conditional on a ban on job cuts until 2022, and an agreement that there should be no Tata Steel site closures before 2026. They advised that unions oppose the current business plan which, it said, ""prioritises shareholder dividends over the long-term development"" of the joint venture. However they do accept that the concept of a joint venture between the two companies could benefit Tata Steel Europe in the long-term. US tariffs: Tata Steel calls for 'protection measures' Tata and ThyssenKrupp agree steel merger Tata Steel merger delayed due to staff negotiations A Tata Steel spokesman said it welcomed the EWC's recognition of the industrial rationale for the proposed joint venture with Thyssenkrupp. He said: ""We believe in the business plan for the proposed joint venture and we are committed to delivering the joint venture without the need for compulsory redundancies. ""Meanwhile, we will continue to share information with the European Works Council about the recent announcement to sell the Cogent electrical steels business as part of our strategy to strengthen our focus on our strategic strip products and markets. ""We will continue to engage in constructive dialogue with our employee representatives throughout the process of creating the proposed joint venture."" Thyssenkrup declined to comment.

"Mrs May left the summit on Friday morning Forcing the UK to leave EU security pacts after Brexit risks the safety of EU and UK citizens, Theresa May has warned European leaders. The UK says EU negotiators are blocking agreement on tracking terrorists and sharing information after March 2019. The EU says as a ""third country"" the UK cannot have the same access to schemes. The EU's chief negotiator said they wanted an ""ambitious"" deal on trade and security but it must be based on ""our  values and principles"". Michel Barnier also warned that ""huge and serious divergence remains"" in Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU and urged the UK to bring forward ""workable and realistic proposals"" for their future relationship. ""The time is short and I am ready to invite the UK delegation to come back to Brussels next Monday,"" he said. Theresa May addressed fellow leaders at a dinner on Thursday night, during the final European Council meeting before October, when both sides hope they will have reached agreement on the UK's withdrawal and a blueprint for its future relationship with the EU. The talks, which stretched into the early hours of Friday, were dominated by the issue of migration, amid a threat from Italy to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not get more help. EU reaches migration deal in crunch talks Bank warning for EU over Brexit progress Brexit date could be delayed, says Blair Mrs May left Brussels on Friday morning and Brexit will be discussed by the remaining EU leaders without her. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthe prime minister had hoped to use the dinner to persuade them it was time to adopt a more flexible approach in negotiations. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte had threatened to veto the summit's agenda if Italy did not get help According to UK officials, Mrs May said EU leaders should tell their negotiators to allow the UK to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System. Without UK participation in such schemes, she suggested their collective ability to fight terrorism would be reduced. ""We would no longer be able to share real-time alerts for wanted persons, including serious criminals,"" she said. ""We would be able to respond less swiftly to alerts for missing people on either side of the Channel and reunite them with their loved ones. ""Our collective ability to map terrorist networks across Europe and bring those responsible to justice would be reduced. ""That is not what I want and I do not believe it is what you want either,"" the prime minister said. She urged them to ""consider what is in the best interests of the safety of your citizens and mine and give your negotiators a mandate that will allow us to achieve this crucial objective."" This video can not be played Belgian PM Charles Michel gave Mrs May his team's shirt ahead of the World Cup clash on Thursday But the vice president of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness, said the focus should be on resolving the question about what happens to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit, not security co-operation. She told BBC Newsnight: ""I am curious as to why this issue would be thrown on the table or why even a veiled threat is necessary"". ""It may not be a helpful move"". And Mr Barnier said the EU wanted an ""EU-UK ambitious partnership, on trade as well as security"" but added: ""We have to base this partnership on our values and principles, respecting also the UK red lines."" Earlier this month he said the UK would be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant deal after Brexit - which allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. He argued it could not remain a part of it, because the UK wanted to leave the European Court of Justice and free movement rules. After ten hours of talks about migration on Thursday night, EU leaders said that new migrant centres could be set up in EU countries on a ""voluntary"" basis. Mrs May welcomed the ""positive conclusions"" reached. She said much of the agreement was ""around what the UK has been encouraging for some time, which is taking more action upstream in countries of origin so that we can ensure that people aren't having to make and aren't making these very dangerous journeys.""

"Mr Tusk said the ""most difficult"" issues were as yet unresolved Donald Tusk has issued a ""last call"" to the UK to ""lay the cards on the table"" if a Brexit deal is to be done in time. The European Council president said the ""most difficult"" issues were unresolved and ""quick progress"" was needed if agreement was to be reached by October. Talks continue over the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU in March next year. What happens to the Irish border remains a sticking point. The UK says both sides want to see a ""faster pace"" in talks.

"Twelve fire engines remain at the scene A man has been arrested on suspicion of starting a moorland blaze on Winter Hill in Lancashire, close to a TV transmitter mast. Lancashire Fire and Rescue Service went to the moorland fire on the hill near Bolton at 15:20 BST on Thursday. A 22-year-old man from Bolton is being held as part of a joint investigation between the fire service and police. Greater Manchester Fire Service said it was tackling a second fire in Bolton which broke out on Friday morning. Lancashire fire crews, who had been in a reserve role supporting colleagues in Greater Manchester dealing witha huge blaze near Saddleworth Moor, were moved to the Winter Hill fire on Thursday evening. The fire, which crews were expected to be at until Saturday, covers an area of about 1.5 sq miles (4 sq km). About 100 firefighters have been tackling the fire Work on the Saddleworth fire, which spread across 7 sq miles (18 sq km), saw soldiers from A Company of the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, join firefighters on Thursday. Eighteen fire engines remain at the scene on Winter Hill, including crews from Cumbria and Merseyside, alongside specialist wildlife units. About 100 firefighters, who resumed their work at first light, are being assisted by mountain rescue officers and a helicopter from water firm United Utilities (UU). The aircraft will be taking water from the nearby Rivington Reservoir to drop on the affected area. A fire service spokesman said while there was no immediate risk to livestock, domestic properties or infrastructure, people living nearby should keep windows and doors closed. The latest fire to affect moorland around Greater Manchester broke near to Horrocks Moor Farm on Scout Road at 02:00 BST.

Director general Tony Hall said: ""I am pleased that we've been able to move past our differences and work through things together; we can now look to the future."" Tony Hall wants the BBC to ""lead the way"" for women in the workplace Lord Hall added he was ""glad"" that she is contributing to a BBC project ""to make the BBC a great place for women to work"". ""That really matters to me, and I want us to lead the way."" When she resigned as China editor, Gracie said she had been dismayed to find the BBC's two male international editors earned ""at least 50% more"" than their two female counterparts. The BBC has now acknowledged she was told she would be paid in line with the North America editor when she took the role, and she accepted the role on that understanding. The BBC has said ""fairness in pay"" is ""vital"" The corporation said it ""has now put this right"". Gracie: 'I could not collude' in pay discrimination' Gracie quit because the two editors earned more than her Â£135,000-a-year salary. She said she had refused a Â£45,000 pay rise because it still left a ""big gap"" between her and her male counterparts, when all she wanted was to be ""made equal"". She went back to a job in the newsroom. The BBC said at the time that ""fairness in pay"" was ""vital"" to the corporation. On 26 January,six of the BBC's leading male presenters agreed to take pay cutsfollowing the revelations about equal salaries. The BBC said Huw Edwards, Nicky Campbell, John Humphrys, Jon Sopel, Nick Robinson and Jeremy Vine had all accepted reduced wages. The Fawcett Society said it would use the donated money to,externalgive women legal support to negotiate equal pay, and it will contribute to strategic legal cases and interventions aimed at strengthening the law. Carrie Gracie finishedher tweet,externalon today's news with the words ""I'm home"". This has been a long and difficult process for one of the BBC's most distinguished journalists. At base, today marks a moral and practical victory for an effective campaigner, and her donation of back pay to the Fawcett Society proves she meant it when she said this was about a principle rather than cash. The narrow question is - what this means for the BBC. The corporation would like it to draw the matter to a close, and pointedly refers in its statement to the ""specific circumstances"" of her case. While today might bring a close to this individual case, it is of course unclear what impact it will have on others at the BBC who are pursuing grievances. The same applies beyond the BBC. As a significant victory for a high-profile campaigner, who came to have totemic status, today will give encouragement to others who have been denied equal pay for equal work.

"Gudrun Burwitz pictured with her father Himmler - who led the SS The daughter of top Nazi Heinrich Himmler was hired by West Germany's foreign intelligence agency (BND) in the 1960s, officials have confirmed. The revelation about Gudrun Burwitz was first reported in the German newspaper Bild following her death aged 88. Her father was in Hitler's inner circle and is viewed as the chief architect of the Holocaust. He killed himself in custody in 1945. Burwitz never disavowed Nazism and defended her father's reputation. She was a teenager when the war ended and was released in 1946 after testifying at the Nuremberg trials. Himmler diaries reveal Nazi horrors The Holocaust: Who are the missing million? 'My granddad captured Heinrich Himmler' German Tabloid Bild reported on her post-war involvement with the BND on Friday, following her death in Munich last month. Gudrun Burwitz continued to attend neo-Nazi events throughout her life, and died in May The head of the spy agency's history department then corroborated the newspaper report about Burwitz's activities in West Germany, which reunited with communist East Germany in 1990 to form the present German state. ""The BND confirms that Ms Burwitz was a member of the BND for a few years until 1963 under an assumed name,"" Bodo Hechelhammer said. ""The timing of her departure coincided with the onset of a change in the understanding and the handling of employees who were involved with the Nazis."" She worked as a secretary at BND headquarters in Pullach, near Munich, from 1961 to 1963. At that time the organisation was under the control of Reinhard Gehlen, a former Nazi military intelligence commander who left the BND in 1968. Himmer (left) pictured inspecting SS Guards with Adolf Hitler Mr Hechelhammer said the organisation did not ordinarily discuss current and former employees but was making an exemption because Burwitz had died. German organisations such as the BND have grappled with how to address their own Nazi links in the post-war era. Burwitz remained prominent in far-right politics throughout her life. She was reported to be a prominent member of Stille Hilfe (Silent Help), a secretive group known to provide legal and financial support to former SS members. Germany country profile She was also known to attend other neo-Nazi events and rallies before her death. Heinrich Himmler was in Adolf Hitler's elite circle. He commanded the SS (Schutzstaffel) - the organisation which played a major role in murdering millions of Jews, Poles, Soviet prisoners-of-war, Roma and others categorised as ""racially inferior"" during the Holocaust. After being taken into British custody in 1945 he killed himself, evading trial for war crimes.

"This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? EU leaders have differed sharply over how a new deal on curbing irregular migration will work. The agreement foresees the creation of secure centres to receive migrants. France's president said his country would not set any up as it was not the EU country where migrants landed first. Italy's prime minister - who had held up agreement at the Brussels summit - said centres could be anywhere within the EU. EU President Donald Tusk warned of difficulties to implement the deal. German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of a ""significant step forward"" but said more must be done to resolve disagreements. By Katya Adler, Europe Editor, BBC News, in Brussels So has Europe's migrant crisis now been solved? In a word, no. On two fronts. Firstly, that of preventing illegal migration and saving migrant lives. Take for example the processing centres that are to operate inside and outside the EU. The idea behind those is to put economic migrants off coming to Europe as they'll know only those with a legal right to asylum or refugee status can stay. But these processing centres are voluntary. We don't know where or when (or if) they will be operational - and in the meantime, migrants will keep making that perilous journey across the Mediterranean. The second failure is more of a half-failure, and it's a political one. Let's face it - with the sharp drop in arrivals to Europe, the stresses and strains between EU countries are clearly political. The fact that leaders like Germany's Angela Merkel leave this summit claiming that ""a significant step forward has been taken"" is a hint that, in true EU summit style, leaders have papered over the cracks. But is Europe North, South, East and West united now over a common migrant and asylum policy moving forward? Absolutely not. The deal is being billed as a lifeline for Mrs Merkel, who has faced a political crisis at home where a key ally, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere. The deal will likely help to stabilise Angela Merkel's rocky coalition Italy also differed with Spain and Greece who agreed to take back migrants registered on their territory who had travelled on to Germany. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the summit's joint communique until the leaders had settled the migration issue. European press says migrant deal 'fragile' Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migrant mutiny Trapped in a country everyone wants to leave This video can not be played Migrant crisis: EU border force Frontex explained The 28 EU leaders agreed several other measures, including:,external Strengthening external border controls, with more funding for Turkey and countries in North Africa Exploring the possibility of ""regional disembarkation platforms"", designed to thwart people-smuggling gangs by processing migrants outside the EU Boosting investment in Africa to help the continent achieve a ""socio-economic transformation"" so people no longer want to leave in pursuit of a better life in Europe The centres are meant be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis,external, but there are no details on which nations might host them or take in refugees. French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants initially arrived in the EU, and that France would not have any as it is ""not a country of first arrival"". But Mr Conte told reporters that all EU states would be able to establish the centres, ""including France"". He suggested Mr Macron had been ""tired"" when he spoke. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte took issue with France's President Macron over the specifics of the deal Gruelling migration talks end in draw Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says, compared to more than a million in 2015. Several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. Non-governmental organisations have fiercely condemned the deal, saying it betrays vulnerable people and those trying to stop them dying in the Mediterranean. The deal also aimed to ""demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations"", MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said. On Friday, around 100 people were said to have drowned off the Libyan coast, with 16 rescued. Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? 'Used as a slave' in a Libyan detention centre Italy's anti-immigration Interior Minister Matteo Salvini has previously railed against rescue ships run by international NGOs, and said on Friday that they helped people traffickers ""consciously or not"".

"This video can not be played Gosport nurse: 'I didn't feel we were killing them' A nurse who worked at a hospital where more than 450 patients died after being prescribed dangerous doses of painkilling drugs has said staff were trying to make them ""comfortable"". The patients were given the drugs inappropriately at the Gosport War Memorial Hospital,a report concluded. The nurse, who does not wish to be identified, told the BBC she ""didn't feel we were killing"" patients. The report's findings have led to calls from families for an inquiry. The independent panel report found there was an ""institutionalised regime"" at the hospital from 1989 to 2000 of prescribing and administering ""dangerous"" amounts of a medication not clinically justified. It said taking into account missing records, a further 200 patients may have also had their lives shortened. The nurse, who has now retired, said at the time it did not seem like lots of people were dying prematurely. ""I suppose I was concerned but at the same time I was pleased these people seemed to be more comfortable. ""That's what nursing is all about; making sure people were comfortable."" ""I can't say that someone died too soon, I didn't feel we were killing them."" The woman said she and her colleagues raised concerns with hospital managers in the 1990s about the use of the dangerous pain killers and the syringe drivers used to pump them into patients ""I feel looking back I think 'did I do my job properly?'. I'm sure I did. Are we nurses classed as murders?"" Asked what she would say to relatives of those who died, she said: ""I would say 'I'm sorry if you feel your loved ones have died in this way. I feel sure they were well looked after and we gave them all the care we could. I did my best'."" This video can not be played Former Gosport hospital doctor Jane Barton did her ""best for her patients"", her husband says. So far, the only person to face disciplinary action has been Dr Jane Barton, who was found guilty of failings in her care of 12 patients at Gosport between 1996 and 1999. But no prosecutions were brought and she was not struck off the medical register, choosing to retire after the findings. The retired nurse said she thought Dr Barton was a ""good woman"". A statement read out on behalf of Dr Barton earlier this week said she was a ""doctor doing the best for her patients"" while working in a ""very inadequately resourced part of the health service"". New force to take on hospital deaths probe Gran 'was treated brutally' at hospital Who is Dr Jane Barton? Inquests into the deaths of 10 patients, six of whom are pictured, were held in 2009 The Gosport Independent Panel's report found whistleblowers and families were ignored as they attempted to raise concerns about the administration of medication on the wards, which was overseen by Dr Barton. Following the release of the report last week, Prime Minister Theresa May described events at Gosport as ""deeply troubling"" and apologised to families over the time it took to get answers from the NHS. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs that police and the Crown Prosecution Service would examine material in the report to consider their next steps and ""whether criminal charges should now be brought"".

"This video can not be played Heatwave: Call to conserve water A hosepipe ban took effect in Northern Ireland at 18:00 BST on Friday.

Temperatures peaked at 30C on Friday, but are expected to be lower today. One fire appliance will remain to monitor agorse fire on the Glenshane Pass.

In the Republic of Ireland, Irish Water has announced a ban on the use of hosepipes in the greater Dublin area from 2 July. Irish Water said the ban will be in place until 31 July, but the situation will be kept under review. By BBC Northern Ireland weather presenter Geoff Maskell It has been an incredible few days of weather. Not quite record breaking - but very, very close. The warmest June temperature ever recorded in Northern Ireland was 30.8C at Knockarevan, back in 1976. On Thursday we came within a whisker of that, recording highs of 30.5C at both Derrylin and Thomastown. The lengthy spell of fine weather is all due to an area of high pressure which has been anchored over the British Isles for the last week. High pressure in summer means, fine sunny days, light winds and initially clear cool nights. At the start of this week the nights were still quite pleasant. But as the ground warms up day by day, as it has done this week, even those night-time temperatures start to rise. NI Water wants customers to turn sprinklers off The fine weather is set to stay with us through the weekend, all of next week and on into the early part of July. There's only a 20% chance of rain in the Belfast area before 11 July. But the temperature will drop a little, from a ""scorchio"" 30 degrees this week to just a very pleasant 23 or 24 degrees next week. Inland Fisheries in the Republic of Ireland asked anglers and the public to report any sightings of fish possibly distressed by high water temperatures and low water levels. They have also asked anglers to practice catch-and-release fishing during the heatwave - meaning all fish caught are returned to the water. The police have reiterated their warning to not leave dogs in cars. The surface of some roads - like Church Road outside Ballyclare - melted in the heat on Thursday When is it too hot to work?

"Fans in Nigeria, Morocco and Senegal express their sorrow after their teams were knocked out the tournament Senegal's World Cup exit on Thursday means Africa has suffered its worst World Cup display for 36 years, with no side from the continent in the knockout stage for the first time since 1982. Going into the tournament, there were high hopes Africa could build on its display in Brazil in 2014 when two teams - Nigeria and Algeria - reached the second round for the first time. Instead, a continent will be wondering where it went wrong as its 15 games resulted in 10 defeats, two draws and just three wins. So what is to blame: bad luck, VAR, or a lack of flair? This was supposed to be the tournament in which Egypt changed their lamentable World Cup record, in part because of what was supposedly a weak group and in part because they boast one of the world's best players. However you look at it, Mohamed Salah dominated Egypt's campaign - ultimately scoring seven, and assisting two, of the 10 goals they scored both in qualifying and in Russia. Mo Salah did not light up the tournament as many had hoped he would It was painfully obvious to the fans how much he would be missed when a shoulder injury sustained in the Champions League final ruled him out of the first game against Uruguay. In his absence, forward Marwan Mohsen - one goal in 23 internationals - looked an inadequate replacement. Even if Salah had been fully fit it is questionable how far the Pharaohs - at their first World Cup in 28 years - would have gone because of costly defensive errors. This is not what you would expect of a team coached by the defensive pragmatist Hector Cuper, but too often they erred - with Ali Gabr and Ahmed Hegazi's central partnership often suspect. Nonetheless, their goalkeepers impressed - Mohamed El Shenawy performing superbly against Uruguay while African legend Essam El Hadary, 45, celebrated World Cup history in fine style against Saudi Arabia by not only becoming the tournament's oldest player but also making a stunning penalty save. But the team that has long dominated African football (with seven continental crowns) ultimately disappointed, never more so than in their final last-gasp defeat by Saudi Arabia. That was the first time they had been in front in a World Cup match, but after 84 years of trying they are still searching for their first win. Morocco's World Cup campaign was undone in the worst possible fashion - conceding a calamitous own goal in stoppage time of their opening game to gift Iran a 1-0 win. Coach Herve Renard had called this match his team's ""World Cup final"", hardly surprising given that Portugal and Spain lay next, and his pained face after the match encapsulated his immense regret. Morocco fans were impressed by their team's performance at the tournament From then on though, Morocco hugely impressed. They fell behind early to European champions Portugal in their next game but after that, it was largely one-way traffic, with the North Africans impressing with their passing, fluidity and constant attacking drive. Like nearly all African teams in Russia, they were undone by the lack of a reliable goalscorer and, when chances did come Morocco's way, they either fell to the wrong people (defender Mehdi Benatia twice guilty) or they were thwarted by top goalkeeping (Rui Patricio denying Younes Belhanda). In their final game, the Atlas Lions continued to impress and were seconds away from inflicting Spain's first defeat in 23 games only for the 2010 world champions to draw 2-2 after yet another stoppage-time goal against an African team. Given that Spain boasted seven players from Real Madrid and Barcelona, with the rest from European heavyweights Manchester City, Manchester United, Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid, this was a match that showed Morocco in the best possible light. ""They are an excellent team who had lost two matches 1-0 while deserving much more,"" said Spain coach Fernando Hierro afterwards. It is hard to disagree. Nigeria's last-gasp loss to Argentina may have attracted much criticism back home, with plenty wondering why the defence wasn't bolstered in the closing stages, but the Super Eagles' Russian campaign was ultimately packed with positives. Despite being placed in the traditional ""Group of Death"", the youngest squad in the tournament - featuring 18 players who had never played at a World Cup before - were just four minutes away from qualifying for the knockout rounds. Victor Moses's penalty had given Nigeria hope against Argentina before they conceded a late goal This was not a Nigeria team blessed with the talents or physical power of the magnificent side in the 1990s, but it made up for that with a solidity and team spirit not often seen in Super Eagles squads. ""I think the future is for Nigeria because there is a big solidarity - you saw in the difficult moments how great the spirit in the team is,"" coach Gernot Rohr told BBC Sport. The German lamented the slow starts to every game for his side in Russia, with Nigeria failing to trouble their opponents in every first half. It is worth noting that unlike previous campaigns, this one went smoothly for Nigeria with next-to-no reports of administrative chaos and with bonuses sorted out months in advance. That bodes well for the future, as does the vast experience the team will have gained from their Russia campaign. Tunisia were simply not good enough to progress from a difficult group featuring both Belgium and England, and that is an admission made by the coach himself. ""We are far from the required level,"" former international Nabil Maaloul said, with captain Wahbi Khazri also venturing that his side found the level against both top-drawer European opponents to be ""too high, too elevated"". Tunisia won their first World Cup match against Panama but they were poor in the other group matches The Carthage Eagles only lost their opening game to England in stoppage time, as an African team once again suffered at the hands of both set-pieces and late goals, but they also created precious little. There can be no doubt that a team shorn of top talents badly missed their star man - injured playmaker Youssef Msakni - but his impact may well have been limited as Belgium's 5-2 destruction of the Carthage Eagles proved. Nonetheless, Tunisia leave the competition as Africa's top scorers - with five goals from three games - and a sense of satisfaction. Despite trailing against Panama, the North Africans fought back to 2-1 and so secure their first win in the competition since 1978 - a year when they became the first African team to win a World Cup game. After four straight defeats for Africa at the start of the competition, Senegal became the continent's great hopes after winning their first game - and the continent's - against a poor Poland. The 2-2 draw with Japan in their next game may have entertained the fans but having twice let go of the lead, it opened the door for a potential slip-up against Colombia - and how damaging that proved. Senegal lost out after receiving more yellow cards than the Japanese - six to four - with two of the West Africans' yellows coming in the final seconds of their clash with the Asian side. Many felt Senegal were Africa's best team in the tournament and were disappointed when they were knocked out While many Senegalese have lamented the new Fifa ruling which eliminated them from the competition on their inferior disciplinary record, coach Aliou Cisse refused to do so - saying simply his side ""didn't deserve"" to make the second round. As with Egypt and Salah, plenty of hope was placed on Sadio Mane but he struggled to make an impact in the games - seldom getting in behind opposing defences and often straitjacketed by tactical demands that seemed to limit his ability to roam free, certainly in the first two games. Senegal were another African team which lacked midfield creativity but they impressed at the other end, where Kalidou Koulibaly and Salif Sane formed a fine and imposing central partnership. The Senegalese defeat by Colombia was their first in a World Cup group game but they exit the competition with Africa's strongest record at the finals - with three wins and just two defeats from their eight games so far. A lot is being written and said about the impact of the newly introduced video assistant referee (VAR) in the tournament and there is no surprise that opinion is divided. The video assistant referee (VAR) was used to review some of the contentious decisions Nigerians have argued that VAR decisions went against them, saying Argentina's Marcos Rojo should have been penalised when heading the ball onto his own hand in St Petersburg - especially since Iran had been awarded a penalty in very similar circumstances on Monday. However, while that latter decision seemed wrong, the referee in the Nigeria-Argentina match got his decision right. Elsewhere, Morocco's Nordin Amrabat left no-one in any doubt as to his views on VAR following Spain's late equaliser in their 2-2 draw but once again it was the right decision, as was the penalty awarded against Egypt for Saudi Arabia. In both Egypt's - and Africa's - favour was the decision to award Mohamed Salah a penalty, which he converted, against host nation Russia. And African fans should not be too despondent as the continent's referees - who have performed well in Russia so far - are still here, meaning at least some Africans might make it to the World Cup's latter stages.

"This video can not be played Gosport nurse: 'I didn't feel we were killing them' A nurse who worked at a hospital where more than 450 patients died after being prescribed dangerous doses of painkilling drugs has said staff were trying to make them ""comfortable"". The patients were given the drugs inappropriately at the Gosport War Memorial Hospital,a report concluded. The nurse, who does not wish to be identified, told the BBC she ""didn't feel we were killing"" patients. The report's findings have led to calls from families for an inquiry. The independent panel report found there was an ""institutionalised regime"" at the hospital from 1989 to 2000 of prescribing and administering ""dangerous"" amounts of a medication not clinically justified. It said taking into account missing records, a further 200 patients may have also had their lives shortened. The nurse, who has now retired, said at the time it did not seem like lots of people were dying prematurely. ""I suppose I was concerned but at the same time I was pleased these people seemed to be more comfortable. ""That's what nursing is all about; making sure people were comfortable."" ""I can't say that someone died too soon, I didn't feel we were killing them."" The woman said she and her colleagues raised concerns with hospital managers in the 1990s about the use of the dangerous pain killers and the syringe drivers used to pump them into patients ""I feel looking back I think 'did I do my job properly?'. I'm sure I did. Are we nurses classed as murders?"" Asked what she would say to relatives of those who died, she said: ""I would say 'I'm sorry if you feel your loved ones have died in this way. I feel sure they were well looked after and we gave them all the care we could. I did my best'."" This video can not be played Former Gosport hospital doctor Jane Barton did her ""best for her patients"", her husband says. So far, the only person to face disciplinary action has been Dr Jane Barton, who was found guilty of failings in her care of 12 patients at Gosport between 1996 and 1999. But no prosecutions were brought and she was not struck off the medical register, choosing to retire after the findings. The retired nurse said she thought Dr Barton was a ""good woman"". A statement read out on behalf of Dr Barton earlier this week said she was a ""doctor doing the best for her patients"" while working in a ""very inadequately resourced part of the health service"". New force to take on hospital deaths probe Gran 'was treated brutally' at hospital Who is Dr Jane Barton? Inquests into the deaths of 10 patients, six of whom are pictured, were held in 2009 The Gosport Independent Panel's report found whistleblowers and families were ignored as they attempted to raise concerns about the administration of medication on the wards, which was overseen by Dr Barton. Following the release of the report last week, Prime Minister Theresa May described events at Gosport as ""deeply troubling"" and apologised to families over the time it took to get answers from the NHS. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs that police and the Crown Prosecution Service would examine material in the report to consider their next steps and ""whether criminal charges should now be brought"".

"Tesco is testing whether supermarket customers can buy products without visiting a till. The UK's biggest retailer has given some staff a smartphone app to use at a store at the company's headquarters. They use the app to scan barcodes on the products they want and then pay, with no trip to a till needed. Co-op is experimenting with similar technology andAmazon already has a checkout-freegrocery store in Seattle that is open to the public. Tesco says its experiment is at a very early stage. It is concerned that checkout-free stores might be a target for shoplifters and, as it operates on very fine profit margins, that could make the technology unviable. ""If the margin in the business is 2 or 3%, you don't have to lose much to make it unprofitable,"" said chief executive Dave Lewis. Given Tesco's size, if it did adopt the technology it would be significant advance for checkout-free shopping. Amazon's supermarket with no checkouts Tesco says growth 'on track' Co-op is also experimenting with a smartphone app that would eliminate the need to visit a till. It is running a trial at a store in Manchester and will expand those tests over the summer. However, retail experts are not convinced that grocers can make big savings from the technology. ""Recent stories about the level of theft at self-service checkouts - something that we've had for around 10 years in retail - leaves me to wonder about the obvious savings in checkout-free stores versus a hidden cost in terms of theft,"" said independent retail analyst Steve Dresser. ""However, you always follow the customer as a retailer. It has always been clear that customers want as little hassle as possible."" Amazon's store in Seattle has a more sophisticated system. Shoppers enter by swiping their smartphone that has the Amazon Go app. The store uses hundreds of ceiling-mounted cameras and electronic sensors to identify each customer and track the items they select. Customers can to put any item straight into their shopping bags and purchases are billed to their credit cards when they leave the store. The Tesco store at its headquarters in Welwyn Garden City is also cashless, which Tesco says has cut the average time spent at a checkout to 45 seconds. It takes shoppers at similar-sized stores that accept cash an average of 90 seconds at the checkout.

"George Osborne was a surprise appointment at Evening Standard, and initially said he would continue as an MP The Evening Standard will post a loss of Â£10m for the year ending in September 2017, a reversal in fortunes for London's paper that poses a big headache for its owner, Evgeny Lebedev. The Standard's loss - Â£9.98m - comes after a recorded profit of Â£2.2m in the previous year, representing a Â£12m swing into the red. The causes of the sharp financial deterioration reflect both long-term, structural changes in the newspaper industry - above all the downward pressure on print display advertising - and specific issues arising in that financial year. Those exceptional circumstances include a London food festival which was, commercially at least, and allowing for sub-optimal weather, an expensive failure. The weakness of sterling pushed paper costs up for all newspapers. And the slowdown in London's property market always augurs ill for the Standard, whose Homes & Property supplement is a key driver of revenue. The Standard also took on costs as a result of the closure in 2016 of its sister title at ESI Media, The Independent, where I was editor of the print edition until it closed in March 2016. The Standardrecently denied allegations,externalthat it had sold favourable news coverage to big advertisers. The losses will inevitably alarm George Osborne, the former chancellor whobecame editorof the London paper last May. As the architect of austerity in the Coalition years, he has foes. And as a surprise appointment to the role of editor with virtually no journalistic experience, critics will point to his tenure as an explanation of the losses. However, pinning the losses on him would betray a certain naivety about the business model of the paper, and timings. Osborne took the editor's chair more than half way through the financial year to which the results pertain. Moreover, as a free paper the Standard is almost wholly reliant on advertising revenue. It has no cover price. The days when editorial changes could really drive big circulation and cover price growth are long gone - even for those papers that charge readers. For a free paper with fixed distribution, editorial changes don't easily correspond to commercial benefit. Even if the ""nibs"" (news in briefs) were full of Pulitzer Prize-winning pieces, it would have limited effect on how many people take the Standard. The deeper question is whether - in an environment where all ad-funded media businesses, from websites to TV companies, are under huge strain because of the flight of cash to a few big digital beasts - the Standard's business model is viable. The path to profitability will probably take several years. On the cost side, there's not much room for manoeuvre, as budgets are already tight. One option might be to cut distribution. On the revenue side, the plan will be the same as at most newspapers: keep print stable and grow digital.  And if you can drive revenues through events, membership schemes, and your audience data, all of that is a bonus. For the Standard, two acts of faith are required here. The first is that despite the huge pressure on print display advertising, overall revenues from that source do not decline. So far the Standard has managed that, holding revenues steady by growing its share of the national newspaper ad market - despite being a free London newspaper. On the digital side, while traffic is sharply up and revenues are growing, they are doing so from a small base, and sustaining digital growth could require serious investment that will worsen the P&L in the short term. Staff can take some reassurance from the fact there is profitability elsewhere in ESI Media. Not at London Live, the TV station, however, which reduced losses to Â£2.95m.  There is little prospect of it ever flourishing commercially. The local TV market will probably be consolidated - pending regulatory approval - and the question is who fancies the task. At The Independent, profits have almost doubled to Â£3.26m. Throughout my near decade at the title, it struggled financially; so to be profitable, growing, and read by nearly five million unique browsers around the world daily is an unfamiliar experience for the publication. The Independent is looking at launching some kind of premium service, to complement its current offering, this year. Last year, Lebedev sold a 30% stake in The Independent to Mohamed Abuljadayel, a Saudi investor. Full disclosure: I worked for Lebedev for six years. I didn't speak to him for this article. Owner Evgeny Lebedev bought the Standard in 2009 and made it a free paper There is no doubt Lebedev is fully committed to ownership of the Standard, which he made free after acquiring it. The free model initially secured a turnaround in fortunes. The paper had forecast losses in the tens of millions, but within a few years was profitable. The task for Lebedev's team is to apply the lessons of The Independent's digital growth to the Standard. Whether the lessons carry across is debatable. Much of the Standard's content is London-focused, though it has celebrity pictures with viral potential, and counts around 40% of its audience as overseas. Osborne has international ambitions for the paper, which could give it journalism that can generate a following in key international markets. But that will cost. Across all media, consolidation is rampant. It is the trend which unites Disney, Fox, Sky, Comcast, AT&T, Time Warner, CBS, Viacom and the Daily Mirror and Daily Express. The UK has plenty of national titles for the size of its population, adding a further reason for consolidation. Common sense suggests some kind of union between the Standard and Metro, which is part of Lord Rothermere's Daily Mail group (DMGT), could be financially beneficial. Both are free-to-consumer, ad-funded titles, housed in the same building; and though Osborne would consider his paper more upmarket than Metro, the savings from a joint editorial and commercial operation would be near-immediate, not least in back-office staff, IT and floor space. For now, however, such a deal is off the table, and it will soon be clear how Lord Rothermere - who sold most of the Standard to Lebedev in 2009 and recently diluted what remained of his stake in it, from 24.9% to 10% - intends to integrate Metro into his company following thedeparture of Paul Dacre,externalas editor of the Daily Mail. Few people these days own newspapers because they want to accrue wealth. But print titles still need to be commercially viable. Profitability is the best guarantee of independence. The Standard can be profitable again - but there's no guarantee, and it will be a long slog.

"An order preventing David Duckenfield being tried was imposed following a private prosecution 18 years ago The match commander on the day of the Hillsborough disaster David Duckenfield will face trial for the manslaughter by gross negligence of 95 football supporters, a judge has ruled. The decision to prosecute the former chief superintendent was made by Sir Peter Openshaw at Preston Crown Court who lifted a stay on his prosecution. An order preventing Mr Duckenfield being tried was imposed 18 years ago. Four other men will also face trial on charges related to Hillsborough. Mr Duckenfield, 73, was match commander at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest when 96 Liverpool fans were fatally injured in a crush in the terrace pens. Under the law at the time, there can be no prosecution for the death of the 96th victim, Tony Bland, because he died more than a year and a day after his injuries were caused. Graham Mackrell, Alan Foster, Donald Denton and Peter Metcalf also face charges relating to Hillsborough Former Sheffield Wednesday club secretary Graham Mackrell is charged with health and safety, and safety at sports grounds offences. The trial of Mr Duckenfield and Mr Mackrell is currently listed to start on 10 September. Former solicitor Peter Metcalf and former police officers Donald Denton and Alan Foster are scheduled to go on trial in January 2019 charged with perverting the course of justice. A hearing to determine whether former Chief Constable Sir Norman Bettison will be tried has been adjourned until August. The Crown Prosecution Service applied to lift a historical stay - halting further legal proceedings - on Mr Duckenfield which was put in place in 2000. In his ruling on Friday, the judge said: ""In respect of the defendant David Duckenfield I lift the stay.""

"This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? EU leaders have differed sharply over how a new deal on curbing irregular migration will work. The agreement foresees the creation of secure centres to receive migrants. France's president said his country would not set any up as it was not the EU country where migrants landed first. Italy's prime minister - who had held up agreement at the Brussels summit - said centres could be anywhere within the EU. EU President Donald Tusk warned of difficulties to implement the deal. German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke of a ""significant step forward"" but said more must be done to resolve disagreements. By Katya Adler, Europe Editor, BBC News, in Brussels So has Europe's migrant crisis now been solved? In a word, no. On two fronts. Firstly, that of preventing illegal migration and saving migrant lives. Take for example the processing centres that are to operate inside and outside the EU. The idea behind those is to put economic migrants off coming to Europe as they'll know only those with a legal right to asylum or refugee status can stay. But these processing centres are voluntary. We don't know where or when (or if) they will be operational - and in the meantime, migrants will keep making that perilous journey across the Mediterranean. The second failure is more of a half-failure, and it's a political one. Let's face it - with the sharp drop in arrivals to Europe, the stresses and strains between EU countries are clearly political. The fact that leaders like Germany's Angela Merkel leave this summit claiming that ""a significant step forward has been taken"" is a hint that, in true EU summit style, leaders have papered over the cracks. But is Europe North, South, East and West united now over a common migrant and asylum policy moving forward? Absolutely not. The deal is being billed as a lifeline for Mrs Merkel, who has faced a political crisis at home where a key ally, Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere. The deal will likely help to stabilise Angela Merkel's rocky coalition Italy also differed with Spain and Greece who agreed to take back migrants registered on their territory who had travelled on to Germany. Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the summit's joint communique until the leaders had settled the migration issue.

Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says, compared to more than a million in 2015. Several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. Non-governmental organisations have fiercely condemned the deal, saying it betrays vulnerable people and those trying to stop them dying in the Mediterranean. The deal also aimed to ""demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations"", MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said.

"The carbon dioxide shortage will start affecting some supplies to supermarkets this weekend, the Food and Drink Federation has warned. CO2 is used to stun farm animals, put fizz in carbonated drinks and is used in packaging, but is in short supply. Federation chief executive Ian Wright said carbon dioxide supplies were not expected to resume until next week. He said that while stocks would not run out, ""choice will be eroded"". Mr Wright told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We will see fewer chicken dishes, fewer pork and bacon dishes. ""We'll see probably less carbonated drinks and certainly bakery and other things that benefit from what's called modified atmosphere packaging, which is plastic packaging with a tray underneath and a dish of food in them."" Why the CO2 shortage really matters Beer shortage hits biggest pub chains Have you noticed a shortage of food and drink at your supermarket? Is there less choice of beer at your local pub? Please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,externalwith your stories. A number of companies have reported disruption to production because of the shortage. Warburton's, the UK's biggest producer of crumpets, said ithas been forced to halt production at two of its four plants. The company uses carbon dioxide to give its crumpets a longer shelf life and prevent mould. Earlier this week the Wetherspoons and Ei Group pub chains said they had temporarily run out, or were running short of, beers including John Smith's, Amstel and Moretti as well as Strongbow cider. The British Retail Consortium said: ""We are aware of specific pressures in some areas such as carbonated soft drinks, beer, British chicken and British pork but the majority of food products are unaffected and retailers do not anticipate food shortages. However, it is likely that the mix of products available may be affected."" This video can not be played Are we in for a beer shortage this summer? The Food and Drink Federation's Mr Wright said that even if supplies of CO2 resumed next week, it would take some time before it made its way to food and drink producers. ""Inventories of products have been eroded quite a lot over the last week and not many people keep very large stocks of products because it is not cost-efficient,"" he explained. Jaega Wise, head brewer at the Wild Card Brewery in Walthamstow, east London, says the CO2 shortage has most affected the bottling side of the micro brewery and bar business. ""This week I had 2,000 litres of beer that was meant to be sent off for bottling and then I get a phone call from our bottler saying 'we simply can't take it because we have no CO2',"" she says. Jaega Wise is the head brewer at the Wild Card Brewery in East London And it is a problem facing all types of brewers - even those who make cask beer. Ms Wise says that while it is possible to make cask ale without CO2 because of the natural carbonation that yeast provides, she says all brewers use carbon dioxide ""to move beer in between tanks, we use it to purge tanks, we generally use it a lot in the brewery itself, so it is a problem for cask producers as well as bottles as well as kegs"". She says Wild Card has just enough CO2 to keep its beer fizzing. ""We're not in a crisis moment yet. I would say keep on going to the pubs, still keep on enjoying the football but if this carries on for much longer we're going to be in trouble."" Quality Pork Limited, which operates Scotland's biggest abattoir at Brechin, is closed and other meat producers are considering changes to use less CO2. Andy McGowan, chief executive of the Scottish Pork Producers co-operative, said he had heard that supplies of CO2 could restart next week, and that Brechin might receive gas in the second half. Abattoirs use CO2 as part of a pre-slaughter stunning process. To avoid overcrowding, Quality Pork had sent 2,000 pigs to the meat processor Tulip in England, while 4,000 remained in Scotland. About 6,000 pigs pass through Brechin every week. Some food and drink firms have asked whether the government could help alleviate the problem. Mr Wright said ministers could ask suppliers that have stopped production for maintenance to put factories back into production. There are concerns about overcrowding as animals will not go to slaughter at their usual rate. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Department of Business have both said they are monitoring the situation. They said: ""We have been assured CO2 producers are working as fast as they can to get plants up and running again, with CO2 production set to start very shortly."" The trade journal Gasworld, which first revealed that CO2 was running short, said that the plant at Billingham, County Durham, is due to restart on Monday.

"Mrs May left the summit on Friday morning Forcing the UK to leave EU security pacts after Brexit risks the safety of EU and UK citizens, Theresa May has warned European leaders. The UK says EU negotiators are blocking agreement on tracking terrorists and sharing information after March 2019. The EU says as a ""third country"" the UK cannot have the same access to schemes. The EU's chief negotiator said they wanted an ""ambitious"" deal on trade and security but it must be based on ""our  values and principles"". Michel Barnier also warned that ""huge and serious divergence remains"" in Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU and urged the UK to bring forward ""workable and realistic proposals"" for their future relationship. ""The time is short and I am ready to invite the UK delegation to come back to Brussels next Monday,"" he said. Theresa May addressed fellow leaders at a dinner on Thursday night, during the final European Council meeting before October, when both sides hope they will have reached agreement on the UK's withdrawal and a blueprint for its future relationship with the EU. The talks, which stretched into the early hours of Friday, were dominated by the issue of migration, amid a threat from Italy to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not get more help. EU reaches migration deal in crunch talks Bank warning for EU over Brexit progress Brexit date could be delayed, says Blair Mrs May left Brussels on Friday morning and Brexit will be discussed by the remaining EU leaders without her. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthe prime minister had hoped to use the dinner to persuade them it was time to adopt a more flexible approach in negotiations. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte had threatened to veto the summit's agenda if Italy did not get help According to UK officials, Mrs May said EU leaders should tell their negotiators to allow the UK to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System. Without UK participation in such schemes, she suggested their collective ability to fight terrorism would be reduced. ""We would no longer be able to share real-time alerts for wanted persons, including serious criminals,"" she said. ""We would be able to respond less swiftly to alerts for missing people on either side of the Channel and reunite them with their loved ones. ""Our collective ability to map terrorist networks across Europe and bring those responsible to justice would be reduced. ""That is not what I want and I do not believe it is what you want either,"" the prime minister said. She urged them to ""consider what is in the best interests of the safety of your citizens and mine and give your negotiators a mandate that will allow us to achieve this crucial objective."" This video can not be played Belgian PM Charles Michel gave Mrs May his team's shirt ahead of the World Cup clash on Thursday But the vice president of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness, said the focus should be on resolving the question about what happens to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit, not security co-operation. She told BBC Newsnight: ""I am curious as to why this issue would be thrown on the table or why even a veiled threat is necessary"". ""It may not be a helpful move"". And Mr Barnier said the EU wanted an ""EU-UK ambitious partnership, on trade as well as security"" but added: ""We have to base this partnership on our values and principles, respecting also the UK red lines."" Earlier this month he said the UK would be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant deal after Brexit - which allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. He argued it could not remain a part of it, because the UK wanted to leave the European Court of Justice and free movement rules. After ten hours of talks about migration on Thursday night, EU leaders said that new migrant centres could be set up in EU countries on a ""voluntary"" basis. Mrs May welcomed the ""positive conclusions"" reached. She said much of the agreement was ""around what the UK has been encouraging for some time, which is taking more action upstream in countries of origin so that we can ensure that people aren't having to make and aren't making these very dangerous journeys.""

"This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? Secure centres for migrants may be set up in EU states to process asylum claims under a deal reached after marathon talks at a summit in Brussels. Thecontrolled centres would be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis,externaland migrants whose claims were rejected would be ""returned"". Refugees could be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them. The deal follows weeks of diplomatic wrangling over migrant rescue ships, and which country should take them in. Coastguard officials said on Friday that around 100 people were thought to have drowned off the Libyan coast, with 14 rescued. They were found in waters to the east of the capital, Tripoli. Gruelling migration talks end in draw Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? There were no details on which countries might set up the secure centres or take in refugees, but French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants first arrived in the EU. ""We have struck the right balance between responsibility and solidarity,"" he said. Numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their 2015 peak, the European Council says. Italy - the entry point for thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - had threatened to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not receive help. ""After this European summit, Europe is more responsible and offers more solidarity,"" said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. ""Today Italy is no longer alone."" Other leaders struck a more cautious note. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done to resolve disagreements. And European Council President Donald Tusk said it was ""too early to talk about a success"". ""We have managed to reach an agreement in the European Council. But this is in fact the easiest part of the task, compared to what awaits us on the ground when we start implementing it,"" he told a news conference. By Adam Fleming, BBC News, Brussels A few things stand out as wins for Italy's new prime minister. The summit's conclusions now include a statement about the need for boats that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to respect international law. But the big one is approval of the concept of closed, secure processing facilities for migrants arriving in the EU. Some say this will make it easier to send back people whose claims for asylum are rejected. Others are already describing them as prisons. This paragraph is full of caveats, commas and sub-clauses - all the hallmarks of something drafted in the middle of the night. Another striking pledge is for an ambitious partnership with Africa. That's the EU trying to balance its tough internal approach with a friendly external one, and offering incentives to North African countries to host facilities where migrants can be assessed for resettlement in Europe. The 28 EU leaders also agreed several other measures,external: strengthening external border controls, and boosting financing for Turkey and countries in North Africa exploring the possibility of ""regional disembarkation platforms"", aimed at breaking the business model of  people-smuggling gangs by processing refugees and migrants outside the EU. However getting North African countries to host such centres could be very difficult and Morocco again on Thursday rejected the idea internal measures taken by member states to stop migrants moving within the EU, which the agreement said undermined asylum policy and the border-free Schengen travel area more investment in Africa to help the continent achieve a ""substantial socio-economic transformation"" so people no longer leave for a better life further work to reform EU asylum policy, including changes to the so-called Dublin regulation under which migrants must be considered for asylum in the first safe country where they arrive Mr Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the joint communiquÃ© until the leaders had settled the migration issue. Both Italy and Greece want other countries to share the burden. However several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the migration issue could be a defining moment for the EU - but she also needed the summit to avert a political crisis at home that could bring down her government. This video can not be played Migrant crisis: EU border force Frontex explained Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, had given her a deadline of this weekend. He has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere from the border in his home state. European press says migrant deal 'fragile' Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migrant mutiny Trapped in a country everyone wants to leave Without the CSU, Mrs Merkel would lose her parliamentary majority. After the talks, she acknowledged the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"". About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says. More than a million people arrived in 2015. This month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight. Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? 'Used as a slave' in a Libyan detention centre The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take some of the migrants on board. Malta said Norway had now also agreed to take a share. Medical charity Medecins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) branded the new EU deal inhumane. ""The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping - and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations,"" MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said.

"The victims, from top left: Rob Hiaasen, Rebecca Smith, Gerald Fischman; John McNamara (bottom centre), Wendi Winters (bottom right) The suspect in the mass shooting at a Maryland newspaper office on Thursday barricaded an exit so that staff could not escape, says a prosecutor. Officials earlier told reporters the accused, Jarrod Ramos, was not co-operating with the investigation. Police found evidence at the suspect's house the attack on the Capital Gazette in Annapolis was planned. Mr Ramos, 38, appeared in court via video link to be charged with five counts of first-degree murder.

He allegedly hunted for victims and sprayed the newsroom with gunfire as journalists hid under their desks and pleaded for help on social media. Prosecutor Wes Adams said during Friday's news conference: ""We brought to the judge's attention the evidence that suggested a co-ordinated attack.

Mr Adams said Mr Ramos had ""entered through the front door and worked his way through the office"". He also said there was ""one victim who attempted to escape through the backdoor and was shot at that point"". The victims were Wendi Winters, 65, editor and community reporter; Rebecca Smith, 34, sales assistant; Robert Hiaasen, 59, assistant editor and columnist; Gerald Fischman, 61, editorial writer; and John McNamara, 56, reporter and editor. Two other people were hurt by broken glass, said police. A woman who knew some of the dead stands before a makeshift memorial to victims of the Capital Gazette newspaper attack Investigators say he had a ""long-standing grievance"" with the newspaper. He sued the Gazette for defamation over a 2011 column that reported on his guilty plea to criminal harassment of a former high school classmate on Facebook. He lost the lawsuit in 2013. In the harassment case, he was reportedly spared jail time and ordered to get therapy. Police said on Friday the defendant had made threatening comments online in May 2013 against the Gazette. But the newspaper declined to pursue charges, not wishing to ""exacerbate"" the situation, said investigators. The woman who said she was stalked by himtold Baltimore's WBAL,externalshe had warned a former police official years ago the suspect ""will be your next mass shooter"". She added: ""He's a [expletive] nut job."" The accused became ""fixated"" with her for no apparent reason, she said, causing her to move three times, change her name and sleep with a gun. The Capital Gazette staff worked through the tragedy, publishing a newspaper for circulation by the following morning On Friday, Anne Arundel County police chief Timothy Altomare said authorities had found evidence at Mr Ramos' residence ""showing the origination of planning"" for the attack. He was asked by reporters how the suspect was able to buy a 12-gauge shotgun despite having been found guilty of harassment. Mr Altomare said only those convicted of serious crimes and certain misdemeanours were banned from buying guns in Maryland. Police said they used facial recognition technology from the Maryland Image Repository System to identify Mr Ramos. Maryland is one of several US states that provides the FBI with access to its drivers' licences, police mug shots and other prison records. Despite falling victim to one of the deadliest attacks on journalists in US history, the Capital Gazette staff worked through the tragedy, publishing a newspaper for circulation by the following morning. The newspaper's editors left the editorial page blank with a note saying they were speechless. Photographs widely shared on social media showed Gazette reporters working on laptops in a parking garage to produce Friday's edition. The newspaper was one of the first to publish the Declaration of Independence in July 1776, though the report appeared on page two because local news always leads its editions, according to the Baltimore Sun.

"Brexit is not the main event in Brussels Brussels is hot and sticky. Brexit is not the main event. And the prime minister does not have an enormous amount that is new to say until she has cracked her cabinet's heads together next week, after which, Number 10 promises that they'll give out a lot more detail. But it feels like a familiar and frustrating routine on all sides. Eight times Theresa May has arrived at a Brussels summit as prime minister. And it feels like, on each occasion, her counterparts have urged her to provide proper detail of what she wants life outside the EU to be like. Brexit talks to move faster, says May Merkel: Defining moment for EU on migration MPs demand five days to debate Brexit deal It's a broken record and its scratches give everyone earache. But this was the summit by which the deal was more or less meant to be done. The political agreement is scheduled to be done in October, and the UK - by its own admission - is still discussing different options. With only four months left to untangle 40 years of cooperation, the frustration around the continent is more obvious than ever. The Irish leader Leo Varadkar even suggested to the BBC that the UK still refuses to understand the fundamentals - that departure has to mean fewer benefits for Britain. This video can not be played Brexit: No cherry picking, no cake-and-eat-it, says Leo Varadkar He told me that the UK government still has to grasp the ""basics"" that it would ""not be a relationship of equals"". Theresa May of course acknowledges that the partnership will be different but, politically, she is a million miles away from being able to agree with such a statement, even if she were willing. Instead the UK is eager for the EU to become more flexible. To move away from what the government regards as a rigid approach from the EU Commission. At dinner on Thursday night there's a chance for her to persuade the other leaders to loosen that approach. Only they can tell their negotiators to ease up on their red lines. In return for that request, she'll promise tonight that the UK will be able to agree on its blueprint for the future relationship between the UK and EU, at a meeting of her cabinet next week. With almost daily skirmishes at home - that could prove optimistic. The UK feels lonely and frustrated here today. The migration crisis dominates the agenda, Brexit feels an annoyance, not a priority. But unblocking the process here, means cooling the Tory wars at home. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told me that the EU could not go on dealing with a split cabinet. To make progress here, the prime minister needs first to make a deal at home. By anyone's definition, this is not a fun summit for the UK.

"David Badillo from the London Fire Brigade has been giving evidence to the public inquiry A firefighter has broken down in tears recalling a ""personal rescue mission"" to save a 12-year-old from the 20th floor of the Grenfell Tower. David Badillo never found Jessica Urbano Ramirez and the schoolgirl died in the blaze. Jessica had in fact fled to the top floor, but this message was not passed on to Mr Badillo, an inquiry heard. Asked what he would have done had he been told Jessica was on the 23rd floor, he said: ""I would have gone up"". Mr Badillo was among the first fire crew members to arrive at Grenfell Tower on 14 June. A woman had stopped Mr Badillo telling him her sister was inside the tower, before giving him the keys to their flat. Struggling to hold back tears, Mr Badillo told the inquiry: ""She said that her sister was 12-years-old, called Jessica, and in the flat alone. The lady asked me if she could come up with me to get her."" Initially he went up to flat 176 alone without breathing equipment but could not get further than floor 15, where he was met by thick black smoke. He told the inquiry he thought: ""I'm in trouble here"". The Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast with Eddie Mair: Friday Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal What happened at Grenfell Tower Visual guide to the fire Mr Badillo was asked by Richard Millett QC: ""Was it right to say you were on a personal rescue mission?"" ""Yes"" he replied. ""It's a little 12-year-old girl on her own and I just wanted to get her out."" The inquiry was shown a CCTV image of David Badillo entering a lift in Grenfell Tower on the night of the fire as he attempted to reach Jessica Urbano Ramirez On the second attempt - now equipped with breathing apparatus and accompanied by a colleague - Mr Badillo reached floor 20 by stairs and found the flat where Jessica lived. In his written statement, he described entering the smoke-logged rooms. ""I checked all of the typical hiding places - under the bed and in the cupboards, but did not find anyone,"" Mr Badillo wrote. ""We were shouting out and searching by stamping and sweeping to feel our way round, using our torches."" Satisfied no one was in there and having found the front door ajar, they decided that Jessica had got out . However the inquiry heard that Jessica had been on the phone to the fire brigade's 999 service, after walking up three floors. Mr Badillo said he did not know this. The firefighter was asked if he had knocked on the door of flat 175 - the flat next to Jessica's - or shouted to alert those inside. He replied that he had not. ""To the family of those people in flat 175, I was looking for another girl and I didn't know anyone was in there,"" he said, his voice breaking. Four people died from flat 175 - Farah Hamdan, her husband Omar Belkadi and children Malak and Leena. Mr Badillo also told the inquiry that during this sort of incident ""you would expect heavy radio traffic"". However he said he could hear ""nothing at all"" from the handheld radios he and his colleagues carried. In earlier evidence, Mr Badillo described the communication sets and radios as ""uselessâ¦ like something from the dark ages"". ""The higher you go up the building the less reliable it is, to the point of nothing at all,"" he added. In his written statement, Mr Badillo said he felt that ""radio communications failed"" on the night of the fire. Mr Badillo's evidence concludes the sixth week of the inquiry, which continues on Monday when more firefighters will give evidence.

"This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? Secure centres for migrants may be set up in EU states to process asylum claims under a deal reached after marathon talks at a summit in Brussels. Thecontrolled centres would be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis,externaland migrants whose claims were rejected would be ""returned"". Refugees could be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them. The deal follows weeks of diplomatic wrangling over migrant rescue ships, and which country should take them in. Coastguard officials said on Friday that around 100 people were thought to have drowned off the Libyan coast, with 14 rescued. They were found in waters to the east of the capital, Tripoli. Gruelling migration talks end in draw Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? There were no details on which countries might set up the secure centres or take in refugees, but French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants first arrived in the EU. ""We have struck the right balance between responsibility and solidarity,"" he said. Numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their 2015 peak, the European Council says. Italy - the entry point for thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - had threatened to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not receive help. ""After this European summit, Europe is more responsible and offers more solidarity,"" said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. ""Today Italy is no longer alone."" Other leaders struck a more cautious note. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done to resolve disagreements. And European Council President Donald Tusk said it was ""too early to talk about a success"". ""We have managed to reach an agreement in the European Council. But this is in fact the easiest part of the task, compared to what awaits us on the ground when we start implementing it,"" he told a news conference. By Adam Fleming, BBC News, Brussels A few things stand out as wins for Italy's new prime minister. The summit's conclusions now include a statement about the need for boats that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to respect international law. But the big one is approval of the concept of closed, secure processing facilities for migrants arriving in the EU. Some say this will make it easier to send back people whose claims for asylum are rejected. Others are already describing them as prisons. This paragraph is full of caveats, commas and sub-clauses - all the hallmarks of something drafted in the middle of the night. Another striking pledge is for an ambitious partnership with Africa. That's the EU trying to balance its tough internal approach with a friendly external one, and offering incentives to North African countries to host facilities where migrants can be assessed for resettlement in Europe. The 28 EU leaders also agreed several other measures,external: strengthening external border controls, and boosting financing for Turkey and countries in North Africa exploring the possibility of ""regional disembarkation platforms"", aimed at breaking the business model of  people-smuggling gangs by processing refugees and migrants outside the EU. However getting North African countries to host such centres could be very difficult and Morocco again on Thursday rejected the idea internal measures taken by member states to stop migrants moving within the EU, which the agreement said undermined asylum policy and the border-free Schengen travel area more investment in Africa to help the continent achieve a ""substantial socio-economic transformation"" so people no longer leave for a better life further work to reform EU asylum policy, including changes to the so-called Dublin regulation under which migrants must be considered for asylum in the first safe country where they arrive Mr Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the joint communiquÃ© until the leaders had settled the migration issue. Both Italy and Greece want other countries to share the burden. However several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the migration issue could be a defining moment for the EU - but she also needed the summit to avert a political crisis at home that could bring down her government. This video can not be played Migrant crisis: EU border force Frontex explained Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, had given her a deadline of this weekend. He has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere from the border in his home state. European press says migrant deal 'fragile' Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migrant mutiny Trapped in a country everyone wants to leave Without the CSU, Mrs Merkel would lose her parliamentary majority. After the talks, she acknowledged the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"". About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says. More than a million people arrived in 2015. This month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight. Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? 'Used as a slave' in a Libyan detention centre The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take some of the migrants on board. Malta said Norway had now also agreed to take a share. Medical charity Medecins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) branded the new EU deal inhumane. ""The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping - and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations,"" MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said.

"EastEnders star Danny Dyer has revealed he's struggled with his daughter Dani appearing on Love Island. ""I didn't want her to do it. I'd never seen it before... you fear it as a father,"" he said on a special evening edition of Good Morning Britain. Dyer also lashed out at former Prime Minister David Cameron's role in the Brexit referendum. ""How come he can scuttle off?"" he said. ""He brought all this on. Where is he? He's in Nice, with his trotters up."" He added: ""Where is the geezer? I think he should be held accountable for it."" Dyer was also asked by Susanna Reid how he felt watching his daughter ""being seduced on national television"". ""It's a nutty thing,"" he said about the ITV2 reality programme. ""It is what it is. It's a game show."" He added: ""Fifty grand's at stake - that's a lot of dough. And Dani's gonna win it."" Dani Dyer (in pink bikini) has not ""put a foot wrong"" according to her Dad The show sees a group of ""sexy singletons"" try to couple up and convince the public to keep them on the island, in order to win the big prize. Dyer told Reid's Good Evening Britain co-presenter Piers Morgan, who has openly criticised the show for several weeks, that his daughter has not ""put a foot wrong"". 12 new singletons to enter Love Island Love Island 'needs to offer more aftercare' Susanna Reid in 'constant battle' with Piers Morgan ""I did struggle at first, it was difficult,"" he said. ""But as it's gone on, I think what she's done is she's proved with this reality TV thing that actually you can be a decent girl, with self-respect, dignity, not be rolling under the bedsheets, still have respect off the man and be loved and adored by young people."" Danny Dyer has played the role of Mick Carter in EastEnders since 2013 Morgan asked Dyer about his daughter's career and whether he would have preferred it if she had ""done it the hard yards way, gone to drama school, learned the craft?"" Dyer responded by saying: ""She's a talented actress. I've had my moments with reality TV as well, and it is an instant thing at the moment. It is a career. ""Some of these young kids, they can't be bothered with that real struggle, that rejection in acting, it's a tough thing, and so why not go and try and do something like this Love Island? Everyone's talking about it. She can earn loads of money and crack right on. ""So who am I to judge? Get hold of that Piers, eat it!"" he said, prompting laughter from Morgan. Morgan responded by saying: ""We won't agree on Love Island, but I understand your paternal concern for your daughter."" Dyer added that Dani's new boyfriend on the show, Jack Fincham, ""seems like a good kid"". Wednesday's episode was ITV2's most-watched programme ever, peaking at 3.4 million viewers, with an audience share of 15.8%, according to ITV's spokesman. These figures are up by 1.3 million compared with last year's equivalent episode. Morgan and Reid made a rare evening TV appearance together Good Evening Britain - broadcast at the same time as Love Island - was aired on ITV just after England were beaten 1-0 by Belgium in the World Cup. Other guests on the show included Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, actress Pamela Anderson, boxer Amir Khan, former politician Ed Balls and comic Daliso Chaponda. Piers Morgan claimed a ratings victory, thanking viewers for ""restoring his faith in humanity"" by tuning in. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Good Evening Britain peaked at 5.2m viewers last night, smashing Love Island which peaked at just 3.6m. Thanks for watching!""he tweeted,external. However, the audience trailed off sharply as the show went on, and average audiences tell a different story. Love Island reached an average of 3.116m viewers across the whole show, compared with Good Evening Britain's 3.103m - a difference of 13,000. Both figures were dwarfed by the average audience for England's third World Cup match, which came to just over 13 million. BBC News entertainment correspondent Lizo Mzimba Certainly when it comes to the average number of viewers, which is the standard benchmark, Love Island just edged ahead of Good Evening Britain. But is it true that GEB had a peak of 5.2 million viewers? Almost certainly not. After the England vs Belgium final whistle, the number of ITV viewers was plummeting rapidly throughout the post-match coverage from a high of 14.6 million. Something that unsurprisingly continued when that came off air at 21:15 BST with adverts then kicking in. 5.2 million is the average number of viewers who were watching the channel between 21:15 and 21:20. GEB is advertised as starting at 21:15 but didn't actually begin until after 21:19, so the number of people watching the first minute of the show is almost certainly lower than the figure of 5.2 million, with the opening titles likely to be the most popular part of the programme at just under 5 million. That's still more than the Love Island peak of 3.6 million. But whereas millions of viewers flocked to Love Island as soon as it started and stayed with it, Good Evening Britain inherited an already large, declining audience, and continued that trend. By the time it came off air, GEB had lost close to 70% of the audience it started with. The one-off special was definitely a winner on social media, though, and Danny Dyer's take on Brexit has gone viral. One online video of his comments has racked up 4.5 million views, ensuring the show is reaching even more eyeballs and getting people talking.

"Accountancy giant PwC is doing away with landlines at office desks, with all staff expected to only use mobiles by the end of the summer. The company, which has 24 offices in the UK employing about 18,000 staff, said the switch to mobiles would be ""more efficient"". A few landlines will remain for security to use, and in rooms used for client meetings and at reception. Meeting rooms will use new conferencing technology that can connect to mobiles. ""We already equip all of our people with a mobile phone, and many had already moved away from using their landlines,"" a spokesman for PwC said. ""With landline usage falling rapidly, we believe that a more mobile-focused policy is a more efficient way of working."" Some small businesses have abandoned fixed-line phones in favour of mobiles in recent years, but PwC's move is one of the first examples of a large organisation doing so. It comes amid a steep decline in landline use by business. In 2010, businesses in the UK had more than 10 million landline numbers. However, that number had fallen 35% to just 6.4 million by the end of last year,according to Ofcom.,external The amount of time businesses spent talking on landlines has dropped even more dramatically. In 2010, businesses logged almost 38 million minutes of calls, but that has halved to 18.8 million in 2017. Residential use of landlines is also in decline. In 2010 UK households made more than 90 million minutes of phone calls, but that had fallen to almost 35 million minutes by last year. However, most homes need a landline for broadband, so the number of residential lines has actually increased since 2010. ""Because of the pricing structure most people have to have a landline to get broadband - but younger people often don't even plug in a handset,"" points out James Barford, a telecoms analyst at Enders Analysis. Earlier this year, BT was forced to cut the cost of a landline by Â£7 a month for customers that only had a landline. The price cut came about following a regulatory investigation by telecoms watchdog Ofcom. It found that although landline rental prices had increased significantly, the cost of providing the services had dropped by more than a quarter. Ofcom said the hardest hit by the rises were customers, many of them elderly, who had never switched from BT.

"Tesco is testing whether supermarket customers can buy products without visiting a till. The UK's biggest retailer has given some staff a smartphone app to use at a store at the company's headquarters. They use the app to scan barcodes on the products they want and then pay, with no trip to a till needed. Co-op is experimenting with similar technology andAmazon already has a checkout-freegrocery store in Seattle that is open to the public. Tesco says its experiment is at a very early stage. It is concerned that checkout-free stores might be a target for shoplifters and, as it operates on very fine profit margins, that could make the technology unviable. ""If the margin in the business is 2 or 3%, you don't have to lose much to make it unprofitable,"" said chief executive Dave Lewis. Given Tesco's size, if it did adopt the technology it would be significant advance for checkout-free shopping. Amazon's supermarket with no checkouts Tesco says growth 'on track' Co-op is also experimenting with a smartphone app that would eliminate the need to visit a till. It is running a trial at a store in Manchester and will expand those tests over the summer. However, retail experts are not convinced that grocers can make big savings from the technology. ""Recent stories about the level of theft at self-service checkouts - something that we've had for around 10 years in retail - leaves me to wonder about the obvious savings in checkout-free stores versus a hidden cost in terms of theft,"" said independent retail analyst Steve Dresser. ""However, you always follow the customer as a retailer. It has always been clear that customers want as little hassle as possible."" Amazon's store in Seattle has a more sophisticated system.

"What makes the perfect World Cup penalty? Who has the best record from the spot? And does luck really come into it? As the tournament enters the knockout phase we have a look at the history of World Cup shootouts, 26 of which have taken place since they were introduced in 1978 - though none were needed in Argentina that year. Of the 240 kicks at World Cup penalty shootouts before the 2018 tournament in Russia, 170 were scored - a conversion rate of just over seven out of 10. Of the successful penalties, the most popular location is low and to the keeper's left, according to data from football experts Opta. The worst penalty to take is low and in the middle area of the goal, with a success rate of only 58%. If a player does decide to hit his penalty straight down the middle, aiming high is the answer. No goalkeeper has saved any of the 15 World Cup shootout penalties struck high and centrally. In fact going for the top part of the goal is generally a good strategy, as Harry Kane demonstrated inEngland's group game against Panama, blasting both his kicks into the top left corner of the net. Opta's data shows that over 90% of penalties struck high and either side of the centre of the goal have been scored. But that approach carries with it the risk of missing the target altogether, as Italian forward Roberto Baggio discovered in the 1994 final,blazing his kick over the barto hand Brazil victory. Only about one in five penalties have actually been saved - 49 out of 240 attempts - with 28 goalkeepers responsible for those saves. The penalties saved have been shared almost equally to either side of the keeper, with 24 saves made diving to the left and 25 to the right. Twelve strikes have hit a post or the crossbar. With defending champions Germany eliminated in the opening stage for the first time since 1938, Russia 2018 is without the most successful penalty shootout team. Only one German, Uli Stielike in the competition's first shootout between West Germany and France in a 1982 semi-final, has ever missed in a penalty competition at a World Cup. Since then, Germany have scored 15 in a row and won all four shootouts they've been involved in. But given Germany's early exit, Argentina could overtake them as the nation with the most shootout victories. Lionel Messi may have missed from the spot against Iceland in the group stages, but his countrymen have a good record in shootouts, notching up four wins from five attempts. Their only loss came in 2006 to - surprise, surprise - Germany. At the opposite end of the scale, England have the worst record, something that will hardly come as a shock to anyone who has followed the national side. The Three Lions have lost all three of the shootouts they've been involved in, converting just seven of their 12 spot-kicks at World Cups. England's penalty defeat at the hands of Portugal in 2006 was one of the worst in terms of the percentage of penalties scored. The two sides managed to score only four spot-kicks between them out of a total of nine attempted. In that game, Portugal's keeper Ricardo saved three kicks, the most in a single shootout. Argentina's Sergio Goycochea and Germany's Harald Schumacher hold the record overall, having stopped four each. Mexico are another side with a poor record from 12 yards, having lost both their shootouts. Switzerland have arguably an even more ignominious record. They are the only team to have taken part in a World Cup penalty shootout and failed to score a single kick. Of the sides that have made it to the last 16 this time round, hosts Russia, Denmark, Croatia and Colombia have never been involved in a World Cup penalty shootout... yet. The penalty shootout is often referred to as a lottery, and luck actually comes into play even before the first player has struck the ball. As the current system stands, teams take turns in a shootout, with the choice of who goes first decided by a coin toss. Team A goes first, then team B, then team A again and so on. The side that wins the coin toss and decides to go first has an important advantage, with teams going first having triumphed 60% of the time. Researchers from the London School of Economics blamed the psychological pressure of 'lagging behind' for affecting performance. Teams going second in World Cup penalty shootouts have a 69% conversion rate, whereas the team going first have a 73% record. TheEnglish Football League has experimented with a new ABBAformat to try to address this. With this format, after an initial spot-kick, teams each take pairs of kicks in an attempt to reduce the pressure on the side taking the second kick in a shootout - but it will not be used at this World Cup. Penalties taken in a shootout are less likely to find the back of the net than those taken in regular play, according to research by Ben Lyttleton, football writer and author of a book on penalties. Lyttleton found that the conversion rate for penalties in open play in international tournaments and national cup competitions in England, Germany, Italy, Spain and the Netherlands over a 10-year period was 78%, compared with 74% in shootouts in the same competitions. Other than the additional pressure a shootout brings, this is potentially explained by the fact that players who may not be regular penalty-takers have to step up. And the pressure seems only to ramp up once the sequence gets under way. Historically the eighth penalty - of the scheduled first 10 - is the one that is missed most often in a World Cup shootout, with two out of every five attempts ending in a save or a miss. And if there is no winner after each side have taken five penalties, the shootout goes to sudden death, with pairs of penalties taken until one of the teams scores and the other doesn't. But that has happened only twice in a World Cup - in that first ever shootout in 1982 and in Sweden's quarter-final victory over Romania in the USA in 1994.

"The sizzling weather is expected to last over the weekend and into the following week One of the UK's largest water firms is warning people to conserve supplies as it makes emergency deliveries during the heatwave. Severn Trent said homes in Shropshire, Staffordshire and Derbyshire had been temporarily without water as demand has outstripped supply across its network. United Utilities said it could bring in a hose pipe ban if people do not limit their water usage over the weekend. Supplier tips include swapping baths for showers and avoiding washing cars. North West supplier United Utilities said the hose pipe ban may be introduced on Monday unless consumers cut the amount of water they use by at least 5%. During the heatwave, the company doubled the amount of extra water it was putting into the system to 500m litres, though the North West is currently using 2.2 billion litres a day.

However, Severn Trent said reservoir levels remained plentiful and it does not foresee a hosepipe ban in the coming weeks. ""With the region still basking in the hottest June for 40 years, demand for water has increased massively and, while Severn Trent has ramped up production at its treatment works, it still needs its customers to consider how they're using water,"" a spokesman said.

"Debate over the future of ATMs in the UK has intensified ahead of a cut in the fee operators receive from banks. From Sunday, the fee paid each time a cash machine is used will be cut, with further reductions due each year until 2021. Link, which oversees cash machines, has argued that the move is vital for the sustainability of the network. Consumer group Which? claims that 300 ATMs are closing a month, but that analysis is disputed by Link. Convenience stores and the ATM industry have also expressed concerns about cash machines disappearing. The fee paid to operators, known as the interchange rate, will be reduced from 25p to 20p per withdrawal. This change will be made over the course of four years, starting on Sunday. However, the fee will be unchanged for free-to-use ATMs which are 1km or more from the next nearest cash machine. Those in remote locations could receive an extra subsidy, particularly if they are threatened with closure. The Association of Convenience Stores has calculated that the change could mean a decline in income of between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 a year for some small stores that operate machines, at a time when they already face other financial pressures. There are two pressing issues, according to Link - which oversees the UK's network of machines but does not run them itself. The first is that consumers are moving away from cash payments to card, contactless, and smartphone-based payments. Recent figures from the UK's banks showed that more transactions were made by debit cards than by cash last year. Who do we trust after cash? The High Streets with 'too many' ATMs The second is that cash machines are clustered in city and town centres. Link argues that changing the fee structure would effectively make it just as lucrative to run a machine in a rural or less affluent area as in a town centre - so would even-out the spread of ATMs. The sustainability of the network would be improved, it said, as there would no longer be lots of ATMs in city centres where consumers were more likely to pay with cards or smartphones rather than cash. There is no obvious impact on the cost of using a cash machine, the vast majority of which do not charge individuals for use. Over the longer-term, there is a debate over whether the changes will affect consumers' access to cash, particularly in more remote areas where cash use is higher. Consumer group Which? and operators say there needs to be more scrutiny of the changes - particularly by the payments regulator. They argue that the changes made by Link is leading to cash machines disappearing and operators leaving the UK, hitting everyone who relies on cash - including those in rural areas. Ron Delnevo, of the ATM Industry Association, suggested that hundreds of the machines had been removed already and installations cancelled ""at a much faster rate than complacent observers expected"". Which? said it had analysed Link's figures and suggested that almost 1,500 machines closed between November last year and April, which it said was a near six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015. The investigation suggested that machines in rural communities were at least as badly hit as urban areas  - down 2.1% and 2% respectively - across the UK at a time when more bank branch closures were being announced. However, Link disputed the analysis. It said: ""Which? has suggested that ATMs have fallen by 1,500 in the period between November 2017 and March 2018, however, Link can confirm that during this period the number of free-to-use ATMs actually increased."" That said, its own more up-to-date published figures shows that there were 388 fewer free-to-use ATMs in the UK in June than there were in December.

"Mr Tusk said the ""most difficult"" issues were as yet unresolved Donald Tusk has issued a ""last call"" to the UK to ""lay the cards on the table"" if a Brexit deal is to be done in time. The European Council president said the ""most difficult"" issues were unresolved and ""quick progress"" was needed if agreement was to be reached by October. Talks continue over the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU in March next year. What happens to the Irish border remains a sticking point. The UK says both sides want to see a ""faster pace"" in talks. But Prime Minister Theresa May has been unable to say much new at this summit - the last one before October - because she has yet to get her cabinet to agree on a blueprint for the UK's future relationship with the EU. Laura Kuenssberg: Can May persuade EU to relax its red lines? EU reaches migration deal in crunch talks Tetchy tit-for-tat at the Brexit summit They are due to meet at Chequers next Friday, in what has been billed as a make-or-break meeting. Mrs May has said the UK will then publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail what strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"". Chancellor Angela Merkel said Mrs May would ""come to Germany and we will have a longer debate on this"", once the proposals were published. At the close of the summit, Mr Tusk told reporters there was a ""great deal of work ahead"" on Brexit and the ""most difficult tasks are still unresolved"". ""Quick progress"" was needed if a deal was to be reached at the next summit. ""This is the last call to lay the cards on the table,"" he said. This video can not be played Juncker: May will resolve Brexit splits By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg European leaders can repeat the same message, louder and louder. But this EU summit's instructions to Theresa May may as well have been shouted into an empty cupboard. Because they know what she knows - that the past 24 hours of Brexit conversations are not nearly as important as the next seven days of discussions at home between Number 10 and the rest of the government. And after more than two years, this time next week ministers should be nearing the conclusion of their country retreat at Chequers. It's there that the prime minister hopes to find resolution in her team on a more detailed offer to the rest of the EU - easing, if not removing, all the contradictions in the Tories' positions. Read Laura's full blog He was one of a string of EU chiefs demanding more clarity from the UK prime minister, who left the summit before the 27 other EU leaders discussed Brexit together on Friday. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the British had to ""make clear their position"" adding: ""We cannot go on to live with a split cabinet. They have to say what they want and we will respond to that."" Reality check: The Brexit challenge for Irish trade Bank warning for EU over Brexit progress EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier warned: ""The time is very short"" and that while progress had been made, ""huge and serious divergence remains, in particular on Ireland and Northern Ireland"". He also said he hoped to see ""workable and realistic"" proposals from the UK on what the future relationship between the UK and EU should look like. He said he was ""ready to invite the UK delegation to come back to Brussels next Monday"" to continue working on a deal. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood that UK officials had already informed the EU Commission they would not hold talks on Monday and the ""mini row over diaries"" revealed ""how tetchy things are"".

Talks between Spain and the UK over Gibraltar, including access to its airport and the exchange of tax information, continue. They also expressed concern that ""no substantial progress has yet been achieved on agreeing a backstop solution for Ireland/Northern Ireland"", if a deal on customs arrangements is not agreed by December 2020. when the transition period is due to end. And they called on member states and EU institutions ""to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes"" - the European Commission president has said the EU must prepare for the possibility that no Brexit deal will be reached. Mrs May's own cabinet is divided over what the UK's customs arrangements after December 2020 should look like, when the transition period agreed with the EU is due to end.

On Thursday, Mrs May said a strong future partnership with the EU was in everyone's interests. ""I think both sides are keen to continue that work at a faster pace than we have done up till now and certainly we would welcome that,"" she said. She added that the UK would publish a White Paper setting out ""in more detail [the] strong partnership the United Kingdom wants to see with the European Union in the future"". But she urged fellow EU leaders to tell their negotiators the UK should be allowed to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System. Without UK participation in such schemes, she suggested their collective ability to fight terrorism would be reduced. Mrs May's Europe adviser Olly Robbins and Brexit Secretary David Davis were due to appear in front of the UK's Brexit select committee next week but it is understood that the appearance has been delayed until after the publication of the White Paper. Former Brexit minister Lord Bridges, who backed Remain in the EU referendum,told the Evening Standard,externalthere was a risk negotiations could become a ""rout"", if the cabinet could not compromise, first with each other, then with Europe. ""If nothing changes, there's a danger the UK will have to agree to a withdrawal treaty full of meaningless waffle on our future relationship with the EU,"" warned Lord Bridges. ""With so little leverage in the next phase, the negotiations would become a rout. Worse, uncertainty will drag on, damaging our economy.""

"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Best goals of the group stage The World Cup group stages have come to an end - with enough memorable storylines to last for a lifetime. Germany were knocked outof the first round for the first time since 1938 after conceding twice in injury time to South Korea. That was after Toni Kroos' dramatic 95th-minute strike in their previous in their previous game to give them hope. We hadXherdan Shaqiri's last-minute winner- and political celebration - for Switzerland against Serbia, andCristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick against Spain- who sacked their manager the day before the World Cup started. HostsRussia thrashed Saudi Arabia 5-0in a near-record-breaking opening game. Argentina looked like they were going out after two matches - only to go through thanks to a late Marcos Rojo volley. England's Harry Kane scored five goals in his opening two games, including a last-minute winnerand a hat-trick,while Brazil launched their campaign proper with an injury-time salvage job against Costa Rica. And let us not forget Milad Mohammadi's throw-in for Iran against Spain, which went viral. It feels like one of the most exciting World Cup group stages - but do the numbers back it up? We had a look to see how it compares to every World Cup since 1998 when the tournament grew to 32 teams. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Cost Rica score as every nation finds the back of the net This World Cup has a way to go before it can match the abundance of goals scored in France in 1998 and Brazil in 2014. In fact, as the below graphic shows, only in 2006 and 2010 have fewer goals been scored during the group stages of a 32-team World Cup. However, Russia 2018 has thus far been about quality, not quantity. The tone was set by the first game of the tournament, with hosts Russia smashing five goals past poor Saudi Arabia. A day later, Portugal and Spain served up six goals between them in a gripping 3-3 draw in Sochi. This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Portugal 3-3 Spain - watch all six goals in under a minute Since then, Belgium and England have dished out hammerings of their own,5-2 against Tunisiaand 6-1 versus Panama respectively. Only two previous 32-team World Cups have had more than four games containing five goals, as you can see from this... This video can not be played 'Brilliant' Rojo volley sends Argentina through The group stages of Russia 2018 have been characterised by late drama, with twists and turns aplenty throughout the 48 games. Ronaldo set the tone with his free-kick to salvage Portugal a 3-3 draw with Spain. Since then, we've had Kane's headed winner against Tunisia, Shaqiri's strike for Serbia against Switzerland, Brazil's injury-time double versus Costa Rica, the crazy VAR-influenced conclusion to Group B, Rojo's rescue job for Argentina, all building to the peak moment when holders Germany crashed out. This World Cup is already closing in on the previous five tournaments for goals scored from the 80th minute onwards in games, as you can see below... This video can not be played World Cup 2018: England 6-1 Panama highlights Some of the world's top goalscorer's have hit form fast in Russia: Kane, Romelu Lukaku, Ronaldo, John Stones. Once again, Ronaldo got the ball rolling (well, travelling at speed), scoring a hat-trick in Portugal's opening game - including that stunning last-minute free-kick - to claim a 3-3 draw with Spain. Not to be outshone, Lukaku and Kane bagged a double each in their own opening games for Belgium and England respectively, before the latter went one better with a hat-trick in his side's 6-1 demolition of Panama. So prolific has Tottenham's Kane been that his tally of five goals so far would already be enough to secure a share of the Golden Boot in two of the previous five tournaments, as this shows: France enjoyed almost 70% of the possession but were unable to find a way through against Denmark It has felt like teams have gone into the group stages of this World Cup with positive intent, something born out in the scarcity of limp, uneventful goalless draws. Russia represents the longest we have gone in a 32-team version of the tournament before the first 0-0, whenFrance and Denmark strolled their way to a pedestrian stalematefor which they were booed off by the crowd at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium. If it wasn't for that abject final Group C game we'd still be waiting for a 0-0 in Russia. This video can not be played Where's Neuer gone? South Korea score second as keeper goes AWOL Germany's failure to qualify from the group stage continues an amazing run of shock exits for teams looking to defend their world title. The elimination of Joachim Low's side was sealed in extraordinary circumstances. Four days on from Kroos' 95th-minute free-kick winner against Sweden, South Korea - previously without a point in the competition - scored twice late on to send the Swedes and Mexico through and Germany home.

The introduction of VAR (video assistant referees) has added to the excitement of this World Cup, bringing drama to games where there may otherwise have been none. The new technology has certainly had an impact at both ends of the pitch, contributing to more penalties having been awarded in the group stages in Russia than in the entirety of any of the previous 32-team World Cups, as illustrated in the below graphic. There have been 24 penalties awarded during the group stage of Russia 2018, already more than in all of the previous five completed tournaments Love it or hate it, you can't deny that VAR has kept things interesting.

Fellow broadcaster Clare Baldingtweeted her appreciation for Gracie,external, saying: ""To donate all of the agreed backpay confirms what we already knew - she is not fighting the fight for herself but for ALL."" At her request, Gracie will now take up to six months of unpaid leave and will take on writing and speaking engagements about both China and gender equality.

""That really matters to me, and I want us to lead the way."" When she resigned as China editor, Gracie said she had been dismayed to find the BBC's two male international editors earned ""at least 50% more"" than their two female counterparts. The BBC has now acknowledged she was told she would be paid in line with the North America editor when she took the role, and she accepted the role on that understanding. The BBC has said ""fairness in pay"" is ""vital"" The corporation said it ""has now put this right"".

At base, today marks a moral and practical victory for an effective campaigner, and her donation of back pay to the Fawcett Society proves she meant it when she said this was about a principle rather than cash. The narrow question is - what this means for the BBC. The corporation would like it to draw the matter to a close, and pointedly refers in its statement to the ""specific circumstances"" of her case. While today might bring a close to this individual case, it is of course unclear what impact it will have on others at the BBC who are pursuing grievances. The same applies beyond the BBC. As a significant victory for a high-profile campaigner, who came to have totemic status, today will give encouragement to others who have been denied equal pay for equal work.

"Mrs May left the summit on Friday morning Forcing the UK to leave EU security pacts after Brexit risks the safety of EU and UK citizens, Theresa May has warned European leaders. The UK says EU negotiators are blocking agreement on tracking terrorists and sharing information after March 2019. The EU says as a ""third country"" the UK cannot have the same access to schemes. The EU's chief negotiator said they wanted an ""ambitious"" deal on trade and security but it must be based on ""our  values and principles"". Michel Barnier also warned that ""huge and serious divergence remains"" in Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU and urged the UK to bring forward ""workable and realistic proposals"" for their future relationship. ""The time is short and I am ready to invite the UK delegation to come back to Brussels next Monday,"" he said. Theresa May addressed fellow leaders at a dinner on Thursday night, during the final European Council meeting before October, when both sides hope they will have reached agreement on the UK's withdrawal and a blueprint for its future relationship with the EU. The talks, which stretched into the early hours of Friday, were dominated by the issue of migration, amid a threat from Italy to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not get more help. EU reaches migration deal in crunch talks Bank warning for EU over Brexit progress Brexit date could be delayed, says Blair Mrs May left Brussels on Friday morning and Brexit will be discussed by the remaining EU leaders without her. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg saidthe prime minister had hoped to use the dinner to persuade them it was time to adopt a more flexible approach in negotiations. Italian PM Giuseppe Conte had threatened to veto the summit's agenda if Italy did not get help According to UK officials, Mrs May said EU leaders should tell their negotiators to allow the UK to continue to take part in schemes like the Prum mechanism for sharing DNA profiles, the Second Generation Schengen Information System - a database of ""real time"" alerts about certain individuals - and the European Criminal Records Information System. Without UK participation in such schemes, she suggested their collective ability to fight terrorism would be reduced. ""We would no longer be able to share real-time alerts for wanted persons, including serious criminals,"" she said. ""We would be able to respond less swiftly to alerts for missing people on either side of the Channel and reunite them with their loved ones. ""Our collective ability to map terrorist networks across Europe and bring those responsible to justice would be reduced. ""That is not what I want and I do not believe it is what you want either,"" the prime minister said. She urged them to ""consider what is in the best interests of the safety of your citizens and mine and give your negotiators a mandate that will allow us to achieve this crucial objective."" This video can not be played Belgian PM Charles Michel gave Mrs May his team's shirt ahead of the World Cup clash on Thursday But the vice president of the European Parliament, Mairead McGuinness, said the focus should be on resolving the question about what happens to the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit, not security co-operation. She told BBC Newsnight: ""I am curious as to why this issue would be thrown on the table or why even a veiled threat is necessary"". ""It may not be a helpful move"". And Mr Barnier said the EU wanted an ""EU-UK ambitious partnership, on trade as well as security"" but added: ""We have to base this partnership on our values and principles, respecting also the UK red lines."" Earlier this month he said the UK would be kicked out of the European Arrest Warrant deal after Brexit - which allows EU members to request the arrest and detention of criminals in other countries without extradition talks between them. He argued it could not remain a part of it, because the UK wanted to leave the European Court of Justice and free movement rules. After ten hours of talks about migration on Thursday night, EU leaders said that new migrant centres could be set up in EU countries on a ""voluntary"" basis. Mrs May welcomed the ""positive conclusions"" reached. She said much of the agreement was ""around what the UK has been encouraging for some time, which is taking more action upstream in countries of origin so that we can ensure that people aren't having to make and aren't making these very dangerous journeys.""

"This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? Secure centres for migrants may be set up in EU states to process asylum claims under a deal reached after marathon talks at a summit in Brussels. Thecontrolled centres would be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis,externaland migrants whose claims were rejected would be ""returned"". Refugees could be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them. The deal follows weeks of diplomatic wrangling over migrant rescue ships, and which country should take them in. Coastguard officials said on Friday that around 100 people were thought to have drowned off the Libyan coast, with 14 rescued. They were found in waters to the east of the capital, Tripoli. Gruelling migration talks end in draw Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? There were no details on which countries might set up the secure centres or take in refugees, but French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants first arrived in the EU. ""We have struck the right balance between responsibility and solidarity,"" he said. Numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their 2015 peak, the European Council says. Italy - the entry point for thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - had threatened to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not receive help. ""After this European summit, Europe is more responsible and offers more solidarity,"" said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. ""Today Italy is no longer alone."" Other leaders struck a more cautious note. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done to resolve disagreements. And European Council President Donald Tusk said it was ""too early to talk about a success"". ""We have managed to reach an agreement in the European Council. But this is in fact the easiest part of the task, compared to what awaits us on the ground when we start implementing it,"" he told a news conference. By Adam Fleming, BBC News, Brussels A few things stand out as wins for Italy's new prime minister. The summit's conclusions now include a statement about the need for boats that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to respect international law. But the big one is approval of the concept of closed, secure processing facilities for migrants arriving in the EU. Some say this will make it easier to send back people whose claims for asylum are rejected. Others are already describing them as prisons. This paragraph is full of caveats, commas and sub-clauses - all the hallmarks of something drafted in the middle of the night. Another striking pledge is for an ambitious partnership with Africa. That's the EU trying to balance its tough internal approach with a friendly external one, and offering incentives to North African countries to host facilities where migrants can be assessed for resettlement in Europe. The 28 EU leaders also agreed several other measures,external: strengthening external border controls, and boosting financing for Turkey and countries in North Africa exploring the possibility of ""regional disembarkation platforms"", aimed at breaking the business model of  people-smuggling gangs by processing refugees and migrants outside the EU. However getting North African countries to host such centres could be very difficult and Morocco again on Thursday rejected the idea internal measures taken by member states to stop migrants moving within the EU, which the agreement said undermined asylum policy and the border-free Schengen travel area more investment in Africa to help the continent achieve a ""substantial socio-economic transformation"" so people no longer leave for a better life further work to reform EU asylum policy, including changes to the so-called Dublin regulation under which migrants must be considered for asylum in the first safe country where they arrive Mr Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the joint communiquÃ© until the leaders had settled the migration issue. Both Italy and Greece want other countries to share the burden. However several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the migration issue could be a defining moment for the EU - but she also needed the summit to avert a political crisis at home that could bring down her government. This video can not be played Migrant crisis: EU border force Frontex explained Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, had given her a deadline of this weekend. He has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere from the border in his home state. European press says migrant deal 'fragile' Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migrant mutiny Trapped in a country everyone wants to leave Without the CSU, Mrs Merkel would lose her parliamentary majority. After the talks, she acknowledged the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"". About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says. More than a million people arrived in 2015. This month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight. Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? 'Used as a slave' in a Libyan detention centre The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take some of the migrants on board. Malta said Norway had now also agreed to take a share. Medical charity Medecins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) branded the new EU deal inhumane. ""The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping - and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations,"" MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said.

"The splits within the EU have been highlighted by Italy's refusal to accept migrants carried by NGO rescue boats in the Mediterranean Hardened Eurosceptics might love to think the EU's in trouble, but as leaders gather in Brussels for their summer summit on Thursday, dedicated Europhiles are also sounding the alarm. ""The fragility of the EU is increasing,"" warns EU Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker. ""The cracks are growing in size."" It's been easy to get distracted this last couple of weeks by the new Italian government and its headline-grabbing rejection of NGO migrant rescue boats. But Mr Juncker is right: EU fissures go deeper and are more widespread. Migration pits southern Europe against the north. Italy and Greece smoulder with resentment at having been left alone to deal with migrant arrivals. Meanwhile, northern countries blame the south for not patrolling their Mediterranean borders better and for having, at least in the past, enabled migrants to ""slip away"" northwards towards richer Germany, Austria and Sweden. Read more from Katya:EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics? Migration slashes the EU from east to west too. Newer member states from Central and Eastern Europe never signed up to the post World War Two ""all for one and one for all"" vision. When it comes to EU solidarity and burden-sharing, they are fervent non-believers. They determinedly turn their backs when Italy and Germany plead for migrant quotas. The number of migrants arriving illegally in Europe may be down, but so is voter tolerance of the problem. The rise and rise across the EU of tough-on-migration politicians has emboldened hardliners such as Hungary's Victor Orban and Austria's Sebastian Kurz, who takes over the six-month rotating presidency of the EU this Sunday and will push migration as a top priority. ""Keep Them Out"" is Austria's main aim and while Europe's (still) most influential leader, Angela Merkel, arrives in Brussels on Thursday pushing - and praying - for compromise on burden-sharing and prevention, the number of EU leaders pushing single-mindedly on the migrant deterrence button is growing. Which brings me to the next layer of European splits provoked by migration: within national governments as well as between countries. Germany is the most dramatic example. UK told 'little time left' for Brexit deal Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migration mutiny Can the EU reach a new deal on migrants? Mrs Merkel has clearly been weakened at home by her previous open-door migrant policy. Formerly viewed as politically untouchable, the German chancellor has now been given an ultimatum by her own interior minister. ""By the end of this Brussels summit, you need to come home with a workable pan-European solution to stop irregular migrants bleeding into Germany,"" Horst Seehofer has threatened her. ""Or I will unilaterally slam Germany's borders shut."" The Austrian government told me this week it would then immediately follow suit, causing a border-closing domino effect across Europe - with a seismic impact on the EU's prize political and economic project: the open-border Schengen agreement. What a blow for Brussels and nightmare for Europe's export-king Germany that would be. Of course we're not there yet. In true European Union style, once gathered round a table here in Brussels, there will undoubtedly be emphasis on what unites rather than divides member countries. On migration, EU leaders will easily agree to beef up their Frontex border guard. This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? There's also growing convergence around the idea of setting up so-called disembarkation centres outside the EU to identify economic migrants, who in theory could be sent home. Those with a right to asylum or refugee status could then be given safe and legal passage to Europe. And there's much talk of closer co-operation (read: money) with migrant countries of origin and the transit countries (read: Libya and its coastguard) that migrants cross to make their way to people smuggler boats. But these ideas are easier to formulate than to carry out. You would need a lot of EU border guards to truly patrol southern Europe's thousands of miles of open coastline. You would need permission from African countries such as Niger and Chad to set up processing centres, for example. So far that's a distant goal. In the meantime, there is no whiff of EU agreement over what to do with migrants who do reach Europe. Which brings us back to the threat to Schengen. Italy's populist Interior Minister Matteo Salvini believes migrant reception centres should be set up in Niger, Mali, Chad and Sudan Gloomy German government sources told me they gave the project a three out of 10 chance of survival thanks to the increasingly nationalistic nature of many European governments. ""And if Schengen does fail,"" they predict, ""that would be the beginning of the end of the European Union."" It's too early really to herald the demise of the EU or even the end of Mrs Merkel's career in government as a result of this very political migrant crisis in Europe. But, as EU summit host Donald Tusk said to EU leaders on the eve of their arrival: ""The stakes are very high. And time is short."" EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics?

"Most major retailers have been banned from selling high-caffeine energy drinks to under-16s since March High-caffeine canned energy drinks are being sold in supermarkets despite a ban, a BBC investigation has found. Sales of the drinks to children under 16 have been voluntarilybanned by most major UK stores since March. A teaching union has warned they are having a detrimental effect on both the health and the attention span of pupils But the British Soft Drinks Association said there is no more caffeine in most energy drinks than in a small cup of coffee. The new code is voluntary but whenBBC Timelinetook a 15-year-old girl round eight supermarkets, half allowed her to buy an energy drink. Jane Peckham, national officer at the NASUWT teaching union, said: ""The ever-increasing consumption of caffeine through energy drinks is a concern for long-term health. ""More and more studies are showing that can lead to diabetes, hyperactivity and other such conditions. ""I think it is something that we all need to pay attention to."" Anecdotally, Ms Peckham said she has heard of pupils consuming up to seven energy drinks a day. And she said it is a problem in both primary and secondary schools. The union is calling for a total ban on energy drinks in schools. Ms Peckham added: ""Research has shown that children who consume high levels of energy drinks are much more likely to develop future negative behaviours. ""It can lead to use of tobacco, binge drinking, possibly drug use and the energy drink is the starting point for that."" The limitations concern drinks which contain more than 150mg of caffeine per litre. Jen Peckham warned energy drinks can cause health problems Timeline took Annie, 15, round eight supermarkets in Glasgow and Newton Mearns, East Renfrewshire, with mixed results. In one Glasgow store, she went to a self-service check out where the canned drink was flagged as a restricted item. Annie told the programme a staff member approved the sale without asking her for identification. She repeated the process in another and when asked by a member of staff when her birthday was, Annie replied: ""May"". He did not ask her age or for proof of her age before approving the sale. In two stores in Newton Mearns, Annie was not asked for identification.

Lennon, 14, is a keen footballer, runner and cyclist and enjoys both flat and fizzy energy drinks. He said: ""The sports drinks give you a boost but the other ones make you kind of hyper. ""Sometimes, if I'm angry, I take them because it calms me down."" The teenager admitted he has been refused energy drinks in supermarkets and has then asked an adult to buy them. He added: ""If energy drinks were banned I would feel frustrated, angry, upset and I would kind of lose my temper. ""I would just hope that when I am older I would get them again so for the rest of my life I could be happy."" Lennon, 14, consumes sports and fizzy energy drinks Naveed Sattar, Professor of Metabolic Medicine at Glasgow University, said children should not be consuming energy drinks. He added: ""They were originally developed for optimal sport performance in high-functioning athletes, to replenish sugars and salts. ""The problem is that the word 'energy' is misleading - kids thinks that they'll be full of vitality after drinking it - but very few children are high-performing athletes so they don't need this additional sugar, salt, and caffeine."" Prof Sattar believes the biggest problem with the drinks is the high sugar content, which can lead to childhood obesity. He said: ""Energy drinks have the same or more sugar than fizzy drinks. ""This kind of refined sugar - as most research agrees - is not nutritious and nourishing, it causes damage to teeth, it causes obesity, which of course leads to heart disease, diabetes and cancer. ""Sports and energy drinks will have salt in them too, and high salt intake is a big factor in high blood pressure in children."" He said the picture concerning caffeine is less clear-cut. Prof Sattar added: ""Some research has suggested that high levels of it are physically bad for you, but many cases seem to be anecdotal. ""Either way, drinking too much energy drink will certainly cause agitation in kids, and impact their ability to sleep. ""Sleep deprivation has knock-on effects including weight gain, adverse diet, emotional distress etc."" The British Soft Drinks Association said it has no safety concerns. A statement on its website on whether energy drinks can be consumed by children, said: ""Whilst caffeine and energy drinks have been deemed safe by health authorities around the world, it is recommended that children consume less caffeine from all sources due to their lower body weight. ""The latest European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report was regarding caffeine intake from all products and confirmed that caffeine intake from energy drinks is negligible in children and less than 11% in adolescents. ""EFSA also confirmed that the main contributors to daily caffeine intake in all age groups are tea, coffee, chocolate and other non-alcoholic beverages.""

"Repeated contact with the same doctor can be beneficial in many ways Patients who see the same doctor again and again have lower death rates, a study suggests. The benefits applied to visits to GPs and specialists and were seen across different cultures and health systems. University of Exeter researchers said the human aspect of medical practice was ""potentially life-saving"" but had been neglected. GPs' leaders said they recognised the value of patients seeing ""their own"" doctor. Because of intense workforce pressures, however, this could mean waiting even longer for an appointment, the Royal College of GPs said. Continuity of care is known to be particularly beneficial for patients with chronic conditions, long-term mental health issues and complex needs. NHS offers smartphone GP appointments Satisfaction with GP services at record low What will the NHS look like at 100 years old? The study, published in BMJ Open, analysed the results of 22 studies in nine countries, including England, France, US, Canada and South Korea. Eighteen of the studies indicated that contact with the same doctor over an average of two years meant fewer deaths over the periods studied, compared with other patients. The researchers said continuity of care was important and should be given a higher priority in healthcare planning. Prof Philip Evans, from the University of Exeter Medical School, said: ""Continuity of care happens when a patient and a doctor see each other repeatedly and get to know each other. ""This leads to better communication, patient satisfaction, adherence to medical advice and much lower use of hospital services."" Sir Denis Pereira Gray, from St Leonard's GP practice in Exeter, who also worked on the study, said: ""Patients have long known that it matters which doctor they see and how well they can communicate with them. ""Until now, arranging for patients to see the doctor of their choice has been considered a matter of convenience or courtesy. ""Now, it is clear it is about the quality of medical practice and is literally 'a matter of life and death'."" Prof Kamila Hawthorne, vice-chair of the Royal College of GPs (RCGP), said many practices were trying out different approaches such as patients being assigned a team of healthcare professionals, including a GP, who had access to their records and could build relationships with them. She said: ""Balancing continuity of care with timely access to GP services is a huge challenge for general practice. And ultimately the answer is more GPs and more resources for the profession."" NHS England has pledged Â£2.4bn extra a year for general practice and 5,000 more GPs by 2020. The RCGP said these must be delivered to safeguard the future of general practice and patient care.

"This video can not be played ""Claire"" says having to return to a clinic makes things ""unnecessarily traumatic"" for some women A decision to allow women to take abortion pills at home in Wales has been welcomed as a ""significant"" move. Until now they have had to take two trips to clinics to take medication to terminate the pregnancy, sometimes miles from home. A charity said women had experienced cramping and bleeding, at times on public transport, trying to get home after taking the pill. The Royal College of Midwives said it was a ""sensible and practical move"". The change brings Wales in line with Scotland,where women have been allowed to take the tablet at home since last year, and with other countries such as Sweden and France. The British Pregnancy Advisory Service (BPAS), an abortion care charity which runs clinics, said Welsh Government move meant women would be able to take the tablet at home where they felt ""safe and comfortable"" and called on England to follow suit. From a 'sense of relief' to a 'broken heart' What happens inside an abortion clinic The British territory with Europe's harshest abortion laws There were8,578 terminations of pregnancy in Wales in 2017,external, more than three out of four - 79.2% - were medical rather than surgical procedures. Under the current system women having a medical abortion, which is only available in the first nine weeks of pregnancy, have to visit a clinic twice to take two tablets within 72 hours of each other. The first tablet, called Mifepristone, blocks the action of the hormone progesterone, which is needed to maintain the pregnancy. The second tablet, called Misoprostol, can be given on the same day, or 24, 48 or 72 hours apart. But the change in Wales will mean that from Friday women will have the choice whether to take Misoprostol - in a clinical setting or take it at home. Women would still need to attend a clinic to take the first pill, Mifepristone, where they would also get the second tablet. Within an hour of taking Misoprostol women can experience heavy bleeding - sometimes on the way home from the clinic. ""This is a massive issue. You don't know when it is going to start,"" said retired nurse Bronwen Davies, a member of the group Abortion Rights Cardiff. Ms Davies explained women could become unwell on the ""long journey"" home, especially in areas of rural Wales, as well as having difficulties taking time off work and paying travel costs to attend clinics. 'Women in England should be allowed to have abortions at home' Inside the secret world of Brazil's WhatsApp abortions Online abortion pill sales 'increasing' Katherine O'Brien, from BPAS, said with how fast the medication could work some women were ""effectively forced to miscarry on the way home"". She said: ""It's incredibly traumatic and difficult, and fairly common for symptoms to come quickly. ""We know women who've asked a taxi to pull over at a hotel and check into a room because they couldn't make it home."" Helen Rogers, director for Wales at the Royal College of Midwives, said: ""This is a sensible and practical move by the Welsh Government. It enables women to have more choice and control over their own reproductive health and well-being. ""It is a welcome announcement that will make a significant difference to women using these services."" Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said the decision had been made after listening to clinicians and women's groups. Mr Gething said: ""This change in practice offers additional choice to women requesting an abortion and enables them to complete treatment in an environment where they feel most comfortable. ""It will also reduce the burden currently placed on clinical resources, increase the availability of appointments for women who want to access termination of pregnancy services and enable a greater number of women to access abortion provision at an earlier point in their pregnancy."" 'They made me feel like a criminal for having an abortion' Last month, the Department of Health said its priority was to ensure that care is safe and of a high quality and that it will continue to monitor the evidence surrounding abortions at home.

""The problem is that the word 'energy' is misleading - kids thinks that they'll be full of vitality after drinking it - but very few children are high-performing athletes so they don't need this additional sugar, salt, and caffeine."" Prof Sattar believes the biggest problem with the drinks is the high sugar content, which can lead to childhood obesity. He said: ""Energy drinks have the same or more sugar than fizzy drinks. ""This kind of refined sugar - as most research agrees - is not nutritious and nourishing, it causes damage to teeth, it causes obesity, which of course leads to heart disease, diabetes and cancer. ""Sports and energy drinks will have salt in them too, and high salt intake is a big factor in high blood pressure in children."" He said the picture concerning caffeine is less clear-cut. Prof Sattar added: ""Some research has suggested that high levels of it are physically bad for you, but many cases seem to be anecdotal. ""Either way, drinking too much energy drink will certainly cause agitation in kids, and impact their ability to sleep. ""Sleep deprivation has knock-on effects including weight gain, adverse diet, emotional distress etc."" The British Soft Drinks Association said it has no safety concerns. A statement on its website on whether energy drinks can be consumed by children, said: ""Whilst caffeine and energy drinks have been deemed safe by health authorities around the world, it is recommended that children consume less caffeine from all sources due to their lower body weight. ""The latest European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report was regarding caffeine intake from all products and confirmed that caffeine intake from energy drinks is negligible in children and less than 11% in adolescents. ""EFSA also confirmed that the main contributors to daily caffeine intake in all age groups are tea, coffee, chocolate and other non-alcoholic beverages.""

"Children can be tempted by fast food offerings near schools Deprived areas such as Blackpool and parts of Manchester and Liverpool have five times more fast food outlets than affluent areas, a survey suggests. The data, from Public Health England (PHE), compared levels of deprivation with numbers of takeaways such as chip shops, burger bars and pizza places. Experts say children exposed to fast food on the way home from school are more likely to eat unhealthily. PHE wants local authorities to refuse applications from new takeaways. One in three children is now overweight or obese by the age of 11. And children from poorer areas are more than twice as likely to be overweight. Adults are also affected, with research inCambridge,externalindicating people living closest to the largest number of fast food outlets were more than twice as likely to be obese. PHE is also encouraging local authorities to work with existing small businesses to provide healthier options. The research analysed data from the Food Standards Agency, which inspects all food businesses. It indicated 17% of fast food outlets were located in the most deprived areas, compared with just 3% in the least deprived. PHE chief nutritionist Dr Alison Tedstone said: ""Local authorities have the power to help support people in making healthier choices. ""They need to question whether these fast food hotspots are compatible with their work to help families and young children live healthier lives."" Prof Russell Viner, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""Kids are coming out of school hungry and finding themselves surrounded by cheap chicken shops, chip shops and other types of tempting junk food. ""This food is tasty and cheap - it's easy to blame the individual, but humans, particularly children, will find it hard to resist tempting food. ""Children from wealthy backgrounds will not be surrounded by junk food in this way."" The report comes a week after the government published its updated Childhood Obesity Plan, which aims to halve childhood obesity in England by 2030. As well as restrictions on junk food ads and supermarket checkout sweets, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt MP pledged to ""help close the deprivation gap."" Healthy chicken shops to fight obesity Reality Check: Why ban fast food within 400m of schools? Takeaway limit near schools plan backed Councils are restricting fast food Some local authorities are already developing ""healthy zones"" by limiting the number of fast food outlets. In Gateshead, where 23% of 10- and 11-year-olds are obese, new planning rules were put in place in 2015. All hot food takeaway applications have to be accompanied by a health impact assessment that looks at: where children congregate numbers of hot food takeaways already in existence high levels of obesity Since then, no new planning applications for fast food takeaways have been approved. Other councils are working to improve the offering at existing takeouts. In Tottenham, Taster's Fried Chicken recently started a new healthier menu for children. The menu included grilled chicken, salad and chunky chips (lower in fat than French fries) in controlled portion sizes, at the same price as regular fried chicken. Taster's in Tottenham are trialling a healthier menu Another scheme has been trialled by the Alexandra Rose Charity, which offers vouchers to low-income families to help them buy fresh fruit and vegetables. Since the scheme began, 2014, about 750 families have taken part, in London and Liverpool. And of those families, 95% ate more fruit and vegetables and reported improved health and wellbeing. But Izzi Seccombe, from the Local Government Association, said more needed to be done. ""Numerous councils have set curbs on new fast food outlets - but current legislation means they lack planning powers to tackle the clustering of existing takeaways already open. ""New legislation is needed to empower councils to help drive forward an effective redesign of damaging food environments.""

"The UK's largest producer of crumpets, Warburton's, has halted production at two of its four plants. The firm has run out of carbon dioxide which it uses to package the product. The CO2 scarcity has already forced beer, fizzy drink and meat firms to curb production. Warburton's supplies 1.5 million crumpets a week to UK consumers, packaged using carbon dioxide to give them longer shelf life and prevent mould. But plants in London and Burnley have run out of CO2 and supplies at the company's Stockton site are intermittent. ""We have had quite big shortfalls,"" said Tearmh Taylor, a spokeswoman for Warburton's. ""We're probably running at about 50% of what we can normally make"" she said. Students raise Â£1,500 for 'jolly' cleaner Bridge jogger-push investigation closed Mother suing Thomas Cook over 'abduction' Only the Midlands plant is operating normally and the firm doesn't know when supplies will resume. Their supplier said it could be next week but have had no confirmation. Meanwhile, the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said brewers were ""working their socks off"" to keep the beer flowing. Scotland's biggest abattoir is closed and other meat producers are considering adapting their products to use less CO2. Some food and drink firms have asked whether the government could help alleviate the problem. ""If a similar issue were to affect the water industry... then you feel government would be acting with far greater urgency,"" the Food and Drink Federation said.. CO2 is widely used in the food processing and drinks industries. It puts the fizz into beer, cider and soft drinks, and is used in food packaging to extend the shelf life of salads, fresh meat and poultry. The gas is also used to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter, and create dry ice to help keep things chilled while in transit. However, several UK and mainland European producers of carbon dioxide - a by-product from ammonia production that is used in the fertiliser industry - closed for maintenance or scaled down operations. In the UK, only two of five plants that supply CO2 are operating at the moment. The shortage comes at the same time demand for food and drink is soaring. ""The football, the weather, the BBQs have created the sort of demand for beer we only see at Christmas,"" one big UK brewing company told the BBC. Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association struck a reassuring note: ""Although stocks of bulk CO2 remain low, brewers across the country are working their socks off around the clock to ensure there is still plenty of beer to go around. ""The UK can produce as much as 10 million pints of beer per day, and with signs of things improving, pubs will certainly not be running dry. ""Our message to beer drinkers and England fans is clear: Keep calm and carry on going to the pub. If your usual beer of choice isn't available, then why not use it as an opportunity to try something new?"" These assurances come after big pub chains in Wetherspoon and Ei Group reported they had temporarily run out, or were short of, brands including John Smith's, Strongbow, Amstel and Birra Moretti in the run-up to Thursday evening's England match against Belgium. Scotland's biggest abattoir closed this week until further notice, and meat processors are considering shortening ""sell by"" dates because packaging will contain lower levels of CO2. There have been concerns about animal welfare if animals don't go to slaughter at their usual rate. ""The last few days have alerted the country to how dependent we are on CO2,"" Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors' Association, told the BBC on Thursday. He criticised CO2 producers for a lack of information about when carbon dioxide supplies might return to normal. ""It makes planning difficult,"" Mr Allen said. The British Poultry Council said its members continued to live ""day-to-day"" as they tried to stretch out their dwindling supplies of the gas. Beer shortage hits biggest pub chains Why the CO2 shortage really matters Beer sales rationed amid CO2 shortage The meat industry has become increasingly frustrated by a lack of information coming from CO2 firms and the UK government in particular over when supplies might return to normal. ""They are not telling us, which means we can't plan,"" said Richard Griffith, from the British Poultry Council. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Department of Business both said they were monitoring the situation. However, the Food and Drink Federation said ministers should really be on the ""front foot"" over what could develop into a major food supply issue. The industry trade journal Gas World, which first reported the news that CO2 was running short, said that two tankers full of liquid CO2 from mainland Europe have been delivered to ports in the UK in the past couple of days. A number of European plants are beginning to increase supplies, while another factory that had closed because of technical issues rather than maintenance, is due to come back online in mid-July.

"The carbon dioxide shortage will start affecting some supplies to supermarkets this weekend, the Food and Drink Federation has warned. CO2 is used to stun farm animals, put fizz in carbonated drinks and is used in packaging, but is in short supply. Federation chief executive Ian Wright said carbon dioxide supplies were not expected to resume until next week. He said that while stocks would not run out, ""choice will be eroded"". Mr Wright told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""We will see fewer chicken dishes, fewer pork and bacon dishes. ""We'll see probably less carbonated drinks and certainly bakery and other things that benefit from what's called modified atmosphere packaging, which is plastic packaging with a tray underneath and a dish of food in them."" Why the CO2 shortage really matters Beer shortage hits biggest pub chains Have you noticed a shortage of food and drink at your supermarket? Is there less choice of beer at your local pub? Please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,externalwith your stories. A number of companies have reported disruption to production because of the shortage. Warburton's, the UK's biggest producer of crumpets, said ithas been forced to halt production at two of its four plants. The company uses carbon dioxide to give its crumpets a longer shelf life and prevent mould. Earlier this week the Wetherspoons and Ei Group pub chains said they had temporarily run out, or were running short of, beers including John Smith's, Amstel and Moretti as well as Strongbow cider. The British Retail Consortium said: ""We are aware of specific pressures in some areas such as carbonated soft drinks, beer, British chicken and British pork but the majority of food products are unaffected and retailers do not anticipate food shortages. However, it is likely that the mix of products available may be affected."" This video can not be played Are we in for a beer shortage this summer? The Food and Drink Federation's Mr Wright said that even if supplies of CO2 resumed next week, it would take some time before it made its way to food and drink producers. ""Inventories of products have been eroded quite a lot over the last week and not many people keep very large stocks of products because it is not cost-efficient,"" he explained. Jaega Wise, head brewer at the Wild Card Brewery in Walthamstow, east London, says the CO2 shortage has most affected the bottling side of the micro brewery and bar business. ""This week I had 2,000 litres of beer that was meant to be sent off for bottling and then I get a phone call from our bottler saying 'we simply can't take it because we have no CO2',"" she says. Jaega Wise is the head brewer at the Wild Card Brewery in East London And it is a problem facing all types of brewers - even those who make cask beer. Ms Wise says that while it is possible to make cask ale without CO2 because of the natural carbonation that yeast provides, she says all brewers use carbon dioxide ""to move beer in between tanks, we use it to purge tanks, we generally use it a lot in the brewery itself, so it is a problem for cask producers as well as bottles as well as kegs"". She says Wild Card has just enough CO2 to keep its beer fizzing. ""We're not in a crisis moment yet. I would say keep on going to the pubs, still keep on enjoying the football but if this carries on for much longer we're going to be in trouble."" Quality Pork Limited, which operates Scotland's biggest abattoir at Brechin, is closed and other meat producers are considering changes to use less CO2. Andy McGowan, chief executive of the Scottish Pork Producers co-operative, said he had heard that supplies of CO2 could restart next week, and that Brechin might receive gas in the second half. Abattoirs use CO2 as part of a pre-slaughter stunning process. To avoid overcrowding, Quality Pork had sent 2,000 pigs to the meat processor Tulip in England, while 4,000 remained in Scotland. About 6,000 pigs pass through Brechin every week. Some food and drink firms have asked whether the government could help alleviate the problem. Mr Wright said ministers could ask suppliers that have stopped production for maintenance to put factories back into production. There are concerns about overcrowding as animals will not go to slaughter at their usual rate. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Department of Business have both said they are monitoring the situation. They said: ""We have been assured CO2 producers are working as fast as they can to get plants up and running again, with CO2 production set to start very shortly."" The trade journal Gasworld, which first revealed that CO2 was running short, said that the plant at Billingham, County Durham, is due to restart on Monday.

"Debate over the future of ATMs in the UK has intensified ahead of a cut in the fee operators receive from banks. From Sunday, the fee paid each time a cash machine is used will be cut, with further reductions due each year until 2021. Link, which oversees cash machines, has argued that the move is vital for the sustainability of the network. Consumer group Which? claims that 300 ATMs are closing a month, but that analysis is disputed by Link. Convenience stores and the ATM industry have also expressed concerns about cash machines disappearing. The fee paid to operators, known as the interchange rate, will be reduced from 25p to 20p per withdrawal. This change will be made over the course of four years, starting on Sunday. However, the fee will be unchanged for free-to-use ATMs which are 1km or more from the next nearest cash machine. Those in remote locations could receive an extra subsidy, particularly if they are threatened with closure. The Association of Convenience Stores has calculated that the change could mean a decline in income of between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 a year for some small stores that operate machines, at a time when they already face other financial pressures. There are two pressing issues, according to Link - which oversees the UK's network of machines but does not run them itself. The first is that consumers are moving away from cash payments to card, contactless, and smartphone-based payments. Recent figures from the UK's banks showed that more transactions were made by debit cards than by cash last year. Who do we trust after cash? The High Streets with 'too many' ATMs The second is that cash machines are clustered in city and town centres. Link argues that changing the fee structure would effectively make it just as lucrative to run a machine in a rural or less affluent area as in a town centre - so would even-out the spread of ATMs. The sustainability of the network would be improved, it said, as there would no longer be lots of ATMs in city centres where consumers were more likely to pay with cards or smartphones rather than cash. There is no obvious impact on the cost of using a cash machine, the vast majority of which do not charge individuals for use. Over the longer-term, there is a debate over whether the changes will affect consumers' access to cash, particularly in more remote areas where cash use is higher. Consumer group Which? and operators say there needs to be more scrutiny of the changes - particularly by the payments regulator. They argue that the changes made by Link is leading to cash machines disappearing and operators leaving the UK, hitting everyone who relies on cash - including those in rural areas. Ron Delnevo, of the ATM Industry Association, suggested that hundreds of the machines had been removed already and installations cancelled ""at a much faster rate than complacent observers expected"". Which? said it had analysed Link's figures and suggested that almost 1,500 machines closed between November last year and April, which it said was a near six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015. The investigation suggested that machines in rural communities were at least as badly hit as urban areas  - down 2.1% and 2% respectively - across the UK at a time when more bank branch closures were being announced. However, Link disputed the analysis. It said: ""Which? has suggested that ATMs have fallen by 1,500 in the period between November 2017 and March 2018, however, Link can confirm that during this period the number of free-to-use ATMs actually increased."" That said, its own more up-to-date published figures shows that there were 388 fewer free-to-use ATMs in the UK in June than there were in December.

He said that people were still hiding under their desks when the gunman stopped shooting. ""I don't know why. I don't know why he stopped,"" he told the Baltimore Sun.

Capital Gazette reporters were pictured working on the next day's newspaper from the car park President Donald Trump was briefed on the attack.

"The inquiry heard from Anthony Bryan and Paulette Wilson, both who were detained twice Immigration officials detained members of the Windrush generation ""unlawfully and inappropriately"" despite their right to be in the UK, MPs have found. A parliamentary committee has published its report,externalinto the Windrush scandal, describing the Home Office's treatment of individuals as ""shocking"". Officials required standards of proof ""which went well beyond those required"", the inquiry found. It has called for a ""fundamental change in the law, culture and procedures"". Who are the Windrush generation? In Pictures: The Windrush generation Windrush peers attack Home Office The Windrush scandal began to be uncovered in April of this year when it emerged that some migrants from Commonwealth countries, who were encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973, were being wrongly categorised as illegal immigrants. They were part of what is known as the Windrush generation - a reference to the Empire Windrush - the ship that brought workers from the West Indies to Britain in 1948. Some who had lived and worked in the UK for years - were threatened with deportation or refused jobs and healthcare. Their treatment coincided with the Home Office's adoption ofa hardline ""hostile environment"" approach, designed to tackle the issue of illegal immigration. In the report published on Friday, MPs and peers on the Joint Committee on Human Rights said the Home Office demonstrated a ""wholly incorrect approach to case-handling and to depriving people of their liberty"". Individuals were locked up unless they could satisfy officials they should not be detained - an approach with the report described as ""simply unlawful"". ""It is for the Home Office to satisfy itself that it has a power to detain an individual - not for an individual to have to satisfy the Home Office that they should not be detained,"" the report said. The report added: ""The Home Office required standards of proof from members of the Windrush generation which went well beyond those required, even by its own guidance; and moreover were impossible for them to meet - and which would have been very difficult for anyone to meet. ""This led to officials making perverse decisions about their status. Moreover, it seems that if those standards were not met, Home Office officials then considered that they had grounds to detain."" The committee examined two cases of Windrush migrants - Anthony Bryan, 60, and Paulette Wilson, 62  - who were both detained after being unable to show documents proving their immigration status. This video can not be played Windrush migrants Anthony Bryan and Paulette Wilson told the committee that Home Office officials treated them as liars. Mr Bryan and Ms Wilsonboth came to Britain from Jamaica as children in the 1960s. Giving evidence to the committee in May, Mr Bryan agreed with a suggestion that a factor in the way he was treated was because he was black. Grandfather Mr Bryan was held in a detention centre twice, for almost three weeks, last year while Ms Wilson was detained for a week. The committee said their experience in detention was ""traumatising and debilitating"". The case files showed that immigration officials dismissed ""ample information and evidence"" for the pair's right to be in the UK, the report said. Some of the evidence discounted by officials included their own accounts of their lives as well as testimonies from family members, people who had known them for decades and lawyers. Members of the Windrush generation - including Anthony Bryan and Paulette Wilson - with MP David Lammy The report said that detention powers should not be used for people living in the UK and who are unlikely to abscond, the report said. ""Detention powers have been used unlawfully and inappropriately by the Home Office without assuring itself that it had a right to deprive individuals of their liberty,"" it said. ""There should be fundamental change in the law, culture and procedures to protect human rights in the work of the Home Office."" 'The British Empire is nothing to be proud of' Windrush generaton: Three stories Man 'broken' over fear of deportation Harriet Harman, the committee chairwoman, said what had happened to Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson had been ""a total violation of their human rights by the state's most powerful government department"". She said some members of the Windrush generation had been treated ""shockingly"" and ""shamefully"" and she called for additional safeguards to be put in place. ""What you've got to have is a system which allows - when something's going wrong - the individual to check it and there to be proper monitoring,"" she told Radio 4's Today. ""There's no independent situation at all. So you've got Home Office officials literally ticking the box for somebody to be detained."" The inquiry rejected the Home Office's claim that the treatment of Mr Bryan and Ms Wilson was due to a ""a series of mistakes"". It said the explanation was not ""credible of sufficient"" and that a ""systemic failure"" is more likely the reason. The scandal led tothe resignation of Home Secretary Amber Ruddandthe promise from Theresa May of compensationwhere appropriate. Earlier this month, more than 2,000 people attended a thanksgiving service marking 70 years since the arrival of Caribbean migrants on the Windrush ship. The migrants were among the first to be recruited to rebuild post-war Britain. In 1971, all Commonwealth citizens already living in the UK were given indefinite leave to remain. There are now 500,000 people resident in the UK who were born in a Commonwealth country and arrived before 1971 - including the Windrush arrivals - according to estimates by Oxford University's Migration Observatory. Earlier this month, Home Secretary Sajid Javidpledged a ""fresh look"" at rulesand said key parts of the UK's immigration policy will be reviewed. What is Windrush Day?

"The legality of recreational use is not up for debate, the government has said Legalising cannabis would raise Â£1bn a year in tax for the UK, a think tank has estimated. The report from the Institute of Economic Affairs has valued the UK's black market in cannabis at Â£2.6bn. Legalising the class B drug would also lead to savings for public services including the police, it said. It comes after former Conservative leader Lord Haguecalled on the governmentto consider legalising cannabis for recreational use. The government haspromised to review the use of medicinal cannabisfollowing two high-profile cases involving severely epileptic children. But the Home Office stressed that the drug will remain banned for recreational use. What are the risks of recreational cannabis? Cannabis debate: What you need to know Why not... legalise drugs? Most UK cannabis 'super strength skunk' According to thedrugs advice service Frank,,externalcannabis is the most widely-used controlled substance in Britain. Anyone found in possession of the drug can be imprisoned for up to five years while supplying it can be punished with a 14-year jail sentence or an unlimited fine. In its report, the Institute of Economic Affairs estimates that around three million people in Britain used a total of 255 tonnes of cannabis last year. The average cannabis user consumes an average 82.5g of the drug per year, or 1.6g per week, the think tank said. One gram is currently worth Â£10. If the drug was legally available, it would generate sales of Â£2bn - twice the size of the cider industry. The think tank said that VAT, excise duty, plus new streams of business and income taxes, would lead to a ""windfall"" for the Treasury of Â£1bn. And savings to the NHS would work out at around Â£300m a year, the IEA said. It added that legalisation would ""virtually eradicate"" the black market, although previous studies have indicated the illegal market would still continue, with dealers selling more potent types of the drug. Chris Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the IEA, said: ""Canada and the USA are showing the way. ""Done properly, the legalisation of cannabis is a win-win-win: criminals lose a lucrative industry, consumers get a better, safer and cheaper product, and the burden on the general taxpayer is reduced.""

In its report, the IEA said licensed sales would lead to safer cannabis replacing the more dangerous strains - like high-strength ""skunk"" - and make it more difficult for under 18s to access the drug. ""Legalisation would also create new jobs and businesses in the legitimate, tax-paying economy, as well as savings in the criminal justice system,"" the IEA added. The debate around legalising cannabis was reignited after the cases of Billy Caldwell, 12, and Alfie Dingley, 6, who wanted to use a banned type of medicinal cannabis to treat their epilepsy. Lord Hague - who is now the most high profile political figure to support legalising cannabis - said the debate about Billy was ""one of those illuminating moments when a longstanding policy is revealed to be inappropriate, ineffective and utterly out of date"". He said the war on cannabis had been ""irreversibly lost"" and a change of policy was needed. Cannabis is not recognised as having any therapeutic value under the law in England and Wales and anyone buying or using it can be arrested or jailed. Only one cannabis-based medical product - Sativex - can be legally prescribed in limited circumstances usually to help alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis and the government is open to further applications. William Hague was Tory leader between 1997 and 2001 The Royal College of Psychiatrists makes clear that legalisation for recreational and medicinal use are distinct issues. It says cannabis carries significant mental health risks but it supports the medicinal use of approved cannabis products.

"This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? Secure centres for migrants may be set up in EU states to process asylum claims under a deal reached after marathon talks at a summit in Brussels. Thecontrolled centres would be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis,externaland migrants whose claims were rejected would be ""returned"". Refugees could be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them. The deal follows weeks of diplomatic wrangling over migrant rescue ships, and which country should take them in. Coastguard officials said on Friday that around 100 people were thought to have drowned off the Libyan coast, with 14 rescued. They were found in waters to the east of the capital, Tripoli. Gruelling migration talks end in draw Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? There were no details on which countries might set up the secure centres or take in refugees, but French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants first arrived in the EU. ""We have struck the right balance between responsibility and solidarity,"" he said. Numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their 2015 peak, the European Council says. Italy - the entry point for thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - had threatened to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not receive help. ""After this European summit, Europe is more responsible and offers more solidarity,"" said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. ""Today Italy is no longer alone."" Other leaders struck a more cautious note. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done to resolve disagreements. And European Council President Donald Tusk said it was ""too early to talk about a success"". ""We have managed to reach an agreement in the European Council. But this is in fact the easiest part of the task, compared to what awaits us on the ground when we start implementing it,"" he told a news conference. By Adam Fleming, BBC News, Brussels A few things stand out as wins for Italy's new prime minister. The summit's conclusions now include a statement about the need for boats that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to respect international law. But the big one is approval of the concept of closed, secure processing facilities for migrants arriving in the EU. Some say this will make it easier to send back people whose claims for asylum are rejected. Others are already describing them as prisons. This paragraph is full of caveats, commas and sub-clauses - all the hallmarks of something drafted in the middle of the night. Another striking pledge is for an ambitious partnership with Africa. That's the EU trying to balance its tough internal approach with a friendly external one, and offering incentives to North African countries to host facilities where migrants can be assessed for resettlement in Europe. The 28 EU leaders also agreed several other measures,external: strengthening external border controls, and boosting financing for Turkey and countries in North Africa exploring the possibility of ""regional disembarkation platforms"", aimed at breaking the business model of  people-smuggling gangs by processing refugees and migrants outside the EU. However getting North African countries to host such centres could be very difficult and Morocco again on Thursday rejected the idea internal measures taken by member states to stop migrants moving within the EU, which the agreement said undermined asylum policy and the border-free Schengen travel area more investment in Africa to help the continent achieve a ""substantial socio-economic transformation"" so people no longer leave for a better life further work to reform EU asylum policy, including changes to the so-called Dublin regulation under which migrants must be considered for asylum in the first safe country where they arrive Mr Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the joint communiquÃ© until the leaders had settled the migration issue. Both Italy and Greece want other countries to share the burden. However several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the migration issue could be a defining moment for the EU - but she also needed the summit to avert a political crisis at home that could bring down her government. This video can not be played Migrant crisis: EU border force Frontex explained Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, had given her a deadline of this weekend. He has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere from the border in his home state. European press says migrant deal 'fragile' Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migrant mutiny Trapped in a country everyone wants to leave Without the CSU, Mrs Merkel would lose her parliamentary majority. After the talks, she acknowledged the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"". About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says. More than a million people arrived in 2015. This month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight. Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? 'Used as a slave' in a Libyan detention centre The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take some of the migrants on board. Malta said Norway had now also agreed to take a share. Medical charity Medecins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) branded the new EU deal inhumane. ""The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping - and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations,"" MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said.

"Tata owns the UK's largest steelworks at Port Talbot Tata Steel and ThyssenKrupp are close to agreeing terms on a merger that will create Europe's second-biggest steelmaker, after Arcelor Mittal. Senior City sources said the deal - which has been under negotiation for more than a year - could be concluded in the next few days. It will see Tata Steel's UK plants merged into a pan-European venture with annual sales of about Â£13bn. These include the politically sensitive Port Talbot works in Wales. Talks have been held up while the future of Tata Steel's enormous pension scheme - which includes the former British Steel retirement plan - was decided. Three months ago, the pensions regulator approved the creation of a new pension fund after Tata agreed to a Â£550m top-up. More recently, ThyssenKrupp has faced pressure from shareholders to secure better terms from Tata. Elliott Management, the aggressive New York hedge fund that has emerged as a key player in big European takeover battles, recently wrote to Thyssen's board saying that Tata's recent financial results did not warrant it receiving a half-share in the combined business. The deal marks another change of ownership for Britain's steel industry, which once led the world, but has shrunk rapidly in the face of cheaper international competition. Most of the industry was nationalised after World War Two, then re-privatised in 1988 as the British Steel Corporation. It became Corus after a merger with a Dutch rival, Koninklijke Hoogovens, in 1999, and was bought by India's Tata Steel in 2006. The British Steel name was revived two years ago, when investment fund Greybull Capital bought Tata Steel's Scunthorpe-based long-products division. Tata and ThyssenKrupp have both said they are committed to the Port Talbot plant, which is Britain's largest remaining steel plant. But steel industry experts said there remained question marks over the site's long-term future.

Warburton's supplies 1.5 million crumpets a week to UK consumers, packaged using carbon dioxide to give them longer shelf life and prevent mould. But plants in London and Burnley have run out of CO2 and supplies at the company's Stockton site are intermittent. ""We have had quite big shortfalls,"" said Tearmh Taylor, a spokeswoman for Warburton's. ""We're probably running at about 50% of what we can normally make"" she said. Students raise Â£1,500 for 'jolly' cleaner Bridge jogger-push investigation closed Mother suing Thomas Cook over 'abduction' Only the Midlands plant is operating normally and the firm doesn't know when supplies will resume. Their supplier said it could be next week but have had no confirmation. Meanwhile, the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) said brewers were ""working their socks off"" to keep the beer flowing. Scotland's biggest abattoir is closed and other meat producers are considering adapting their products to use less CO2. Some food and drink firms have asked whether the government could help alleviate the problem. ""If a similar issue were to affect the water industry... then you feel government would be acting with far greater urgency,"" the Food and Drink Federation said.. CO2 is widely used in the food processing and drinks industries. It puts the fizz into beer, cider and soft drinks, and is used in food packaging to extend the shelf life of salads, fresh meat and poultry. The gas is also used to stun pigs and chickens before slaughter, and create dry ice to help keep things chilled while in transit. However, several UK and mainland European producers of carbon dioxide - a by-product from ammonia production that is used in the fertiliser industry - closed for maintenance or scaled down operations. In the UK, only two of five plants that supply CO2 are operating at the moment. The shortage comes at the same time demand for food and drink is soaring. ""The football, the weather, the BBQs have created the sort of demand for beer we only see at Christmas,"" one big UK brewing company told the BBC. Brigid Simmonds, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association struck a reassuring note: ""Although stocks of bulk CO2 remain low, brewers across the country are working their socks off around the clock to ensure there is still plenty of beer to go around. ""The UK can produce as much as 10 million pints of beer per day, and with signs of things improving, pubs will certainly not be running dry. ""Our message to beer drinkers and England fans is clear: Keep calm and carry on going to the pub. If your usual beer of choice isn't available, then why not use it as an opportunity to try something new?"" These assurances come after big pub chains in Wetherspoon and Ei Group reported they had temporarily run out, or were short of, brands including John Smith's, Strongbow, Amstel and Birra Moretti in the run-up to Thursday evening's England match against Belgium. Scotland's biggest abattoir closed this week until further notice, and meat processors are considering shortening ""sell by"" dates because packaging will contain lower levels of CO2. There have been concerns about animal welfare if animals don't go to slaughter at their usual rate. ""The last few days have alerted the country to how dependent we are on CO2,"" Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors' Association, told the BBC on Thursday. He criticised CO2 producers for a lack of information about when carbon dioxide supplies might return to normal. ""It makes planning difficult,"" Mr Allen said. The British Poultry Council said its members continued to live ""day-to-day"" as they tried to stretch out their dwindling supplies of the gas. Beer shortage hits biggest pub chains Why the CO2 shortage really matters Beer sales rationed amid CO2 shortage The meat industry has become increasingly frustrated by a lack of information coming from CO2 firms and the UK government in particular over when supplies might return to normal. ""They are not telling us, which means we can't plan,"" said Richard Griffith, from the British Poultry Council. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and the Department of Business both said they were monitoring the situation. However, the Food and Drink Federation said ministers should really be on the ""front foot"" over what could develop into a major food supply issue. The industry trade journal Gas World, which first reported the news that CO2 was running short, said that two tankers full of liquid CO2 from mainland Europe have been delivered to ports in the UK in the past couple of days. A number of European plants are beginning to increase supplies, while another factory that had closed because of technical issues rather than maintenance, is due to come back online in mid-July.

"This video can not be played Why is the Aquarius migrant rescue ship empty? Secure centres for migrants may be set up in EU states to process asylum claims under a deal reached after marathon talks at a summit in Brussels. Thecontrolled centres would be set up by EU states on a voluntary basis,externaland migrants whose claims were rejected would be ""returned"". Refugees could be resettled in EU states which agreed to take them. The deal follows weeks of diplomatic wrangling over migrant rescue ships, and which country should take them in. Coastguard officials said on Friday that around 100 people were thought to have drowned off the Libyan coast, with 14 rescued. They were found in waters to the east of the capital, Tripoli. Gruelling migration talks end in draw Could the migration crisis finish the EU? Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? There were no details on which countries might set up the secure centres or take in refugees, but French President Emmanuel Macron said they would be in countries where migrants first arrived in the EU. ""We have struck the right balance between responsibility and solidarity,"" he said. Numbers illegally entering the EU have dropped 96% since their 2015 peak, the European Council says. Italy - the entry point for thousands of migrants, mainly from Africa - had threatened to veto the summit's entire agenda if it did not receive help. ""After this European summit, Europe is more responsible and offers more solidarity,"" said Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. ""Today Italy is no longer alone."" Other leaders struck a more cautious note. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said more needed to be done to resolve disagreements. And European Council President Donald Tusk said it was ""too early to talk about a success"". ""We have managed to reach an agreement in the European Council. But this is in fact the easiest part of the task, compared to what awaits us on the ground when we start implementing it,"" he told a news conference. By Adam Fleming, BBC News, Brussels A few things stand out as wins for Italy's new prime minister. The summit's conclusions now include a statement about the need for boats that pick up migrants in the Mediterranean to respect international law. But the big one is approval of the concept of closed, secure processing facilities for migrants arriving in the EU. Some say this will make it easier to send back people whose claims for asylum are rejected. Others are already describing them as prisons. This paragraph is full of caveats, commas and sub-clauses - all the hallmarks of something drafted in the middle of the night. Another striking pledge is for an ambitious partnership with Africa. That's the EU trying to balance its tough internal approach with a friendly external one, and offering incentives to North African countries to host facilities where migrants can be assessed for resettlement in Europe. The 28 EU leaders also agreed several other measures,external: strengthening external border controls, and boosting financing for Turkey and countries in North Africa exploring the possibility of ""regional disembarkation platforms"", aimed at breaking the business model of  people-smuggling gangs by processing refugees and migrants outside the EU. However getting North African countries to host such centres could be very difficult and Morocco again on Thursday rejected the idea internal measures taken by member states to stop migrants moving within the EU, which the agreement said undermined asylum policy and the border-free Schengen travel area more investment in Africa to help the continent achieve a ""substantial socio-economic transformation"" so people no longer leave for a better life further work to reform EU asylum policy, including changes to the so-called Dublin regulation under which migrants must be considered for asylum in the first safe country where they arrive Mr Conte had earlier taken the rare step of blocking the conclusions of the joint communiquÃ© until the leaders had settled the migration issue. Both Italy and Greece want other countries to share the burden. However several Central European states have so far rejected an EU scheme to relocate 160,000 refugees from overcrowded camps in Greece and Italy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel had said that the migration issue could be a defining moment for the EU - but she also needed the summit to avert a political crisis at home that could bring down her government. This video can not be played Migrant crisis: EU border force Frontex explained Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, from her Bavarian coalition partner the CSU, had given her a deadline of this weekend. He has threatened to start turning away migrants who have already registered elsewhere from the border in his home state. European press says migrant deal 'fragile' Merkel's Bavarian ally threatens migrant mutiny Trapped in a country everyone wants to leave Without the CSU, Mrs Merkel would lose her parliamentary majority. After the talks, she acknowledged the EU still had ""a lot of work to do to bridge the different views"". About 56,000 migrants have arrived in Europe so far this year, the International Organization for Migration says. More than a million people arrived in 2015. This month's tensions over migrant rescue ships barred from entry to Italian ports - most recently German charity ship Lifeline - have put the issue firmly back in the EU spotlight. Reality Check: Who is responsible for migrants at sea? The Aquarius: Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? 'Used as a slave' in a Libyan detention centre The Lifeline was only allowed to dock in Malta after intense diplomacy among several EU states, who each agreed to take some of the migrants on board. Malta said Norway had now also agreed to take a share. Medical charity Medecins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) branded the new EU deal inhumane. ""The only thing European states appear to have agreed on is to block people at the doorstep of Europe regardless of how vulnerable they are, or what horrors they are escaping - and to demonise non-governmental search and rescue operations,"" MSF's emergencies chief Karline Kleijer said.

"Debate over the future of ATMs in the UK has intensified ahead of a cut in the fee operators receive from banks. From Sunday, the fee paid each time a cash machine is used will be cut, with further reductions due each year until 2021. Link, which oversees cash machines, has argued that the move is vital for the sustainability of the network. Consumer group Which? claims that 300 ATMs are closing a month, but that analysis is disputed by Link. Convenience stores and the ATM industry have also expressed concerns about cash machines disappearing. The fee paid to operators, known as the interchange rate, will be reduced from 25p to 20p per withdrawal. This change will be made over the course of four years, starting on Sunday. However, the fee will be unchanged for free-to-use ATMs which are 1km or more from the next nearest cash machine. Those in remote locations could receive an extra subsidy, particularly if they are threatened with closure. The Association of Convenience Stores has calculated that the change could mean a decline in income of between Â£2,500 and Â£3,000 a year for some small stores that operate machines, at a time when they already face other financial pressures. There are two pressing issues, according to Link - which oversees the UK's network of machines but does not run them itself. The first is that consumers are moving away from cash payments to card, contactless, and smartphone-based payments. Recent figures from the UK's banks showed that more transactions were made by debit cards than by cash last year. Who do we trust after cash? The High Streets with 'too many' ATMs The second is that cash machines are clustered in city and town centres. Link argues that changing the fee structure would effectively make it just as lucrative to run a machine in a rural or less affluent area as in a town centre - so would even-out the spread of ATMs. The sustainability of the network would be improved, it said, as there would no longer be lots of ATMs in city centres where consumers were more likely to pay with cards or smartphones rather than cash. There is no obvious impact on the cost of using a cash machine, the vast majority of which do not charge individuals for use. Over the longer-term, there is a debate over whether the changes will affect consumers' access to cash, particularly in more remote areas where cash use is higher. Consumer group Which? and operators say there needs to be more scrutiny of the changes - particularly by the payments regulator. They argue that the changes made by Link is leading to cash machines disappearing and operators leaving the UK, hitting everyone who relies on cash - including those in rural areas. Ron Delnevo, of the ATM Industry Association, suggested that hundreds of the machines had been removed already and installations cancelled ""at a much faster rate than complacent observers expected"". Which? said it had analysed Link's figures and suggested that almost 1,500 machines closed between November last year and April, which it said was a near six-fold increase from a steady rate of fewer than 50 closures a month since 2015. The investigation suggested that machines in rural communities were at least as badly hit as urban areas  - down 2.1% and 2% respectively - across the UK at a time when more bank branch closures were being announced. However, Link disputed the analysis. It said: ""Which? has suggested that ATMs have fallen by 1,500 in the period between November 2017 and March 2018, however, Link can confirm that during this period the number of free-to-use ATMs actually increased."" That said, its own more up-to-date published figures shows that there were 388 fewer free-to-use ATMs in the UK in June than there were in December.

"This video can not be played Knowing the number of seals is a good indicator of the Thames Estuary's health Sixty years ago the Thames Estuary was regarded as ""biologically dead"" and largely devoid of wildlife. But, in recent years seals have returned to the Thames as well as to the coastal and low-lying lands bordering the estuary. Last year, scientists recorded more than 3,500 harbour and grey seals. Now, they are starting the first count of seal pups to see how important the area is a breeding ground. ""These seals are higher predators in the estuary,"" says Thea Cox, conservation biologist at the Zoological Society of London. ""Knowing how many there are is a really good indicator of the health of the estuary, what habitat is available to them, what food source is available to them."" ZSL conservation biologist Thea Cox Just a short boat ride from Ramsgate, we come across a colony of seals basking on a sandbank. Some lie on the spits of sand lazily waving their flippers, while others swim towards our boat, showing off their diving skills. ""To understand particularly how many pups they are having will tell us about the reproductive potential of the population,"" says Thea Cox. ""It will add to the existing baseline that we have from five years of population surveys - a really good piece of new information that we will be gathering this year."" She studies the seals with binoculars, pointing out the two species of seal resident on this river. Most are harbour seals (also known as the common seal), while a few are grey seals, which are larger and have a longer, flatter nose. Some of the harbour seals are about to give birth. ZSL biologists will be searching for new arrivals from land, air and sea over four days from Sunday. The survey is taking place across the Greater Thames Estuary, which includes parts of the Kent and Essex coasts. Why this story matters Seals have been gradually returning to the UK coastline since seal hunting was banned in the early 1970s. Numbers have risen in the Greater Thames Estuary and off the east coast of England. But there are a number of emerging threats, including plastic pollution and competition between seals for food and habitat. And an outbreak of a virus in 2002 led to the loss of nearly a quarter of harbour seals off the east coast of England. ""We've seen numbers increase, which is brilliant news, but that's not to say they still aren't subject to threats,"" says Thea Cox. ""Those could be from major construction projects in the estuary, dredging projects and general disturbance from human use of the estuary."" Our boat's skipper, Stuart Barnes, has been spotting marine wildlife for a decade. He saw pups near here for the first time last year, suggesting this could be an important breeding site. ""It proves that the environment is actually getting cleaner,"" he says. ""It's good to see that the waterways are actually nice for them. Once upon a time, with several industries around then, the seal population did die off; that's due to distemper as well as general pollution in the rivers."" Learn more...

"The legality of recreational use is not up for debate, the government has said Legalising cannabis would raise Â£1bn a year in tax for the UK, a think tank has estimated. The report from the Institute of Economic Affairs has valued the UK's black market in cannabis at Â£2.6bn. Legalising the class B drug would also lead to savings for public services including the police, it said. It comes after former Conservative leader Lord Haguecalled on the governmentto consider legalising cannabis for recreational use. The government haspromised to review the use of medicinal cannabisfollowing two high-profile cases involving severely epileptic children. But the Home Office stressed that the drug will remain banned for recreational use. What are the risks of recreational cannabis? Cannabis debate: What you need to know Why not... legalise drugs? Most UK cannabis 'super strength skunk' According to thedrugs advice service Frank,,externalcannabis is the most widely-used controlled substance in Britain. Anyone found in possession of the drug can be imprisoned for up to five years while supplying it can be punished with a 14-year jail sentence or an unlimited fine. In its report, the Institute of Economic Affairs estimates that around three million people in Britain used a total of 255 tonnes of cannabis last year. The average cannabis user consumes an average 82.5g of the drug per year, or 1.6g per week, the think tank said. One gram is currently worth Â£10. If the drug was legally available, it would generate sales of Â£2bn - twice the size of the cider industry. The think tank said that VAT, excise duty, plus new streams of business and income taxes, would lead to a ""windfall"" for the Treasury of Â£1bn. And savings to the NHS would work out at around Â£300m a year, the IEA said. It added that legalisation would ""virtually eradicate"" the black market, although previous studies have indicated the illegal market would still continue, with dealers selling more potent types of the drug. Chris Snowdon, head of lifestyle economics at the IEA, said: ""Canada and the USA are showing the way. ""Done properly, the legalisation of cannabis is a win-win-win: criminals lose a lucrative industry, consumers get a better, safer and cheaper product, and the burden on the general taxpayer is reduced."" Canadapassed a lawlegalising cannabis earlier this month. Uruguaybecame the first countryto legalise the sale of cannabis for recreational use in December 2013, while a number of US states have also voted to permit it. In its report, the IEA said licensed sales would lead to safer cannabis replacing the more dangerous strains - like high-strength ""skunk"" - and make it more difficult for under 18s to access the drug. ""Legalisation would also create new jobs and businesses in the legitimate, tax-paying economy, as well as savings in the criminal justice system,"" the IEA added. The debate around legalising cannabis was reignited after the cases of Billy Caldwell, 12, and Alfie Dingley, 6, who wanted to use a banned type of medicinal cannabis to treat their epilepsy. Lord Hague - who is now the most high profile political figure to support legalising cannabis - said the debate about Billy was ""one of those illuminating moments when a longstanding policy is revealed to be inappropriate, ineffective and utterly out of date"". He said the war on cannabis had been ""irreversibly lost"" and a change of policy was needed. Cannabis is not recognised as having any therapeutic value under the law in England and Wales and anyone buying or using it can be arrested or jailed. Only one cannabis-based medical product - Sativex - can be legally prescribed in limited circumstances usually to help alleviate the symptoms of multiple sclerosis and the government is open to further applications. William Hague was Tory leader between 1997 and 2001 The Royal College of Psychiatrists makes clear that legalisation for recreational and medicinal use are distinct issues. It says cannabis carries significant mental health risks but it supports the medicinal use of approved cannabis products. Campaigners against legalisation argue that it would normalise the use of drugs among children and lead to greater addiction and health problems. Prime Minister Theresa May last year vowed to continue the ""war on drugs,"" saying ""the incredible damage [drugs] can do to families and the individuals concerned"".

"Teachers leaving the profession outnumber new recruits, the figures suggest The number of teachers working in state-funded schools in England has fallen to its lowest level since 2013, official statistics show. Last year, 451,900 full time equivalent teachers were working in English state schools, compared with 457,000 in 2016. Teacher numbers have not been lower since 2013, according tofigures published on Thursday by the Department for Education,external. The government said recruiting more teachers was a top priority. Until last year, teacher numbers had been rising steadily. In 2011, there were 440,000 teachers in English schools, reaching 449,000 by 2013, and 457,000 by 2016 - but last year the number fell sharply. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the largest teachers' union, the NEU, said the statistics would make ""grim reading"" for Education Secretary Damian Hinds. She said qualified teachers leaving the profession outnumbered new recruits. ""We are losing teachers too quickly, undoubtedly because the government is burning them out with an excessive workload and they can earn more and have a better work-life balance in another profession."" Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT union, said parents would be particularly concerned that the teacher shortage coincided with evidence of increasing class sizes. Separate government figures, also published on Thursday,,externalshow the number of pupils in England's schools continues to rise, with secondary schools affected for the fourth year in a row. There are now 66,000 more children in England's schools, compared with last year. Some of the increase is in primaries but most of it is in secondaries, where overall numbers have risen 35,400 as the baby boom of the early 2000s makes the transition. The figures suggest the staffing crisis means teachers increasingly lack university-level qualifications in the subjects they teach, with more than a third of physics teachers and almost a quarter of chemistry teachers without a relevant higher education qualification in the subjects. A spokesman for the Department for Education pointed out that an additional 32,000 trainee teachers had been recruited last year. ""Teacher recruitment will always be challenging in a strong economy with record numbers of jobs,"" he said. ""But we know there is more to do, which is why the education secretary has made it his top priority to make sure teaching remains an attractive and fulfilling profession."" Mr Hindshas already promised to cut teachers' workload and to reduce their ""bureaucratic burden"". Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school leaders' union NAHT, said ministers had until recently failed to heed warnings about staffing. He urged ministers ""to address the root causes of the problem, which sees too few new recruits entering the system and too many experienced hands leaving prematurely"". ""Paying teachers' properly for the essential work they do, not overloading them with work, and giving them access to proper professional development throughout their careers are the key steps that the government needs to take. And they need to do it fast,"" said Mr Whiteman.
