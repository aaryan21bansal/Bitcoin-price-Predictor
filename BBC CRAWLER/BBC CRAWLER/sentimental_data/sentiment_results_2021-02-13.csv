"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he will set out ""as much detail"" as he can give in his lockdown road map on 22 February Boris Johnson has said he is ""optimistic"" he will be able to set out plans later this month for a ""cautious"" easing of England's lockdown. The prime minister said ""huge progress"" had been made with the rollout of vaccines, with ministers hopeful that schools can reopen from 8 March. After this, the government would look to open non-essential shops and then later the hospitality sector, he said. It comes as scientists warned against easing lockdown measures too quickly. Mr Johnson will set out his ""road map"" out of lockdown on 22 February. So far, more than 14.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine,according to Saturday's government figures,external. The government is aiming to offer a first jab to everyone in thetop four priority groups,external- about 15 million people - by Monday. The figures also show a further 612 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, taking the total number of deaths by that measure to 116,908. Hancock: We could live with Covid 'like we do flu' Over-70s urged to get vaccine as UK nears target Jab trialled for people who cannot be vaccinated Speaking at a visit to the Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies plant in Billingham, Teesside, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm optimistic, I won't hide it from you. I'm optimistic but we have to be cautious."" Setting out the government's priorities, he said: ""Our children's education is our number one priority, but then working forward, getting non-essential retail open as well and then, in due course, as and when we can prudently and cautiously, of course we want to be opening hospitality as well. ""I will be trying to set out as much as I possibly can in as much detail as I can, always understanding that we have to be wary of the pattern of disease. ""We don't want to be forced into any kind of retreat or reverse ferret,"" the PM added. He also echoed comments made earlier by Health Secretary Matt Hancock thatCovid-19 could become an illness that we live with - like the flu - by the end of the year. ""A nasty disease like this will roll through. A new disease like this will take time for humanity to adapt to, but we are,"" Mr Johnson said. ""I do think that in due time it will become something that we simply live with. Some people will be more vulnerable than others - that's inevitable."" Mr Hancocktold the Daily Telegraph,externalthat he hoped new drugs by the end of 2021 could make Covid a ""treatable disease"", and one that we live with ""like we do the flu"". This suggested that he was ruling out a ""zero Covid"" strategy, aimed at eliminating the virus entirely from the UK. However, scientists said coronavirus mutations were getting ""more dangerous"" and ""more infectious"" and warned against treating it like the flu. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Dr Sarah Pitt, a virologist at the University of Brighton, told the BBC: ""It's not a type of flu. It's not the same sort of virus. It doesn't cause the same sort of disease, it's very, very nasty."" She added: ""The mutations, the variations, that we're seeing are becoming more infectious, not less infectious and a bit more dangerous, not less dangerous."" Prof Steven Riley, a member of the SPI-M modelling group, told BBC Radio 4 Today: ""If for some reason we were to choose to just pretend it (coronavirus) wasn't here anymore, then there is the potential to go back to a wave that is a similar size to the one that we are in now."" Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said vaccines were ""doing what we wanted them to do"", particularly among the very elderly and vulnerable, who were among the first to receive the jab. Although acknowledging that it was ""desperately important"" for schools to return and society to reopen, he cautioned against getting into a cycle ""where we are constantly opening up and then closing down again and everything is very unstable"". ""It's worse to open up, have another wave of pandemic, another bunch of hospitalisations and have to close down again than to be able to progressively normalise things,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. NHS Confederation chairman Lord Victor Adebowale said 8 March for schools could still be too soon, adding that the NHS workforce was ""on its knees"". ""I understand the pressure to open schools. We need to do so very safely. I think mid or late March is when we should be reassessing. ""We have had a number of false dawns when we have set dates, taken the action, then find ourselves having to row back very quickly,"" Lord Adebowale told Today. But the prime minister is facing calls from some MPs in his party to ease restrictions. Meanwhile, UK Hospitality said for every week the hospitality sector remains shut down more companies are being placed in jeopardy and millions of jobs across hospitality and the supply chain are being put at risk. The trade association's chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: ""That is why we urge the prime minister to work with us on delivering a safe, swift and sustainable exit from lockdown for hospitality.""

"This video can not be played People in Yangon surround security vehicles to prevent police arrests People in Myanmar are reacting with defiance as authorities use night-time raids to arrest opponents of the military coup. Video footage showed people banging pots and pans to warn their neighbours of approaching security forces. Mass protests have taken place since the military seized control of the South East Asian country on 1 February. The army announced on Saturday that arrest warrants had been issued for seven prominent opposition campaigners. They are wanted under the rarely used charge of ""disturbing tranquillity"". One of them, Min Ko Naing, was one of the student leaders involved in the failed 1988 uprising against the then-military dictator. He has appeared in a social media video denouncing the use of night-time raids to make arrests. Myanmar: What will the military do now? The shooting of a young protester 'Down with the military - release our leaders!' The United Nations human rights office said on Friday that more than 350 people had been arrested since the coup. The country's elected leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, is under house arrest. This video can not be played Myanmar coup: How did we get here? The military on Saturday also suspended laws requiring court orders for detaining people longer than 24 hours and for searching private property. BBC Burmese journalist Nyein Chan Aye said people in Myanmar were feeling ""extremely insecure, anxious and uncertain about what will happen next"". ""Sleepless nights are becoming common here in Myanmar. Security forces are raiding people's residences in many places across the country and trying to arrest those who are against the military junta. People are protecting each other, staying up late at night,"" he said. In the country's biggest city, Yangon, footage showed people chanting and alerting neighbours as security vehicles approached. In a video shared with Reuters news agency, crowds could be seen surrounding and marching alongside police vehicles. The videographer told the news agency the crowd had at least once made the police turn back from driving in the direction of West Yangon Hospital. Other footage showed people gathering in Yangon to demand the release of a teacher who had reportedly been detained, and banging pots and pans when they thought police units were conducting raids to arrest people. As people took to the streets for the eighth consecutive day on Saturday, protesters chanted: ""Stop arresting people at night-time."" Mass protests in Myanmar entered their second week on Saturday Internet memes captioned ""Our nights aren't safe anymore"" have been circulating on social media. Phil Robertson, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division, told the BBC there were ""more and more night-time raids"" taking place in Myanmar, in which people were dragged from their homes in the middle of the night. ""We have neighbourhoods now who are trying to organise. They're using pot banging when it looks like the police or military are coming into the area. It really has become a situation where the crackdown is now going after anybody that the military identifies as leaders of these protests,"" he said. Myanmar group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners has also voiced concern about overnight arrests. ""Family members are left with no knowledge of the charges, location, or condition of their loved ones. These are not isolated incidents, and night-time raids are targeting dissenting voices,"" it said in a statement. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was long considered a pariah state while under the rule of an oppressive military junta from 1962 to 2011 A gradual liberalisation began in 2010, leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government led by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year In 2017, Myanmar's army responded to attacks on police by Rohingya militants with a deadly crackdown, driving more than half a million Rohingya Muslims across the border into Bangladesh in what the UN later called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" Aung San Suu Kyi and her government were overthrown in an army coup on 1 February following a landslide NLD win in November's election Yangon residents obstruct night-time arrests.

"Prof Dominic Dwyer said the team only received a summary of key data China refused to hand over key data to the World Health Organization (WHO) team investigating the origins of Covid-19, one of its members has said. Microbiologist Dominic Dwyer told Reuters, the Wall St Journal and the New York Times the team requested raw patient data from early cases, what he called ""standard practice"". He said they only received a summary. China has not responded to the allegation but has previously insisted it was transparent with the WHO. The US has urged China to make available data from the earliest stages of the outbreak, saying it has ""deep concerns"" about the WHO report. Last week, the WHO team concludedit was ""extremely unlikely"" that the coronavirus leaked from a labin the city of Wuhan, dismissing a controversial theory that emerged last year. Wuhan was the first place in the world where the virus was detected, in late 2019. Since then, more than 106 million cases and 2.3 million deaths have been reported worldwide. Wuhan: City of silence 'Wuhan whistleblower' remembered one year on Wuhan marks its anniversary with triumph and denial The investigators had asked for raw data on the 174 identified cases of Covid-19 from Wuhan in December 2019,,externalProfessor Dwyer told Reuters. Only half of the early cases had been exposed to the seafood market where the virus was initially detected. ""That's why we've persisted to ask for that,"" Prof Dwyer said. ""Why that doesn't happen, I couldn't comment. Whether it's political or time or it's difficult... But whether there are any other reasons why the data isn't available, I don't know. One would only speculate."" Thea Kolsen Fischer, a Danish immunologist who was also part of the WHO team, told the New York Times thatshe saw the investigation as ""highly geopolitical"",external. ""Everybody knows how much pressure there is on China to be open to an investigation and also how much blame there might be associated with this,"" she said. Prof Dwyer said the restrictions on data would be mentioned in the WHO team's final report, which could be released as early as next week. The team arrived in early January and spent four weeks in China - the first two in hotel quarantine. This video can not be played Covid-19 and Wuhan: Why don't we know more? Beijing has insisted it was transparent with the WHO investigators, whose visit began only after months of negotiations. The experts were closely monitored by the Chinese authorities. The US accused China of hiding the extent of the initial outbreak and criticised the terms of the visit, which restricted the freedom of the WHO team to travel and interview witnesses, including community members, on health grounds. The investigators told the New York Times that disagreements, including over access to patient records, were so tense that they sometimes erupted into shouting matches. Last month, an interim report from the WHO criticised China's initial response, saying that ""public health measures could have been applied more forcefully"". The WHO team has also called for further investigation into the possibility of ""cold chain"" transmission, referring to the theory the virus could have spread through the transport and trade of frozen food. Dr Peter Daszak, a member of the WHO team, said the focus on where the origins that led to Covid-19 might be, could be shifted to South East Asia.

"""Significant gaps"" remain in the hotel quarantine plan that comes into force on Monday, Heathrow Airport has said. Travellers arriving in England from 33 high-risk countries will be required to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. But the airport said ministers needed to ensure appropriate measures were in place to avoid compromising the safety of passengers and airport staff. The government said it was working closely with airports and hotels to manage any issues that arose. How England's hotel quarantine will differ from Australia's Hotel quarantine site taken down after launch What are the new rules and fines for foreign travel? UK nationals and Irish residents returning from the""red list"",external- mainly consisting of countries in South America and Africa, plus Portugal - will have to quarantine in government-sanctioned hotels to try to stop new coronavirus variants entering the country. They will have to pay Â£1,750 for their stay, which covers the cost of the hotel, transport and testing, and book it in advance using agovernment portal,external. Those who fail to quarantine in such hotels face fines of Â£5,000 to Â£10,000, while anyone who lies on their passenger locator form about having been in a country on the red list faces a prison sentence of up to 10 years. But, less than two days away from the measures coming into effect, Heathrow said it had yet to receive ""necessary reassurances"" from the government. A spokesman said: ""We have been working hard with the government to try to ensure the successful implementation of the policy from Monday, but some significant gaps remain. ""Ministers must ensure there is adequate resource and appropriate protocols in place for each step of the full end-to-end process from aircraft to hotel to avoid compromising the safety of passengers and those working at the airport."" The airport is one of five in England where people requiring hotel quarantine can enter the UK and is expected to receive the largest number of passengers. The other four are Gatwick, London City, Birmingham and Farnborough Airfield. Regulations for the hotel quarantine measures, which come into force from 04:00 on Monday, havehave now been published,external. But on Friday the Immigration Services Union said its officials hadyet to receive guidance on how the system would work. The union said officials still did not know what levels of checks they should be conducting on travellers. It also raised concerns about the safety of security halls. And the GMB union has warned that ""rushed"" government plans are not thorough enough to make sure workers on the front line in quarantine hotels are protected. The union said security guards were one of the occupations worst hit by Covid deaths, adding that it wanted to meet employers to develop a strategy to better protect workers.

Beckie Morris, 30, planned to repatriate to the UK with husband Matthew and their five-week-old daughter, but they now face a quarantine bill of thousands of pounds if they do.

I tried to reach out, and I know it's still really early days, but there's just no information. ""They haven't really laid out what actually happens when you get to that hotel and I don't think that's going to be known until the first person goes in there. ""People shouldn't be used as guinea pigs - especially not paying that amount, that is an extortionate amount of money."" A government spokeswoman said: ""Every essential check - from pre-departure testing to the passenger locator form - will help prevent the importing of new coronavirus variants into the UK.

"The storming of the US Capitol last month left five people dead, over 100 police officers injured and millions of dollars in damage to the building. Most of the rioters were allowed to leave the building without facing arrest, but a month-long search for offenders has resulted in charges against a reported 221 people. Among those arrested, there have been state lawmakers, military veterans and even a gold medal-winning Olympian. Here's a closer look at who conducted the siege and why. Far-right insignia was spotted on the clothing, badges and flags of several insurrectionists, but the vast majority of the 200-plus people charged so far are ordinary pro-Trump activists. So far, only about 10% of those charged have been found to have ties to organised far right militias or other right-wing extremist groups. ""What we are dealing with here is not merely a mix of right-wing organisations, but a broader mass movement with violence at its core,"" wrote Dr Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security & Threats. Dr Pape led a 22-person research team from the University of Chicago in a study - titled Faces of the American Insurrection - that takes a closer look at who has been arrested since 6 January. 'Like a medieval battle': The riots frontline Canada labels Proud Boys a terrorist entity The report found that FBI arrests of violent right-wingers over the past five years were almost five times as likely to uncover militia and gang connections as those arising from the violence on 6 January. At least 12 people linked to the Proud Boys - an all-male group with a history of street violence against left-wing opponents - currently face charges. It includes prominent members like a leading organiser of its Hawaii branch, a self-proclaimed ""sergeant in arms"" and a former US Army captain who ran for a seat in a state legislature. Bomb-making manuals were located in the home of one arrested Proud Boy. Another was a self-professed white supremacist who had previously expressed his desire to become a ""lone wolf killer"". Other extremists had connections with militant anti-government groups such as the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters and the Aryan Nations, several of whom have military experience. One arrested Three Percenter - Guy Wesley Reffitt, 48, a drilling rig worker from Texas - reportedly threatened his children, saying: ""If you turn me in, you're a traitor and you know what happens to traitors...traitors get shot."" The mob was largely pro-Trump, but they came from all parts of the country. The rioters facing federal charges hail from 41 out of the 50 US states and the District of Columbia, according to theGeorge Washington University extremism tracker,external. The University of Chicago report finds that most of the insurrectionists came from large urban counties where Joe Biden beat Donald Trump by slim-to-moderate margins in the 2020 election. These counties typically contain big and racially diverse populations. Only a few came from pro-Trump strongholds. ""This will come as a surprise to many Biden supporters, who presumably think that the insurrectionists are coming from red counties - rural, almost completely white, and with high unemployment - far from Biden strongholds,"" said Dr Pape. ""This is fundamentally a political movement, one not only centred in ""red"" parts of the country, but also consisting of pro-Trump supporters who are in the political minority in many places."" Much like other right-wing activists arrested for deadly violence since 2015, the protesters facing charges have been predominantly white and male. But whereas the extremists charged from 2015 to 2020 were mostly under the age of 35, two thirds of those facing charges for the Capitol attack are over the age of 35. ""As the data started to roll in, the very first surprise was the age because the last thing I was expecting was for the median age to be around 40,"" said Dr Pape. He noted the average age for those involved in political violence around the world is late 20s to early 30s. ""With political violence, we think that individuals will age out of it. They'll grow up, get married, have kids and become less politically violent,"" he explained. This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol More than four-fifths of them are employed and come from various backgrounds, from business owners to white collar professionals. There is Dr Simone Gold, 55, from Beverly Hills, California, who was among a group of doctors that last year spread misleading claims about the coronavirus, including that hydroxychloroquine - a drug touted relentlessly by Mr Trump - was an effective treatment. Jenna Ryan - a real estate broker from Dallas, Texas - garnered attention on social media after she flew to DC by private jet to join the march to the Capitol. Cogensia - an Illinois-based marketing company - fired its chief executive Bradley Rukstales, after he was federally charged for being a part of the violent mob. ""What that means is there's more at work here than the usual drivers like unemployment and you can count less on usual solutions like 'give them a job',"" said Dr Pape. Some of those involved in storming the Capitol have suggested they were at least partially motivated by Donald Trump. Jacob Chansley - the ""QAnon shaman"" from Arizona who wore a Viking pelt to the riot - told the FBI he was in DC ""at the request of President Trump"". A lawyer for Robert Bauer, a Kentucky man, said he ""marched to the US Capitol because President Trump said to do so"". In an FBI interview, Valerie Elaine Ehrke from Northern California said she heard President Trump tell the crowd to go to the US Capitol and ""decided she wanted to be part of the crowd, and she walked to the US Capitol"", according to court documents. Some have argued in court that they went to the riot because Donald Trump told them to Several have indicated they believed the election was not over and there was still a path to preventing the results from being certified. This false claim was repeatedly made by Mr Trump since his election defeat and - prior to the riot - he told gathered supporters at a rally near the White House that he ""won by a landslide"". With the second impeachment trial of Mr Trump starting this week, these statements may form the backbone of the prosecution's case as they try to prove the former president was ""personally responsible"" for inciting an insurrection. The Pentagon has acknowledged that ""some of the extremists who stormed the US Capitol on January 6 were active duty service members and others were military veterans."" Although it has not released exact numbers, Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin will institute a one-day military ""stand down"" in the next two months to address the issue of extremism in its ranks. This video can not be played The terror of being trapped in the US Capitol - three eyewitness accounts of politicians The New York Times has discovered at least two current military members, and 20 veterans that have been charged. One veteran - Larry Rendall Brock Jr, 53 - was pictured in combat gear and carrying zip-tie handcuffs. He had repeatedly posted on social media about the Three Percenters and Oath Keepers militias. Two others who face charges - Thomas Robertson and Jacob Fracker - previously served in the US Army and were also active members of the Rocky Mount Police Department in Virginia. It remains unclear how many off-duty police officers may have been involved, but reports suggest that at least 31 police officers from agencies across the US are under investigation for their alleged participation in the protest and the eventual mob violence at the Capitol.

"The government is scrapping a cap of Â£95,000 on public sector redundancy payments, after court action by trade unions. Ministers say they are looking for new ways to tackle excessive pay-outs for higher earners. Those who have left their jobs since the change was introduced in November should be reimbursed the shortfall. A Treasury spokesman said the cap was withdrawn due to ""the unintended consequences"" it had on employees. They added that the government remained committed to bringing forward proposals to tackle unjustified exit payments. What are my rights if I am made redundant? The cap came into force last November, with the aim of ensuring exit payments represented value for money and were fair to taxpayers. But unions had fought the move, seeking a judicial review into the regulations. Unison said the rules, meant to prevent excessive payments to the highest earners, would have hit ordinary workers. Unite said long-serving public servants earning relatively low salaries of Â£25,000 a year would have been affected, and welcomed the decision to remove the cap. Newly published guidance,externalfrom the Treasury encourages employers to pay any former workers who left between 4 November and 12 February the amount they would have received without the cap. Unison general secretary Christina McAnea described the cap as ""damaging"", saying it had ""threatened to blight the retirement of millions of workers"". ""Through no fault of their own, long-serving staff over the age of 55 and facing redundancy would have been hit by the regulation,"" she added. ""Because they're obliged to take their pensions if they lose their jobs, when combined with redundancy payments the final amount could have exceeded the Â£95,000 cap."" Announcing the cap in 2015, the government said it wanted to significantly reduce the cost to the taxpayer of public sector pay-offs,which totalled about Â£6.5bn between 2011-12 and 2013-14,external. More than Â£1bn of this cost came as a result of exit payments costing more than Â£100,000, it said. The BBC introduced a Â£150,000 maximum limit on redundancy payments in 2013 following criticism of severance packages paid to some departing senior executives.

"Former President Trump is acquitted at his impeachment trial over the deadly attack on the US Capitol Trump faced a single charge of inciting a mob of his supporters to ransack Congress Fifty-seven senators voted to convict him - 10 short of the number needed to convict Seven Republicans turned against their former president Top Republican Mitch McConnell lambasted Trump's election 'lies' But said he could not convict him because he is now a private citizen Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the Republicans 'cowards' A statement from Trump called the verdict a witch hunt but vowed to carry on the fight Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thanks for joining us for the dramatic final day of Donald Trump's second impeachment trial. You can follow further updates to the storyhere. Here are the key moments from today:  Today's editor was Tom Geoghegan and writers were Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady and Holly Honderich. For President Joe Biden, the impeachment of Donald Trump has meant starting his first term competing for headlines with his predecessor. Now the Democrat is hoping to take the focus back to his administration's coronavirus response. With Trump's trial officially behind him, Biden's team has scheduled a televised town hall focusing on Covid on Wednesday in Wisconsin, with a trip to Michigan on Thursday to tour a vaccine-production facility. Since becoming president, Biden has made the pandemic central to his agenda. Last week, his White House secured deals for 200 million more vaccine doses, and said that 300 million people will be vaccinated by the end of July.  We've just been discussing the future of the seven Republicans who voted to convict. It's only been a couple of hours since the Senate took its vote, but they are already facing a backlash from within their party. The former president's son, Donald Trump Jr, posted on Twitter suggesting that there be an impeachment for the ""RINOS"" - Republicans in name only - an insult frequently favoured by his father. And Fox TV host Laura Ingraham has predicted that ""None of the Republicans who voted in the affirmative today will speak at the 2024 GOP Convention"" - where speaker slots indicate who holds the power in the party. As Democrats keep telling us: this was the most bipartisan impeachment vote in US history. Seven Republican Senators crossed party lines and voted to convict. So what awaits them now? For two of them, the political consequences won't matter very much.Pat Toomeyof Pennsylvania andRichard Burrof North Carolina are both retiring. Three others -Susan Collins, Ben SasseandBill Cassidy- were just elected in November and so will have six more years to win back any voters angered by their decision today. Mitt Romneyhas less time - he is up for election again in 2024. But as a moderate and long-time critic of Trump, he's never been a favourite of his party's more right-wing voters, and is very popular in his home state of Utah. Lisa Murkowskiof Alaska has even less time - she'll face voters again in 2022. But much like Romney, she has long endeared herself to voters there with her moderate approach, and the open primary system in Alaska makes her a strong candidate. Senate Republican Lindsey Graham told reporters he will meet former President Donald Trump in the coming weeks to discuss ""the future of the Republican Party"". On the heels of the 6 January riots and a second impeachment trial, there are real tensions in the party about the way ahead. Graham said he was looking ahead to 2022, and his party's chances of gaining seats in the House and Senate. Both are currently controlled by the Democrats. ""For that to happen, Trump's got to work with everybody,"" he said. And Graham's not the only one with the former president's ear. Last month, Representative Kevin McCarthy flew to Florida to meet Trump. Both meetings point to the former president's lingering power in the Republican party. Democratic House managers left the Senate chamber for the last time Trump's defence team hugs after the acquittal Trump's defence team, including Michael van der Veen (right) take the Senate subway post-trial Republican leader Mitch McConnell departs the chamber In the same press conference, she also hit back at Mitch McConnell for justifying his vote to acquit on the fact Trump was out of office. Pelosi says the Democrats had prepared their case for the trial with several days still left in his presidency, but it was McConnell who caused the delay. Mitch McConnell ""created the situation where it could not have
been heard"" before Trump was out of office, she says. Democrats ""didn't choose"" to wait, she says. Speaking to reporters, Pelosi rejects the idea of censuring Donald Trump - a far lesser punishment than impeachment. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have floated the proposal in recent days, as it became clear Trump would be acquitted in an impeachment trial. Censure would be ""a slap in the face of the Constitution"", Pelosi says, calling the Senators who voted to acquit ""cowardly"". ""We censure people for using stationary for the wrong purpose,"" she says. ""We don't censure people for inciting insurrection that kills people in the Capitol.""  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter If every Senate Republican had their own political calculation to make before casting their vote - weighing whether to risk the ire of their party or the judgement of general election voters - one particular senatorâs drama was on particularly stark display. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, leader of his party in the Senate, had been outspoken for weeks in his criticism of Donald Trumpâs conduct on 6 January. For a while, his final vote in the trial was in doubt. On Saturday morning, however, he informed his fellow senators he would support acquittal. After the Senate rendered its final verdict, he explained why. He condemned Trumpâs behaviour and said he engaged in a âdisgraceful dereliction of duty.â âThereâs no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,â McConnell said. His not guilty vote, he said, was because former presidents were not eligible for impeachment trials. If such a precedent were followed, he said, any private citizen - regardless of status - could be impeached and ruled ineligible for public office by the Congress. McConnellâs critics will view that as a cop-out, not a principled stand. And it is noteworthy that his procedural objection allows him to avoid being out of step with the majority of Senate Republicans, which is a risky place for a congressional leader to be. Itâs a fine line for McConnell to walk, and time will tell if his fellow Republicans are satisfied with his vote, if not his words. Read more from Anthony. Here's a glance at what conservative Twitter is saying post-trial. Donald Trump Jr, the former president's eldest son, was quick to weigh in on all that his father is doing right, with a meme to boot. Conservative punditLaura Ingrahamaccused Democrats of not caring about the law, just ""political points"". Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist, deemed it all a waste of time. ButRod Dreher, a senior editor at the American Conservative, instead agreed with Democrat Chuck Schumer, saying Republicans had disgraced themselves. Allow Twitter content?

McConnell continues his criticism of the former president. ""Trump is still liable for everything he did while in office,"" McConnell notes. ""He didn't get away with anything he did, yet. Yet. We have a criminal justice system in this country. ""We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one."" Senators Burr and Murkowski We were expecting at least four Republican senators to side with Democrats at the end of this trial, and we ended up with seven. SenatorRichard Burr,of North Carolina, andPat Toomeyof Pennsylvania are the two unexpected additions to the list. SenatorBill Cassidyof Louisiana was slightly less of a surprise, as he did vote to advance the trial. Burr, who is retiring, said in a statement after the vote that he believed it was unconstitutional to impeach a president who was no longer in office, but once the Senate set the precedent that it was within the law, he listened to the facts as an impartial juror. ""The facts are clear,"" he said. ""As I said on January 6th, the president bears responsibility for these tragic events. The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection against a co-equal branch of government."" Burr concludes that he did not make the decision lightly, but Trump ""violated his oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"". As for Cassidy, he kept his statement to the point: ""Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty."" Senator Toomey has not issued a statement yet, but Politico reporter Olivia Beavers tweeted that he described it as the ""right call"" to convict and did not comment further. This video can not be played McConnell explains how he finds Trump responsible but voted to acquit Republican Minority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell is delivering remarks now. Once a Trump ally, McConnell bluntly criticises him for promoting unsubstantiated theories about election fraud, and then for not doing his job ""as the chaos unfolded"" on 6 January. ""With police officers bleeding and broken glass covering Capitol floors, he kept repeating election lies and praising the criminals,"" McConnell says. The veteran Republican adds that Trump supporters who use the millions of votes he received in the election as a deflection is an ""absurd"" argument, because ""74 million Americans did not invade the Capitol. Hundreds of rioters did"". After his uncommon attack on a fellow Republican, McConnell gets into why he did not, then, vote to convict. He says impeachment is a ""narrow tool for a narrow purpose"". ""If President Trump were still in office I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge."" But McConnell says his understanding of the Constitution finds that only the president, vice-president and civil officers can be convicted: ""We have no power to convict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen"". ""If removal [from current office] becomes impossible,"" he continues, ""conviction becomes insensible."" Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Capitol Hill It was the verdict everyone expected, but the day was not without its drama. Seven Republicans voted along with Democrats to convict Donald Trump of inciting the violent attack on the Capitol last month. In the end, they didnât get the two-thirds majority they needed. Still, this is a historic moment. Trump is the first president to be impeached twice and has set a record with the most votes to convict by members of his own party After Trump was acquitted, first up was the leader of the Democrats in the Senate. ""January 6 will live as a day of infamy in the United States. The failure to convict Donald Trump will live as a vote of infamy in the history of the United States Senate,"" says New York Senator Chuck Schumer. He criticised the 43 senators who voted to acquit Trump who effectively ""signed their names alongside his"" in the history books. The Democratic senator insisted one thing is certain - that Trump's legacy will be embroiled in this scandal forevermore, making it nearly impossible for him to ever hold elected office again. As the senator spoke, however, the Trump team released a statement promising a future for the Make America Great Again movement. Without a conviction, there is nothing barring Trump from holding office again. Whether he runs again remains to be seen. But he will certainly wield his influence in other ways. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The current presidentâs strategy for handling the former presidentâs impeachment trial was to keep the whole ordeal at armâs length. He wasnât closely following the proceedings, White House officials said. During the trial, he kept a busy schedule of events related to the coronavirus pandemic. The Biden administrationâs calculation is that his long-term political fortunes rest on his success in dealing with the pandemic, the economy and the American publicâs other concerns, and not with the outcome of Trumpâs impeachment trial. In the end, the trial had little practical impact on his progress towards enacting his legislative agenda. The Senate lost only three days of business. With the trial concluded, the Senate will resume confirming Bidenâs administration appointments, after it returns from a week recess. All of this should please Biden and his team. If the Democratic base decides, however, that the price of moving forward with Bidenâs political agenda was the failure to hold Trump fully accountable - for instance, by conducting a speedy trial without witnesses - he may pay a political price nevertheless. In the political battles ahead, Biden needs a united Democratic Party. If there is second-guessing after this impeachment trial, cracks might start to emerge. Trump's office released a statement just moments after he was acquitted. ""This has been yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country,"" it reads. He does not mention the 6 January riot, rather reiterates the narrative that Democrats are the party that supports rioters and mobs. ""It is a sad commentary on our times that one political party in America is given a free pass to denigrate the rule of law, defame law enforcement, cheer mobs, excuse rioters..."" He concludes with a look to the future and a promise to his supporters. ""Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun. In the months ahead I have much to share with you, and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people."" This video can not be played Patrick Leahy delivers the verdict Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter New trial, same outcome. Trump once again avoided conviction by the US Senate because his fellow Republicans, by and large, stuck by his side. That, at its most basic level, is a win for the president. He is still eligible to run for president again in 2024, if he so chooses. His base, by all indications, is still largely intact. Trump did not emerge from this impeachment trial unscathed, however. One of the most memorable portions of the prosecution case by House managers were the new videos of Trumpâs supporters, wearing Make America Great Again hats and waving Trump flags, ransacking the Capitol. Those images will forever be associated with the Trump brand. Every rally he holds from here on will evoke memories of that riot. It may not cost him among the Republican rank and file, but independent voters - and moderates - are unlikely to forget. Read Anthony's analysis in full The Senate vote fell short of the threshold required to convict, with 57 in favour and 43 backing acquittal. There were seven Republicans (Senators Sasse, Romney, Burr, Collins, Murkowski, Toomey and Cassidy) joining Democrats to convict on the single charge of incitement. But Democrats needed two-thirds of the Senate to vote guilty to convict, so they were 10 votes short. Impeachment charges are political, not criminal. An impeachment acquittal essentially means the Senate did not find cause to remove a president from office. Of course, Trump is no longer in office. But if Trump had been convicted, the Senate could also have voted to prevent the former president from ever holding office again. The Democratic-led House of Representatives approved the article of impeachment on 13 January, with the support of 10 Republicans. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he will set out ""as much detail"" as he can give in his lockdown road map on 22 February Boris Johnson has said he is ""optimistic"" he will be able to set out plans later this month for a ""cautious"" easing of England's lockdown. The prime minister said ""huge progress"" had been made with the rollout of vaccines, with ministers hopeful that schools can reopen from 8 March. After this, the government would look to open non-essential shops and then later the hospitality sector, he said. It comes as scientists warned against easing lockdown measures too quickly. Mr Johnson will set out his ""road map"" out of lockdown on 22 February. So far, more than 14.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine,according to Saturday's government figures,external. The government is aiming to offer a first jab to everyone in thetop four priority groups,external- about 15 million people - by Monday. The figures also show a further 612 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, taking the total number of deaths by that measure to 116,908. Hancock: We could live with Covid 'like we do flu' Over-70s urged to get vaccine as UK nears target Jab trialled for people who cannot be vaccinated Speaking at a visit to the Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies plant in Billingham, Teesside, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm optimistic, I won't hide it from you. I'm optimistic but we have to be cautious."" Setting out the government's priorities, he said: ""Our children's education is our number one priority, but then working forward, getting non-essential retail open as well and then, in due course, as and when we can prudently and cautiously, of course we want to be opening hospitality as well. ""I will be trying to set out as much as I possibly can in as much detail as I can, always understanding that we have to be wary of the pattern of disease. ""We don't want to be forced into any kind of retreat or reverse ferret,"" the PM added. He also echoed comments made earlier by Health Secretary Matt Hancock thatCovid-19 could become an illness that we live with - like the flu - by the end of the year. ""A nasty disease like this will roll through. A new disease like this will take time for humanity to adapt to, but we are,"" Mr Johnson said. ""I do think that in due time it will become something that we simply live with. Some people will be more vulnerable than others - that's inevitable."" Mr Hancocktold the Daily Telegraph,externalthat he hoped new drugs by the end of 2021 could make Covid a ""treatable disease"", and one that we live with ""like we do the flu"". This suggested that he was ruling out a ""zero Covid"" strategy, aimed at eliminating the virus entirely from the UK. However, scientists said coronavirus mutations were getting ""more dangerous"" and ""more infectious"" and warned against treating it like the flu. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Dr Sarah Pitt, a virologist at the University of Brighton, told the BBC: ""It's not a type of flu. It's not the same sort of virus. It doesn't cause the same sort of disease, it's very, very nasty."" She added: ""The mutations, the variations, that we're seeing are becoming more infectious, not less infectious and a bit more dangerous, not less dangerous."" Prof Steven Riley, a member of the SPI-M modelling group, told BBC Radio 4 Today: ""If for some reason we were to choose to just pretend it (coronavirus) wasn't here anymore, then there is the potential to go back to a wave that is a similar size to the one that we are in now."" Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said vaccines were ""doing what we wanted them to do"", particularly among the very elderly and vulnerable, who were among the first to receive the jab. Although acknowledging that it was ""desperately important"" for schools to return and society to reopen, he cautioned against getting into a cycle ""where we are constantly opening up and then closing down again and everything is very unstable"". ""It's worse to open up, have another wave of pandemic, another bunch of hospitalisations and have to close down again than to be able to progressively normalise things,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. NHS Confederation chairman Lord Victor Adebowale said 8 March for schools could still be too soon, adding that the NHS workforce was ""on its knees"". ""I understand the pressure to open schools. We need to do so very safely. I think mid or late March is when we should be reassessing. ""We have had a number of false dawns when we have set dates, taken the action, then find ourselves having to row back very quickly,"" Lord Adebowale told Today. But the prime minister is facing calls from some MPs in his party to ease restrictions. Meanwhile, UK Hospitality said for every week the hospitality sector remains shut down more companies are being placed in jeopardy and millions of jobs across hospitality and the supply chain are being put at risk.

Your Live Page writers today were Gareth Evans, Victoria Lindrea and Hazel Shearing. The page was edited by Julian Joyce.     British parents living overseas whose children will have to travel back to boarding school in the UK when schools reopen, have pleaded with the government to rethink hotel quarantine rules. Those arriving from countries on the government's red list will be required to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days once new rules are introduced on Monday. With no date confirmed for schools to reopen - but with 8 March clearly in the PM's sights - parents have been left with a difficult choice. Karl Feilder, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, has two daughters, aged 15 and 17, who attend a boarding school near Reading. He said he would not allow his children to return if it meant quarantining in a hotel alone. ""To be perfectly honest, I think anyone in their right mind would not do that with their children. ""The fact that they haven't told us when schools are going back means we can't take the decision now to put them on a plane today or tomorrow to beat the Monday morning deadline. Mr Feilder suggested children returning to the UK should be allowed to quarantine at school, adding: ""The schools are perfectly well able to look after the kids and make sure they're staying put."" ""We're quite happy to do the Covid tests, we're quite happy to do the home quarantine, whatever - just don't lock my children up."" This video can not be played Travel abroad UK: how to fly during a Covid pandemic Portugal has extended the suspension of all flights from the UK and Brazil until at least 1 March. The move comes amid concern over the new variants of Covid-19 identified in the two countries. ""In the context of the epidemiological situation... all flights from Brazil and the United Kingdom"" are suspended, the interior ministry said. Portugal also extended its stricter border controls with neighbouring Spain until 1 March. The average number of daily reported virus cases continues to fall, with a further 13,308 confirmed cases across the UK according to government figures. However, figures are often lower at the weekend, due to a lag in reporting. In addition there were a further 621 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It takes the total number of UK deaths to 116,908. The Iranian president said ""we all have to be vigilant"" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has warned of a potential ""fourth wave"" of cases as infections rise in some areas of the country. He said some cities in the south-western province of Khuzestan were now categorised as ""red"" - the highest alert level. ""This is a warning for all of us,"" President Rouhani said on state television earlier today. ""This means the beginning of moving towards the fourth wave. We all have to be vigilant to prevent this,"" he added. Iran started its vaccination campaign on Tuesday, and the first shipment of doses arrived on February 4. Police bodycam footage captured a man's legs dangling from the loft at a house party in Scarborough A man was discovered hiding at an illegal house party when his legs were spotted dangling from an entrance to a loft, police have said. North Yorkshire Police found the reveller in a ceiling hatch as they attended a report of the gathering in Scarborough. Officers described it as an ""unusual incident"". In January, the force said they were stillbreaking up house parties in the town ""every night""despite lockdown. More than 100 people have now been fined for being at illegal indoor gatherings in the town. ""We're all looking forward to a good party once this is over. In the meantime our officers won't wait for an invitation,"" a spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said. Red Cross workers gathered at Beirut airport ahead of the vaccine delivery The first batches of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will soon arrive in Lebanon, as the country prepares to begin its vaccination programme. The launch will take place at midday on Sunday at the headquarters of the prime minister - where the outgoing premier Hassan Diab will receive the first dose. The purchase of the vaccine is being financed by the World Bank, which says it will ensure a fair and transparent distribution of the first batch of doses. Lebanon has been facing a surge in infections in recent weeks amid a deep economic and political crisis. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""optimistic"" over the easing of lockdown restrictions in England. During a visit to Teesside, Mr Johnson said he will set out ""as much detail"" as he can give in his lockdown roadmap on 22 February, reiterating that his first priority is to reopen schools.  This video can not be played Covid: Boris Johnson 'optimistic' over easing of restrictions The number of patients reporting symptoms of Covid-19 weeks after becoming ill - so-called Long Covid - could be as high as 20%, according to one immunologist. Professor Danny Altmann, from Imperial College London, believes earlier estimates which put the number of people suffering Long Covid at one in 20 - lower than the number now being reported. ""Many people would have 10-20% as their range if you look at the papers on how many people are still reporting significant symptoms several months afterwards,"" he told Times Radio. Prof Altmann added there was ""no absolute correlation"" between severe illness and Long Covid: ""There's plenty of people out there who barely know they had it and never had a PCR test or antibody test who are suffering massively still from long Covid. The immunologist is calling for Long Covid clinics to be opened in the UK, amid warnings it could place a major burden on the NHS. ""The kind of burden I've been suggesting is equivalent to our NHS burden of arthritis, which is one of the biggest causes on our NHS time and expenditure,"" said Prof Altmann. ""It's a real thing to worry and think about for the future."" Symptoms of long Covid include ongoing fatigue, loss of taste or smell, respiratory and cardiovascular problems and mental health issues.   The WHO team are currently at the end of their investigation mission in Wuhan One of the investigators examining the origins of the pandemic has said China refused to give raw data on its early cases to the World Health Organization (WHO) team. ""That's standard practice for an outbreak investigation,"" Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious diseases expert, told the Reuters news agency earlier today. He added that, despite repeated requests, the WHO-led team was only given a summary of the data on more than 170 cases they were interested in from an early outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019. Mr Dwyer said the motive for withholding the raw data was a matter of speculation. ""Whether it's
political or time or it's difficult... I don't know,"" he said. China has insisted it was transparent with the investigators, whose initial findings could be published next week.

Boris Johnson wore a face covering during a visit to a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Stockton-on-Tees During his visit to Teesside, Prime Minister Boris Johnson echoed Health Secretary Matt Hancock, outlining that we will have to ""simply live with"" Covid-19. ""A new disease like this will take time for humanity to adapt to, but we are,"" he said. He said ""new therapies are being discovered the whole time"" to reduce mortality and improve treatments. ""I do think, that in due time, it will become something that we simply live with. Some people will be more vulnerable than others - that's inevitable,"" he said. ""I think the Health Secretary spoke about the autumn. Let's see where we get to."" Boris Johnson has said he is ""optimistic"" that he will be able to start announcing the easing of coronavirus restrictions in England this month, but doesn't want to be ""forced into"" a ""reverse ferret""  - or U-turn - later on. The prime minister is due to lay out his ""roadmap"" out of lockdown on 22 February. ""I'm optimistic, but we have to be cautious,"" he said, during a visit to the plant where the new Novavax vaccine will be made in Billingham, Teesside. He said his first priority remained opening schools in England on 8 March. ""Then working forward, getting non-essential retail open as well and then, in due course, as and when we can, prudently, cautiously of course, we want to be opening hospitality as well,"" he said. ""I will be trying to set out as much as I possibly can, in as much detail as I can, always understanding that we have to be wary of the pattern of disease. We don't want to be forced into any kind of retreat or reverse ferret."" More on that case of the South African variant that was identified in the village of Bramley, near Basingstoke, Hampshire. It means from next week, residents aged over 16 will be asked to come forward for surge-testing in the hope of preventing any further cases of the variant. ""I appreciate that this news may be worrying for the local community, but it's really important to understand that the risk of transmission from this single case is considered to be very low,"" said Simon Bryant, director of public health at Hampshire County Council. Mr Bryant added that there was ""no evidence that this particular variant causes more severe illness, or that the regulated vaccines do not protect against it"". ""The rapid local testing programme is primarily a precautionary measure designed to help the government to better understand and prevent the spread of new variants across the country,"" he said. West Norwood in south London is among the areas in England where the SA variant has been found Newsbeat is taking listeners to the centre of the pandemic, after spending a number of days at Harrogate District hospital in North Yorkshire. The special programme, Life on the front line, talks to staff at the hospital as it weathers its busiest period since last March. Porter Tom covers 10 miles a day, while intensive care nurse Becky works with some of the hospital's sickest Covid patients: ""I wouldn't wish what we have to see on anyone.""  More surge testing is to take place in parts of Middlesbrough - covering the TS7 postcode - in areas of Walsall and in specific areas of the RG26 postcode in Hampshire, after new cases of the South African variant were found. The surge testing is being introduced, in addition to existing testing, to monitor and suppress the spread of the virus after confirmed cases of the SA variant - not associated with international travel - came to light in those regions. In Walsall, the surge testing operation has been extended in response to a confirmed second case of the variant. People living within these targeted areas are strongly encouraged to take a Covid-19 test this week, whether they are showing symptoms or not. Those with symptoms should book a test in the usual way, while those those without symptoms should visit their local authority website for more information. A mobile testing unit will be available in Middlesbrough from Saturday onwards, the council said and urged residents to come forward. Secondary school pupils in Scotland may have to adopt two-metre social distancing rules when they begin a phased return to school later this month. The tougher new social distancing guidelines have been put forward by the government's advisory group on education and children's issues. The advisory group says,externalthe ""additional protective measure"" should also apply on school buses. The two-metre rule is already in place for teachers at secondary schools, while primary pupils should observe it ""whenever possible"". Scotland's youngest pupilsare likely to return full-time from 22 February. Some senior secondary pupils preparing for exams could also be back in the classroom from the same date. Education SecretaryJohn Swinney described the proposals,externalas ""an important scientific and clinical update"". Read more. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Ice-skating fever is gripping the Netherlands. After almost a year of Covid-related restrictions, a nation of ice-skating fanatics are taking a welcome break from the pandemic. Freezing temperatures have seen the canals here ice over, and there is a glimmer of hope that the world's biggest competition on natural ice might just go ahead later this year. The winter activity is not without its risks, however. Firefighters had to rescue more than 10 people in the Hague after a frozen pond they were skating on began to thaw on Friday.

British parents living overseas whose children will have to travel back to boarding school in the UK when schools reopen, have pleaded with the government to rethink hotel quarantine rules. Those arriving from countries on the government's red list will be required to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days once new rules are introduced on Monday. With no date confirmed for schools to reopen - but with 8 March clearly in the PM's sights - parents have been left with a difficult choice. Karl Feilder, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, has two daughters, aged 15 and 17, who attend a boarding school near Reading. He said he would not allow his children to return if it meant quarantining in a hotel alone. ""To be perfectly honest, I think anyone in their right mind would not do that with their children. ""The fact that they haven't told us when schools are going back means we can't take the decision now to put them on a plane today or tomorrow to beat the Monday morning deadline. Mr Feilder suggested children returning to the UK should be allowed to quarantine at school, adding: ""The schools are perfectly well able to look after the kids and make sure they're staying put."" ""We're quite happy to do the Covid tests, we're quite happy to do the home quarantine, whatever - just don't lock my children up.""

The move comes amid concern over the new variants of Covid-19 identified in the two countries. ""In the context of the epidemiological situation... all flights from Brazil and the United Kingdom"" are suspended, the interior ministry said. Portugal also extended its stricter border controls with neighbouring Spain until 1 March. The average number of daily reported virus cases continues to fall, with a further 13,308 confirmed cases across the UK according to government figures. However, figures are often lower at the weekend, due to a lag in reporting. In addition there were a further 621 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It takes the total number of UK deaths to 116,908. The Iranian president said ""we all have to be vigilant"" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has warned of a potential ""fourth wave"" of cases as infections rise in some areas of the country. He said some cities in the south-western province of Khuzestan were now categorised as ""red"" - the highest alert level. ""This is a warning for all of us,"" President Rouhani said on state television earlier today. ""This means the beginning of moving towards the fourth wave. We all have to be vigilant to prevent this,"" he added. Iran started its vaccination campaign on Tuesday, and the first shipment of doses arrived on February 4. Police bodycam footage captured a man's legs dangling from the loft at a house party in Scarborough A man was discovered hiding at an illegal house party when his legs were spotted dangling from an entrance to a loft, police have said. North Yorkshire Police found the reveller in a ceiling hatch as they attended a report of the gathering in Scarborough. Officers described it as an ""unusual incident"". In January, the force said they were stillbreaking up house parties in the town ""every night""despite lockdown. More than 100 people have now been fined for being at illegal indoor gatherings in the town. ""We're all looking forward to a good party once this is over. In the meantime our officers won't wait for an invitation,"" a spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said. Red Cross workers gathered at Beirut airport ahead of the vaccine delivery The first batches of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will soon arrive in Lebanon, as the country prepares to begin its vaccination programme. The launch will take place at midday on Sunday at the headquarters of the prime minister - where the outgoing premier Hassan Diab will receive the first dose. The purchase of the vaccine is being financed by the World Bank, which says it will ensure a fair and transparent distribution of the first batch of doses. Lebanon has been facing a surge in infections in recent weeks amid a deep economic and political crisis. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""optimistic"" over the easing of lockdown restrictions in England. During a visit to Teesside, Mr Johnson said he will set out ""as much detail"" as he can give in his lockdown roadmap on 22 February, reiterating that his first priority is to reopen schools.  This video can not be played Covid: Boris Johnson 'optimistic' over easing of restrictions The number of patients reporting symptoms of Covid-19 weeks after becoming ill - so-called Long Covid - could be as high as 20%, according to one immunologist. Professor Danny Altmann, from Imperial College London, believes earlier estimates which put the number of people suffering Long Covid at one in 20 - lower than the number now being reported. ""Many people would have 10-20% as their range if you look at the papers on how many people are still reporting significant symptoms several months afterwards,"" he told Times Radio. Prof Altmann added there was ""no absolute correlation"" between severe illness and Long Covid: ""There's plenty of people out there who barely know they had it and never had a PCR test or antibody test who are suffering massively still from long Covid. The immunologist is calling for Long Covid clinics to be opened in the UK, amid warnings it could place a major burden on the NHS. ""The kind of burden I've been suggesting is equivalent to our NHS burden of arthritis, which is one of the biggest causes on our NHS time and expenditure,"" said Prof Altmann. ""It's a real thing to worry and think about for the future."" Symptoms of long Covid include ongoing fatigue, loss of taste or smell, respiratory and cardiovascular problems and mental health issues.   The WHO team are currently at the end of their investigation mission in Wuhan One of the investigators examining the origins of the pandemic has said China refused to give raw data on its early cases to the World Health Organization (WHO) team. ""That's standard practice for an outbreak investigation,"" Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious diseases expert, told the Reuters news agency earlier today. He added that, despite repeated requests, the WHO-led team was only given a summary of the data on more than 170 cases they were interested in from an early outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019. Mr Dwyer said the motive for withholding the raw data was a matter of speculation. ""Whether it's
political or time or it's difficult... I don't know,"" he said. China has insisted it was transparent with the investigators, whose initial findings could be published next week.

""A new disease like this will take time for humanity to adapt to, but we are,"" he said. He said ""new therapies are being discovered the whole time"" to reduce mortality and improve treatments. ""I do think, that in due time, it will become something that we simply live with. Some people will be more vulnerable than others - that's inevitable,"" he said. ""I think the Health Secretary spoke about the autumn. Let's see where we get to."" Boris Johnson has said he is ""optimistic"" that he will be able to start announcing the easing of coronavirus restrictions in England this month, but doesn't want to be ""forced into"" a ""reverse ferret""  - or U-turn - later on. The prime minister is due to lay out his ""roadmap"" out of lockdown on 22 February. ""I'm optimistic, but we have to be cautious,"" he said, during a visit to the plant where the new Novavax vaccine will be made in Billingham, Teesside. He said his first priority remained opening schools in England on 8 March. ""Then working forward, getting non-essential retail open as well and then, in due course, as and when we can, prudently, cautiously of course, we want to be opening hospitality as well,"" he said. ""I will be trying to set out as much as I possibly can, in as much detail as I can, always understanding that we have to be wary of the pattern of disease.

Mr Bryant added that there was ""no evidence that this particular variant causes more severe illness, or that the regulated vaccines do not protect against it"".

More surge testing is to take place in parts of Middlesbrough - covering the TS7 postcode - in areas of Walsall and in specific areas of the RG26 postcode in Hampshire, after new cases of the South African variant were found. The surge testing is being introduced, in addition to existing testing, to monitor and suppress the spread of the virus after confirmed cases of the SA variant - not associated with international travel - came to light in those regions. In Walsall, the surge testing operation has been extended in response to a confirmed second case of the variant. People living within these targeted areas are strongly encouraged to take a Covid-19 test this week, whether they are showing symptoms or not. Those with symptoms should book a test in the usual way, while those those without symptoms should visit their local authority website for more information. A mobile testing unit will be available in Middlesbrough from Saturday onwards, the council said and urged residents to come forward.

"Former President Trump is acquitted at his impeachment trial over the deadly attack on the US Capitol Trump faced a single charge of inciting a mob of his supporters to ransack Congress Fifty-seven senators voted to convict him - 10 short of the number needed to convict Seven Republicans turned against their former president Top Republican Mitch McConnell lambasted Trump's election 'lies' But said he could not convict him because he is now a private citizen Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the Republicans 'cowards' A statement from Trump called the verdict a witch hunt but vowed to carry on the fight Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thanks for joining us for the dramatic final day of Donald Trump's second impeachment trial. You can follow further updates to the storyhere. Here are the key moments from today:  Today's editor was Tom Geoghegan and writers were Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady and Holly Honderich. For President Joe Biden, the impeachment of Donald Trump has meant starting his first term competing for headlines with his predecessor. Now the Democrat is hoping to take the focus back to his administration's coronavirus response. With Trump's trial officially behind him, Biden's team has scheduled a televised town hall focusing on Covid on Wednesday in Wisconsin, with a trip to Michigan on Thursday to tour a vaccine-production facility. Since becoming president, Biden has made the pandemic central to his agenda. Last week, his White House secured deals for 200 million more vaccine doses, and said that 300 million people will be vaccinated by the end of July.  We've just been discussing the future of the seven Republicans who voted to convict. It's only been a couple of hours since the Senate took its vote, but they are already facing a backlash from within their party. The former president's son, Donald Trump Jr, posted on Twitter suggesting that there be an impeachment for the ""RINOS"" - Republicans in name only - an insult frequently favoured by his father. And Fox TV host Laura Ingraham has predicted that ""None of the Republicans who voted in the affirmative today will speak at the 2024 GOP Convention"" - where speaker slots indicate who holds the power in the party. As Democrats keep telling us: this was the most bipartisan impeachment vote in US history. Seven Republican Senators crossed party lines and voted to convict. So what awaits them now? For two of them, the political consequences won't matter very much.Pat Toomeyof Pennsylvania andRichard Burrof North Carolina are both retiring. Three others -Susan Collins, Ben SasseandBill Cassidy- were just elected in November and so will have six more years to win back any voters angered by their decision today. Mitt Romneyhas less time - he is up for election again in 2024. But as a moderate and long-time critic of Trump, he's never been a favourite of his party's more right-wing voters, and is very popular in his home state of Utah. Lisa Murkowskiof Alaska has even less time - she'll face voters again in 2022. But much like Romney, she has long endeared herself to voters there with her moderate approach, and the open primary system in Alaska makes her a strong candidate. Senate Republican Lindsey Graham told reporters he will meet former President Donald Trump in the coming weeks to discuss ""the future of the Republican Party"". On the heels of the 6 January riots and a second impeachment trial, there are real tensions in the party about the way ahead. Graham said he was looking ahead to 2022, and his party's chances of gaining seats in the House and Senate. Both are currently controlled by the Democrats. ""For that to happen, Trump's got to work with everybody,"" he said. And Graham's not the only one with the former president's ear. Last month, Representative Kevin McCarthy flew to Florida to meet Trump. Both meetings point to the former president's lingering power in the Republican party. Democratic House managers left the Senate chamber for the last time Trump's defence team hugs after the acquittal Trump's defence team, including Michael van der Veen (right) take the Senate subway post-trial Republican leader Mitch McConnell departs the chamber In the same press conference, she also hit back at Mitch McConnell for justifying his vote to acquit on the fact Trump was out of office. Pelosi says the Democrats had prepared their case for the trial with several days still left in his presidency, but it was McConnell who caused the delay. Mitch McConnell ""created the situation where it could not have
been heard"" before Trump was out of office, she says. Democrats ""didn't choose"" to wait, she says. Speaking to reporters, Pelosi rejects the idea of censuring Donald Trump - a far lesser punishment than impeachment. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have floated the proposal in recent days, as it became clear Trump would be acquitted in an impeachment trial. Censure would be ""a slap in the face of the Constitution"", Pelosi says, calling the Senators who voted to acquit ""cowardly"". ""We censure people for using stationary for the wrong purpose,"" she says. ""We don't censure people for inciting insurrection that kills people in the Capitol.""  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter If every Senate Republican had their own political calculation to make before casting their vote - weighing whether to risk the ire of their party or the judgement of general election voters - one particular senatorâs drama was on particularly stark display. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, leader of his party in the Senate, had been outspoken for weeks in his criticism of Donald Trumpâs conduct on 6 January. For a while, his final vote in the trial was in doubt. On Saturday morning, however, he informed his fellow senators he would support acquittal. After the Senate rendered its final verdict, he explained why. He condemned Trumpâs behaviour and said he engaged in a âdisgraceful dereliction of duty.â âThereâs no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,â McConnell said. His not guilty vote, he said, was because former presidents were not eligible for impeachment trials. If such a precedent were followed, he said, any private citizen - regardless of status - could be impeached and ruled ineligible for public office by the Congress. McConnellâs critics will view that as a cop-out, not a principled stand. And it is noteworthy that his procedural objection allows him to avoid being out of step with the majority of Senate Republicans, which is a risky place for a congressional leader to be. Itâs a fine line for McConnell to walk, and time will tell if his fellow Republicans are satisfied with his vote, if not his words. Read more from Anthony. Here's a glance at what conservative Twitter is saying post-trial. Donald Trump Jr, the former president's eldest son, was quick to weigh in on all that his father is doing right, with a meme to boot. Conservative punditLaura Ingrahamaccused Democrats of not caring about the law, just ""political points"". Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist, deemed it all a waste of time. ButRod Dreher, a senior editor at the American Conservative, instead agreed with Democrat Chuck Schumer, saying Republicans had disgraced themselves. Allow Twitter content?

McConnell continues his criticism of the former president. ""Trump is still liable for everything he did while in office,"" McConnell notes. ""He didn't get away with anything he did, yet. Yet. We have a criminal justice system in this country. ""We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one."" Senators Burr and Murkowski We were expecting at least four Republican senators to side with Democrats at the end of this trial, and we ended up with seven. SenatorRichard Burr,of North Carolina, andPat Toomeyof Pennsylvania are the two unexpected additions to the list. SenatorBill Cassidyof Louisiana was slightly less of a surprise, as he did vote to advance the trial. Burr, who is retiring, said in a statement after the vote that he believed it was unconstitutional to impeach a president who was no longer in office, but once the Senate set the precedent that it was within the law, he listened to the facts as an impartial juror. ""The facts are clear,"" he said. ""As I said on January 6th, the president bears responsibility for these tragic events. The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection against a co-equal branch of government."" Burr concludes that he did not make the decision lightly, but Trump ""violated his oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"". As for Cassidy, he kept his statement to the point: ""Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty."" Senator Toomey has not issued a statement yet, but Politico reporter Olivia Beavers tweeted that he described it as the ""right call"" to convict and did not comment further. This video can not be played McConnell explains how he finds Trump responsible but voted to acquit Republican Minority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell is delivering remarks now. Once a Trump ally, McConnell bluntly criticises him for promoting unsubstantiated theories about election fraud, and then for not doing his job ""as the chaos unfolded"" on 6 January. ""With police officers bleeding and broken glass covering Capitol floors, he kept repeating election lies and praising the criminals,"" McConnell says. The veteran Republican adds that Trump supporters who use the millions of votes he received in the election as a deflection is an ""absurd"" argument, because ""74 million Americans did not invade the Capitol. Hundreds of rioters did"". After his uncommon attack on a fellow Republican, McConnell gets into why he did not, then, vote to convict. He says impeachment is a ""narrow tool for a narrow purpose"". ""If President Trump were still in office I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge."" But McConnell says his understanding of the Constitution finds that only the president, vice-president and civil officers can be convicted: ""We have no power to convict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen"". ""If removal [from current office] becomes impossible,"" he continues, ""conviction becomes insensible."" Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Capitol Hill It was the verdict everyone expected, but the day was not without its drama. Seven Republicans voted along with Democrats to convict Donald Trump of inciting the violent attack on the Capitol last month. In the end, they didnât get the two-thirds majority they needed. Still, this is a historic moment. Trump is the first president to be impeached twice and has set a record with the most votes to convict by members of his own party After Trump was acquitted, first up was the leader of the Democrats in the Senate. ""January 6 will live as a day of infamy in the United States. The failure to convict Donald Trump will live as a vote of infamy in the history of the United States Senate,"" says New York Senator Chuck Schumer. He criticised the 43 senators who voted to acquit Trump who effectively ""signed their names alongside his"" in the history books. The Democratic senator insisted one thing is certain - that Trump's legacy will be embroiled in this scandal forevermore, making it nearly impossible for him to ever hold elected office again. As the senator spoke, however, the Trump team released a statement promising a future for the Make America Great Again movement. Without a conviction, there is nothing barring Trump from holding office again. Whether he runs again remains to be seen. But he will certainly wield his influence in other ways. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The current presidentâs strategy for handling the former presidentâs impeachment trial was to keep the whole ordeal at armâs length. He wasnât closely following the proceedings, White House officials said. During the trial, he kept a busy schedule of events related to the coronavirus pandemic. The Biden administrationâs calculation is that his long-term political fortunes rest on his success in dealing with the pandemic, the economy and the American publicâs other concerns, and not with the outcome of Trumpâs impeachment trial. In the end, the trial had little practical impact on his progress towards enacting his legislative agenda. The Senate lost only three days of business. With the trial concluded, the Senate will resume confirming Bidenâs administration appointments, after it returns from a week recess. All of this should please Biden and his team. If the Democratic base decides, however, that the price of moving forward with Bidenâs political agenda was the failure to hold Trump fully accountable - for instance, by conducting a speedy trial without witnesses - he may pay a political price nevertheless. In the political battles ahead, Biden needs a united Democratic Party. If there is second-guessing after this impeachment trial, cracks might start to emerge. Trump's office released a statement just moments after he was acquitted. ""This has been yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country,"" it reads. He does not mention the 6 January riot, rather reiterates the narrative that Democrats are the party that supports rioters and mobs. ""It is a sad commentary on our times that one political party in America is given a free pass to denigrate the rule of law, defame law enforcement, cheer mobs, excuse rioters..."" He concludes with a look to the future and a promise to his supporters. ""Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun. In the months ahead I have much to share with you, and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people."" This video can not be played Patrick Leahy delivers the verdict Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter New trial, same outcome. Trump once again avoided conviction by the US Senate because his fellow Republicans, by and large, stuck by his side. That, at its most basic level, is a win for the president. He is still eligible to run for president again in 2024, if he so chooses. His base, by all indications, is still largely intact. Trump did not emerge from this impeachment trial unscathed, however. One of the most memorable portions of the prosecution case by House managers were the new videos of Trumpâs supporters, wearing Make America Great Again hats and waving Trump flags, ransacking the Capitol. Those images will forever be associated with the Trump brand. Every rally he holds from here on will evoke memories of that riot. It may not cost him among the Republican rank and file, but independent voters - and moderates - are unlikely to forget. Read Anthony's analysis in full The Senate vote fell short of the threshold required to convict, with 57 in favour and 43 backing acquittal. There were seven Republicans (Senators Sasse, Romney, Burr, Collins, Murkowski, Toomey and Cassidy) joining Democrats to convict on the single charge of incitement. But Democrats needed two-thirds of the Senate to vote guilty to convict, so they were 10 votes short. Impeachment charges are political, not criminal. An impeachment acquittal essentially means the Senate did not find cause to remove a president from office. Of course, Trump is no longer in office. But if Trump had been convicted, the Senate could also have voted to prevent the former president from ever holding office again. The Democratic-led House of Representatives approved the article of impeachment on 13 January, with the support of 10 Republicans. Â© 2025 BBC.

Last week, his White House secured deals for 200 million more vaccine doses, and said that 300 million people will be vaccinated by the end of July.  We've just been discussing the future of the seven Republicans who voted to convict. It's only been a couple of hours since the Senate took its vote, but they are already facing a backlash from within their party. The former president's son, Donald Trump Jr, posted on Twitter suggesting that there be an impeachment for the ""RINOS"" - Republicans in name only - an insult frequently favoured by his father. And Fox TV host Laura Ingraham has predicted that ""None of the Republicans who voted in the affirmative today will speak at the 2024 GOP Convention"" - where speaker slots indicate who holds the power in the party. As Democrats keep telling us: this was the most bipartisan impeachment vote in US history. Seven Republican Senators crossed party lines and voted to convict. So what awaits them now? For two of them, the political consequences won't matter very much.Pat Toomeyof Pennsylvania andRichard Burrof North Carolina are both retiring. Three others -Susan Collins, Ben SasseandBill Cassidy- were just elected in November and so will have six more years to win back any voters angered by their decision today. Mitt Romneyhas less time - he is up for election again in 2024. But as a moderate and long-time critic of Trump, he's never been a favourite of his party's more right-wing voters, and is very popular in his home state of Utah. Lisa Murkowskiof Alaska has even less time - she'll face voters again in 2022. But much like Romney, she has long endeared herself to voters there with her moderate approach, and the open primary system in Alaska makes her a strong candidate. Senate Republican Lindsey Graham told reporters he will meet former President Donald Trump in the coming weeks to discuss ""the future of the Republican Party"". On the heels of the 6 January riots and a second impeachment trial, there are real tensions in the party about the way ahead. Graham said he was looking ahead to 2022, and his party's chances of gaining seats in the House and Senate. Both are currently controlled by the Democrats. ""For that to happen, Trump's got to work with everybody,"" he said. And Graham's not the only one with the former president's ear. Last month, Representative Kevin McCarthy flew to Florida to meet Trump. Both meetings point to the former president's lingering power in the Republican party. Democratic House managers left the Senate chamber for the last time Trump's defence team hugs after the acquittal Trump's defence team, including Michael van der Veen (right) take the Senate subway post-trial Republican leader Mitch McConnell departs the chamber In the same press conference, she also hit back at Mitch McConnell for justifying his vote to acquit on the fact Trump was out of office. Pelosi says the Democrats had prepared their case for the trial with several days still left in his presidency, but it was McConnell who caused the delay. Mitch McConnell ""created the situation where it could not have
been heard"" before Trump was out of office, she says. Democrats ""didn't choose"" to wait, she says. Speaking to reporters, Pelosi rejects the idea of censuring Donald Trump - a far lesser punishment than impeachment. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have floated the proposal in recent days, as it became clear Trump would be acquitted in an impeachment trial. Censure would be ""a slap in the face of the Constitution"", Pelosi says, calling the Senators who voted to acquit ""cowardly"". ""We censure people for using stationary for the wrong purpose,"" she says. ""We don't censure people for inciting insurrection that kills people in the Capitol.""  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter If every Senate Republican had their own political calculation to make before casting their vote - weighing whether to risk the ire of their party or the judgement of general election voters - one particular senatorâs drama was on particularly stark display. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, leader of his party in the Senate, had been outspoken for weeks in his criticism of Donald Trumpâs conduct on 6 January. For a while, his final vote in the trial was in doubt. On Saturday morning, however, he informed his fellow senators he would support acquittal. After the Senate rendered its final verdict, he explained why. He condemned Trumpâs behaviour and said he engaged in a âdisgraceful dereliction of duty.â âThereâs no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,â McConnell said. His not guilty vote, he said, was because former presidents were not eligible for impeachment trials. If such a precedent were followed, he said, any private citizen - regardless of status - could be impeached and ruled ineligible for public office by the Congress. McConnellâs critics will view that as a cop-out, not a principled stand. And it is noteworthy that his procedural objection allows him to avoid being out of step with the majority of Senate Republicans, which is a risky place for a congressional leader to be. Itâs a fine line for McConnell to walk, and time will tell if his fellow Republicans are satisfied with his vote, if not his words. Read more from Anthony. Here's a glance at what conservative Twitter is saying post-trial. Donald Trump Jr, the former president's eldest son, was quick to weigh in on all that his father is doing right, with a meme to boot. Conservative punditLaura Ingrahamaccused Democrats of not caring about the law, just ""political points"". Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist, deemed it all a waste of time. ButRod Dreher, a senior editor at the American Conservative, instead agreed with Democrat Chuck Schumer, saying Republicans had disgraced themselves. Allow Twitter content?

McConnell continues his criticism of the former president. ""Trump is still liable for everything he did while in office,"" McConnell notes. ""He didn't get away with anything he did, yet. Yet. We have a criminal justice system in this country. ""We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one."" Senators Burr and Murkowski We were expecting at least four Republican senators to side with Democrats at the end of this trial, and we ended up with seven. SenatorRichard Burr,of North Carolina, andPat Toomeyof Pennsylvania are the two unexpected additions to the list. SenatorBill Cassidyof Louisiana was slightly less of a surprise, as he did vote to advance the trial. Burr, who is retiring, said in a statement after the vote that he believed it was unconstitutional to impeach a president who was no longer in office, but once the Senate set the precedent that it was within the law, he listened to the facts as an impartial juror. ""The facts are clear,"" he said. ""As I said on January 6th, the president bears responsibility for these tragic events. The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection against a co-equal branch of government."" Burr concludes that he did not make the decision lightly, but Trump ""violated his oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"". As for Cassidy, he kept his statement to the point: ""Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty."" Senator Toomey has not issued a statement yet, but Politico reporter Olivia Beavers tweeted that he described it as the ""right call"" to convict and did not comment further. This video can not be played McConnell explains how he finds Trump responsible but voted to acquit Republican Minority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell is delivering remarks now. Once a Trump ally, McConnell bluntly criticises him for promoting unsubstantiated theories about election fraud, and then for not doing his job ""as the chaos unfolded"" on 6 January. ""With police officers bleeding and broken glass covering Capitol floors, he kept repeating election lies and praising the criminals,"" McConnell says. The veteran Republican adds that Trump supporters who use the millions of votes he received in the election as a deflection is an ""absurd"" argument, because ""74 million Americans did not invade the Capitol. Hundreds of rioters did"". After his uncommon attack on a fellow Republican, McConnell gets into why he did not, then, vote to convict. He says impeachment is a ""narrow tool for a narrow purpose"". ""If President Trump were still in office I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge."" But McConnell says his understanding of the Constitution finds that only the president, vice-president and civil officers can be convicted: ""We have no power to convict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen"". ""If removal [from current office] becomes impossible,"" he continues, ""conviction becomes insensible."" Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Capitol Hill It was the verdict everyone expected, but the day was not without its drama. Seven Republicans voted along with Democrats to convict Donald Trump of inciting the violent attack on the Capitol last month. In the end, they didnât get the two-thirds majority they needed. Still, this is a historic moment. Trump is the first president to be impeached twice and has set a record with the most votes to convict by members of his own party After Trump was acquitted, first up was the leader of the Democrats in the Senate. ""January 6 will live as a day of infamy in the United States. The failure to convict Donald Trump will live as a vote of infamy in the history of the United States Senate,"" says New York Senator Chuck Schumer. He criticised the 43 senators who voted to acquit Trump who effectively ""signed their names alongside his"" in the history books. The Democratic senator insisted one thing is certain - that Trump's legacy will be embroiled in this scandal forevermore, making it nearly impossible for him to ever hold elected office again. As the senator spoke, however, the Trump team released a statement promising a future for the Make America Great Again movement. Without a conviction, there is nothing barring Trump from holding office again. Whether he runs again remains to be seen. But he will certainly wield his influence in other ways. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The current presidentâs strategy for handling the former presidentâs impeachment trial was to keep the whole ordeal at armâs length. He wasnât closely following the proceedings, White House officials said. During the trial, he kept a busy schedule of events related to the coronavirus pandemic. The Biden administrationâs calculation is that his long-term political fortunes rest on his success in dealing with the pandemic, the economy and the American publicâs other concerns, and not with the outcome of Trumpâs impeachment trial. In the end, the trial had little practical impact on his progress towards enacting his legislative agenda. The Senate lost only three days of business. With the trial concluded, the Senate will resume confirming Bidenâs administration appointments, after it returns from a week recess. All of this should please Biden and his team. If the Democratic base decides, however, that the price of moving forward with Bidenâs political agenda was the failure to hold Trump fully accountable - for instance, by conducting a speedy trial without witnesses - he may pay a political price nevertheless. In the political battles ahead, Biden needs a united Democratic Party. If there is second-guessing after this impeachment trial, cracks might start to emerge. Trump's office released a statement just moments after he was acquitted. ""This has been yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country,"" it reads. He does not mention the 6 January riot, rather reiterates the narrative that Democrats are the party that supports rioters and mobs. ""It is a sad commentary on our times that one political party in America is given a free pass to denigrate the rule of law, defame law enforcement, cheer mobs, excuse rioters..."" He concludes with a look to the future and a promise to his supporters. ""Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun. In the months ahead I have much to share with you, and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people."" This video can not be played Patrick Leahy delivers the verdict Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter New trial, same outcome. Trump once again avoided conviction by the US Senate because his fellow Republicans, by and large, stuck by his side. That, at its most basic level, is a win for the president. He is still eligible to run for president again in 2024, if he so chooses. His base, by all indications, is still largely intact. Trump did not emerge from this impeachment trial unscathed, however. One of the most memorable portions of the prosecution case by House managers were the new videos of Trumpâs supporters, wearing Make America Great Again hats and waving Trump flags, ransacking the Capitol. Those images will forever be associated with the Trump brand. Every rally he holds from here on will evoke memories of that riot. It may not cost him among the Republican rank and file, but independent voters - and moderates - are unlikely to forget. Read Anthony's analysis in full The Senate vote fell short of the threshold required to convict, with 57 in favour and 43 backing acquittal. There were seven Republicans (Senators Sasse, Romney, Burr, Collins, Murkowski, Toomey and Cassidy) joining Democrats to convict on the single charge of incitement. But Democrats needed two-thirds of the Senate to vote guilty to convict, so they were 10 votes short. Impeachment charges are political, not criminal. An impeachment acquittal essentially means the Senate did not find cause to remove a president from office. Of course, Trump is no longer in office. But if Trump had been convicted, the Senate could also have voted to prevent the former president from ever holding office again. The Democratic-led House of Representatives approved the article of impeachment on 13 January, with the support of 10 Republicans. Â© 2025 BBC.

British parents living overseas whose children will have to travel back to boarding school in the UK when schools reopen, have pleaded with the government to rethink hotel quarantine rules. Those arriving from countries on the government's red list will be required to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days once new rules are introduced on Monday. With no date confirmed for schools to reopen - but with 8 March clearly in the PM's sights - parents have been left with a difficult choice. Karl Feilder, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, has two daughters, aged 15 and 17, who attend a boarding school near Reading. He said he would not allow his children to return if it meant quarantining in a hotel alone. ""To be perfectly honest, I think anyone in their right mind would not do that with their children. ""The fact that they haven't told us when schools are going back means we can't take the decision now to put them on a plane today or tomorrow to beat the Monday morning deadline. Mr Feilder suggested children returning to the UK should be allowed to quarantine at school, adding: ""The schools are perfectly well able to look after the kids and make sure they're staying put.""

The move comes amid concern over the new variants of Covid-19 identified in the two countries. ""In the context of the epidemiological situation... all flights from Brazil and the United Kingdom"" are suspended, the interior ministry said. Portugal also extended its stricter border controls with neighbouring Spain until 1 March. The average number of daily reported virus cases continues to fall, with a further 13,308 confirmed cases across the UK according to government figures. However, figures are often lower at the weekend, due to a lag in reporting. In addition there were a further 621 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It takes the total number of UK deaths to 116,908.

The purchase of the vaccine is being financed by the World Bank, which says it will ensure a fair and transparent distribution of the first batch of doses.

Professor Danny Altmann, from Imperial College London, believes earlier estimates which put the number of people suffering Long Covid at one in 20 - lower than the number now being reported. ""Many people would have 10-20% as their range if you look at the papers on how many people are still reporting significant symptoms several months afterwards,"" he told Times Radio. Prof Altmann added there was ""no absolute correlation"" between severe illness and Long Covid: ""There's plenty of people out there who barely know they had it and never had a PCR test or antibody test who are suffering massively still from long Covid. The immunologist is calling for Long Covid clinics to be opened in the UK, amid warnings it could place a major burden on the NHS. ""The kind of burden I've been suggesting is equivalent to our NHS burden of arthritis, which is one of the biggest causes on our NHS time and expenditure,"" said Prof Altmann. ""It's a real thing to worry and think about for the future."" Symptoms of long Covid include ongoing fatigue, loss of taste or smell, respiratory and cardiovascular problems and mental health issues.

British parents living overseas whose children will have to travel back to boarding school in the UK when schools reopen, have pleaded with the government to rethink hotel quarantine rules. Those arriving from countries on the government's red list will be required to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days once new rules are introduced on Monday. With no date confirmed for schools to reopen - but with 8 March clearly in the PM's sights - parents have been left with a difficult choice. Karl Feilder, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, has two daughters, aged 15 and 17, who attend a boarding school near Reading. He said he would not allow his children to return if it meant quarantining in a hotel alone. ""To be perfectly honest, I think anyone in their right mind would not do that with their children. ""The fact that they haven't told us when schools are going back means we can't take the decision now to put them on a plane today or tomorrow to beat the Monday morning deadline. Mr Feilder suggested children returning to the UK should be allowed to quarantine at school, adding: ""The schools are perfectly well able to look after the kids and make sure they're staying put."" ""We're quite happy to do the Covid tests, we're quite happy to do the home quarantine, whatever - just don't lock my children up.""

Portugal also extended its stricter border controls with neighbouring Spain until 1 March. The average number of daily reported virus cases continues to fall, with a further 13,308 confirmed cases across the UK according to government figures.

"Former President Trump is acquitted at his impeachment trial over the deadly attack on the US Capitol Trump faced a single charge of inciting a mob of his supporters to ransack Congress Fifty-seven senators voted to convict him - 10 short of the number needed to convict Seven Republicans turned against their former president Top Republican Mitch McConnell lambasted Trump's election 'lies' But said he could not convict him because he is now a private citizen Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called the Republicans 'cowards' A statement from Trump called the verdict a witch hunt but vowed to carry on the fight Edited by Tom Geoghegan Thanks for joining us for the dramatic final day of Donald Trump's second impeachment trial. You can follow further updates to the storyhere. Here are the key moments from today:  Today's editor was Tom Geoghegan and writers were Ritu Prasad, Marianna Brady and Holly Honderich. For President Joe Biden, the impeachment of Donald Trump has meant starting his first term competing for headlines with his predecessor. Now the Democrat is hoping to take the focus back to his administration's coronavirus response. With Trump's trial officially behind him, Biden's team has scheduled a televised town hall focusing on Covid on Wednesday in Wisconsin, with a trip to Michigan on Thursday to tour a vaccine-production facility. Since becoming president, Biden has made the pandemic central to his agenda. Last week, his White House secured deals for 200 million more vaccine doses, and said that 300 million people will be vaccinated by the end of July.  We've just been discussing the future of the seven Republicans who voted to convict. It's only been a couple of hours since the Senate took its vote, but they are already facing a backlash from within their party. The former president's son, Donald Trump Jr, posted on Twitter suggesting that there be an impeachment for the ""RINOS"" - Republicans in name only - an insult frequently favoured by his father. And Fox TV host Laura Ingraham has predicted that ""None of the Republicans who voted in the affirmative today will speak at the 2024 GOP Convention"" - where speaker slots indicate who holds the power in the party. As Democrats keep telling us: this was the most bipartisan impeachment vote in US history. Seven Republican Senators crossed party lines and voted to convict. So what awaits them now? For two of them, the political consequences won't matter very much.Pat Toomeyof Pennsylvania andRichard Burrof North Carolina are both retiring. Three others -Susan Collins, Ben SasseandBill Cassidy- were just elected in November and so will have six more years to win back any voters angered by their decision today. Mitt Romneyhas less time - he is up for election again in 2024. But as a moderate and long-time critic of Trump, he's never been a favourite of his party's more right-wing voters, and is very popular in his home state of Utah. Lisa Murkowskiof Alaska has even less time - she'll face voters again in 2022. But much like Romney, she has long endeared herself to voters there with her moderate approach, and the open primary system in Alaska makes her a strong candidate. Senate Republican Lindsey Graham told reporters he will meet former President Donald Trump in the coming weeks to discuss ""the future of the Republican Party"". On the heels of the 6 January riots and a second impeachment trial, there are real tensions in the party about the way ahead. Graham said he was looking ahead to 2022, and his party's chances of gaining seats in the House and Senate. Both are currently controlled by the Democrats. ""For that to happen, Trump's got to work with everybody,"" he said. And Graham's not the only one with the former president's ear. Last month, Representative Kevin McCarthy flew to Florida to meet Trump. Both meetings point to the former president's lingering power in the Republican party. Democratic House managers left the Senate chamber for the last time Trump's defence team hugs after the acquittal Trump's defence team, including Michael van der Veen (right) take the Senate subway post-trial Republican leader Mitch McConnell departs the chamber In the same press conference, she also hit back at Mitch McConnell for justifying his vote to acquit on the fact Trump was out of office. Pelosi says the Democrats had prepared their case for the trial with several days still left in his presidency, but it was McConnell who caused the delay. Mitch McConnell ""created the situation where it could not have
been heard"" before Trump was out of office, she says. Democrats ""didn't choose"" to wait, she says. Speaking to reporters, Pelosi rejects the idea of censuring Donald Trump - a far lesser punishment than impeachment. Both Democratic and Republican lawmakers have floated the proposal in recent days, as it became clear Trump would be acquitted in an impeachment trial. Censure would be ""a slap in the face of the Constitution"", Pelosi says, calling the Senators who voted to acquit ""cowardly"". ""We censure people for using stationary for the wrong purpose,"" she says. ""We don't censure people for inciting insurrection that kills people in the Capitol.""  Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter If every Senate Republican had their own political calculation to make before casting their vote - weighing whether to risk the ire of their party or the judgement of general election voters - one particular senatorâs drama was on particularly stark display. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, leader of his party in the Senate, had been outspoken for weeks in his criticism of Donald Trumpâs conduct on 6 January. For a while, his final vote in the trial was in doubt. On Saturday morning, however, he informed his fellow senators he would support acquittal. After the Senate rendered its final verdict, he explained why. He condemned Trumpâs behaviour and said he engaged in a âdisgraceful dereliction of duty.â âThereâs no question that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,â McConnell said. His not guilty vote, he said, was because former presidents were not eligible for impeachment trials. If such a precedent were followed, he said, any private citizen - regardless of status - could be impeached and ruled ineligible for public office by the Congress. McConnellâs critics will view that as a cop-out, not a principled stand. And it is noteworthy that his procedural objection allows him to avoid being out of step with the majority of Senate Republicans, which is a risky place for a congressional leader to be. Itâs a fine line for McConnell to walk, and time will tell if his fellow Republicans are satisfied with his vote, if not his words. Read more from Anthony. Here's a glance at what conservative Twitter is saying post-trial. Donald Trump Jr, the former president's eldest son, was quick to weigh in on all that his father is doing right, with a meme to boot. Conservative punditLaura Ingrahamaccused Democrats of not caring about the law, just ""political points"". Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist, deemed it all a waste of time. ButRod Dreher, a senior editor at the American Conservative, instead agreed with Democrat Chuck Schumer, saying Republicans had disgraced themselves. Allow Twitter content?

McConnell continues his criticism of the former president. ""Trump is still liable for everything he did while in office,"" McConnell notes. ""He didn't get away with anything he did, yet. Yet. We have a criminal justice system in this country. ""We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one."" Senators Burr and Murkowski We were expecting at least four Republican senators to side with Democrats at the end of this trial, and we ended up with seven. SenatorRichard Burr,of North Carolina, andPat Toomeyof Pennsylvania are the two unexpected additions to the list. SenatorBill Cassidyof Louisiana was slightly less of a surprise, as he did vote to advance the trial. Burr, who is retiring, said in a statement after the vote that he believed it was unconstitutional to impeach a president who was no longer in office, but once the Senate set the precedent that it was within the law, he listened to the facts as an impartial juror. ""The facts are clear,"" he said. ""As I said on January 6th, the president bears responsibility for these tragic events. The evidence is compelling that President Trump is guilty of inciting an insurrection against a co-equal branch of government."" Burr concludes that he did not make the decision lightly, but Trump ""violated his oath of office to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution"". As for Cassidy, he kept his statement to the point: ""Our Constitution and our country is more important than any one person. I voted to convict President Trump because he is guilty."" Senator Toomey has not issued a statement yet, but Politico reporter Olivia Beavers tweeted that he described it as the ""right call"" to convict and did not comment further. This video can not be played McConnell explains how he finds Trump responsible but voted to acquit Republican Minority Leader Senator Mitch McConnell is delivering remarks now. Once a Trump ally, McConnell bluntly criticises him for promoting unsubstantiated theories about election fraud, and then for not doing his job ""as the chaos unfolded"" on 6 January. ""With police officers bleeding and broken glass covering Capitol floors, he kept repeating election lies and praising the criminals,"" McConnell says. The veteran Republican adds that Trump supporters who use the millions of votes he received in the election as a deflection is an ""absurd"" argument, because ""74 million Americans did not invade the Capitol. Hundreds of rioters did"". After his uncommon attack on a fellow Republican, McConnell gets into why he did not, then, vote to convict. He says impeachment is a ""narrow tool for a narrow purpose"". ""If President Trump were still in office I would have carefully considered whether the House managers proved their specific charge."" But McConnell says his understanding of the Constitution finds that only the president, vice-president and civil officers can be convicted: ""We have no power to convict and disqualify a former officeholder who is now a private citizen"". ""If removal [from current office] becomes impossible,"" he continues, ""conviction becomes insensible."" Barbara Plett UsherBBC News, Capitol Hill It was the verdict everyone expected, but the day was not without its drama. Seven Republicans voted along with Democrats to convict Donald Trump of inciting the violent attack on the Capitol last month. In the end, they didnât get the two-thirds majority they needed. Still, this is a historic moment. Trump is the first president to be impeached twice and has set a record with the most votes to convict by members of his own party After Trump was acquitted, first up was the leader of the Democrats in the Senate. ""January 6 will live as a day of infamy in the United States. The failure to convict Donald Trump will live as a vote of infamy in the history of the United States Senate,"" says New York Senator Chuck Schumer. He criticised the 43 senators who voted to acquit Trump who effectively ""signed their names alongside his"" in the history books. The Democratic senator insisted one thing is certain - that Trump's legacy will be embroiled in this scandal forevermore, making it nearly impossible for him to ever hold elected office again. As the senator spoke, however, the Trump team released a statement promising a future for the Make America Great Again movement. Without a conviction, there is nothing barring Trump from holding office again. Whether he runs again remains to be seen. But he will certainly wield his influence in other ways. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter The current presidentâs strategy for handling the former presidentâs impeachment trial was to keep the whole ordeal at armâs length. He wasnât closely following the proceedings, White House officials said. During the trial, he kept a busy schedule of events related to the coronavirus pandemic. The Biden administrationâs calculation is that his long-term political fortunes rest on his success in dealing with the pandemic, the economy and the American publicâs other concerns, and not with the outcome of Trumpâs impeachment trial. In the end, the trial had little practical impact on his progress towards enacting his legislative agenda. The Senate lost only three days of business. With the trial concluded, the Senate will resume confirming Bidenâs administration appointments, after it returns from a week recess. All of this should please Biden and his team. If the Democratic base decides, however, that the price of moving forward with Bidenâs political agenda was the failure to hold Trump fully accountable - for instance, by conducting a speedy trial without witnesses - he may pay a political price nevertheless. In the political battles ahead, Biden needs a united Democratic Party. If there is second-guessing after this impeachment trial, cracks might start to emerge. Trump's office released a statement just moments after he was acquitted. ""This has been yet another phase of the greatest witch hunt in the history of our country,"" it reads. He does not mention the 6 January riot, rather reiterates the narrative that Democrats are the party that supports rioters and mobs. ""It is a sad commentary on our times that one political party in America is given a free pass to denigrate the rule of law, defame law enforcement, cheer mobs, excuse rioters..."" He concludes with a look to the future and a promise to his supporters. ""Our historic, patriotic and beautiful movement to Make America Great Again has only just begun. In the months ahead I have much to share with you, and I look forward to continuing our incredible journey together to achieve American greatness for all of our people."" This video can not be played Patrick Leahy delivers the verdict Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter New trial, same outcome. Trump once again avoided conviction by the US Senate because his fellow Republicans, by and large, stuck by his side. That, at its most basic level, is a win for the president. He is still eligible to run for president again in 2024, if he so chooses. His base, by all indications, is still largely intact. Trump did not emerge from this impeachment trial unscathed, however. One of the most memorable portions of the prosecution case by House managers were the new videos of Trumpâs supporters, wearing Make America Great Again hats and waving Trump flags, ransacking the Capitol. Those images will forever be associated with the Trump brand. Every rally he holds from here on will evoke memories of that riot. It may not cost him among the Republican rank and file, but independent voters - and moderates - are unlikely to forget. Read Anthony's analysis in full The Senate vote fell short of the threshold required to convict, with 57 in favour and 43 backing acquittal. There were seven Republicans (Senators Sasse, Romney, Burr, Collins, Murkowski, Toomey and Cassidy) joining Democrats to convict on the single charge of incitement. But Democrats needed two-thirds of the Senate to vote guilty to convict, so they were 10 votes short. Impeachment charges are political, not criminal. An impeachment acquittal essentially means the Senate did not find cause to remove a president from office. Of course, Trump is no longer in office. But if Trump had been convicted, the Senate could also have voted to prevent the former president from ever holding office again. The Democratic-led House of Representatives approved the article of impeachment on 13 January, with the support of 10 Republicans. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he will set out ""as much detail"" as he can give in his lockdown road map on 22 February Boris Johnson has said he is ""optimistic"" he will be able to set out plans later this month for a ""cautious"" easing of England's lockdown. The prime minister said ""huge progress"" had been made with the rollout of vaccines, with ministers hopeful that schools can reopen from 8 March. After this, the government would look to open non-essential shops and then later the hospitality sector, he said. It comes as scientists warned against easing lockdown measures too quickly. Mr Johnson will set out his ""road map"" out of lockdown on 22 February. So far, more than 14.5 million people in the UK have had at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine,according to Saturday's government figures,external. The government is aiming to offer a first jab to everyone in thetop four priority groups,external- about 15 million people - by Monday. The figures also show a further 612 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test, taking the total number of deaths by that measure to 116,908. Hancock: We could live with Covid 'like we do flu' Over-70s urged to get vaccine as UK nears target Jab trialled for people who cannot be vaccinated Speaking at a visit to the Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies plant in Billingham, Teesside, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm optimistic, I won't hide it from you. I'm optimistic but we have to be cautious."" Setting out the government's priorities, he said: ""Our children's education is our number one priority, but then working forward, getting non-essential retail open as well and then, in due course, as and when we can prudently and cautiously, of course we want to be opening hospitality as well. ""I will be trying to set out as much as I possibly can in as much detail as I can, always understanding that we have to be wary of the pattern of disease. ""We don't want to be forced into any kind of retreat or reverse ferret,"" the PM added. He also echoed comments made earlier by Health Secretary Matt Hancock thatCovid-19 could become an illness that we live with - like the flu - by the end of the year. ""A nasty disease like this will roll through. A new disease like this will take time for humanity to adapt to, but we are,"" Mr Johnson said. ""I do think that in due time it will become something that we simply live with. Some people will be more vulnerable than others - that's inevitable."" Mr Hancocktold the Daily Telegraph,externalthat he hoped new drugs by the end of 2021 could make Covid a ""treatable disease"", and one that we live with ""like we do the flu"". This suggested that he was ruling out a ""zero Covid"" strategy, aimed at eliminating the virus entirely from the UK. However, scientists said coronavirus mutations were getting ""more dangerous"" and ""more infectious"" and warned against treating it like the flu. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Dr Sarah Pitt, a virologist at the University of Brighton, told the BBC: ""It's not a type of flu. It's not the same sort of virus. It doesn't cause the same sort of disease, it's very, very nasty."" She added: ""The mutations, the variations, that we're seeing are becoming more infectious, not less infectious and a bit more dangerous, not less dangerous."" Prof Steven Riley, a member of the SPI-M modelling group, told BBC Radio 4 Today: ""If for some reason we were to choose to just pretend it (coronavirus) wasn't here anymore, then there is the potential to go back to a wave that is a similar size to the one that we are in now."" Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, said vaccines were ""doing what we wanted them to do"", particularly among the very elderly and vulnerable, who were among the first to receive the jab. Although acknowledging that it was ""desperately important"" for schools to return and society to reopen, he cautioned against getting into a cycle ""where we are constantly opening up and then closing down again and everything is very unstable"". ""It's worse to open up, have another wave of pandemic, another bunch of hospitalisations and have to close down again than to be able to progressively normalise things,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. NHS Confederation chairman Lord Victor Adebowale said 8 March for schools could still be too soon, adding that the NHS workforce was ""on its knees"". ""I understand the pressure to open schools. We need to do so very safely. I think mid or late March is when we should be reassessing. ""We have had a number of false dawns when we have set dates, taken the action, then find ourselves having to row back very quickly,"" Lord Adebowale told Today. But the prime minister is facing calls from some MPs in his party to ease restrictions. Meanwhile, UK Hospitality said for every week the hospitality sector remains shut down more companies are being placed in jeopardy and millions of jobs across hospitality and the supply chain are being put at risk. The trade association's chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said: ""That is why we urge the prime minister to work with us on delivering a safe, swift and sustainable exit from lockdown for hospitality.""

"Vaccines have transformed the pandemic, but there is still a huge need for drugs which can treat Covid. Immunity from vaccines can wane, and access is still a major problem around the world. Also, new variants emphasise the possible need for a back-up. There are now many drugs that target the virus or our body in different ways: anti-inflammatory drugs that stop our immune system overreacting with deadly consequences anti-viral drugs that make it harder for the coronavirus to replicate inside the body antibody therapies that mimic our own immune system to attack the virus These are all needed at different stages of the infection. They range from dirt cheap to spectacularly expensive, and some are more resilient to new variants than others. When you catch Covid, your body releases a flood of chemicals to warn that you're under attack. This chemical alarm is called inflammation, and is vital for rallying your immune system to boot out Covid. But if you don't get rid of the virus quickly, then inflammation can spiral out of control and eventually damage vital organs such as your lungs. It's this excessive inflammation that kills. An anti-inflammatory steroid that already existed before Covid -dexamethasone- was the first drug proved to save the lives of people with Covid. It's given to seriously ill patients with breathing troubles - it cuts the risk of death by a fifth for patients on oxygen, and by a third for those on ventilators. It is also so cheap that it has become the go-to drug around the world - with everywhere from Brazil to China using it. Other anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to work, including the steroid hydrocortisone andbaricitinib, which is normally used in rheumatoid arthritis. There are more advanced and targeted anti-inflammatory drugs such astocilizumab and sarilumab. Tocilizumab has been widely used in hospitals in China, India and Australia. These are also effective, but up to 100 times as expensive as dexamethasone. This has restricted their use - although they are still cheaper than an intensive care bed. Anti-inflammatories work best later on in the disease, but an asthma drug called budesonide has been shown to help vulnerable people with early Covid symptoms recover more quickly at home. An anti-viral directly targets the ability of the coronavirus to make copies of itself inside our bodies. Such a drug keeps levels of the virus in the body low, so there is less of it for your immune system to deal with. Paxlovid is a pill taken twice a day for five days- according to its maker, Pfizer, it cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by 89% in vulnerable adults Molnupiravir stops the virus from making effective copies of itself- the manufacturer, Merck, estimates it cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half Both Paxlovid and molnupiravir are best taken soon after symptoms appear. Pfizer expects to make 80 million courses of Paxlovid by the end of 2022 and has said it will allow generic makers in 95 low-income nations to produce and distribute it at cost price. Merck is allowing Indian generic drug firms to turn out molnupiravir cheaply for 100 low and middle-income countries. Another anti-viral,remdesivir, is given through a drip and cuts recovery time from Covid. Drug treatments are thought to have great potential for poorer countries such as Sudan, where vaccination is less available The third approach is to give people an infusion of antibodies that can attack the virus. These stick to the surface of the coronavirus and mark it for destruction by the body's immune system. The body makes its own antibodies when it is attacked by coronavirus. The most effective of these have been studied in the lab, grown and given to patients. This is known asmonoclonal antibody therapy. Vulnerable NHS patients to be offered new drug These therapies are often reserved for seriously ill patients who are struggling to make their own antibodies. Ronapreve, by Regeneron and Roche,reduces the length of hospital stays and the risk of death Sotrovimab, made by GSK,reduces the risk of hospitalisation and death by 79% in high-risk adults A different monoclonal antibody treatment calledEvushield,external, made by AstraZeneca, is recommended for some vulnerable people to hopefully prevent disease before they show any signs of being infected. This is known as prophylactic therapy. Anti-inflammatories should work against all variants because they target our own bodies, rather than the virus itself. There is more concern about whether monoclonal antibodies would work with new variants, as they rely on being a close match for the virus. If a new variant is heavily mutated then it theoretically makes the drugs weaker. However, GSK says it has tested its therapy against the Omicron variant and it remains effective in laboratory studies. Anti-virals are expected to hold up against the variants seen so far. None of the mutations seen in Omicron should affect the ability of the drugs to work. However, if the drugs are used widely then there is the potential for drug resistance to emerge. A number of drugs have been heralded as potential therapies for Covid - sometimes with no sign that they actually make any difference. Ivermectin has been controversially promoted for use in many parts of the world, despite no evidence that it works. Taking antibodies from survivors' blood - known as convalescent plasma therapy - has been touted, but has not reduced deaths. There was also speculation that drugs used to treat malaria and HIV might work, but this has come to nothing. FollowJameson Twitter,external BOOSTER:Who can get the fourth jab and how do you book it?

"Greene King has changed the name of four of its pubs A brewery has renamed four of its pubs over concerns they had racist connotations. Greene King has changed the names of three pubs called The Black Boy, and another called The Black's Head. Managing director Wayne Shurvinton said there was a perception the names were ""linked with racism"". Dr Halima Begum, of The Runnymede Trust, welcomed the news, saying the names had been a continual reminder of a ""history of oppression"". The Black Boy pubs - in Bury St Edmunds and Sudbury in Suffolk, and Shinfield in Berkshire - along with the Black's Head, in Wirksworth, Derbyshire, have been given new names, but Greene King says it will take a while for the signage to be changed. It is believed there are about 70 pubs called The Black Boy in the UK, and there remains no consensus on where the name comes from. Links to the mining industry and a nickname for King Charles II have both been cited as possibilities. Another theory relates to Native American figures placed outside premises to sell tobacco. Mr Shurvinton said ""despite the obscure origins"" there was a perception the names were ""linked with racism, which is why we knew we had to take this step if we wanted to continue on our journey to become a truly anti-racist organisation"". The Black Boy in Shinfield is one of four pubs getting a new name The pub in Bury St Edmunds is now called The West Gate The Sudbury pub is now called The Lady Elizabeth The pub in Shinfield is now called The Shinfield Arms The Derbyshire pub is now called The Quarryman New names were decided for the pubs following online polls, in which more than 7,000 people took part. Last year, the pub chain apologised for itshistorical links to the slave trade. It was founded in 1799 by Benjamin Greene, who owned highly profitable plantations. Greene King said it was working on plans to invest in black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities, after consulting with staff. Dr Begum, chief executive of racial equality charity The Runnymede Trust, said Greene King should be acknowledged for taking steps regarding its founder's exploitation of black people and for being open about its historical links to slavery. She said: ""The company has made several symbolic efforts to address its founder's legacy of oppression, not least by diversifying its hiring practices and through its work with the Slavery Museum in Liverpool - but is the renaming of a few pubs enough to make amends? No. Not in the slightest. ""No doubt members of BAME communities walk past these hostelries and read the names above the door every day. They are essentially having the history of oppression rubbed in their faces on a daily basis. ""We should not single out Greene King. Many companies that remain household names today profited from the unconscionable ownership and exploitation of black people.""

"The Government is confident that its post-Brexit worst-case scenario of disruption from queues of thousands of lorries in Kent has now been avoided. Overall freight flows have returned to the same levels as last year. Internal figures seen by the BBC show outbound roll-on roll-off lorry traffic for Great Britain for the month so far at 98% of last February's levels. Inbound traffic is at 99% of last year's levels. The transition period after the UK left the EU is now over, and a new regime is in place. One official says the government is ""pleased that overall flows are back to normal"". About 80-90% of laden lorries are arriving border-ready. Post-Brexit trade: Three firms, three problems Larger manufacturing firms in particular appear to have taken advantage of new systems designed to prepare loads for the border on leaving premises. Officials say they are pleased that overall flows are back to normal. However, their analysis of data from multiple sources - ferry manifests, port traffic, the Channel Tunnel, French officials and Kent Permit checks - also shows: significantly lower traffic in January a notable rise in the number of empty lorries returning from Great Britain to the European Union, and specific industries clearly affected by the end of the Brexit transition period Lorry traffic on the crossing from Kent to the EU on ferries and via the Channel Tunnel in January was 67% of the same month in 2020, and 82% in February. Although there is no formal count of empty lorries, a variety of ferry company, French, and UK official data suggest the proportion of empty lorries going back to the EU at around 50%. French sources suggested Eurotunnel, which tends to transfer higher-value loads, was seeing 50-60% empty loads. Industry sources said the existence of such empty lorries was not new, but that this was normally at 25-30%. So far this year, there is also evidence of freight routes changing and more traffic going via Harwich and Immingham to the Netherlands, though this will also reflect the recent French Covid testing policy. The Government's data on lorries turning back due to the wrong documentation is now below 2.5%, having been closer to 8% in the first days of the new regime. Combining the reduction in traffic flow with the increased number of empty lorries, it is possible to calculate that actual lorry transfers of freight in January from Kent to the EU were substantially down, by around 2,000 lorries a day compared to January 2020. Even now, with overall levels back to normal, there are around 1,000-2,000 fewer lorries exiting the whole of Great Britain with actual freight. This is partly down to pre-Christmas stockpiling, but that effect is likely to be waning now. The government has also internally identified what type of exports are in the lorries, as that information is reported in ferry manifest data. From this, it has concluded internally that exports of clothing and apparel have been hit mainly by a Covid lockdown impact. But the fall in food, agriculture and sea fish exports is the impact of the post-Brexit transition period. The big picture is that the worst-case scenario queues have not materialised. But the economic impact in specific areas of the economy is noticeable in the same data. French officials confirmed this same general picture, and both sides of the Channel reported a good level of cooperation in ironing out problems with, for example, IT systems. Official statistics on this will only start to be available with trade figures for July published next month. Internally, the Government's hope is that the lack of congestion can now tempt cautious traders back into fully using these trade routes.

We'll be back again tomorrow with all the latest updates from the Sunday morning shows and the rest of the day's news. Your Live Page writers today were Gareth Evans, Victoria Lindrea and Hazel Shearing. The page was edited by Julian Joyce.     British parents living overseas whose children will have to travel back to boarding school in the UK when schools reopen, have pleaded with the government to rethink hotel quarantine rules. Those arriving from countries on the government's red list will be required to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days once new rules are introduced on Monday. With no date confirmed for schools to reopen - but with 8 March clearly in the PM's sights - parents have been left with a difficult choice. Karl Feilder, who lives in the United Arab Emirates, has two daughters, aged 15 and 17, who attend a boarding school near Reading. He said he would not allow his children to return if it meant quarantining in a hotel alone. ""To be perfectly honest, I think anyone in their right mind would not do that with their children. ""The fact that they haven't told us when schools are going back means we can't take the decision now to put them on a plane today or tomorrow to beat the Monday morning deadline. Mr Feilder suggested children returning to the UK should be allowed to quarantine at school, adding: ""The schools are perfectly well able to look after the kids and make sure they're staying put."" ""We're quite happy to do the Covid tests, we're quite happy to do the home quarantine, whatever - just don't lock my children up.""

The move comes amid concern over the new variants of Covid-19 identified in the two countries. ""In the context of the epidemiological situation... all flights from Brazil and the United Kingdom"" are suspended, the interior ministry said. Portugal also extended its stricter border controls with neighbouring Spain until 1 March. The average number of daily reported virus cases continues to fall, with a further 13,308 confirmed cases across the UK according to government figures. However, figures are often lower at the weekend, due to a lag in reporting. In addition there were a further 621 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. It takes the total number of UK deaths to 116,908. The Iranian president said ""we all have to be vigilant"" Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has warned of a potential ""fourth wave"" of cases as infections rise in some areas of the country. He said some cities in the south-western province of Khuzestan were now categorised as ""red"" - the highest alert level. ""This is a warning for all of us,"" President Rouhani said on state television earlier today. ""This means the beginning of moving towards the fourth wave. We all have to be vigilant to prevent this,"" he added. Iran started its vaccination campaign on Tuesday, and the first shipment of doses arrived on February 4. Police bodycam footage captured a man's legs dangling from the loft at a house party in Scarborough A man was discovered hiding at an illegal house party when his legs were spotted dangling from an entrance to a loft, police have said. North Yorkshire Police found the reveller in a ceiling hatch as they attended a report of the gathering in Scarborough. Officers described it as an ""unusual incident"". In January, the force said they were stillbreaking up house parties in the town ""every night""despite lockdown. More than 100 people have now been fined for being at illegal indoor gatherings in the town. ""We're all looking forward to a good party once this is over. In the meantime our officers won't wait for an invitation,"" a spokesperson for North Yorkshire Police said. Red Cross workers gathered at Beirut airport ahead of the vaccine delivery The first batches of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will soon arrive in Lebanon, as the country prepares to begin its vaccination programme. The launch will take place at midday on Sunday at the headquarters of the prime minister - where the outgoing premier Hassan Diab will receive the first dose. The purchase of the vaccine is being financed by the World Bank, which says it will ensure a fair and transparent distribution of the first batch of doses. Lebanon has been facing a surge in infections in recent weeks amid a deep economic and political crisis. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he is ""optimistic"" over the easing of lockdown restrictions in England. During a visit to Teesside, Mr Johnson said he will set out ""as much detail"" as he can give in his lockdown roadmap on 22 February, reiterating that his first priority is to reopen schools.  This video can not be played Covid: Boris Johnson 'optimistic' over easing of restrictions The number of patients reporting symptoms of Covid-19 weeks after becoming ill - so-called Long Covid - could be as high as 20%, according to one immunologist. Professor Danny Altmann, from Imperial College London, believes earlier estimates which put the number of people suffering Long Covid at one in 20 - lower than the number now being reported. ""Many people would have 10-20% as their range if you look at the papers on how many people are still reporting significant symptoms several months afterwards,"" he told Times Radio. Prof Altmann added there was ""no absolute correlation"" between severe illness and Long Covid: ""There's plenty of people out there who barely know they had it and never had a PCR test or antibody test who are suffering massively still from long Covid. The immunologist is calling for Long Covid clinics to be opened in the UK, amid warnings it could place a major burden on the NHS. ""The kind of burden I've been suggesting is equivalent to our NHS burden of arthritis, which is one of the biggest causes on our NHS time and expenditure,"" said Prof Altmann. ""It's a real thing to worry and think about for the future."" Symptoms of long Covid include ongoing fatigue, loss of taste or smell, respiratory and cardiovascular problems and mental health issues.   The WHO team are currently at the end of their investigation mission in Wuhan One of the investigators examining the origins of the pandemic has said China refused to give raw data on its early cases to the World Health Organization (WHO) team. ""That's standard practice for an outbreak investigation,"" Dominic Dwyer, an Australian infectious diseases expert, told the Reuters news agency earlier today. He added that, despite repeated requests, the WHO-led team was only given a summary of the data on more than 170 cases they were interested in from an early outbreak in Wuhan in December 2019. Mr Dwyer said the motive for withholding the raw data was a matter of speculation. ""Whether it's
political or time or it's difficult... I don't know,"" he said. China has insisted it was transparent with the investigators, whose initial findings could be published next week.

Boris Johnson wore a face covering during a visit to a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Stockton-on-Tees During his visit to Teesside, Prime Minister Boris Johnson echoed Health Secretary Matt Hancock, outlining that we will have to ""simply live with"" Covid-19. ""A new disease like this will take time for humanity to adapt to, but we are,"" he said. He said ""new therapies are being discovered the whole time"" to reduce mortality and improve treatments. ""I do think, that in due time, it will become something that we simply live with. Some people will be more vulnerable than others - that's inevitable,"" he said. ""I think the Health Secretary spoke about the autumn. Let's see where we get to."" Boris Johnson has said he is ""optimistic"" that he will be able to start announcing the easing of coronavirus restrictions in England this month, but doesn't want to be ""forced into"" a ""reverse ferret""  - or U-turn - later on. The prime minister is due to lay out his ""roadmap"" out of lockdown on 22 February. ""I'm optimistic, but we have to be cautious,"" he said, during a visit to the plant where the new Novavax vaccine will be made in Billingham, Teesside. He said his first priority remained opening schools in England on 8 March. ""Then working forward, getting non-essential retail open as well and then, in due course, as and when we can, prudently, cautiously of course, we want to be opening hospitality as well,"" he said. ""I will be trying to set out as much as I possibly can, in as much detail as I can, always understanding that we have to be wary of the pattern of disease. We don't want to be forced into any kind of retreat or reverse ferret."" More on that case of the South African variant that was identified in the village of Bramley, near Basingstoke, Hampshire. It means from next week, residents aged over 16 will be asked to come forward for surge-testing in the hope of preventing any further cases of the variant. ""I appreciate that this news may be worrying for the local community, but it's really important to understand that the risk of transmission from this single case is considered to be very low,"" said Simon Bryant, director of public health at Hampshire County Council. Mr Bryant added that there was ""no evidence that this particular variant causes more severe illness, or that the regulated vaccines do not protect against it"". ""The rapid local testing programme is primarily a precautionary measure designed to help the government to better understand and prevent the spread of new variants across the country,"" he said. West Norwood in south London is among the areas in England where the SA variant has been found Newsbeat is taking listeners to the centre of the pandemic, after spending a number of days at Harrogate District hospital in North Yorkshire. The special programme, Life on the front line, talks to staff at the hospital as it weathers its busiest period since last March. Porter Tom covers 10 miles a day, while intensive care nurse Becky works with some of the hospital's sickest Covid patients: ""I wouldn't wish what we have to see on anyone.""  More surge testing is to take place in parts of Middlesbrough - covering the TS7 postcode - in areas of Walsall and in specific areas of the RG26 postcode in Hampshire, after new cases of the South African variant were found. The surge testing is being introduced, in addition to existing testing, to monitor and suppress the spread of the virus after confirmed cases of the SA variant - not associated with international travel - came to light in those regions. In Walsall, the surge testing operation has been extended in response to a confirmed second case of the variant. People living within these targeted areas are strongly encouraged to take a Covid-19 test this week, whether they are showing symptoms or not. Those with symptoms should book a test in the usual way, while those those without symptoms should visit their local authority website for more information. A mobile testing unit will be available in Middlesbrough from Saturday onwards, the council said and urged residents to come forward. Secondary school pupils in Scotland may have to adopt two-metre social distancing rules when they begin a phased return to school later this month. The tougher new social distancing guidelines have been put forward by the government's advisory group on education and children's issues. The advisory group says,externalthe ""additional protective measure"" should also apply on school buses. The two-metre rule is already in place for teachers at secondary schools, while primary pupils should observe it ""whenever possible"". Scotland's youngest pupilsare likely to return full-time from 22 February. Some senior secondary pupils preparing for exams could also be back in the classroom from the same date. Education SecretaryJohn Swinney described the proposals,externalas ""an important scientific and clinical update"". Read more. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Ice-skating fever is gripping the Netherlands. After almost a year of Covid-related restrictions, a nation of ice-skating fanatics are taking a welcome break from the pandemic. Freezing temperatures have seen the canals here ice over, and there is a glimmer of hope that the world's biggest competition on natural ice might just go ahead later this year. The winter activity is not without its risks, however. Firefighters had to rescue more than 10 people in the Hague after a frozen pond they were skating on began to thaw on Friday. Some were lifted out as they sunk into the water, while others crawled to reach the edges of the pond before the ice could crack further. Police and firefighters helped rescue people from the thawing pond in The Hague Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that, with the support of vaccines and new treatments, Covid-19 will become a "" treatable disease"" that we ""have to live with, like we do flu"". But there are experts who warn we are still ""a long way"" from being able to treat the virus as we do flu - with mutations getting ""more dangerous"" and ""more infectious"" Dr Richard Horton has suggested it would up to four years to build up sufficient levels of immunity in the population, but agreed we can't live under restrictive measure indefinitely. BBC Health Correspondent Nick Triggle says it's simply about being realistic: ""Covid isn't something that can be eradicated like smallpox. ""Temporary suppression, which is essentially what countries like New Zealand have done, is about protecting people in the short-term. Unless they keep their borders shut forever, it cannot work long-term. ""Vaccines mean immunity builds up and, at the very least, should stop most people falling seriously ill. ""There will be an ongoing challenge of keeping up with a virus that will mutate - although this is likely to be less difficult than it seems as coronaviruses tend to be much more stable than flu, for which different strains circulate every year. ""There will always be people who are susceptible, either the vaccine doesn't work or they have refused to have it. That is why the continued advances in treatments are essential. ""But we should never again see the levels of deaths we have. ""Thousands will still die in winters to come. But each year this should lessen until it gets near to the levels of mortality we see with flu - something which society readily accepts."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Government is confident that its post-Brexit worst-case scenario of disruption from queues of thousands of lorries in Kent has now been avoided. Overall freight flows have returned to the same levels as last year. Internal figures seen by the BBC show outbound roll-on roll-off lorry traffic for Great Britain for the month so far at 98% of last February's levels. Inbound traffic is at 99% of last year's levels. The transition period after the UK left the EU is now over, and a new regime is in place. One official says the government is ""pleased that overall flows are back to normal"". About 80-90% of laden lorries are arriving border-ready. Post-Brexit trade: Three firms, three problems Larger manufacturing firms in particular appear to have taken advantage of new systems designed to prepare loads for the border on leaving premises. Officials say they are pleased that overall flows are back to normal. However, their analysis of data from multiple sources - ferry manifests, port traffic, the Channel Tunnel, French officials and Kent Permit checks - also shows: significantly lower traffic in January a notable rise in the number of empty lorries returning from Great Britain to the European Union, and specific industries clearly affected by the end of the Brexit transition period Lorry traffic on the crossing from Kent to the EU on ferries and via the Channel Tunnel in January was 67% of the same month in 2020, and 82% in February. Although there is no formal count of empty lorries, a variety of ferry company, French, and UK official data suggest the proportion of empty lorries going back to the EU at around 50%. French sources suggested Eurotunnel, which tends to transfer higher-value loads, was seeing 50-60% empty loads. Industry sources said the existence of such empty lorries was not new, but that this was normally at 25-30%. So far this year, there is also evidence of freight routes changing and more traffic going via Harwich and Immingham to the Netherlands, though this will also reflect the recent French Covid testing policy. The Government's data on lorries turning back due to the wrong documentation is now below 2.5%, having been closer to 8% in the first days of the new regime. Combining the reduction in traffic flow with the increased number of empty lorries, it is possible to calculate that actual lorry transfers of freight in January from Kent to the EU were substantially down, by around 2,000 lorries a day compared to January 2020. Even now, with overall levels back to normal, there are around 1,000-2,000 fewer lorries exiting the whole of Great Britain with actual freight. This is partly down to pre-Christmas stockpiling, but that effect is likely to be waning now. The government has also internally identified what type of exports are in the lorries, as that information is reported in ferry manifest data. From this, it has concluded internally that exports of clothing and apparel have been hit mainly by a Covid lockdown impact. But the fall in food, agriculture and sea fish exports is the impact of the post-Brexit transition period. The big picture is that the worst-case scenario queues have not materialised. But the economic impact in specific areas of the economy is noticeable in the same data. French officials confirmed this same general picture, and both sides of the Channel reported a good level of cooperation in ironing out problems with, for example, IT systems. Official statistics on this will only start to be available with trade figures for July published next month. Internally, the Government's hope is that the lack of congestion can now tempt cautious traders back into fully using these trade routes.

"Ten people will be allowed per group and groups can consist of members from different households Pubs and restaurants in Jersey will be allowed to reopen for table service only from 22 February, the government has announced. Up to 10 people will be allowed per group and groups can consist of people from different households. Customers must have a substantial meal and a social distance of 2m (6ft) must be kept between tables. Further relaxations to Covid restrictions will begin next week, the government said. From next Wednesday, faith groups will be allowed to meet for worship in groups of up to 40 people. Controlled outdoor sports gatherings can also restart from Wednesday for up to 35 people under 18 and from 8 March for up to 35 people over 18. From 22 February, any pubs that cannot serve food must remain closed, the government said. Last orders at those that can reopen must be placed by 22:00 GMT and masks must be worn at all times except when eating and drinking. Rules on household gatherings will remain unchanged, with islandersbanned from mixing with others in their homes. Chief minister, Senator John Le FondrÃ©, said the current levels of infection in the island showed it was safe to continue reopening group activities ""carefully and with mitigation measures in place"". He said: ""Risks remain though, which is why we are not opening up too quickly and why we are not yet relaxing our travel arrivals policy."" The minister for health and social services, Deputy Richard Renouf, said the relaxation of public heath measures created some risk but there were ""significant wellbeing benefits to reconnecting some of the activities we have all been missing"". Minister for economic development, Senator Lyndon Farnham added that he was sure the move would be ""welcome news to our hospitality industry"".
