"Some 746,000 taxpayers are believed to have missed the deadline Taxpayers who missed January's self-assessment deadline might see increased fines because of a delay in sending out penalty notices, experts have warned. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) normally sends warnings in February, but this year some may go out from late April. From 1 May the standard Â£100 fine rises by Â£10 a day - so when letters arrive, penalties could already be accruing. HMRC blamed increased workload from Brexit for the delay but said no one would be ""unfairly penalised"". It is thought746,000 taxpayers missed the deadlinefor tax returns to be submitted online on 31 January. Ina notice issued on Friday,external, HMRC said: ""We expect an increased demand in our call centres as the UK leaves the EU, so we intend to delay the issue of these notices to ensure we can provide the best service to our customers. ""This will release those staff for EU exit related work. ""We will issue daily penalties to individuals who have still not filed three months after the deadline, in appropriate cases, at the normal time."" HMRC has 'daunting task' as Brexit nears HMRC error hits early-filing taxpayers But the Association of Taxation Technicians warned fines could begin rising before some people had even received a letter telling them. Jon Stride, of the Association of Taxation Technicians, said: ""If the Â£100 penalty notice is issued by HMRC at the end of April, a taxpayer may, by the time the notice hits their doormat, already be incurring additional penalties."" Mr Stride is calling on HMRC to clarify whether it will take into account the late issuing of notices when considering a higher fine. And Dan Neidle, a tax lawyer at Clifford Chance, told the BBC: ""Where people have genuinely forgotten, it seems harsh and even unfair to remind them so late that they're already running up daily penalties."" An HMRC spokesman said: ""No-one will be unfairly penalised as a result of this change. The vast majority will be aware they missed the January 31 filing date, as we do remind regularly with nudge messages before the deadline. ""The latest date letters will go out is April and this will still leave customers several weeks to contact us. This is sensible planning to make sure we focus our resources on delivering important functions in the event of a no deal [Brexit]."" A source at HMRC said if letters did get sent at the end of April, people receiving them would be given plenty of time to respond.

"Donen received an honorary Oscar in 1998, and performed an impromptu dance Veteran Hollywood musicals director Stanley Donen has died aged 94, according to US media reports. The director was perhaps best known for the 1952 musical Singin' in the Rain, which he co-directed with its star Gene Kelly. His other films included On the Town, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Funny Face. The Chicago Tribune first reported Donen's death, citing one of his sons, Mark. A former Broadway dancer, Donen moved into cinema as a choreographer, then as a director. He translated his love for dance to the big screen with the help of Kelly and Fred Astaire. Singin' in the Rain was named the greatest movie musical of all time by the American Film Institute in 2006. Singin' in the Rain starred Gene Kelly and Debbie Reynolds Edgar Wright, who directed films including Hot Fuzz, paid tribute to the breadth of Donen's work, from musicals to thrillers, while Mission Impossible filmmaker Christopher McQuarrie said that Donen ""understood when to move and when to let others do the moving"".

"This video can not be played Six Nations: Wales come back to stun England 21-13 Six Nations Championship Wales (3) 21 Tries:Hill, AdamsCons:BiggarPen:Anscombe 3 England (10) 13 Try:CurryCon:FarrellPen:Farrell 2 Wales produced a stirring second half to crush England's Grand Slam dream with a record-breaking 12th consecutive Test win. England had led 10-3 at the interval after 20-year-old Tom Curry's first international try garlanded a brutal defensive display. But Wales came barrelling back and took the lead with 13 minutes to go when second row Cory Hill smashed over after a relentless series of drives. And with replacement Dan Biggar taking control, Josh Adams sealed it at the death as he claimed his fly-half's cross-field kick to send the Principality Stadium into ear-splitting ecstasy. If Wales can beat Scotland in Edinburgh in two weeks' time only Ireland in Cardiff on the final day of the championship will stand between them and a first Grand Slam since 2012. But this will go down as another masterclass from their coach Warren Gatland, as England were unable to get close to their form of the opening two rounds. We let ourselves down - England coach Jones Gatland fist pump shows what win means Hartley ruled out of rest of Six Nations Wales' wise men inflict another Cardiff curse This video can not be played Six Nations: Tom Curry bursts through to give England lead against Wales It was a frenetic start on an afternoon warm enough to be late April rather than February, both sides looking to kick, Kyle Sinckler charging into tackles with relish as the songs rolled down the stands. Owen Farrell and Anscombe exchanged penalties and then England struck again, Curry picking and going off an unguarded ruck seven metres out as Justin Tipuric dallied with Ben Youngs. Farrell's conversion from in front made it 10-3 and the home crowd fell uncharacteristically quiet, the score doubly chastening for Wales after Courtney Lawes had robbed the ball from an opposition maul. When Anscombe's attempted cross-field kick was picked off by Henry Slade it took a desperate tackle from Adams to prevent a second try. Wales were running against a white wall of defenders, Curry and Sinckler relentless, yet Anscombe almost profited when Jones' men lost a scrum against the head and his chip ahead left Youngs scrambling desperately under his own posts. But it was England who ended the half in control, Jonny May kicking long down the left wing and bundling the covering Hadleigh Parkes into touch. Jones' men set up a 12-man driving maul that rumbled to the Welsh five-metre line, but Farrell opted to cross-kick to Jack Nowell in the right-hand corner and George North managed to snuff the danger out. This video can not be played Hill gives Wales late lead with 'great finish' Wales had struggled in the first half of their first two games, against France and Italy, but once again they dragged themselves into a contest they had struggled to dictate. Anscombe banged over a penalty on the angle after May had been penalised for holding on and the margin was down to four points with more than a third of the contest to come. Sinckler had played on the edge throughout but was penalised in the Welsh half for obstructing Anscombe and then again for a high tackle on Alun Wyn Jones in front of his own posts. As the England tight-head was hauled off for Harry Williams, Anscombe knocked over the penalty for 10-9 and the home support was alive again. It was Anscombe's last act, Biggar thrown on with 20 minutes left, but when Curry won a penalty as Parkes held on 25m out it was his opposite number Farrell with the three points. Back came Wales. Drive upon drive hammered at the English defence, the big ball-carriers taking it up to within a few metres, the crowd baying as the red shirts got closer. On the 35th phase the white line cracked. Hill battered through two men on a clever angle and reached out to nudge the ball on to the try-line, and Biggar's sweet kick from the right touchline made it 16-13. And with England pinned back Adams soared above Elliot Daly to take the ball at the second attempt and flop into the corner. This video can not be played 'Absolutely sensational!' Josh Adams seals Wales victory Wales continue to dominate this fixture in years ending in 'nine' having won the corresponding fixtures in 1949, 1959, 1969, 1979, 1989, 1999 and 2009. Warren Gatland's men have won nine straight matches at home for the first time since 1999 - their last defeat in Cardiff came against New Zealand in November 2017. This is the first Six Nations encounter in the last five to be settled by more than six points. Wales have set a national record of 12 consecutive Test victories. Wales have won all eight games that Gareth Anscombe has started at fly-half England had won the aerial battle against Ireland and France, but Williams ruled the skies - and also made more runs than any other back while beating more defenders than any other Welshman Wales head coach Warren Gatland:""We created lots of problems for ourselves in the first half but we were much better in the second. ""All that pain and hard work last week in training paid dividends, in the second half tactically we were really good. ""It's a pretty special group of boys at the moment in fact a brilliant group at the moment."" England captain Owen Farrell:""We didn't really get a foothold in the last 30 minutes of the game. We did well in the first half and we had a good go at the start of the second, but then we couldn't get back that momentum. ""We made a few errors and they did what they did well. We couldn't get out of our half and they managed to build a lot of pressure. It will feel a lot worse than it should now but we will look back on it and learn from what we need to."" This video can not be played Record Wales win? 'Just another Saturday' -  Alun Wyn Jones Former England international Martin Johnson on BBC TV: ""England got what they deserved, they lost the grip of it and Wales took hold with their first try. They imposed themselves physically, and there was only going to be one winner. There was a period of 20 minutes in the second half where England did nothing."" Former Wales international Shane Williams on Radio 5 live:""When you see someone like Dan Biggar coming on, you know exactly what to expect.

"This video can not be played The victims are tea plantation workers from the north-eastern state of Assam At least 130 people have died and more than 200 are being treated in hospital after drinking toxic bootleg alcohol in north-eastern India, officials said. Some 35 people were reported dead in the state of Assam on Sunday, days after about 100 people died in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Ten people have been arrested over the bootleg drink, a police official said. There were many women among the victims, who all worked on tea plantations. An inquiry has been ordered into the tragedy. The death toll is believed to be the highest since a 2011 case in West Bengal, where more than 170 people died after ingesting bootleg alcohol. The first victims died on Thursday, according to the administrator of the Golaghat district in Assam, Dhiren Hazarika. Golaghat district Superintendent of Police Pushkar Singh told the BBC Hindi service that police had found the home where the toxic liquor was made and had recovered one and a half litres (2.5pts) of it. Doctors at the hospitals where the victims were being treated were baffled by the ingredients used in the illegal alcohol, which has caused organ failure. An expert team from the city of Guwahati is being brought in analyse the contents of the drink A tea plantation worker who consumed the bootleg alcohol lies on a drip ""The people came to the hospital with severe vomiting, extreme chest pain and breathlessness,"" Dr Ratul Bordoloi, joint director of Golaghat's health department, told the AFP news agency. One worker who was undergoing treatment at Golaghat Hospital told the BBC that he had been at a tea plantation on Thursday when the purchase the alcohol. ""I had bought half a litre of wine and drank it before eating,"" he said. ""Initially, everything was normal, but after some time my head started hurting. The headache grew so much that I could not eat or sleep."" The man felt restless until the morning, when he started getting chest pain. His wife took him to the tea plantation hospital and he was referred to the district hospital. This video can not be played Nearly half of the alcohol market is made up of so-called 'country-made' liquor Deaths from illegally produced alcohol, which is much cheaper than branded spirits, are common in parts of rural India. Bootleggers often add methanol - a highly toxic form of alcohol sometimes used as an anti-freeze - to their mixture to increase its strength. If ingested in even small quantities, methanol can cause blindness, liver damage and death. State police said two excise department officials were suspended for failing to take adequate precautions over the sale of the alcohol.

"Jodey Whiting had suffered ill health for a number of years A woman whose disabled daughter killed herself after her benefit payments were stopped has called for officials to be prosecuted over their failings. Jodey Whiting, 42, of Stockton, Teesside, took her life in 2017 when her payments were halted because she missed a capability assessment. An independent inquiry has found the Department for Work (DWP) breached its own rules and it has been ordered to apologise and pay Â£10,000 compensation. The DWP said it accepted the findings. Ms Whiting, a mother of nine, suffered multiple physical and mental health issues including curvature of the spine and a brain cyst, and took 23 tablets each day. She was suffering from pneumonia when she missed her assessment but was then ruled fit to work and had her Employment and Support Allowance halted. Her mother, Joy Dove, of Norton, said she was ""shocked"" by the extent of the failings outlined in a letter from the Independent Case Examiner. She said: ""It was awful. There was no need. They pushed her to it. ""How can you cut someone's money off without seeing them?"" The examiner found the DWP did not follow procedures which should have seen it telephone and visit Ms Whiting after she missed the appointment. Ms Dove is seeking legal advice over whether any further action is possible. ""No-one should go through this,"" she said. Alex Cunningham, Labour MP for Stockton North, said the DWP had ""systematic problems"". He added: ""They had opportunities to help this family and each time they failed."" Joy Dove has described the family's compensation payment as ""blood money"" The DWP said it apologised to Ms Whiting's family for ""failings in how we handled her case"". A spokeswoman added: ""Our thoughts are with them at this difficult time and we are providing compensation. She said the DWP was reviewing its procedures to ""ensure this doesn't happen again"".

"Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari (L) and his opponent Atiku Abubakar cast their ballots Votes are being counted in Nigeria's closely-fought general election, with voting hours extended in some places following delays in the morning. The main challenger to President Muhammadu Buhari, 76, is the former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, 72. Whoever wins will have to address power shortages, corruption, security threats, and a sluggish economy. The election had been due to take place a week ago but was delayed at the last minute for logistical reasons. President Buhari cast his ballot in his hometown of Daura in the northern state of Katsina. Asked if he would congratulate his rival if he lost, he said: ""I will congratulate myself."" About two hours before polls were due to open on Saturday, residents of the town of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state in the country's north-east reported hearing several blasts and gunfire. State police said in a statement that there was no threat to public safety. ""The gunfire were not targeted at members of the public but was for security purposes,"" the statement said. Five things about Nigeria: The superpower with no power Is Africa going backwards on democracy? Borno is the birthplace of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which had said it planned to disrupt the elections. In the north-eastern state of Yobe, suspected Islamist militants attacked the town of Geidam, forcing people to flee, the Reuters news agency reported. The initial vote was rescheduled in a dramatic press conference in the early hours of Saturday 16 February, just five hours before polls were due to have opened. President Muhammadu Buhari (l) is expected to face a strong challenge from Atiku Abubakar (r) The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) has given several reasons for the delay, including attempted sabotage and logistical issues such as bad weather and problems with delivering the ballot papers. Inec has said that everything is in place for the poll to take place this time round. The candidate with the most votes is declared the winner in the first round, as long as that person gains at least 25% of the votes in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states. There are 73 registered candidates in the presidential election, but campaigning has been dominated by the two political giants and the established party machines behind them. The ballot paper has to be extra long in order to fit on all 73 presidential candidates The president's All Progressives Congress (APC) has promised to take the country to the ""next level"", arguing that in his first four-year term Mr Buhari has done a lot of ""foundational work"" that may not be immediately obvious. Mr Abubakar and his People's Democratic Party have pledged ""to get Nigeria working again"", saying that the president has wasted the last four years. Nigerians taken past danger zone to vote Does Nigeria's 'generation democracy' want to vote? Both men are from the mainly Muslim north of the country. While they are in their 70s, more than half of Nigeria's 84 million registered voters are under 35. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer but corruption and a failure to invest the proceeds from the industry have hampered development in the country. It slipped into a recession in 2016 and a slow recovery has meant that not enough jobs have been created to cope with the large number of young people coming into the employment market. Currently nearly a quarter of the working age population is unemployed. Election in numbers 73 million have voter's cards 51% of the electorate under the age of 35 73 registered presidential candidates 120,000 polling stations Mr Buhari has quelled a militant Islamist rebellion in the north-east of the country, but Boko Haram remains active. There has also been an upsurge in violence in the country's Middle Belt as traditional herders and more settled farmers have clashed. Up until 1999 Nigeria was governed by either short-lived civilian administrations or military rulers. But this year marks 20 years since the return of democracy. Mr Buhari was elected in 2015 - the first time an opposition candidate had defeated an incumbent to become president.

"Saturday saw deadly confrontations at border crossings as volunteers attempted to collect aid Deadly clashes broke out in Venezuelan border towns on Saturday, as President NicolÃ¡s Maduro blocked humanitarian aid from crossing from Colombia and Brazil.

Mr GuaidÃ³ organised the collection of hundreds of tonnes of foreign aid at the country's borders. He gave the government a deadline of Saturday to allow the aid to be brought into Venezuela or vowed to have volunteers march it in themselves.

"The Brexit vote must not be frustrated and the government needs to maintain an ""absolute"" focus on delivering it, Theresa May has said. In a speech to Tory activists the PM said, as her negotiations with the EU reach their final stages, the ""worst thing we could do is lose our focus"". It came as three pro-EU cabinet members warned they could vote to delay Brexit to prevent a ""disastrous"" no-deal. But Mrs May said there must be no party ""purges"" over MPs with differing views. Ahead of crucial votes in the Commons next week, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauketold the Daily Mail,externalthey would be prepared to defy the prime minister and vote for a delay. The intervention led to calls for their resignations by Tory Brexiteers. Cabinet trio issue Brexit delay warning Brexit: A really simple guide A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame The UK remains on course to leave the European Union on 29 March. However, the government has repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of the UK leaving without a formal deal, in the event that Mrs May cannot get MPs to approve the deal she negotiated with Brussels in time. Mrs May's speech to the National Conservative Convention in Oxford on Saturday evening came as MPs prepare for a series of votes on Wednesday which could see Parliament take control of the Brexit process. Delegates at the convention overwhelmingly backed a symbolic motion saying Brexit should not be delayed, and leaving without an agreement should remain an option. Mr Clark, the business secretary, along with Ms Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, and the justice secretary, Mr Gauke, had earlier said they would be prepared to defy Mrs May and vote for a delay to Brexit. They argued there  ""simply will not be time to agree a deal and complete all the necessary legislation"" unless a deal is approved in the coming days. An amendment tabled by former Tory minister Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour's Yvette Cooper would give Parliament the opportunity to delay Brexit and prevent a no-deal situation if there is no agreement with the EU by the middle of March. But Mrs May told activists: ""Our focus to deliver Brexit must be absolute. ""We must not, and I will not, frustrate what was the largest democratic exercise in this country's history. In the very final stages of this process, the worst thing we could do is lose our focus."" Mrs May also said there should be no moves to deselect MPs because of their views on Brexit. Theresignations of three pro-Remain Tory MPs- Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston - to join a group of Labour defectors in the new Independent Group reduced the Tories working majority in Parliament to eight. Mrs May said: ""No-one gets more frustrated than I do when people vote against the whip, particularly given the tight Parliamentary arithmetic that we face. ""But we are not a party of purges and retribution. We called a referendum and let people express their views - so we should not be seeking to deselect any of our MPs because of their views on Brexit. ""Our party is rightly a broad church - on that and other issues."" Mrs May is expected to hold talks with EU figures in Sharm el-Sheikh Mrs May is expected to hold talks with European Council president Donald Tusk and other key EU figures in Egypt later during a summit between leaders of EU and Arab league countries. But Downing Street has played down hopes of a breakthrough on her Brexit deal being reached in Sharm el- Sheikh. The summit is the first between leaders of EU and Arab league countries and will focus on tackling concerns over security and migration, and boosting trade.

"The opposition has planned to deliver foreign humanitarian aid on 23 February In the humble neighbourhood of El Valle, in south-western Caracas, several hundred residents are gathered round in a community square, waiting for a meeting to start. One of the organisers picks up the microphone and starts addressing the crowd. ""Why are you all here?"" he asks them. ""For Venezuela,"" they readily reply in unison before starting to sing the national anthem. ""Glory to the brave nation, which shook off the yoke,"" they all chant. ""Off with the chains! Off with the chains!"" The anthem may reference Venezuela's colonial history, but the wording is particularly fitting for today's politics too. Venezuelans are joining in the modern-day fight to shake off President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's administration, a government that many blame for strangling the economy and people's lives. Venezuela crisis in nine charts Why the military back Maduro The men prepared to die for Maduro This meeting - and many similar events across the country - is being held ahead of a deadline set by opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ for humanitarian aid to be brought into the country from abroad. Mr GuaidÃ³, head of the National Assembly and self-declared interim president, and his supporters are trying to gather a million volunteers. Volunteers gather in Caracas ahead of Saturday's deadline They want to spread the word about how important this humanitarian aid is. It does not sound like many in this meeting need convincing. When asked who wants to be a volunteer, everyone raises their hands. There is a feeling of optimism among many Venezuelans at the moment - an energy that has not existed in the country for a long time. And the hope that Saturday may be the start of a new path. Liset Marin, who attended the meeting, says she hopes change is coming Standing on the edge of the crowd are Liset Marin and her two children. Her husband is in Panama, where he has had to find work because of the crisis. ""There have been so many struggles before and nothing's ever happened,"" she says, her voice breaking as she speaks. She apologises for being emotional, but says it is all too much. ""This time, we feel things are evolving and there will be a change. We can only hope."" Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Mr Maduro has accused the aid of being a Trojan horse, a US-orchestrated show and excuse to interfere in Venezuela. There is no doubt this has become a political issue. But Alberto Kabbabe, the director of a local charity helping to feed Venezuelans, says the fault lies squarely with the president. ""He's the one who created the crisis here in Venezuela,"" he says. ""The National Assembly asked for humanitarian aid in 2016, we've been asking in 2017 and 2018 and now in 2019. There are a lot of people dying because they don't have access to what they need, so the show has been created by Maduro's government."" In parliament this week, Miguel Pizarro, the opposition politician in charge of humanitarian aid, also hit back at accusations from the international community that aid was being used for political ends. ""We're also worried that for political reasons, people are dying in this country,"" he said in a speech where he pleaded with the armed forces to let the aid through. ""And for political reasons, our surgeons don't have the right tools."" This video can not be played James Reynolds: A bus ride through crisis-hit Caracas Juan GuaidÃ³'s push to bring aid into the country is a clear strategy, experts say, and an understandable one. ""This is an attempt to put Maduro in a difficult spot of his own making,"" says David Smilde, a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America think-tank. ""It's not crazy for him [Maduro] to think it's a Trojan horse, because very clearly this has been on the opposition's agenda. ""It's a way of drawing international attention,"" he continues. ""It's important to make that clear that this whole situation wouldn't exist if Maduro had said: 'OK opposition, you want to bring in some aid? Go for it.'"" Will the aid help? ""I think that the intention is to dramatise the situation,"" says Michael Shifter of the Inter-American Dialogue think-tank in Washington. ""It's certainly not the solution - and the solution won't come without a political change in Venezuela,"" he says, adding that this is a strategy aimed at winning the hearts and minds of officers. This video can not be played Why Venezuela matters to the US... and vice versa There is so much uncertainty around what will happen on Saturday. President Maduro still controls Venezuela's borders and in that respect has the upper hand. But many are looking to next week already. If the stand-off drags on, the fear is that this positive energy that has revived Mr Maduro's critics will wane, as will the interest of the international community, and that's what Juan GuaidÃ³ needs to achieve regime change. People want to know about a plan B - if indeed Mr GuaidÃ³ has thought of one. Otherwise, the hope here will soon turn to despair.

"Theresa May is a reserved figure who rarely betrays any emotions and certainly never likes to show any signs of weakness. But the defection of Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen - three Conservative MPs from the One Nation wing of the party - may have struck a chord. The prime minister wrote to the trio on Thursday, expressing sadness at their decision - although she did challenge their attack on her leadership. Mrs May also called in two of the trio's political soulmates, the former ministers Justine Greening and Phillip Lee, for lengthy discussions at Number 10. Lee, who was once one of the PM's closest friends at Westminster, had not spoken to her since he resigned as a justice minister in July in protest at her handling of Brexit. Over the last 24 hours, he received texts from the party chairman Brandon Lewis and the chief whip Julian Smith. And then there was the invitation for a 45-minute chat with the prime minister at Number 10 to discuss Brexit and much else beyond. ""Something has happened,"" one source close to Lee says. ""They must be worried."" The odd sign of prime ministerial nerves is explained by the potentially painful challenge facing Mrs May next week. MPs are guaranteed a fresh Brexit vote next Wednesday. If she is unable to satisfy the likes of Mr Lee and Ms Greening, who are determined to rule out a no-deal Brexit, Mrs May could find her hand is forced by Parliament. Before being invited to Number 10 on Thursday, Justine Greening complained multiple requests for meetings had been ignored Former Conservative cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin is understood to be confident that, in such circumstances, he would win a vote on a cross-party amendment that could extend Article 50. The amendment, drawn up with the former Labour cabinet minister Yvette Cooper, would seek to force the PM to avoid a no-deal Brexit by setting aside time for a Parliamentary bill. If she fails to reach a deal with the EU by the middle of March, the bill would oblige the prime minister to: Put a motion before parliament proposing a no-deal exit on 29 March. That is designed to present a stark choice which would be rejected by MPs, Mr Letwin hopes. Or put down a motion proposing an extension to Article 50. A number of ministers are saying in private they would be prepared to lose their jobs to be able to support the Cooper-Letwin amendment. Other ministers believe that, in the end, an insufficient number of their colleagues would resign to allow the amendment to pass. The prime minister is taking no chances and is working hard to secure a revised deal with the EU by next Tuesday, the eve of vote. She met European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels on Wednesday and will talk to EU leaders in the margins of an EU-Arab League summit in Sharm el-Sheikh on Sunday and Monday. Downing Street is looking for changes to Mrs May's Brexit deal on two levels: An assurance, possibly in the form of a legal codicil attached to the withdrawal agreement, that the Northern Ireland backstop would never be permanent. The backstop is designed to avoid the return of physical infrastructure on the Irish border by aligning Northern Ireland closely to the EU in the event of a failure to agree a future UK-EU relationship by the end of the planned transition period. A guarantee in the political declaration, which sets out the framework for the future relationship, that ""alternative arrangements"" - new technology - would be at the heart of the future relationship. This would avoid the need for a ""hard border"". The EU is keen to help but has two concerns. It will not offer any legal guarantees that undermine the withdrawal agreement, and it fears that it could make concessions that are then rejected by MPs. One cabinet minister told me they are confident that the prime minister will secure a deal in time for her to upgrade next week's parliamentary vote to a legally binding ""meaningful"" vote. Another minister tells me: ""There will be a deal... by 29 March. The EU always goes to the line."" But then the minister added: ""Never underestimate the ability of this prime minister to muck things up."" The pointed remarks show that as Brexit nears the endgame, this lonely prime minister struggles to command loyalty even among her ministers.

He turned himself in on Friday after an arrest warrant was issued. Even though bail was set at $1m, he will have to post $100,000 to secure his release. He has been ordered to surrender his passport and to have no contact with anyone under the age of 18. The 52-year-old's court appearance comes just weeks after a documentary series called Surviving R Kelly aired. It contained decades of allegations of abuse against him from many women, including the singer's ex-wife. The judge chairing Saturday's hearing was John Fitzgerald Lyke Jr, who presided over last week's bail hearing for actor Jussie Smollett. The actor is accused of staging a hoax hate crime against himself. Chicago Police released an image of the singer after his arrest Kelly appeared in court on Saturday afternoon and faces 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. Prosecutors said that one of the cases relates to footage showing Kelly engaging in sex with a 14-year-old girl, according to the Associated Press. Kelly was previously acquitted over another video tape of a similar nature in 2008. Kelly met another of the four girls, who was 16 at the time, when she asked for the singer's autograph during the same trial. Another accuser met Kelly at a restaurant as she celebrated her 16th birthday. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx previously said the singer could face a maximum of seven years in prison for each count. Kelly has faced, and denied, accusations about sexual and physical abuse for decades. History of allegations against R Kelly R Kelly's daughter: He's a monster In 1994 it was reported he married 15-year-old singer and musical protÃ©gÃ© Aaliyah at a secret ceremony in Chicago when he was 27. US media said she had lied about her age on the certificate, and the marriage was later annulled. In 2002 the star was charged with child pornography in Chicago over footage that appeared to show him engaging in intercourse, oral sex, urination, and other sexual acts with a girl said to be 13 or 14. The case took six years to go to trial. Both Kelly and the girl alleged to be in the video denied it was them. Eventually the jury acquitted Kelly of all 14 charges against him. People have been calling for a boycott on Kelly's music with the hashtag #MuteRKelly In 2017, Kelly was forced to deny allegations that he was holding a number of young women captive in a so-called ""abusive cult"" after a bombshell report from BuzzFeed News. He has also been sued privately by a number of women, including some who allege underage sexual relationships and another who says he ""intentionally"" infected her with a sexually transmitted disease. The singer has continued to make music throughout the allegations. There have been calls to boycott Kelly's music- both recordings and performances - with people using the social media hashtag #MuteRKelly. Ms Foxx had urged women to come forward after the documentary series aired.

"Emily Thornberry said she would rather die than join another party A group of MPs who left Labour have ""betrayed"" their seats and would be ""crushed"" if by-elections were held, the shadow foreign secretary has said. Emily Thornberry accused eight MPs who quit the party to form The Independent Group in the Commons of going to ""cuddle up to Tories on the benches"". She told a Labour rally in Broxtowe she would rather die than join a new party. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has said the defections are a cause for regret and reflection, not anger. The departing Labour MPs said earlier this week they were leaving the partyover its stance on Brexit and the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism. They werefollowed by three Tory MPswho cited ""a shift to the right"" in their party and the government's ""disastrous handling of Brexit"" as reasons for their departure. Latest MP to quit Labour 'ashamed' of party Who are the Independent Group and what do they want? Could new group reshape political tribes? The newly-formed ""The Independent Group"" - which at the moment remains a grouping in Parliament not an official political party - says it represents ""the centre ground of British politics"". They have urged like-minded MPs from other parties to join them. But Ms Thornberry accused the Labour MPs of having had ""the cheek to reject our new manifesto and our new leader"". She said: ""It was our manifesto and our leader that gave them the huge majorities that they now have in their seats - those seats they have betrayed by their actions."" ""If our new independent splitters have got the guts to have by-elections, we will crush them."" If an MP changes or leaves the party they were elected under, it does not automatically trigger a by-election. This is because at the ballot box voters choose the individual they want as their MP, not the party they wanted running the country. A by-election can happen if the defectors resign as MPs or if voters in their constituencies call for a petition to recall their MP. However, voters can only call for a petition under specific circumstances, such as an MP being convicted of an offence and receiving a custodial sentence. None of these conditions applies to the members of the Independent Group. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also joined Emily Thornberry at the rally Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn also addressed the crowd in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire - the constituency of the former Conservative MP Anna Soubry, who has also joined the new grouping. ""I'm very sad at some of the things that have happened and very sad at some of the things that have been said. ""Walking away from our movement achieves nothing"", he said. On Friday,Ian Austin become the ninth MP to quit Labour this week, blaming Mr Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"". But the MP for Dudley North said he had no plans to join The Independent Group. Meanwhile, Theresa May's government's working majority was reduced after three MPsresigned earlier this week- Ms Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston. The trio - who all support the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum - held a press conference and criticised the government for letting the ""hard-line anti-EU awkward squad"" take over the party. They joined The Independent Group, with Ms Allen saying she was ""excited"" about the future and wants to be ""a part of something better, a party that people vote for because they want to, not because they feel they have to."" The Independent Group is not a registered political party and has not published a manifesto - although it does have a list of values on its website. Now with 11 members, the new group has the same number of MPs as the Lib Dems and is the joint fourth largest.

"This video can not be played Kelly has faced, and denied, accusations about abuse for decade A judge in the US has set R Kelly's bail at $1m (Â£766,500) after the singer was charged with sexually abusing four females, including three minors. The R&B star, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has faced decades of sexual abuse claims. He has never been convicted and has previously denied other allegations. He turned himself in on Friday after an arrest warrant was issued. Even though bail was set at $1m, he will have to post $100,000 to secure his release.

"Cardinal Marx called for greater transparency within the Church A senior Roman Catholic Cardinal has said that files documenting child sexual abuse were destroyed, allowing offences to continue. German Cardinal Reinhard Marx told a conference on paedophilia in the Church that procedures to prosecute offenders ""were deliberately not complied with"". ""The rights of victims were effectively trampled underfoot,"" he said. The unprecedented four-day summit has brought together 190 bishops from across the world.

"The man and women were in a Citroen car when the crash happend A man and a woman in their 70s have died in a crash involving a van being pursued by police in south-east London. The crash happened on Footscray Road, Eltham, just after midnight. Scotland Yard said officers had spotted the Ford Transit van being driven ""erratically at speed"" and the driver had failed to stop. The man and the woman, who were in another car, died at the scene. The driver of the van was arrested and taken to hospital. He was held on suspicion of driving while over the alcohol limit, driving while unfit through drugs, and causing death by dangerous driving, the Met said. The incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. The arrested man was driving a van Neighbour Mahmut Hasan, 57, said he woke up when he heard the car crash into his Honda. ""I came down and saw [paramedics] trying to resuscitate the older couple for a long time. I saw the passenger side had a walking stick next to it. ""Their whole car was a mess. Very badly damaged. The front was gone."" Hussein Dervish, 65, also heard the noise and went outside to see what had happened. ""I was in the back of my house when I heard just a loud bang. Even with the double glazing and all that, I still heard it. ""I went outside and saw the car and the van. I said to the police officer: 'I hope the [couple] are okay?' But the policeman said they weren't."" The Met's deputy commissioner Stephen House said the thoughts of the force were with the family of those who died.

"First-time buyers now make up the majority of home purchases bought with a mortgage in the UK, figures show. The Halifax bank said the last time such a situation existed was 1995. Its research found Pendle in Lancashire and Copeland in Cumbria were the most affordable areas, with homes costing 2.6 times local earnings on average. An average deposit of Â£32,841 is required to get on the property ladder in the UK, but first-time buyers in London need to find Â£110,656. Where can I afford to live? What help can first-time house buyers get? The Halifax First-Time Buyer Review is based on figures from industry group UK Finance, as well as its own house price database and Office for National Statistics earnings figures. Halifax said first-time owners in 2018 accounted for just over half of all sales with a mortgage. There has been an overall increase in UK first-time buyers from 192,300 in 2008 to 372,000 in 2018, although in Scotland and Wales numbers have fallen, the research found. According to the Halifax , the average price of a typical first home has jumped by 39%, from Â£153,030 in 2008 to Â£212,473 in 2018. It said terraced houses, followed by semi-detached properties, were the first-time buyer's home of choice over the past decade. A first-time buyer would be close to being able to buy a home outright in the north east of England or Northern Ireland for the same money it would take to raise a deposit in the capital last year, where the average price paid by a first-time buyer was Â£426,857. In north-east England the average first-time buyer home was Â£126,104 while in Northern Ireland it was Â£129,615. In Wales a first-time buyer spent an average of Â£144,542 in 2018, and in Scotland it was Â£141,671. Russell Galley, managing director at the Halifax, said the continued growth in first-time buyers came despite a shortage of homes and the ongoing challenge of raising a deposit. Jackie Bennett, director of mortgages at UK Finance, said competitive mortgage deals and government schemes such as Help to Buy have boosted the market for first-time buyers while new buy-to-let purchases were ""dampened"" by tax and regulatory changes. East Ayrshire in Scotland was identified as the third most affordable area, with homes at three times local gross earnings. Brent, in north-west London, was identified as the least affordable area, with first-time buyer property prices at 13.3 times local earnings, followed by two other areas in the capital - Hackney and Newham, in east London. Oxford was the only place outside London among the top 10 least affordable areas for first-time buyers, where average prices were nearly 11 times local earnings. Where can I afford to live?

"There is much to like about Only Fools and Horses The Musical: the premise, the songs, the optimism. The revolving set is good, too - moving the action seamlessly from the Nags Head Pub to the Trotters' high-rise council flat in Peckham, South London. It's all cushdy, as Del Boy would say. The only snag is it's also a bit like his famous yellow, three-wheeled motor; as in it occasionally misfires and never really gets going. That might be because the show isn't properly run in, and needs more time to warm up, but the night I went it lacked the horsepower required to turn a long-running television sitcom into a memorable night at the theatre. There is a sense of watching a group of talented Only Fools and Horses super-fans going through classic routines from the TV show (Del Boy falling through the bar, Rodney trying to explain to Trigger that his name is not Dave, and so on) without ever fully owning their stage adaptation. The impersonations are all excellent, but for it to work as a piece of stand-alone musical theatre, the performers need to move beyond paying homage to a much-loved series and have the confidence to inhabit the characters and make them live in the present. I don't really care if Tom Bennett's Del Boy sounds like David Jason's or if Ryan Hutton employs the same mannerisms Nicholas Lyndhurst used when he played Rodney. What matters is the chemistry between the two actors and their ability to match Jason and Lyndhurst by becoming a memorable comic double act. They are not helped by the show's opening, which sees Bennett spraying around famous Del Boy quotes like some of that knock-off perfume he flogs. Rodney, Del Boy and Grandad: Tom Bennett, Whitehouse and Ryan Hutton ""This time next year we'll be millionaires... He who dares wins,"" and Rodney's ""two GCEs"" fill the air with the faintly stale aroma of nostalgia. It perks up with a lusty rendition of the programme's theme tune Hooky Street, at which point the cast relax and the show starts to find its feet. The story compresses more than 20 years and 60 episodes of the show into a two-hour tale in which Rodney and Cassandra (Pippa Duffy) are making wedding preparations, Boycie (Jeff Nicholson) and Marlene (Samantha Seager) are trying to conceive, and Del Boy goes to a dating agency looking for a ""sort"" and ends up with Raquel (Dianne Pilkington). The original series was written by John Sullivan, whose metier was the television sitcom (Citizen Smith, Just Good Friends). Only Fools and Horses was his masterpiece, a combination of the best of The Phil Silvers Show and Steptoe & Son, with characters drawn as well as a Michelangelo sketch. Samantha Seager plays Marlene with Jeff Nicholson as Boycie In 1996 a single episode was watched by 24 million people. Sullivan died in 2011 having mulled on the idea of a musical version. In 2015 his son Jim found an outline for an opening scene, and then happened upon a cassette tape made by Chas and Dave singing a song co-written by his father called This Time Next Year. Lovely jubbly. Paul Whitehouse was approached to help write the script and Only Fools and Horses The Musical was born. Whitehouse ended up doing much more than write the script. The production recreates scenes from the TV show He collaborated with the late Chas Hodges on some numbers, wrote others in their entirety, and took on the role of Granddad in the production. All of his contributions are worthy of Sullivan's legacy. The song Where Have All the Cockneys Gone, co-written with Hodges, is a high point as it morphs into Any Old Iron. And giving Trigger a crystal ball in which to gaze and see gentrified Peckham of the future full of artisan shops instead of dodgy fly-pitchers provides a welcome break from the sentimentality. As does Del Boy receiving a going over by a couple of local faces. The jokes come thick and fast. The TV cast included [L-R] Paul Barber, Patrick Murray, Sue Holderness, Roy Heather, John Challis and Roger Lloyd Pack Some land, such as Del Boy telling his dating agent that ""he's been engaged more times than a switchboard"". Others fall flatter than Rodney's stag night, most noticeably when Del Boy has a crack at topical humour, declaring knowingly: ""We're all part of Europe now. We're all one big happy family."" Television and theatre are very different mediums. The original TV cast were hugely popular You can't simply transplant one to another and expect the operation to be a success. Hence the introduction of the musical element. But too much of the production is a lift from the TV series without the benefit of the cutaways, close-ups and shot changes to capture the comic nuances of John Sullivan's scripts. It is possible Only Fools and Horses The Musical will settle down and find its feet as a theatre show, but right now it is a lovingly constructed, professionally produced tribute show that fails to live up to the original.

"Melissa McCarthy has an outside chance of adding an Oscar to her Razzie With this year's Oscars being handed out on Sunday, Hollywood is in the grip of awards fever. But there are some awards no movie stars want. The winners of the Golden Raspberries, for the worst films and performances of the year, have been announced. Sherlock Holmes rehash Holmes & Watson won four including worst film and worst supporting actor for John C Reilly. Melissa McCarthy won worst actress - despite the fact she is also up for the best actress gong at the actual Oscars. She received her Razzie for her roles in both The Happytime Murders and Life of the Party. However, she did receive a consolation in the form of a ""Razzie redeemer award"" for Can You Ever Forgive Me? - the film for which she is nominated for best actress at the real Academy Awards. Jamie Lee Curtis defends Oscars amid 'chaos' The Oscar film that almost had a different star She plays author-turned-conwoman Lee Israel, but she's an outsider for the Oscar - she'll have to beat Glenn Close and Olivia Colman, among others, to win. Even if she does, she won't be the first person to win an Oscar and a Razzie in the same year. Holmes and Watson, which starred John C Reilly (left) and Will Ferrell, was panned by critics Sandra Bullock managed that in 2010, when she won the Academy Award for The Blind Side a day after she picked up the raspberry-shaped statuette for All About Steve. She even turned up to the Razzies ceremony with a trailer full of DVDs of the offending film. Unfortunately, McCarthy didn't have the chance to receive her raspberry in person because the Razzies no longer hold a physical award ceremony.

"Tommy Robinson led a protest outside the BBC offices in Salford earlier on Saturday About 4,000 people joined former English Defence League leader Tommy Robinson in a protest against the BBC. The corporation confirmed an upcoming Panorama episode was investigating Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon. He criticised the programme at the rally outside the BBC's Salford offices. About 500 people attended a counter-protest by anti-fascists. The BBC said the episode would follow its ""strict editorial guidelines"". A counter-protest was also held at MediaCityUK by anti-fascists Mr Yaxley-Lennon said the aim of the protest was to make a stand ""against the corrupt media"" and called for the BBC licence fee to be scrapped. During the rally, undercover filming of BBC Panorama journalist John Sweeney, carried out by a supporter of Mr Yaxley-Lennon, was broadcast on a large screen. Mr Sweeney is heard saying ""one of my political heroes is the former head of the IRA Martin McGuinness"", which the BBC says was taken out of context as Mr Sweeney was referencing Mr McGuinness's role in the peace process. Mr McGuinness, who, as a prominent Sinn Fein politician, became Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, had acknowledged he was a member of the IRA. He died in 2017. Mr Sweeney was also recorded making remarks which Tommy Robinson has described as racist, homophobic and anti-working class. In response, a BBC spokeswoman said: ""The BBC strongly rejects any suggestion that our journalism is 'faked' or biased. ""Any programme we broadcast will adhere to the BBC's strict editorial guidelines. ""Some of the footage which has been released was recorded without our knowledge during this investigation and John Sweeney made some offensive and inappropriate remarks, for which he apologises. BBC Panorama's investigation will continue."" Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, spoke to a crowd of about 4,000 UKIP leader Gerard Batten told demonstrators that Mr Yaxley-Lennon ""speaks up for things that are right, he tells the truth and he can mobilise lots of people like you, and that's what they fear"". A rally organiser also took to the stage and told demonstrators: ""Don't touch the photographers or any of the media companies. Let them be. Just for today."" The National Union of Journalists (NUJ) said they ""roundly condemn Tommy Robinson... and his fellow, far-right thugs who intend to intimidate staff at the corporation, particularly those working on Panorama"". ""BBC staff should be free to do their jobs without these threats,"" the NUJ spokesperson added. ""Intimidation, threats and violence carried out by far-right protesters systematically targeting the media, especially photojournalists, are becoming more frequent and we will always call out this behaviour and report criminal activity to the police."" In May 2018, Mr Yaxley-Lennon was jailed for potentially prejudicing two court cases - in Canterbury and Leeds - after having been found to have broken contempt of court laws by live-streaming outside them on social media. The Court of Appeal later quashed the Leeds conviction and ordered that it be reheard in its entirety. Mr Yaxley-Lennon iswaiting for a decision from the attorney generalon whether he will face a full trial for the alleged contempt outside Leeds Crown Court - the ruling that he committed contempt of court by live-streaming in Canterbury still stands. He told the Salford protest: ""I want us all to give him a messageâ¦  I dare you to charge me again because I just want to see the scenes outside court."" In November,PayPal announced it would no longer process payments for Mr Yaxley-Lennon, saying he had broken its policy on acceptable use. He wasbanned from Twitterin March 2018. It is understood that his account was suspended for breaking its ""hateful conduct policy"".

"Cardinal Marx called for greater transparency within the Church A senior Roman Catholic Cardinal has said that files documenting child sexual abuse were destroyed, allowing offences to continue. German Cardinal Reinhard Marx told a conference on paedophilia in the Church that procedures to prosecute offenders ""were deliberately not complied with"". ""The rights of victims were effectively trampled underfoot,"" he said. The unprecedented four-day summit has brought together 190 bishops from across the world.

"Dozens of normally loyal Conservative MPs could rebel against the government in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit, Downing Street has been warned. Leaders of the Brexit Delivery group of MPs, comprising Leavers and Remainers, say up to 30 may back alternatives if the PM's reworked deal isn't voted on. No 10 says talks aimed at getting the changes MPs demand continue ""at pace"". Meanwhile, John McDonnell has suggested Labour is ""moving towards"" backing another Brexit referendum. The shadow chancellortold the Evening Standard,externalhe was warming to the idea of MPs backing a Commons amendment which would approve the Brexit deal but only if it was put to the public in another vote. Theresa May's efforts to win round European leaders will continue at a summit in Egypt over the weekend. Her spokeswoman said the PM would have another ""period of engagement"" on Brexit at an EU-League of Arab States summit in Sharm el-Sheikh - including a meeting with European Council president Donald Tusk. But a senior EU official said there would be ""no deal in the desert"", since not all the 27 other EU leaders would be present and the issue required proper preparation. A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame May reaches out to Remainer rebels Threat of no-deal Brexit 'focusing minds' The UK remains on course to leave the European Union on 29 March. But the government has repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility of the UK leaving without a formal deal, in the event that Mrs May cannot get MPs to approve the deal she negotiated with Brussels in time. On Friday, theIrish government published a wide range of emergency measuresto support businesses, protect jobs and essential services that will be enacted if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. This video can not be played Nadine Dorries says ERG members are ""absolutely desperate for a deal, but weâre desperate for the right deal"". Many MPs fear that scenario would be damaging to business and cause chaos at ports. Growing concerns over the prospect of a no-deal exit are set to come to a head next Wednesday when MPs debate Brexit again and, if the UK and EU haven't agreed a deal by then, will vote on future options. The Brexit Delivery Group (BDG) says ""numerous"" Tory MPs are prepared to back an amendment tabled by former minister Sir Oliver Letwin and Labour's Yvette Cooper to give Parliament the opportunity to delay Brexit and prevent a no-deal situation if there is no agreement with the EU by the middle of March. It has been reported that a handful of ministers, including potentially some in the cabinet, could also back the amendment, in what would be a direct challenge to the prime minister's authority. TheBBC's Newsnight's political editor Nicholas Wattsaid a number ""were saying in private they would be prepared to lose their jobs"" to be able to support the amendment. BDG co-chairman Andrew Percy told the BBC that members of his group were becoming ""tired"" of the rival European Research Group faction's refusal to back the prime minister. The ERG of Brexiteers, led by Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker, insist the ""no-deal"" option must be preserved as negotiating leverage in Brussels and declined to back the PM in a non-binding vote on the issue recently. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. In a letter to government whips, Mr Percy and his co-chairman Simon Hart write: ""Not only does this risk damaging the national interest, but also... we are putting in jeopardy the very thing many colleagues have spent decades campaigning for; our exit from the European Union."" They believe the main sticking point - MPs' demands for changes to the backstop, the ""insurance policy"" to prevent the return of customs checks on the Irish border - will be secured. However, they fear it might not be enough to win over some Brexiteers. One ERG member, Nadine Dorries, insisted the group was not ""holding the government to ransom"", telling the BBC's Politics Live that all but one member was ""desperate for a deal"". On Thursday, Mrs May held meetings with senior ministers who have expressed concerns about the impact of a no-deal scenario on business and also leading Remainers in her party, such as Justine Greening and Phillip Lee. The duo have been touted as potential defectors to the newly formed Independent Group of ex-Tory and Labour MPs, which is calling for another EU referendum in return for supporting the PM. This video can not be played Brexit: Can Remainers and Leavers come together? This video can not be played BBC Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth explains what we know so far about The Independent Group Mr Lee told the BBC that although he was staying in his party, there were ""worrying"" signs of a ""populist"" shift in direction and it was time for Mrs May to ""face down"" the ERG. ""There are elements of that group that do not reflect the Conservatism that I joined in 1992 and it's about time that we dealt with it,"" he told Radio 4's Today. The government has described the latest talks in Brussels involving Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier as ""productive"". It says they will move to a ""technical level"", with Mr Barclay and Mr Cox meeting Mr Barnier again early next week.

Some 35 people were reported dead in the state of Assam on Sunday, days after about 100 people died in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Ten people have been arrested over the bootleg drink, a police official said. There were many women among the victims, who all worked on tea plantations. An inquiry has been ordered into the tragedy. The death toll is believed to be the highest since a 2011 case in West Bengal, where more than 170 people died after ingesting bootleg alcohol. The first victims died on Thursday, according to the administrator of the Golaghat district in Assam, Dhiren Hazarika. Golaghat district Superintendent of Police Pushkar Singh told the BBC Hindi service that police had found the home where the toxic liquor was made and had recovered one and a half litres (2.5pts) of it. Doctors at the hospitals where the victims were being treated were baffled by the ingredients used in the illegal alcohol, which has caused organ failure. An expert team from the city of Guwahati is being brought in analyse the contents of the drink A tea plantation worker who consumed the bootleg alcohol lies on a drip ""The people came to the hospital with severe vomiting, extreme chest pain and breathlessness,"" Dr Ratul Bordoloi, joint director of Golaghat's health department, told the AFP news agency. One worker who was undergoing treatment at Golaghat Hospital told the BBC that he had been at a tea plantation on Thursday when the purchase the alcohol. ""I had bought half a litre of wine and drank it before eating,"" he said. ""Initially, everything was normal, but after some time my head started hurting. The headache grew so much that I could not eat or sleep."" The man felt restless until the morning, when he started getting chest pain.

"This video can not be played Kelly has faced, and denied, accusations about abuse for decade R Kelly has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, at least nine of which involve minors. The R&B star, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has faced decades of claims of sexual abuse against women and teenagers below the age of consent. He has never been convicted and has previously denied other allegations. An arrest warrant was issued, and the 52-year-old turned himself in to police in Chicago later on Friday. His lawyer says he is ""shell-shocked"". Steve Greenberg told The Associated Press that his client was ""extraordinarily disappointed and depressed"" by the charges and maintains his innocence. The indictment come just weeks after a documentary series called Surviving R Kelly aired. It contained decades of allegations of abuse against R Kelly, from many women, including the singer's ex-wife. Prosecutors in Cook County announced the aggravated criminal sexual abuse charges, involving four victims, on Friday. The singer is known for songs such as Ignition and I Believe I Can Fly They say they took place between 1998 and 2010. Documents say at least three of the victims were aged between 13 and 16 at the time of their reported assaults. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said he could face a maximum of seven years in prison for each count. A no-bail arrest warrant has been issued for Kelly. Mr Greenberg, his lawyer, told AP that he had offered to sit down with prosecutors before the filing to describe ""why these charges are baseless"" but said they refused. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx had urged women to come forward after the documentary series aired. History of allegations against R Kelly R Kelly's daughter: He's a monster Lawyer Michael Avenatti has said he is representing six people, including two alleged victims, making allegations against Kelly. At least one of the victims is included in Friday's indictment, he said. Kelly was previously acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 Mr Avenatti came forward last week to say he had uncovered and handed over previously unreleased footage showing Kelly engaging in sex with an underage girl to prosecutors. The lawyer says the 40-minute tape, believed to be shot in 1999, shows him having sexual intercourse and engaging in other sexual and lewd acts with a 14-year-old. He has alleged both Kelly and the girl ""repeatedly"" reference her age as being 14 in the video. Kelly was previously acquitted over another video tape of a similar nature in 2008.

US broadcaster CNN has said it has seen the new footage and described it as ""clear and explicit"". The charges come one day afterlawyer Gloria Allred said she was representing two new womenmaking fresh allegations against Kelly. Kelly has faced, and denied, accusations about sexual and physical abuse for decades. In 1994 it was reported he married 15-year-old singer and musical protÃ©gÃ© Aaliyah at a secret ceremony in Chicago when he was 27. US media said she had lied about her age on the certificate, and the marriage was later annulled. In 2002 the star was charged with child pornography in Chicago over footage that appeared to show him engaging in intercourse, oral sex, urination, and other sexual acts with a girl said to be 13 or 14. The history of allegations against R Kelly The case took six years to go to trial. Both Kelly and the girl alleged to be in the video denied it was them. Eventually the jury acquitted Kelly of all 14 charges against him. People have been calling for a boycott on Kelly's music with the hashtag #MuteRKelly In 2017, Kelly was forced to deny allegations that he was holding a number of young women captive in a so-called ""abusive cult"" after a bombshell report from Buzzfeed News. He has also been sued privately by a number of women, including some who allege underage sexual relationships and another who says he ""intentionally"" infected her with a sexually transmitted disease. The singer has continued to make music throughout the allegations. There have been calls to boycott Kelly's music- both recordings and performances - with people using the social media hashtag #MuteRKelly. Throughout 2018 women continued to come forward publicly alleging abuse. The singer was the subject of the documentary series Surviving R Kelly earlier this year. Across six episodes, a catalogue of women accused him of sexual and emotional abuse - including several who said they were underage when sexual relations began. After the series aired, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx made a plea for victims to come forward and report - saying she was ""sickened"" by the allegations.

"The NHS has been told to stop using pagers for communications by 2021, in order to save money. The health service still uses about 130,000 pagers, which is about 10% of the total left in use globally. They cost the NHS about Â£6.6m a year. Health Secretary Matt Hancock called them ""outdated"" and said he wanted to rid the NHS of ""archaic technology like pagers and fax machines"". However, many in the medical industry say that pagers are quick and reliable. Doctors say they are useful in emergencies, and proposed replacements have their own shortcomings. The pagers used in the NHS today are mostly one-way communication devices that can receive short messages but cannot send replies. To send a message, staff call either an automated phone line or speak to a dedicated operator. The NHS uses about 130,000 pagers The recipient's pager will beep and display the message or a phone number to call. In order to call back, the recipient must use a mobile phone or find a landline. Pagers were widely used in the 1980s, before mobile phones and two-way SMS text messages became more popular. Vodafone ended its national pager service in March 2018. Capita's PageOne is the last remaining national pager network left in the UK, which the government suggests has led to increased costs. One doctor told the BBC that the pager system is useful in emergencies, for example if a patient goes into cardiac arrest in a hospital. Sending an alert to several members of the cardiac arrest team can take less than a minute, which is critical in an emergency situation. This video can not be played Retro tech: When the pager was king The pager network uses its own transmitters and frequencies that penetrate buildings well, so coverage is excellent and messages are typically delivered reliably and quickly. Mr Hancock said ""email and mobile phones"" were a ""more secure, quicker and cheaper way to communicate"". ""We have to get the basics right, like having computers that work and getting rid of archaic technology like pagers and fax machines,"" he said. In 2017, the West Suffolk NHS Foundation Trust ran a trial and replaced its pagers with an app called Medic Bleep. The app let staff message and call one another, individually or in groups, and worked on phones, tablets and desktop computers. The Department of Health and Social Care described it as ""similar to WhatsApp"" but with enhanced security, and said it had saved doctors time. The Trust is now ""weeks away"" from removing non-emergency pagers at its main hospital. However, critics warn: mobile phone and wi-fi coverage in hospitals is patchy and there are often ""dead spots"" web-based messaging services can experience delays and back-logs of messages mobile networks can experience slow-downs or unavailability mobile phones could interfere with hospital equipment while the pager system is old, it is quick and reliable and does the job NHS trusts will be allowed to keep some pagers for emergency situations, for example if the wi-fi or mobile networks went offline. An investigation in 2018 found that the NHS was still sending documents from around 9,000 fax machines, which Mr Hancock also hopes to phase out.

"A man holds a placard at the protest reading, ""Samir didn't die, the government killed him"" Thousands of protesters have marched in Mexico City following the murder of an environmental activist. Samir Flores Soberanes, who was also a journalist, was shot twice in the head in his home in Amilcingo, south of Mexico City, on Wednesday. The protesters held signs saying ""Samir didn't die, the government killed him""; ""Samir lives""; and ""Justice for Samir"". As the march made its way through Mexico City, thousands gathered in Amilcingo to lay Flores to rest. The reasons for the killing are not yet clear but a prosecutor has indicated it was linked to organised crime. Samir Flores Soberanes was gunned down on doorstep in Amilcingo, south of Mexico City Flores was a longstanding opponent of the Proyecto Integral Morelos (PIM), a development project that includes two new thermoelectric plants and a 150km (93 mile) natural gas pipeline in the state. His death came just days before Saturday and Sunday's public referendum on the plants. The Peoples in Defense of Land and Water Front, of which Flores was a member, said he attended a public meeting about the project days before his death and challenged government representatives. Protesters in Mexico City carried placards reading, ""Samir lives"" Mexican president Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador expressed regret about the killing but said the referendum would go ahead. ""I'm very sorry about the murder,"" he said. ""The consultation we have to continue because it is a process that was already agreed to."" Activists fear that the pipeline will contaminate the local water supply, which would predominantly affect the indigenous communities in the area. Flores's family and friends were joined by many others in Amilcingo on Friday for a funeral procession through the streets. The procession paused at the offices of Amiltzinko Community Radio, where Flores worked as a producer. Flores was laid to rest with a funeral procession through his hometown of Amilcingo The contents of a note found next to Flores's body were not disclosed by police. An environmental group he worked with said it believe the murder was linked to his opposition to the pipeline. Officials said that they had no evidence that Flores' killing was linked to the project or the referendum.

"What's the oldest item of clothing in your wardrobe? Chances are you may struggle to top a 70-year-old dress - which happens to be Hannah's pride and joy. ""It was passed down from my grandma to my auntie, then cousin, then me. There are so many amazing dresses like that, built to last."" Radio 1 Newsbeat has been talking to sustainable fashion blogger Hannah about fast fashion - as MPs say clothing brands and retailers shouldpay to fund a clothing recycling scheme.

More than 3,700 litres of water are used in the full lifetime of some pairs of jeans Do you see yourself wearing that item at least 30 times? If the answer is no, then put it back on the rack. Hannah says the more items that factories have to produce - the more damage is done to the environment. ""Commit to wearing clothes more than just once or a handful at times. It also ensures you don't waste your money on things that you don't actually love."" Call up your bestie or organise a meet-up via the group chat. ""Your friends might have some clothes that you may like and vice versa. Swapping wardrobes might also stop you from wasting money on something new."" Bored of that pair of jeans?

Hannah says: ""Around 11 million items of clothing go into landfills every day in the UK which is just a crazy amount. ""If you're just a bit bored of the length of a pair of jeans sometimes I cut the hem off a bit just to give it a bit of a refresh. This keeps my clothes in my wardrobe for years longer."" ""Mend your clothes,"" Hannah advises. ""I find that if I have got a hole in a jumper or a pair of jeans with a broken zipper, I just fix them."" ""Washing clothes on 30Â° rather than 40Â° and not using tumble dryers is definitely better for the environment,"" Hannah says. Washing machines and tumble driers can also age your clothes faster. ""There are lots of websites that give great tips on how to wash different fabrics and different bits of clothing so you can wash your clothes more sustainably."" What a waste: In the UK, hundreds of millions of items of clothing are sent to landfill each year People in the UK send235 million items of clothing to landfillseach year, according to the most recent figures. Hannah says rather than throwing them away - often these items could be given to second hand or charity shops for a new lease of life.

"This video can not be played Sydney Langton said she would never condone killing animals for taxidermy In her spare time, 16-year-old Sydney Langton has a singular passion: stuffing birds and foxes and any other roadkill that comes her way. Here she explains why she loves being a teenage taxidermist. Look into a freezer belonging to any of my friends and you will most likely find chips, fish-fingers and ice cream. That's not the case with me. My own personal freezer, stored out in the family shed, is filled with roadkill. The vegan taxidermist Taxidermist sold monkey heads on eBay The man who was stuffed like an animal The fake taxidermist In it are badgers and foxes, a seagull and duck, some pheasants and partridges. They are not to eat, of course, but to stuff, for my rather unusual hobby - especially for a teenage girl - taxidermy. Admittedly, it's a niche world. Growing up, while my friends were interested in sport or reading, I was fascinated by dead animals. Sydney only uses animals that have died of natural causes or are roadkill If I came across a dead hedgehog or bird, I would poke at it with a stick, or bring it home to examine, marvelling at its anatomy. My interest was piqued further when, age eight, I was visiting a friend's house and saw a fox's head on the wall. With my parent's help, I bought one off eBay, but swiftly realised this wasn't a sustainable path. Instead, I began contacting established taxidermists for advice, and for my 13th birthday, my parents paid for me to attend a course where I was taught how to stuff a jay. It was quite an involved procedure, learning how to remove the meat off the bones, then separate out the feathers and stuff it with shredded wool. I had to make precise incisions and use accurate sewing. From there, I gradually expanded my repertoire. I have done foxes and badgers, stoats and weasels and even an eagle owl, which had been raised in captivity and died aged 10. A stuffed eagle owl, worth around Â£800 I am a member of the Guild of Taxidermists and attend conferences, and although this isn't really a woman's world, or one for teenagers, the experts I've met have been very encouraging and helpful. My work was also given a boost when my teachers [at school in Llandudno, Conwy], said I could submit it for my GCSE artwork. Of course, I know some people find taxidermy squeamish or controversial. But I never condone killing animals for taxidermy, and would only ever work with creatures that have died of natural causes or been hit by cars. When I'm working with protected species, like red squirrels, I have to have official documents that prove they have not been killed for the purpose of taxidermy. Personally, I think the process is beautiful; I see the creature that was once there. I also feel it's a way of preserving the animals for education and of keeping a record of that species for years to come. The only taxidermy I don't like is pet taxidermy, as I don't feel it can ever truly capture the personality of the animal. At work: Sydney says each piece takes days to prepare My hobby has led me to become known locally as the 'taxidermy girl'. Neighbours bang on the door with foxes and magpies, or tell me where roadkill is, which I collect with my dad, Doug, when we're sure it is safe. I invest a lot of time in my work; a single crow can take 10 hours to stuff, and it can be a hard, frustrating process that can end in tears. It is not simply about stuffing an animal. The main aim, in fact, is to make the creature look as lifelike as possible by its stance or position, and it takes a lot of skill, which I'm still learning. My interest has now grown to the extent I want to be a professional taxidermist when I leave school. Already I have some sold some pieces. Sydney's Cabinet of Curiosities for her GCSE artwork A smaller bird or animal goes for roughly Â£80, a full badger for Â£400, and my Eagle Owl is worth Â£800, but it's not for sale. Personally, I love doing birds and one of my ambitions is to taxidermy a peacock. I do realise this is a niche pastime, but for me, it is one creating art of pure beauty. Meet the vegan taxidermist.

"Rachel Tucker plays a pilot in Come From Away The aftermath of the 9/11 attacks might not seem like the most obvious inspiration for a musical, but it's the subject of a new West End show. Come From Away tells the true story of a small Canadian town that took in 7,000 stranded plane passengers after the attacks. The Broadway production won the Tony award for best direction. However,some critics of the London version felt the show glossed over the trauma of 9/11.,external It's not the most unusual subject to become a musical, though. Here are six other real-life and fictional stories that got the song and dance treatment. Carrie was a successful film, starring Sissy Spacek, before it became a musical flop Plots about teenagers coming of age are something of a musical staple. But while the likes of West Side Story continue to delight audiences, the public didn't take a musical version of Stephen King's horror novel Carrie to their hearts. The song and dance routine about slaughtering a pig, at the opening of the second act, might have put some theatre-goers off. Broadway's most notorious flop ran for only three days, when it opened in 1988.An off-Broadway revival in 2012 fared slightly better, but still closed early.,external Princess Diana in Edmonton, Canada, in 1983 More than 20 years after her death, Princess Diana's life story continues to fascinate writers. She's already inspired a 2013 film starring Naomi Watts and the Monica Ali novel Untold Story.A musical about her life begins previews in the US on Tuesday.,external Diana: A New Musical focuses on Diana's life in her twenties and features 23 songs from Bon Jovi's keyboard player David Bryan. Bryan says he's used different musical styles to represent each character: ""Diana is pop-rock, royalty is string quartet, we have paparazzi as punk guitars and we try to make all those roles live on top of each other."" Early readings of the musical were closed to critics, so we'll have to wait until the first preview to find out more. This isn't the first musical to be written about Diana.  Footage of a different production at a Tennessee community theatre has become a viral hit on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Cereal cafe founders Alan and Gary Keery didn't expect their shop to spark protests...let alone a musical The story of the opening of the Cereal Killer cafe in east London has been made into a musical. The cafe, which went on to become a chain, sparked angry protests from locals when it opened in Shoreditch in 2014. Shops hit in anti-gentrification demo Cereal cafe backed by Boris Johnson The musical, originally called Spilt Milk and now renamed The Cereal Cafe, has been in development for two years. The news that the hipster cafe was to become a musical did not go down well with some on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A workshop version of The Cereal Cafe opens in London later this month for a three-day run, so you can see for yourself if it really heralds the end of civilisation. Urinetown is set in a society where everyone must pay to pee Greg Kotis got the idea for his toilet-themed musical, Urinetown, when he encountered his first pay-per-use public loo. The satirical show is set in a future where private toilets have been banned, after years of drought. Critics and audiences managed to see past the show's rather unappealing name.  Urinetown ran on Broadway for three years and scooped a trio of Tonys. The news that the show was to open in London in 2014 led many reviewers to break out their worst toilet puns. The best of the bunch came from The Guardian's Michael Billington, who dubbed Urinetown ""the Spend-a-Penny Opera that's a welcome relief"",external. The Shroud of Turin is a strip of linen that some people believe was used to wrap Jesus's body after the crucifixion Who wouldn't want to see a musical about a scientist who becomes obsessed with finding out whether the Shroud of Turin really was Jesus's burial cloth? Before you answer, keep in mind that it features a high-kicking priest, dancing nuns, and such timeless lyrics as: ""To measure the darkness, you must stand in the dark. But when you stand in the dark, you cannot see a thing."" Despite this, almost nobody went to see the 1986 Broadway musical Into The Light. It closed after just six performances. The cast of Triassic Parq do their best dinosaur impressions in rehearsals If you ever wanted to watch Jurassic Park told from the point of view of the dinosaurs, then the 2012 off-Broadway musical comedy Triassic Parq is for you. Described by the New York Times,externalas a ""bawdy tribute to dinosaurs and their newfound genitalia"", the show follows a group of dinosaurs whose lives are thrown into chaos when one of the females spontaneously turns male. Needless to say, the show didn't achieve quite the same success as the Michael Crichton novel or the Stephen Spielberg film that inspired it.

"This video can not be played The creative solutions to a lack of house affordability For many young people, the pleasures of their own hearth and home are out of reach. About 40% of young adultscannot afford to buy one of the cheapest homes in their areain the UK, with the average deposit nowstanding at about Â£26,000. But they also face""unaffordable"" rentsacross most of Britain, according to recent research. So, many are turning to radical, innovative and sometimes mind-boggling alternatives. The owners of three unorthodox homes explained why they've turned away from bricks and mortar. Tom, Harriet and their son, Ruben, use friends' and family's homes for showers or a break when the weather is particularly bad Harriet Baggley, 24, her partner, Tom Offen, 25, and their son, Ruben, two, live in a van fitted with a log-burning stove, insulation and a makeshift kitchenette. The 2008 Volkswagen Transporter 4, nicknamed ""Iggy"", has been their home since they left rented accommodation in April last year. They move their home-on-wheels to different spots every few days, spending two to three nights a week at a relative's more conventional home while helping them with child care. ""Renting didn't really sit well with us and the other option was buying a house and getting a mortgage, which is something we don't want to do,"" Harriet said. The van's wood-burning stove was fitted by a blacksmith from west Wales The artist and hotel worker believes her family's nine cubic-metre digs is ""massively"" attractive from a financial perspective. But she admits life in such a tiny space can have its drawbacks and is certainly not for everyone. Inside the housing crisis- Why I live in a cupboard 'Why I'm living in a van on the streets of Bristol' Man starts self-build camper-van group ""The hardest part is probably being on top of each other and staying organized. There's not much room to be your own person. ""But we have work, we have time away from each other and we come back to a space that's our own,"" Harriet added. There is no law preventing anyone from living in a van full time, as long as the vehicle is appropriately taxed and insured. The van is fitted with a steel chimney But there can be restrictions on where can you can park and spend the night, with local authorities imposing different rules and constraints. Harriet said it can be a challenge to find places to stay the night but she and Tom have their ""favourite spots"" where they stop for short spells. ""Our long-term plan is to buy a plot of land and to possibly build a cob house - we're not quite sure yet,"" she added. The Â£30,000 price of Clare and Aubrey Fry's home included the cost of buying two purpose-converted containers, as well as the ground works and utility costs For Aubrey Fry, 37, and his wife, Clare, 34, life in a repurposed 40ft shipping container was only meant to be short term. Three years later and the steel box is still home, sweet home. The pair moved to Hay-on-Wye, where Aubrey's family own a farm, after growing frustrated with London property prices. They wanted to keep their costs low, while building their new home and business premises on the land, and Aubrey had an itch to try something different. ""I've always wanted to develop a shipping container and make it into a home,"" Aubrey said. ""There are millions of them all over the world, they get used once and then get taken out of action; and I think they are a good space to live in."" Aubrey and Clare Fry say life with their dog, Morgan, in the shipping container is very cosy So, they bought two converted residential containers from a firm in Liverpool and located them on the farm, near to where they run their canoeing and outdoor activity business. In total, they spent up to Â£30,000 creating the temporary homestead. ""I'd have been putting that [money] into rent if I wasn't putting it into something we could live in and have and keep. ""It's extremely comfortable, I would happily continue living in a shipping container if I didn't have a beautiful new home to live in. But that time is now coming to an end."" Aubrey and Clare Fry's main living space has under-floor heating and a log burner Clare said that, while the space is compact, that can actually be a good thing. ""I've found it really good fun. A way of decluttering,"" she said. But she warned anyone thinking of shipping life to consider theplanning restrictions and regulationsthat apply to some shipping container structures. The couple are now close to moving into their new, permanent home and they plan to sell the shipping container. ""It will be really sad [to see it go], but hopefully it will have a new life somewhere and be just as useful to someone else,"" Clare said. Tom Dutton hopes to build a ""tiny home"" on a trailer, similar to this one, made in Poilley, France Tom Dutton, 30, is a free-wheeling surfer. So it should be no surprise that he wants a drag-and-drop home; one he can pull on wheels to different spots and set down. Something he can build himself. Something cheap. Something tiny. The construction worker is learning how to build a ""tiny home"" -something that is becoming increasingly popular- via short courses run at the Centre for Alternative Technology (CAT) in Machynlleth, Powys. Tom Dutton is hoping to build a transportable tiny home ""A big part of it is the financial freedom that comes with having a tiny home,"" Tom said. ""Not being bridled to a mortgage for the rest of my life, being able to pursue the things I'm passionate about in life."" Aside from catching waves, this includes ""helping others"" in his free time. ""For a lot of people the work-life balance is way out at the moment, and I feel that this is a way to pull that back."" Tiny homes can be built from a number of different materials, with the basic structure often made from a wood frame Of course, a tiny home builder still needs a plot of land and they need to adhere to planning regulations. But Tom, who lives in Porthleven, Cornwall, is hoping to build his moveable digs, mount it on a trailer and then move it between his friends' smallholdings. He hopes to spend Â£10,000 to Â£15,000 to build the self-contained unit within the next 12 to 18 months. BA US city is building tiny homes in peopleâs back gardens This tiny house is home to a family of five Tiny homes- A revolutionary design craze Right now, he believes owning a more conventional home is simply out of reach, having only just worked himself out of his university debt. He said: ""We're living in uncertain times - no-one's got a clue what's going to happen after Brexit or if we have another financial crash. ""The idea that I've got something that's moveable and it's going to keep me warm and dry, and that I can survive comfortably, with very little, makes a lot of sense at the moment.""

The tiny homes movement is growing in popularity in the UK - having gained tractionin the United States- with the outlay for these diminutive dwellings coming in as low as Â£2,500. People living in tiny houses say they arereducing their energy costs as well as their carbon footprints. Carwyn Lloyd-Jones, who teaches the ""tiny homes"" building course at CAT, said it had certainly attracted younger people looking for a cheaper alternative. ""It's because they want to have that space to live in, but they are not necessarily able to afford that plot of land to build a full-size house,"" he said. ""But possibly they might have parents that have got gardens, so they could get planning permission to build a little annexe or they could chuck mum and dad out so they can live in the real house.""

"The man and women were in a Citroen car when the crash happend A man and a woman in their 70s have died in a crash involving a van being pursued by police in south-east London. The crash happened on Footscray Road, Eltham, just after midnight. Scotland Yard said officers had spotted the Ford Transit van being driven ""erratically at speed"" and the driver had failed to stop. The man and the woman, who were in another car, died at the scene. The driver of the van was arrested and taken to hospital. He was held on suspicion of driving while over the alcohol limit, driving while unfit through drugs, and causing death by dangerous driving, the Met said. The incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. The arrested man was driving a van Neighbour Mahmut Hasan, 57, said he woke up when he heard the car crash into his Honda. ""I came down and saw [paramedics] trying to resuscitate the older couple for a long time. I saw the passenger side had a walking stick next to it. ""Their whole car was a mess. Very badly damaged. The front was gone."" Hussein Dervish, 65, also heard the noise and went outside to see what had happened. ""I was in the back of my house when I heard just a loud bang. Even with the double glazing and all that, I still heard it. ""I went outside and saw the car and the van. I said to the police officer: 'I hope the [couple] are okay?'

The US-based Boston Consulting Group has received five contracts, worth Â£14.2m, to work with the Cabinet Office, Departments for Environment, Exiting the European Union and Business. Defra awarded 13 contracts for research services. Gus Tugendhat, the founder of Tussell, a data provider on UK government contracts, told the BBC: ""Even in the best of circumstances, the civil service alone would never have had sufficient capacity to pull off a project like Brexit in the time available"". ""Due to the sheer breadth of issues the government is having to grapple with, it was pragmatic to engage the expertise of consultants - even if it is has led to extra cost for the public sector and a windfall for consulting firms,"" he said. The final amount of money handed to suppliers may be lower than the value of the published contracts. It is possible this analysis has not included Brexit-related contracts where the title or description do not reference it explicitly. ""It's no surprise they have let a lot of contracts,"" said Jill Rutter from the Institute for Government. ""But for the public to be confident about what they have let, it's important that, despite the rushed timescales, [the contracts] have been let through a proper process and government should be transparent about whom they have contracts with and what they are getting for them."" Two of the research contracts are to monitor news and social media reports about Brexit for the Department for Exiting the European Union. One stipulates it wants ""accurate media monitoring data from across the 27 EU countries"". IT contracts valued at Â£10.2m were awarded by government departments, led by the Home Office, which inked four deals, all relating to EU citizens currently living and working in the UK. These include an agreement with Worldreach for facial recognition software for the EU Settlement Scheme app and Fujitsu for ID document scanning work. The lowest value contract made public, worth Â£12,500, was between the Department for Education and a law firm for ""legal analysis on the status of EU national children in the UK and British national children in the EU"". Others covered more specialist areas. Defra agreed a Â£15,000 deal on research to assess ""the impact of Brexit on the milling wheat and malting barley supply chain"". ""The whole of government is preparing for the UK to make an orderly and successful exit from the European Union, and we are equipping ourselves with the right people and the right skills across government to make this happen,"" the spokesman said. Tamzen Isacsson, the chief executive of the Management Consultancies Association, said: ""Brexit has created an unprecedented workload for the UK government with the need to set up and plan new systems to cover border control, trade, agricultural policy and immigration as well as many other complex policy areas."" But Dave Penman, the general secretary of the FDA, the professional association for civil servants, said: ""The eye watering figure of over Â£100m being spent on consultants will come as no surprise to civil servants who have been asked to prepare for Brexit following almost a decade of austerity that has seen the civil service shrink by almost a quarter."" ""Britain's exit of the EU, on whatever terms, will require new skills and greater resources for the civil service for decades to come,"" he added. PWC and Deloitte said they do not comment on client work. Across the public sector, 23 different contracting authorities have awarded Brexit deals - 85 of them, worth a combined Â£107.3m. Many smaller bodies, including Visit Britain, the BFI, and local authorities awarded Brexit-related work. The Arts Council commissioned research ""to quantify the extent of European and international working relationships by arts and cultural organisations in England"". The BFI asked for research to, in part, ""establish lines of work for future research topics to ensure that the economic and cultural value of the UK's screen sectors is preserved and continues to grow over the coming years"". In December, the Treasury said it had provided more than Â£4.2bn for Brexit preparations since 2016.

"Beavers will become a protected species in Scotland from May, Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham has said. The long-awaited and controversial move - opposed by many farmers - follows extensive wrangling over how their numbers should be managed. Farming leaders have raised concerns about the damage caused to agricultural land from their dam-building. Scottish Natural Heritage will issue guidance for farmers over the coming weeks. Ms Cunningham toldRadio Scotland's Out of Doors programme: ""It is what people have been waiting for, it is what we said we were going to do. ""I do appreciate that for a lot of people it seems to have taken a very long time but these things do. You don't just snap your fingers and do it overnight."" Beaver reintroduction 'positive rewilding' Rising beaver numbers worry farmers Beavers' biodiversity benefit highlighted Beavers have been extinct in Scotland for 400 years but were illegally released into the wild in Tayside several years ago. They are regarded as an enemy to farmers because of their dam-building which has led to fields being flooded and crops ruined. The latest count found the population had tripled over six years to 430 beavers in more than 100 active territories. The technical process for adding them to the list of protected species has now been started. Roseanna Cunningham said beavers had both a positive and negative impact on the environment From May it will become an offence to kill, injure or capture the animals. The Scottish Wildlife Trust has been growing increasingly uneasy at the lack of protection for beavers while a final decision was awaited. On Friday, they reported that one had been found dead on a wildlife reserve. They believe it had died from an infection after being shot in the chest. Protection and mitigation measures for farmers, particularly around Tayside, will be ""extensive"" according to the environment secretary. She added: ""I think most farmers realised pretty much a couple of years ago that this was going to happen. ""There will be control measures. We are looking at and talking to them about extensive potential mitigation measures. ""Beavers have a great impact on our environment, they are very good for biodiversity, but to pretend that there aren't some other issues, some more negative impacts, would be to be blind to the truth.""

"Labour would give workers the right to choose their working hours from their first day in a new job, the party's equalities spokeswoman is to say. Employers would be required to allow their employees to work flexibly from day one, Dawn Butler will tell the party's Women's Conference later. This would open up more roles to women who care for loved ones, helping to close the gender pay gap, she will say. Workers can currently request flexible working after 26 weeks in post. This can include features such as job-sharing, working from home, part-time, annualised or compressed hours or flexi-time. However, employers can reject requests provided they do so in ""in a reasonable manner"". 'I dialled into work and prayed my baby wouldn't wake up' Is it the end of the 9 to 5 working day? 'Sandwich carers completely undervalued' Labour says that - if elected - it would create a ""presumption in favour of flexible working"", requiring employers to design the potential for people to work flexibly when creating roles. ""This change to the law is essential to closing the gender pay gap and dismantling the structural barriers that hold women back from promotion and progression,"" Ms Butler will say. Highlighting government statistics on ""sandwich carers"" - those who care both for children and elderly or disabled relatives - Labour says women account for 68% of those providing 20 or more hours of free adult care per week. ""Women do the vast majority of unpaid care, but this must not be a barrier to women in work,"" Ms Butler will tell the conference in Telford. ""Under Labour's plans, no woman will be shut out of the workplace because they're a mum or they care for a parent or a disabled loved one, or both."" The plans would place an onus on employers who wanted to reject applications to prove roles were unsuitable, in line with conditions set out in new statutory guidance. Under current laws, employers can reject applications for various reasons such as that they will lead to damaging extra costs, could affect quality and performance, or work cannot be reorganised among staff. The government took steps to promote flexible working when launching its drive to force large employers to publish their gender pay gaps. In October 2017, Prime Minister Theresa May called on employers to advertise all jobs as flexible from day one, unless there were ""solid reasons"" against doing so. A Flexible Working Task Force, chaired by the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development and including policymakers, employer groups and unions, began work in March last year. 'I dialled into work and prayed my baby wouldn't wake up' Work when you want, firm tells new staff Is it the end of the 9 to 5 working day? 9 to 5? Make it 8 till 4, actually...

"This video can not be played Battle of the concerts held on either side of the Venezuela-Colombia border Venezuela has said that its border with Colombia has been partially closed, shortly after opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ defied a travel ban to cross it. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez tweeted to say the ""total, temporary closure"" was due to serious threats against the country's sovereignty and security. Tensions have been rising over a row about the delivery of humanitarian aid. Two people were killed by Venezuelan security forces on Saturday near the border with Brazil. The violence was condemned by the United States government, which said in a statement: ""The Venezuelan military must allow humanitarian aid to peacefully enter the country. The world is watching."" Should Branson 'back off' from Venezuela? Foreign aid: Genuine help or Trojan horse? Mr GuaidÃ³, the leader of the country's opposition-dominated National Assembly, last month declared himself the country's interim leader. He has since won the backing of dozens of nations, including the US. He has called the rule of President Nicolas Maduro constitutionally illegitimate, claiming that Mr Maduro's re-election in 2018 was marred by voting irregularities. Hundreds of tonnes of humanitarian aid sitting just outside Venezuela's borders have become a flashpoint between Mr GuaidÃ³ and President Maduro. Mr Maduro has so far refused to allow the aid, which includes food and medicine, to cross over into Venezuela. Mr GuaidÃ³ has vowed that hundreds of thousands of volunteers will help bring it in on Saturday. Mr GuaidÃ³ (centre) alongside Chile's President Sebastian Pinera (left) and Paraguay's President Mario Abdo Benitez (right) at a Cucuta aid warehouse On Friday, rival concerts were held just 300m (980ft) away from each other on either side of the Venezuelan-Colombia border. Mr GuaidÃ³ turned up at Venezuela Aid Live in Cucuta, organised by British businessman Richard Branson, on Friday. He was greeted there by the presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay - three of the nations who have recognised the 35-year-old lawmaker as interim president. He alleged that he was able to cross over on Friday with the help of the Venezuelan armed forces. The claim is significant as President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has been able to retain power largely because of his military support. Hours after his appearance, the announcement about the closure of bridges in Tachira state was made. It follows a similar announcement made on Thursday about the closure of the border with Brazil - where another aid collection is being raised. Violent clashes broke out there on Friday morning after members of an indigenous community reportedly confronted Venezuelan troops in the southern village of Kumarakapay. Venezuela closes border with Brazil GuaidÃ³ sets up Venezuela aid confrontation US planes carrying aid arrive in Colombia Witnesses said that troops opened fire on individuals who tried to block a road to prevent military vehicles from passing. Human rights campaigners said soldiers shot and killed two people and wounded 15 others. An ambulance photographed responding to violent clashes near the border with Brazil A spokeswoman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had a meeting with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza on Friday in New York, in which he urged authorities to refrain from using lethal force against demonstrators. Economic conditions have deteriorated rapidly since President Maduro took power in 2013. The UN says about three million people have fled the country over the last few years. Hyperinflation has caused the cost of essentials to soar, leaving many unable to afford basics like food and medicine. Mr GuaidÃ³ has said the aid deliveries are necessary to stop Venezuelans dying. He has vowed to get his supporters to mobilise en-masse to get it in on Saturday. Analysis by Katy Watson, BBC News South America correspondent This is the day Venezuela's opposition has been waiting for. A day that will test the loyalty of the country's armed forces towards Nicolas Maduro and determine his future. Lorries laden with aid are expected to set off from both Colombia and Brazil and attempt to cross the border. A ship carrying aid is also travelling from Puerto Rico. Throughout Venezuela, people will gather at military barracks to ask soldiers for their help in the aid effort. Until now, senior officers have remained loyal to Mr Maduro - but with pressure being heaped on them to help the Venezuelan people, will they listen to their leader or change sides, support Juan Guaido and open the borders? These next few days are deeply uncertain. President Maduro denies there is any crisis and has branded the aid plans a US-orchestrated show. Performers at his rival concert on Friday performed in front of a backdrop that said #TrumpHandsoffVenezuela, the AFP news agency reports. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The US President has led the effort to recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as president, and has implemented economic sanctions to put pressure on President Maduro's government. At a speech earlier this week, he urged the Venezuelan military to switch sides and abandon their support of the president. He has repeatedly reiterated that ""all options are open"" in regards to the US response to the unfolding crisis. Should Branson 'back off' from Venezuela?

"Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari (L) and his opponent Atiku Abubakar cast their ballots Votes are being counted in Nigeria's closely-fought general election, with voting hours extended in some places following delays in the morning. The main challenger to President Muhammadu Buhari, 76, is the former vice president, Atiku Abubakar, 72. Whoever wins will have to address power shortages, corruption, security threats, and a sluggish economy. The election had been due to take place a week ago but was delayed at the last minute for logistical reasons. President Buhari cast his ballot in his hometown of Daura in the northern state of Katsina. Asked if he would congratulate his rival if he lost, he said: ""I will congratulate myself."" About two hours before polls were due to open on Saturday, residents of the town of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state in the country's north-east reported hearing several blasts and gunfire. State police said in a statement that there was no threat to public safety. ""The gunfire were not targeted at members of the public but was for security purposes,"" the statement said. Five things about Nigeria: The superpower with no power Is Africa going backwards on democracy? Borno is the birthplace of the Islamist militant group Boko Haram, which had said it planned to disrupt the elections. In the north-eastern state of Yobe, suspected Islamist militants attacked the town of Geidam, forcing people to flee, the Reuters news agency reported. The initial vote was rescheduled in a dramatic press conference in the early hours of Saturday 16 February, just five hours before polls were due to have opened. President Muhammadu Buhari (l) is expected to face a strong challenge from Atiku Abubakar (r) The Independent National Electoral Commission (Inec) has given several reasons for the delay, including attempted sabotage and logistical issues such as bad weather and problems with delivering the ballot papers. Inec has said that everything is in place for the poll to take place this time round. The candidate with the most votes is declared the winner in the first round, as long as that person gains at least 25% of the votes in two-thirds of Nigeria's 36 states. There are 73 registered candidates in the presidential election, but campaigning has been dominated by the two political giants and the established party machines behind them. The ballot paper has to be extra long in order to fit on all 73 presidential candidates The president's All Progressives Congress (APC) has promised to take the country to the ""next level"", arguing that in his first four-year term Mr Buhari has done a lot of ""foundational work"" that may not be immediately obvious. Mr Abubakar and his People's Democratic Party have pledged ""to get Nigeria working again"", saying that the president has wasted the last four years. Nigerians taken past danger zone to vote Does Nigeria's 'generation democracy' want to vote? Both men are from the mainly Muslim north of the country. While they are in their 70s, more than half of Nigeria's 84 million registered voters are under 35. Nigeria is Africa's largest oil producer but corruption and a failure to invest the proceeds from the industry have hampered development in the country. It slipped into a recession in 2016 and a slow recovery has meant that not enough jobs have been created to cope with the large number of young people coming into the employment market. Currently nearly a quarter of the working age population is unemployed. Election in numbers 73 million have voter's cards 51% of the electorate under the age of 35 73 registered presidential candidates 120,000 polling stations Mr Buhari has quelled a militant Islamist rebellion in the north-east of the country, but Boko Haram remains active. There has also been an upsurge in violence in the country's Middle Belt as traditional herders and more settled farmers have clashed. Up until 1999 Nigeria was governed by either short-lived civilian administrations or military rulers. But this year marks 20 years since the return of democracy. Mr Buhari was elected in 2015 - the first time an opposition candidate had defeated an incumbent to become president.

"The man and women were in a Citroen car when the crash happend A man and a woman in their 70s have died in a crash involving a van being pursued by police in south-east London. The crash happened on Footscray Road, Eltham, just after midnight. Scotland Yard said officers had spotted the Ford Transit van being driven ""erratically at speed"" and the driver had failed to stop. The man and the woman, who were in another car, died at the scene. The driver of the van was arrested and taken to hospital. He was held on suspicion of driving while over the alcohol limit, driving while unfit through drugs, and causing death by dangerous driving, the Met said. The incident has been referred to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. The arrested man was driving a van Neighbour Mahmut Hasan, 57, said he woke up when he heard the car crash into his Honda. ""I came down and saw [paramedics] trying to resuscitate the older couple for a long time. I saw the passenger side had a walking stick next to it. ""Their whole car was a mess. Very badly damaged. The front was gone."" Hussein Dervish, 65, also heard the noise and went outside to see what had happened. ""I was in the back of my house when I heard just a loud bang. Even with the double glazing and all that, I still heard it. ""I went outside and saw the car and the van. I said to the police officer: 'I hope the [couple] are okay?' But the policeman said they weren't."" The Met's deputy commissioner Stephen House said the thoughts of the force were with the family of those who died.

"This video can not be played Battle of the concerts held on either side of the Venezuela-Colombia border Venezuela has said that its border with Colombia has been partially closed, shortly after opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ defied a travel ban to cross it. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez tweeted to say the ""total, temporary closure"" was due to serious threats against the country's sovereignty and security. Tensions have been rising over a row about the delivery of humanitarian aid. Two people were killed by Venezuelan security forces on Saturday near the border with Brazil. The violence was condemned by the United States government, which said in a statement: ""The Venezuelan military must allow humanitarian aid to peacefully enter the country. The world is watching."" Should Branson 'back off' from Venezuela? Foreign aid: Genuine help or Trojan horse? Mr GuaidÃ³, the leader of the country's opposition-dominated National Assembly, last month declared himself the country's interim leader. He has since won the backing of dozens of nations, including the US. He has called the rule of President Nicolas Maduro constitutionally illegitimate, claiming that Mr Maduro's re-election in 2018 was marred by voting irregularities. Hundreds of tonnes of humanitarian aid sitting just outside Venezuela's borders have become a flashpoint between Mr GuaidÃ³ and President Maduro. Mr Maduro has so far refused to allow the aid, which includes food and medicine, to cross over into Venezuela. Mr GuaidÃ³ has vowed that hundreds of thousands of volunteers will help bring it in on Saturday. Mr GuaidÃ³ (centre) alongside Chile's President Sebastian Pinera (left) and Paraguay's President Mario Abdo Benitez (right) at a Cucuta aid warehouse On Friday, rival concerts were held just 300m (980ft) away from each other on either side of the Venezuelan-Colombia border. Mr GuaidÃ³ turned up at Venezuela Aid Live in Cucuta, organised by British businessman Richard Branson, on Friday. He was greeted there by the presidents of Colombia, Chile and Paraguay - three of the nations who have recognised the 35-year-old lawmaker as interim president. He alleged that he was able to cross over on Friday with the help of the Venezuelan armed forces. The claim is significant as President NicolÃ¡s Maduro has been able to retain power largely because of his military support. Hours after his appearance, the announcement about the closure of bridges in Tachira state was made. It follows a similar announcement made on Thursday about the closure of the border with Brazil - where another aid collection is being raised. Violent clashes broke out there on Friday morning after members of an indigenous community reportedly confronted Venezuelan troops in the southern village of Kumarakapay. Venezuela closes border with Brazil GuaidÃ³ sets up Venezuela aid confrontation US planes carrying aid arrive in Colombia Witnesses said that troops opened fire on individuals who tried to block a road to prevent military vehicles from passing. Human rights campaigners said soldiers shot and killed two people and wounded 15 others. An ambulance photographed responding to violent clashes near the border with Brazil A spokeswoman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he had a meeting with Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza on Friday in New York, in which he urged authorities to refrain from using lethal force against demonstrators. Economic conditions have deteriorated rapidly since President Maduro took power in 2013. The UN says about three million people have fled the country over the last few years. Hyperinflation has caused the cost of essentials to soar, leaving many unable to afford basics like food and medicine. Mr GuaidÃ³ has said the aid deliveries are necessary to stop Venezuelans dying. He has vowed to get his supporters to mobilise en-masse to get it in on Saturday. Analysis by Katy Watson, BBC News South America correspondent This is the day Venezuela's opposition has been waiting for. A day that will test the loyalty of the country's armed forces towards Nicolas Maduro and determine his future. Lorries laden with aid are expected to set off from both Colombia and Brazil and attempt to cross the border. A ship carrying aid is also travelling from Puerto Rico. Throughout Venezuela, people will gather at military barracks to ask soldiers for their help in the aid effort. Until now, senior officers have remained loyal to Mr Maduro - but with pressure being heaped on them to help the Venezuelan people, will they listen to their leader or change sides, support Juan Guaido and open the borders? These next few days are deeply uncertain. President Maduro denies there is any crisis and has branded the aid plans a US-orchestrated show. Performers at his rival concert on Friday performed in front of a backdrop that said #TrumpHandsoffVenezuela, the AFP news agency reports. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The US President has led the effort to recognise Mr GuaidÃ³ as president, and has implemented economic sanctions to put pressure on President Maduro's government. At a speech earlier this week, he urged the Venezuelan military to switch sides and abandon their support of the president. He has repeatedly reiterated that ""all options are open"" in regards to the US response to the unfolding crisis. Should Branson 'back off' from Venezuela?

"This video can not be played Kelly has faced, and denied, accusations about abuse for decade R Kelly has been charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse, at least nine of which involve minors. The R&B star, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has faced decades of claims of sexual abuse against women and teenagers below the age of consent. He has never been convicted and has previously denied other allegations. An arrest warrant was issued, and the 52-year-old turned himself in to police in Chicago later on Friday. His lawyer says he is ""shell-shocked"". Steve Greenberg told The Associated Press that his client was ""extraordinarily disappointed and depressed"" by the charges and maintains his innocence. The indictment come just weeks after a documentary series called Surviving R Kelly aired. It contained decades of allegations of abuse against R Kelly, from many women, including the singer's ex-wife. Prosecutors in Cook County announced the aggravated criminal sexual abuse charges, involving four victims, on Friday. The singer is known for songs such as Ignition and I Believe I Can Fly They say they took place between 1998 and 2010. Documents say at least three of the victims were aged between 13 and 16 at the time of their reported assaults. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said he could face a maximum of seven years in prison for each count. A no-bail arrest warrant has been issued for Kelly. Mr Greenberg, his lawyer, told AP that he had offered to sit down with prosecutors before the filing to describe ""why these charges are baseless"" but said they refused. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx had urged women to come forward after the documentary series aired. History of allegations against R Kelly R Kelly's daughter: He's a monster Lawyer Michael Avenatti has said he is representing six people, including two alleged victims, making allegations against Kelly. At least one of the victims is included in Friday's indictment, he said. Kelly was previously acquitted of child pornography charges in 2008 Mr Avenatti came forward last week to say he had uncovered and handed over previously unreleased footage showing Kelly engaging in sex with an underage girl to prosecutors. The lawyer says the 40-minute tape, believed to be shot in 1999, shows him having sexual intercourse and engaging in other sexual and lewd acts with a 14-year-old. He has alleged both Kelly and the girl ""repeatedly"" reference her age as being 14 in the video. Kelly was previously acquitted over another video tape of a similar nature in 2008.

US broadcaster CNN has said it has seen the new footage and described it as ""clear and explicit"". The charges come one day afterlawyer Gloria Allred said she was representing two new womenmaking fresh allegations against Kelly. Kelly has faced, and denied, accusations about sexual and physical abuse for decades. In 1994 it was reported he married 15-year-old singer and musical protÃ©gÃ© Aaliyah at a secret ceremony in Chicago when he was 27. US media said she had lied about her age on the certificate, and the marriage was later annulled. In 2002 the star was charged with child pornography in Chicago over footage that appeared to show him engaging in intercourse, oral sex, urination, and other sexual acts with a girl said to be 13 or 14. The history of allegations against R Kelly The case took six years to go to trial. Both Kelly and the girl alleged to be in the video denied it was them. Eventually the jury acquitted Kelly of all 14 charges against him. People have been calling for a boycott on Kelly's music with the hashtag #MuteRKelly In 2017, Kelly was forced to deny allegations that he was holding a number of young women captive in a so-called ""abusive cult"" after a bombshell report from Buzzfeed News. He has also been sued privately by a number of women, including some who allege underage sexual relationships and another who says he ""intentionally"" infected her with a sexually transmitted disease. The singer has continued to make music throughout the allegations. There have been calls to boycott Kelly's music- both recordings and performances - with people using the social media hashtag #MuteRKelly. Throughout 2018 women continued to come forward publicly alleging abuse. The singer was the subject of the documentary series Surviving R Kelly earlier this year. Across six episodes, a catalogue of women accused him of sexual and emotional abuse - including several who said they were underage when sexual relations began. After the series aired, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx made a plea for victims to come forward and report - saying she was ""sickened"" by the allegations.

"Amber Peat was found hanged after going missing from her home in Mansfield The mother and stepfather of a 13-year-old girl who hanged herself gave ""very little, if any, consideration"" to her welfare, a coroner has said. Amber Peat's mum and stepdad also demonstrated little ""emotional warmth"" towards her, Coroner Laurinda Bower added. Returning a narrative conclusion, she said agencies missed 11 opportunities which may have prevented Amber's death. Amber's mother, Kelly Peat, said she had been ""the best parent"" she could. Ms Bower considered whether to return a conclusion of suicide but she could not be sure Amber intended to die. ""Considering Amber's age, her emotional immaturity and her undoubted vulnerability, and the absence of any professional ever having properly assessed Amber's risk of self-harm or suicide, I am not able to determine, on the balance of probabilities, Amber's intention at the time of her death,"" she said. This video can not be played The couple appeared at a press conference in the days following Amber's disappearance Amber Peat was found hanged in a hedgerow in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, on 2 June 2015. Three days earlier, on 30 May, she had walked out of her homefollowing an argument with her family about chores. She had previously run away from home and also expressed a wish to die. Amber Peat ""always had a sad face"", according to a former class teacher The inquest heard how Mrs Peat became engaged to Amber's stepfather, Daniel Peat, just 12 weeks after splitting up with Amber's biological father. Amber also had to move house and schools during this time, which was ""further complicated"" by the fact Amber was due to take her SAT examinations. ""There appears to have been very little, if any, consideration of the welfare of Amber and this is a theme to which I shall return,"" the coroner said. In her narrative conclusion, the coroner said education, health and social care agencies all missed opportunities to assess Amber and her family. ""Had those agencies responded to safeguarding concerns in an appropriate manner it is possible Amber would not have died when she did,"" the coroner said. Amber's mother Kelly Peat was at the inquest to hear the verdict The inquest heard evidence from several of Amber's teachers who had concerns about her life at home. Amber told one teacher how her stepfather hadpunished her by making her wear baggy grey jogging bottomsto school and carry her belongings in a plastic bag. Mr and Mrs Peat accepted Amber had gone to school wearing the jogging bottoms and carrying a plastic bag, but said shemust have lied when she blamed her stepfatherfor it. However, the coroner found that Amber had been telling the truth. ""I find as a fact that Amber was made to wear the jogging bottoms to school and to use a carrier bag as punishment by Mr Peat in the full knowledge that she would be humiliated,"" the coroner said. ""This was perhaps borne out of the frustration that he was feeling towards Amber rejecting his attempts to discipline her."" Amber's body was found in Westfield Lane, about a mile from her home in Bosworth Street The inquest heard evidence from a police officer who said Mrs Peat was ""not particularly emotional, as in upset"", when her daughter went missing. The coroner also noted a lack of emotion from Mr and Mrs Peat when they gave evidence at the inquest. ""On more than one occasion, professionals told me how they had witnessed Mr and Mrs Peat demonstrate a lack of emotional warmth towards Amber at times when one would expect emotion to be present, such as Amber returning home after being missing,"" the coroner said. ""Indeed, when they gave evidence to this inquest there was a distinct lack of emotional warmth towards Amber, more so from Mr Peat than Mrs Peat."" Paralegal Amy Robinson read a statement out on behalf of Amber's mother A statement on behalf of Mrs Peat was read out by a lawyer following the inquest. ""Like all parents, Kelly knows she is not perfect but she has been, and continues to be, the best parent she can for her children,"" the statement said. ""Kelly wonders whether things could have been different had Amber and her family received more support and advice for Amber's behaviour. ""She proactively sought help on numerous occasions with Amber, and tried to work with the agencies as much as possible."" The statement said Mrs Peat had been ""subjected to intense media and public scrutiny"" since Amber's death. ""Some of the things that have been said have been very hurtful, not only to Kelly but her family too and they have had a huge impact on their well-being,"" the statement said. Amber's mother ""feels strongly that Amber would not have meant to deliberately harm herself"" The statement said Mrs Peat ""will always wonder"" why Amber did what she did. ""She and her family find it impossible to believe that Amber purposely set out to take her own life,"" the statement said. ""Kelly feels strongly that Amber would not have meant to deliberately harm herself or mean for this to happen."" Aserious case review was launchedfollowing Amber's death and is still to be published. Chris Few, chairman of Nottinghamshire Safeguarding Children Board, said they ""owe it to Amber to learn from what happened"". ""Before we publish the serious case review, it is important for all those involved to take some time to reflect on and consider the coroner's findings and to identify whether there is any further action needed,"" he said.

"There is much to like about Only Fools and Horses The Musical: the premise, the songs, the optimism. The revolving set is good, too - moving the action seamlessly from the Nags Head Pub to the Trotters' high-rise council flat in Peckham, South London. It's all cushdy, as Del Boy would say. The only snag is it's also a bit like his famous yellow, three-wheeled motor; as in it occasionally misfires and never really gets going. That might be because the show isn't properly run in, and needs more time to warm up, but the night I went it lacked the horsepower required to turn a long-running television sitcom into a memorable night at the theatre. There is a sense of watching a group of talented Only Fools and Horses super-fans going through classic routines from the TV show (Del Boy falling through the bar, Rodney trying to explain to Trigger that his name is not Dave, and so on) without ever fully owning their stage adaptation. The impersonations are all excellent, but for it to work as a piece of stand-alone musical theatre, the performers need to move beyond paying homage to a much-loved series and have the confidence to inhabit the characters and make them live in the present. I don't really care if Tom Bennett's Del Boy sounds like David Jason's or if Ryan Hutton employs the same mannerisms Nicholas Lyndhurst used when he played Rodney. What matters is the chemistry between the two actors and their ability to match Jason and Lyndhurst by becoming a memorable comic double act. They are not helped by the show's opening, which sees Bennett spraying around famous Del Boy quotes like some of that knock-off perfume he flogs. Rodney, Del Boy and Grandad: Tom Bennett, Whitehouse and Ryan Hutton ""This time next year we'll be millionaires... He who dares wins,"" and Rodney's ""two GCEs"" fill the air with the faintly stale aroma of nostalgia. It perks up with a lusty rendition of the programme's theme tune Hooky Street, at which point the cast relax and the show starts to find its feet. The story compresses more than 20 years and 60 episodes of the show into a two-hour tale in which Rodney and Cassandra (Pippa Duffy) are making wedding preparations, Boycie (Jeff Nicholson) and Marlene (Samantha Seager) are trying to conceive, and Del Boy goes to a dating agency looking for a ""sort"" and ends up with Raquel (Dianne Pilkington). The original series was written by John Sullivan, whose metier was the television sitcom (Citizen Smith, Just Good Friends). Only Fools and Horses was his masterpiece, a combination of the best of The Phil Silvers Show and Steptoe & Son, with characters drawn as well as a Michelangelo sketch. Samantha Seager plays Marlene with Jeff Nicholson as Boycie In 1996 a single episode was watched by 24 million people. Sullivan died in 2011 having mulled on the idea of a musical version. In 2015 his son Jim found an outline for an opening scene, and then happened upon a cassette tape made by Chas and Dave singing a song co-written by his father called This Time Next Year. Lovely jubbly. Paul Whitehouse was approached to help write the script and Only Fools and Horses The Musical was born. Whitehouse ended up doing much more than write the script. The production recreates scenes from the TV show He collaborated with the late Chas Hodges on some numbers, wrote others in their entirety, and took on the role of Granddad in the production. All of his contributions are worthy of Sullivan's legacy. The song Where Have All the Cockneys Gone, co-written with Hodges, is a high point as it morphs into Any Old Iron. And giving Trigger a crystal ball in which to gaze and see gentrified Peckham of the future full of artisan shops instead of dodgy fly-pitchers provides a welcome break from the sentimentality. As does Del Boy receiving a going over by a couple of local faces. The jokes come thick and fast. The TV cast included [L-R] Paul Barber, Patrick Murray, Sue Holderness, Roy Heather, John Challis and Roger Lloyd Pack Some land, such as Del Boy telling his dating agent that ""he's been engaged more times than a switchboard"". Others fall flatter than Rodney's stag night, most noticeably when Del Boy has a crack at topical humour, declaring knowingly: ""We're all part of Europe now. We're all one big happy family."" Television and theatre are very different mediums. The original TV cast were hugely popular You can't simply transplant one to another and expect the operation to be a success. Hence the introduction of the musical element. But too much of the production is a lift from the TV series without the benefit of the cutaways, close-ups and shot changes to capture the comic nuances of John Sullivan's scripts. It is possible Only Fools and Horses The Musical will settle down and find its feet as a theatre show, but right now it is a lovingly constructed, professionally produced tribute show that fails to live up to the original.

"This video can not be played Sydney Langton said she would never condone killing animals for taxidermy In her spare time, 16-year-old Sydney Langton has a singular passion: stuffing birds and foxes and any other roadkill that comes her way. Here she explains why she loves being a teenage taxidermist. Look into a freezer belonging to any of my friends and you will most likely find chips, fish-fingers and ice cream. That's not the case with me. My own personal freezer, stored out in the family shed, is filled with roadkill. The vegan taxidermist Taxidermist sold monkey heads on eBay The man who was stuffed like an animal The fake taxidermist In it are badgers and foxes, a seagull and duck, some pheasants and partridges. They are not to eat, of course, but to stuff, for my rather unusual hobby - especially for a teenage girl - taxidermy. Admittedly, it's a niche world. Growing up, while my friends were interested in sport or reading, I was fascinated by dead animals. Sydney only uses animals that have died of natural causes or are roadkill If I came across a dead hedgehog or bird, I would poke at it with a stick, or bring it home to examine, marvelling at its anatomy. My interest was piqued further when, age eight, I was visiting a friend's house and saw a fox's head on the wall. With my parent's help, I bought one off eBay, but swiftly realised this wasn't a sustainable path. Instead, I began contacting established taxidermists for advice, and for my 13th birthday, my parents paid for me to attend a course where I was taught how to stuff a jay. It was quite an involved procedure, learning how to remove the meat off the bones, then separate out the feathers and stuff it with shredded wool. I had to make precise incisions and use accurate sewing. From there, I gradually expanded my repertoire. I have done foxes and badgers, stoats and weasels and even an eagle owl, which had been raised in captivity and died aged 10. A stuffed eagle owl, worth around Â£800 I am a member of the Guild of Taxidermists and attend conferences, and although this isn't really a woman's world, or one for teenagers, the experts I've met have been very encouraging and helpful. My work was also given a boost when my teachers [at school in Llandudno, Conwy], said I could submit it for my GCSE artwork. Of course, I know some people find taxidermy squeamish or controversial. But I never condone killing animals for taxidermy, and would only ever work with creatures that have died of natural causes or been hit by cars. When I'm working with protected species, like red squirrels, I have to have official documents that prove they have not been killed for the purpose of taxidermy. Personally, I think the process is beautiful; I see the creature that was once there. I also feel it's a way of preserving the animals for education and of keeping a record of that species for years to come. The only taxidermy I don't like is pet taxidermy, as I don't feel it can ever truly capture the personality of the animal. At work: Sydney says each piece takes days to prepare My hobby has led me to become known locally as the 'taxidermy girl'. Neighbours bang on the door with foxes and magpies, or tell me where roadkill is, which I collect with my dad, Doug, when we're sure it is safe. I invest a lot of time in my work; a single crow can take 10 hours to stuff, and it can be a hard, frustrating process that can end in tears. It is not simply about stuffing an animal. The main aim, in fact, is to make the creature look as lifelike as possible by its stance or position, and it takes a lot of skill, which I'm still learning. My interest has now grown to the extent I want to be a professional taxidermist when I leave school. Already I have some sold some pieces. Sydney's Cabinet of Curiosities for her GCSE artwork A smaller bird or animal goes for roughly Â£80, a full badger for Â£400, and my Eagle Owl is worth Â£800, but it's not for sale. Personally, I love doing birds and one of my ambitions is to taxidermy a peacock. I do realise this is a niche pastime, but for me, it is one creating art of pure beauty. Meet the vegan taxidermist.

"What's the oldest item of clothing in your wardrobe? Chances are you may struggle to top a 70-year-old dress - which happens to be Hannah's pride and joy. ""It was passed down from my grandma to my auntie, then cousin, then me. There are so many amazing dresses like that, built to last."" Radio 1 Newsbeat has been talking to sustainable fashion blogger Hannah about fast fashion - as MPs say clothing brands and retailers shouldpay to fund a clothing recycling scheme.

More than 3,700 litres of water are used in the full lifetime of some pairs of jeans Do you see yourself wearing that item at least 30 times? If the answer is no, then put it back on the rack. Hannah says the more items that factories have to produce - the more damage is done to the environment. ""Commit to wearing clothes more than just once or a handful at times. It also ensures you don't waste your money on things that you don't actually love."" Call up your bestie or organise a meet-up via the group chat. ""Your friends might have some clothes that you may like and vice versa. Swapping wardrobes might also stop you from wasting money on something new."" Bored of that pair of jeans?

Hannah says: ""Around 11 million items of clothing go into landfills every day in the UK which is just a crazy amount. ""If you're just a bit bored of the length of a pair of jeans sometimes I cut the hem off a bit just to give it a bit of a refresh. This keeps my clothes in my wardrobe for years longer."" ""Mend your clothes,"" Hannah advises. ""I find that if I have got a hole in a jumper or a pair of jeans with a broken zipper, I just fix them."" ""Washing clothes on 30Â° rather than 40Â° and not using tumble dryers is definitely better for the environment,"" Hannah says. Washing machines and tumble driers can also age your clothes faster. ""There are lots of websites that give great tips on how to wash different fabrics and different bits of clothing so you can wash your clothes more sustainably."" What a waste: In the UK, hundreds of millions of items of clothing are sent to landfill each year People in the UK send235 million items of clothing to landfillseach year, according to the most recent figures. Hannah says rather than throwing them away - often these items could be given to second hand or charity shops for a new lease of life.

"Rachel Tucker plays a pilot in Come From Away The aftermath of the 9/11 attacks might not seem like the most obvious inspiration for a musical, but it's the subject of a new West End show. Come From Away tells the true story of a small Canadian town that took in 7,000 stranded plane passengers after the attacks. The Broadway production won the Tony award for best direction. However,some critics of the London version felt the show glossed over the trauma of 9/11.,external It's not the most unusual subject to become a musical, though. Here are six other real-life and fictional stories that got the song and dance treatment. Carrie was a successful film, starring Sissy Spacek, before it became a musical flop Plots about teenagers coming of age are something of a musical staple. But while the likes of West Side Story continue to delight audiences, the public didn't take a musical version of Stephen King's horror novel Carrie to their hearts. The song and dance routine about slaughtering a pig, at the opening of the second act, might have put some theatre-goers off. Broadway's most notorious flop ran for only three days, when it opened in 1988.An off-Broadway revival in 2012 fared slightly better, but still closed early.,external Princess Diana in Edmonton, Canada, in 1983 More than 20 years after her death, Princess Diana's life story continues to fascinate writers. She's already inspired a 2013 film starring Naomi Watts and the Monica Ali novel Untold Story.A musical about her life begins previews in the US on Tuesday.,external Diana: A New Musical focuses on Diana's life in her twenties and features 23 songs from Bon Jovi's keyboard player David Bryan. Bryan says he's used different musical styles to represent each character: ""Diana is pop-rock, royalty is string quartet, we have paparazzi as punk guitars and we try to make all those roles live on top of each other."" Early readings of the musical were closed to critics, so we'll have to wait until the first preview to find out more. This isn't the first musical to be written about Diana.  Footage of a different production at a Tennessee community theatre has become a viral hit on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Cereal cafe founders Alan and Gary Keery didn't expect their shop to spark protests...let alone a musical The story of the opening of the Cereal Killer cafe in east London has been made into a musical. The cafe, which went on to become a chain, sparked angry protests from locals when it opened in Shoreditch in 2014. Shops hit in anti-gentrification demo Cereal cafe backed by Boris Johnson The musical, originally called Spilt Milk and now renamed The Cereal Cafe, has been in development for two years. The news that the hipster cafe was to become a musical did not go down well with some on social media. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A workshop version of The Cereal Cafe opens in London later this month for a three-day run, so you can see for yourself if it really heralds the end of civilisation. Urinetown is set in a society where everyone must pay to pee Greg Kotis got the idea for his toilet-themed musical, Urinetown, when he encountered his first pay-per-use public loo. The satirical show is set in a future where private toilets have been banned, after years of drought. Critics and audiences managed to see past the show's rather unappealing name.  Urinetown ran on Broadway for three years and scooped a trio of Tonys. The news that the show was to open in London in 2014 led many reviewers to break out their worst toilet puns. The best of the bunch came from The Guardian's Michael Billington, who dubbed Urinetown ""the Spend-a-Penny Opera that's a welcome relief"",external. The Shroud of Turin is a strip of linen that some people believe was used to wrap Jesus's body after the crucifixion Who wouldn't want to see a musical about a scientist who becomes obsessed with finding out whether the Shroud of Turin really was Jesus's burial cloth? Before you answer, keep in mind that it features a high-kicking priest, dancing nuns, and such timeless lyrics as: ""To measure the darkness, you must stand in the dark. But when you stand in the dark, you cannot see a thing."" Despite this, almost nobody went to see the 1986 Broadway musical Into The Light. It closed after just six performances. The cast of Triassic Parq do their best dinosaur impressions in rehearsals If you ever wanted to watch Jurassic Park told from the point of view of the dinosaurs, then the 2012 off-Broadway musical comedy Triassic Parq is for you. Described by the New York Times,externalas a ""bawdy tribute to dinosaurs and their newfound genitalia"", the show follows a group of dinosaurs whose lives are thrown into chaos when one of the females spontaneously turns male. Needless to say, the show didn't achieve quite the same success as the Michael Crichton novel or the Stephen Spielberg film that inspired it.

"Mark Acklom was placed on a plane in Geneva and was escorted through Bristol Airport One of Britain's most wanted fugitives has been extradited to the UK from Switzerland after being on the run in Europe for years. Mark Acklom, who disappeared in 2012, allegedly posed as an MI6 agent to con a Gloucestershire woman out of her Â£850,000 life savings. The 45-year-old was arrested at a luxury apartment in Zurich last summer. He will appear at Bristol Magistrates' Court on Saturday charged with 20 fraud offences. They include 12 charges of converting or removing criminal property and eight charges of fraud by false representation. Mr Acklom allegedly posed as an MI6 agent and Swiss banker and conned divorcee Carolyn Woods into loaning him the money during a year-long relationship in Bath in 2012. Three years ago a European Arrest Warrant was issued for Mr Acklom who was believed to be in Spain having been released from a Spanish prison over a Â£200,000 property fraud. Carolyn Woods had a year-long relationship with Mark Acklom during which time she said she loaned him thousands of pounds In October 2016 he was among 10 British fugitives named by the National Crime Agency (NCA) as the most wanted in Spain. Chief Insp Gary Haskins, from Avon and Somerset Police, said:  ""No matter where suspected criminals are in the world we will always do everything we can to track them down and bring them back to the UK to face justice. ""This extradition would not have been possible without the support of all our law enforcement partners and I'm extremely grateful for their assistance in helping us bring Acklom home to answer some very serious charges."" Mr Acklom was escorted back to Bristol Airport from Geneva earlier and is currently in police custody.
