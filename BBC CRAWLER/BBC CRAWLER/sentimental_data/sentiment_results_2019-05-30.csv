"Canada PM Justin Trudeau and US VP Mike Pence were in Ottawa to discuss trade and other issues US Vice-President Mike Pence says he is ""proud to be part of a pro-life administration"" after being pressed on the issue during a visit to Canada. Canadian PM Justin Trudeau said the two men had a ""cordial conversation"" about abortion laws in the US despite their difference of views. Mr Trudeau has said he is concerned about the ""backsliding"" of women's rights south of the border. The PM and the VP also discussed issues related to trade and China. In the US, the contentious issue of abortion has been front-and-centre this year as nearly a dozen states have moved to pass new, stricter laws on abortion. Critics have pointed at what they see as an orchestrated challenge to a decades-old US Supreme Court ruling that protected a woman's right to choose an abortion. Mr Pence is known for his staunch opposition to abortion. Mr Trudeau, on the other hand, is outspoken in support of reproductive rights. The two were able to diplomatically sidestep any tensions when asked about that discussion by reporters on Thursday. Mr Pence said the Trump administration ""will always stand for the right to life"". ""But those are debates within the United States and I know that Canada will deal with those issues in a manner that the people of Canada have determined most appropriate."" The US abortion battle explained in three minutes Trudeau bans anti-abortion funding Media giants could quit Georgia over abortion law Amid the political firestorm over state-level anti-abortion bills in the US, in Canada the Liberals have been pressuring their Conservative rivals over their stance on the issue in the run-up to the general election. Conservative leader Andrew Scheer - who has supported pro-life legislation in the past - has vowed that if he were to form government he would not reopen the debate. Meanwhile, much of the discussion on Thursday revolved around efforts to ratify the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USCMA, the new North American trade deal. None of the three countries have ratified the agreement, though Canada moved to ratify USCMA by formally presenting it to parliament on Wednesday. Mexico is also moving towards its ratification. Mr Pence said there were ""energetic efforts"" being made to get the stamp of approval from Congress this summer. Michael Spavor (L) and Michael Kovrig have been detained in China since December Canada also sought assurances from the US that they would assist in the case of two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were arrested in China. They are believed to have been detained in retaliation for December's arrest in Canada of Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou at the request of the US.

"Uber's shares have fallen more than 10% since the company floated this month Uber has posted a $1bn (Â£790m) loss as the ride-hailing firm delivered its first figures since a disappointing flotation earlier this month. The quarterly loss came despite a 20% rise in revenues to $3.1bn and increase in monthly active users to 93 million. The results were in line with many analysts' forecasts and may provide reassurance about the company's future profitability. Uber shares have sunk almost 11% since it listed on Wall Street on 10 May. The company is the biggest of a group of Silicon Valley start-ups that have gone public this year against the backdrop of a global stock market sell-off sparked by renewed US-China trade tensions. But Uber has also faced strong competition in the smartphone ride-hailing business, and incurred extra costs for signing up new drivers and establishing the Uber Eats delivery service. Finance Chief Nelson Chai said he had recently seen some less aggressive pricing by competitors, which include arch rival Lyft. He added that Uber was prepared to keep spending. ""We will not hesitate to invest to defend our market position globally."" The company has ambitions to move into electric scooters, e-bikes, and even aircraft, allowing people to hail rides via their smartphones. During a conference call after publication of the results, Uber boss Dara Khosrowshahi said the company's disappointing start as a public business was just a step on ""the long journey of making Uber a platform for the movement of people and transport of commerce around the world at a massive scale"". The share price was almost flat in after-hours trading immediately following release of the numbers, but then jumped 1.6% higher before falling back. Some analysts have expressed unease about the company ever making a profit. The number of investors betting that Uber's share price will fall - called short-selling - has risen during the past two weeks. One analyst, Atlantic Equities' James Cordwell, said a lack of any forward guidance in Thursday's statement ""is a little disappointing"".

"The Confederation of British Industry has warned Conservative leadership candidates over a no-deal Brexit. Such a scenario would do ""severe"" damage to businesses, the body - which supported Remain - told all the MPs running to lead the party. Director general Carolyn Fairbairn told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a no-deal Brexit should be an option ""that is not even considered"". She was speaking after the CBI sent an open letter to candidates. In its letter the CBI says: ""Firms large and small are clear that leaving the EU with a deal is the best way forward."" ""Short-term disruption and long-term damage to British competitiveness will be severe if we leave without one. The vast majority of firms can never be prepared for no-deal, particularly our [small and medium-sized] members who cannot afford complex and costly contingency plans."" She told Today that businesses were not ready for a no-deal scenario and said ""this idea that we are ready is just not true"". ""How can you be prepared for Â£20bn of increased customs costs? How can be you prepared for tariffs rising overnight? 150,000 businesses with no systems in place to do deal with this. ""This is not a responsible strategy for a government to have."" CBI says industry sectors face Brexit extinction All you need to know about Brexit Reality Check: What does a 'WTO Brexit' mean? What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but Theresa May asked for an extension and the date was pushed back to 31 October. The official race to succeed her gets under way after she stands down in early June, but jostling between Tory candidates has already begun. Esther McVey, the first of the12 confirmed contenders to stand in the Tory leadership race, said earlier this week in a column for theDaily Telegraph,externalthe UK needs to ""actively embrace leaving the EU without a deal"". Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab have said they would like to renegotiate the terms of Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with Brussels, but would enforce the current October deadline. Gerard Lyons, co-founder of Economists for Brexit, told Today: ""I don't think any of the leadership candidates are advocating no deal as their plan A. ""One has to have a plan B. No deal, whether we like it or not, has to be plan B. ""The CBI, remember, was amongst Project Fear three years ago and since the referendum we've seen one million jobs added the economy,"" he said. Mr Lyons, a former advisor to Mr Johnson, told the BBC a no-deal Brexit would just be a ""stepping stone"" to a free trade agreement. He said the challenges facing the UK would be ""better addressed outside"" the EU and that a focus needed to place on issues such as investment in infrastructure and investment to address ""imbalances"" in the economy. British business has issued a challenge to the next prime minister to prove that the Conservatives are the party of business. That can only be achieved, says the CBI, if the next leader commits to leaving the EU with a deal. The lobbying group insists that firms large and small are clear that leaving the EU with a deal is essential to protect the economy, jobs and living standards. However, of the 12 candidates (so far), at least half say they are prepared (in fact some of them are determined) to leave the world's largest trading bloc as scheduled at the end of October - with or without a deal in place. That includes the current favourite, Boris Johnson who, when foreign secretary, had a message for business leaders during the Brexit negotiations that ended in ""ck"" but wasn't ""back"". That expletive - directed to a community that had traditionally seen the Conservative Party as its natural partner - shocked some in the business world and for others merely highlighted the dwindling influence of business in the politics of Brexit. That gulf still seems very wide with business saying it can't work with anyone who contemplates no deal - and a party which may find it hard to contemplate a leader who won't. Business has traditionally been important to the Conservative Party as one of its main sources of financial support. However, overall donations to the party collapsed in the first quarter of the year, according tofigures published by the Electoral Commission,external. The party received Â£3.7m in donations and public funds in the three months to March.For the fourth quarter,externalof 2018, it was Â£7.5m. Tory leadership candidateJeremy Hunt has warned his partythat pushing through a no-deal Brexit would be ""political suicide"" because it would result in a general election in which Labour could take power. Fellow leadership contender Kit Malthouse, a housing minister, has said: ""Those people who say no-deal would be a catastrophe and those people who say it would be a walk in the park are both wrong - it is somewhere in the middle."" Meanwhile, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said the deal reached between the UK and the EU was ""the only option"" if the UK wanted to leave ""in an orderly manner"". The winner of the contest to lead the Conservative Party will become the next prime minister. Who has declared and who still might?

"Muhammad Javed used a hammer and machete to kill his wife A ""controlling and coercive"" husband who battered his wife to death after he wrongly suspected her of having an affair has been found guilty of murder. Muhammad Javed, 59, used a hammer and machete to kill Saeeda Hussain, 53, in the living room of their east London home in February last year. The Old Bailey heard she had ""feared the shame"" if his violence towards her was reported to authorities. Javed, of Staines Road, Ilford, will be sentenced on 21 June. Prosecutor Julian Evans told the trial jury the couple's children were aware of Javed's ""violence and... mistreatment"" during their marriage of more than 30 years. However, Mr Evans said Ms Hussain ""did not want them to report it to the police or to others outside the family"". ""She feared that the defendant would be deported. ""She also feared the shame that, in her mind, such revelations would bring."" Mother-of-five Saeeda Hussain was murdered at the home she shared with her husband Mr Evans told the court that Javed had suspected his wife was ""having an affair or was seeing other men behind his back"", suspicions the prosecutor claimed ""were entirely without merit"". The court was told Javed had installed CCTV at their home to monitor the mother-of-five's behaviour and the couple slept in separate rooms. A pathologist estimated that there were at least 46 separate impacts from the machete and at least seven blows from the hammer from the attack on 13 February. The court heard Javed then changed out of his blood-stained clothes, left the weapons near his wife's body, locked the living-room door, and left by a window. He then contacted his daughter's father-in-law and told him: ""You are going to hear very bad news"". At about 18:00 GMT he then went to the local police station and told an officer: ""I have just killed my wife"". When police entered the house they found a discarded boiler suit covered in blood, which Det Insp John Marriott said was ""probably donned... to avoid getting his wife's blood on his clothes"". He added: ""If ever a case shows the importance of contacting police if you are in, or aware of, an abusive relationship, then this is it.""

Sixty new cases were reported in the past week, bringing this year's total to 971 cases in 26 US states - the highest since 1994. The disease was declared effectively eliminated from the US in 2000. Recent outbreaks have been attributed to foreign travellers spreading it to those lacking vaccinations in the US. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement on Thursday: ""If these outbreaks continue through summer and fall, the United States may lose its measles elimination status. ""That loss would be a huge blow for the nation and erase the hard work done by all levels of public health. ""The measles elimination goal, first announced in 1963 and accomplished in 2000, was a monumental task."" This video can not be played What exactly is behind the US measles outbreak? The statement added that previously between three and four million Americans were diagnosed with the sometimes-fatal illness each year, leading to an estimated 400-500 deaths and 48,000 hospitalisations. Earlier this year, Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases testified to lawmakers that more must be done to prevent the spread of the disease. ""I consider it an irony that you have one of the most contagious viruses known to man juxtaposed against one of the most effective vaccines they have,"" he said. ""Yet we don't do and have not done what could be done - namely eliminate, eradicate the virus."" This year's tally of 971 means the US has already broken the 1994 record - 963 infections - in only the first five months of 2019.

"University tuition fees in England should be cut to Â£7,500, says a landmark review commissioned by the government. This will be balanced by extending repayments from 30 to 40 years - so that people could be paying back student loans into their 60s. But the review calls for the return of maintenance grants, which were axed in 2016, for poorer students. Prime Minister Theresa May said scrapping them had been a mistake. The review, chaired by the banker Philip Augar, has come up with ideas to provide better value for money in higher and further education. His big conclusions are that fees are too high in university - and that funding is too low in further education. Would the changes help poorer students? John Pienaar: A cause dear to May's heart Universities told not to 'scaremonger' over fee cut Biggest winners and losers from degree courses Universities have seen ""generous funding"" while other sectors have faced austerity, he argues, and he suggests that more support should be switched towards vocational education. The review proposes: Maximum for tuition fees should be reduced from Â£9,250 to Â£7,500 per year Any unpaid debts would not be cancelled until 40 years after graduating, rather than 30 years Repayments start at a lower point, when graduates earn Â£23,000 rather than Â£25,725 Means-tested, non-repayable maintenance grants of up to Â£3,000, for both university and higher-level technical courses More funding for further education and more access to loans for students on vocational courses ""Lifelong learning loan allowance"" to support students of all ages University funding would be targeted towards high-cost subjects and those considered a priority and away from those seen as ""low value"" The review is the prime minister's personal project and she pressed ahead with publishing its findings in her final days in office. It will be one of the last major announcements before she leaves No 10 - and she spoke with conviction about trying to drive ""social mobility"". Echoing her own words at the beginning of her premiership, she called for an end to ""burning injustices"". Mrs May accepted that her party's abolition of maintenance fees had not worked. But she argued the package of measures would remove barriers and make sure that no-one should feel that ""because of who they are or where they are from, the world of higher education is not open to them"". She also made a strong call for better funding for further education, saying that colleges had been ""overlooked, undervalued and underfunded"". But in terms of how it went down - the conversation afterwards, in an audience of education leaders, was about the curious gap between the strength of the message and the absence of such activity while in office. Or perhaps that Brexit had consumed everything else around it. It sounded like a rallying call going into government, rather than a legacy on leaving it. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says that the biggest winners will be the highest earners. They pay off their debts relatively quickly, saving on interest charges. The cut in fees will mean that they will pay even less, with the IFS estimating that the highest earning 20% could cut payments by 30%. The review wants to switch more support into improving skills and vocational training The losers could be lower earners, who currently might never have paid off their debts and had them written off. Extending the repayments to 40 years could mean they have to pay off more of their loans. Former universities minister Jo Johnson said the system was ""regressive"". But there are other factors to be considered. The return of non-repayable grants will cut costs for poorer students. This video can not be played Justine Greening told the World at One: ""This plan is like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.â And the longer-term aim is to reduce the number of ""low value"" courses, so that fewer students are taking degrees which are going to give them low earnings in the jobs market. The prime minister was unambiguous about the scope for cuts in fees. ""Plenty of courses do not cost the full current rate of Â£9,250 per student per year to teach,"" she said at the launch of the review. Dr Augar said universities had enjoyed rising incomes, while other sectors had faced a decade of austerity - and there was room for ""efficiencies"". This video can not be played The author of a government report says fees should be cut to Â£7,500 There are also proposals for direct funding to fill the gap of reduced fees. But this will also be a lever for the government to influence the courses being offered - by giving more funding to courses which are either expensive to deliver, such as some sciences. Or else it will be a financial incentive for universities to teach courses which are seen as being of ""high value"" to the economy. The Russell Group of universities says there would need to be a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that any shortfall would be replaced. The Association of Colleges, facing a boost in income for further education, was much more enthusiastic. ""For too long, we've had a system that works for half the population whilst neglecting the other half,"" said chief executive David Hughes. A snap poll from YouGov showed that the idea of lowering fees is popular - backed by 59%. But Conservative and Brexit supporters are the least likely to want lower fees, say the pollsters. There is also a question of perception. Shakira Martin, president of the National Union of Students, said it would help to address ""the debt aversion caused by high fees, high living costs and the lack of maintenance grants"". Dr Augar also reminded the launch event about how negatively high fees and debts could be viewed, and the misunderstandings of the system. He said research for the review had come across a grandparent wondering whether they should sell their house to pay off a grandchild's student debt. The review says a fee cut would not happen before 2021-22 at the earliest. But there remains another significant political catch. Changes in the level of tuition fees have to be approved by both houses of Parliament. With the current political deadlock it seems unlikely that such a measure will be pushed forward any time soon - and the future of the plans will depend on the response of the next prime minister. Labour, which wants to completely scrap tuition fees, has already dismissed the review as ""all talk, empty promises and very little action"". Universities told not to 'scaremonger' on fee cut Tuition fees cut expected as May's legacy Â£7,500 tuition fees plan faces Brexit delay Short-term politics 'harms skills training' Would the proposed student finance changes help poorer students?

Nigel Farage spoke at a campaign rally for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential race He described both Mr Farage and Mr Johnson, who is among 11 contenders to replace Mrs May as Conservative leader, as ""big powers"" adding: ""I think they have done a good job."" Asked if he supported them, Mr Trump relied: ""Well, I like them. They are friends of mine but I haven't thought about supporting them. ""Maybe it's not my business to support people, but I have a lot of respect for both of those men."" During the visit, the Americans are expected to express concern over giving the Chinese company Huawei access to the UK 5G network. Leaked reports from the UK's National Security Councilsuggested the firm could be allowed to build ""non-core"" parts of the network, such as antennas, despite fears this could increase the risk of espionage.

"This video can not be played England beat South Africa by 104 runs in opening game ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, The Oval England 311-8 (50 overs):Stokes 89, Morgan 57, Roy 54, Root 51, Ngidi 3-66 South Africa 207 (39.5 overs):De Kock 68, Van der Dussen 50, Archer 3-27 England won by 104 runs Scorecard.Table.Schedule Ben Stokes and Jofra Archer lit up The Oval to ensure England defeated South Africa and got their World Cup campaign off to a winning start. Regularly bowling in excess of 90mph, Archer - playing only his fourth one-day international - took 3-27 and hit Hashim Amla on the helmet to force him to temporarily retire hurt. After Stokes took an amazing one-handed catch on the boundary to dismiss Andile Phehlukwayo, South Africa were dismissed for 207 to lose by 104 runs. Stokes earlier made 89 and Jason Roy, Joe Root and Eoin Morgan hit half-centuries to take England to 311-8, a total that seemed no better than par. Quinton de Kock's 68 had South Africa in the hunt at 129-2, but he pulled Liam Plunkett to long leg to become the first of three wickets to fall for 15 runs. When Stokes took two wickets in two balls, the world number ones and favourites completed an ideal start to the tournament. In a competition where the 10 teams play each other once to determine the semi-finalists, the hosts travel to Nottingham to meet Pakistan at Trent Bridge on Monday. South Africa, who showed enough with the ball to suggest they will contend for the semis, are back at The Oval on Sunday to take on Bangladesh. TMS podcast: Stokes stunner lights up The Oval This video can not be played 'Incredible' Stokes catch removes Phehlukwayo England have been building to this competition for the four years since their dismal first-round exit at the last World Cup, sweeping all before them mainly thanks to their power-packed batting line-up. But for three-quarters of a day that began with the Duke of Sussex opening the tournament, they were in danger of being upset by a well-drilled South Africa. Indeed, on a slow pitch that produced intriguing rather than entertaining cricket, this was at times a low-key start to the tournament. Under grey skies even the crowd was subdued for long periods. The exceptions to all of this were Archer and Stokes. For Archer, pace, aggression and hostility made it seem like a wicket was likely every time he had the ball in his hand. However, the moment of the day belonged to Stokes, who took the most incredible catch, one that is unlikely to be bettered throughout the whole tournament. As Phehlukwayo swept Adil Rashid towards the mid-wicket boundary, the ball seemed to be too high for Stokes to reach. He leapt, flinging himself backwards with his right arm outstretched. As he clung on in one hand, the crowd gasped and his team-mates mobbed him for disbelieving celebrations. This video can not be played Archer takes first World Cup wicket to make England breakthrough Born in Barbados to a British father, Archer only qualified to play for England in March and here showed exactly why he was fast-tracked into the World Cup squad. The wickets he took were all, at least in some part, down to his pace. After Amla took a nasty blow to the grille, Aiden Markram fended to slip and Faf du Plessis hooked to long leg. With South Africa in danger of subsiding, De Kock added 85 with Rassie van der Dussen. Both had moments of fortune - Rashid looked to have bowled De Kock only for the bails not to come off, while Van der Dussen was dropped by wicketkeeper Jos Buttler. This video can not be played Watch De Kock's amazing escape after ball hits stumps The game turned after De Kock helped a short ball from Plunkett to Root at long leg. JP Duminy holed out off Moeen and Dwaine Pretorius was run out by Stokes' bullet throw from the deep as three wickets fell in 21 balls. Archer returned to remove Van der Dussen with another short ball and, though Amla came back before gloving Plunkett behind, Stokes took over. First came the wonder catch, then the wickets of Kagiso Rabada and Imran Tahir completed an impressive England bowling and fielding display. For a variety of reasons - the control of the South Africa bowlers, the sluggish nature of the pitch and maybe even a few nerves - this was not the free-scoring England of the past four years. The tone was set by a clever piece of captaincy from Du Plessis. Leg-spinner Tahir was chosen to open the bowling and Jonny Bairstow edged his second ball behind to become the first opener to get a golden duck in the first innings of a World Cup tournament. To their credit, England steadied. Roy and Root added 106 and, after they both fell in the space of four balls, Morgan and Stokes shared 106 of their own. Roy played powerful drives while Root scored almost exclusively off his pads. Morgan pulled and drove, playing the aggressor in his stand with Stokes until he was athletically caught by a diving Markram at long-on off Tahir. Stokes began calmly - his first 31 runs came from 36 balls - but he gradually upped his scoring. Still, the biggest blow to England's late charge came when Buttler dragged on to his stumps. In the face of some intelligent South Africa bowling, England's assault never materialised, but their total proved to be more than adequate. This video can not be played 'What a way to bring up a 50' - Stokes' 'cheeky' four England all-rounder Ben Stokes on BBC Test Match Special:""I'm sure there were a few nerves kicking around - I've not felt like that in a long time when we arrived at the ground. To come away with a win is a fantastic start. ""That's the best we've fielded in about two or three years. The amount of runs we saved was absolutely brilliant."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS:""Any team's success is generally geared around the all-rounder. Ben Stokes finding form in the first game of the World Cup is a huge boost for England. ""His innings with the bat was really smart - and that's the way I'd describe this England performance: smart."" England captain Eoin Morgan:""We were very good today. We were good as a batting unit even though we couldn't score a considerable total, which was our Plan A. ""But we felt that the score we had on the board was above average. We won't have days like this every time. ""Jofra Archer bowled fast and accurate on a slow pitch it was outstanding from a young guy. He's taking everything in his stride. It's very exciting. South Africa captain Faf du Plessis:""We were outplayed in all three departments. I thought 300 was par - we were bowling cutters, but there were some really good batting performances from England. ""Hashim Amla is OK now. He was all over the place when he came off the field but hopefully he is OK for the next game."" Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith on the TMS podcast:""All of our fears came up today - the balance and the batting are the weak parts for South Africa.

"The proposal would copy encrypted chats and share them with the security services A ""hypothetical"" proposal by UK security agency GCHQ to eavesdrop on encrypted messages has been criticised by tech firms and rights groups. Google and Apple were among 47 firms to sign an open letter, saying it,externalwas a ""serious threat"" to trust and security. The GCHQ plan would mean, in some circumstances, security services got copies of encrypted messages. The technique resembled the way that GCHQ currently used wiretaps to listen to unencrypted chat, said the agency. Theplan for a so-called ""ghost protocol"" was first floated,externalby the UK National Cyber Security Centre's technical director Ian Levy and GCHQ's chief codebreaker Crispin Robinson in November 2018. The proposal was intended to add to the debate about strongly encrypted messaging systems that security services have struggled to break. Instead of asking for encryption systems to be weakened so they can be cracked, the plan would instead copy messages and send the duplicate on to a third recipient. That other recipient would be able to read the message because they possessed a key corresponding to the one with which it was encrypted. The ghosting system would only be used in ""exceptional circumstances"" to gather information about suspects, said the discussion paper about the technology. Spies from GCHQ take part in covert charity bike ride Prince William works with security agencies on attachment Drab London office block was GCHQ spy base In their letter, rights groups, industry bodies and tech firms said the idea would ""violate"" important human rights principles. Signatories include Google, Apple, WhatsApp and Microsoft as well as Big Brother Watch, Privacy International and the Center for Democracy and Technology. The letter said that implementing GCHQ's idea would require changes that ""undermine user security and trust"" and potentially introduce vulnerabilities into messaging systems. ""The overwhelming majority of users rely on their confidence in reputable providers to perform authentication functions and verify that the participants in a conversation are the people they think they are, and only those people,"" said the letter. ""GCHQ's ghost proposal completely undermines this trust relationship and the authentication process,"" it added. It would also threaten privacy and free speech, wrote the signatories. In response, Mr Levy said its idea was ""hypothetical"" and intended as a ""starting point for discussion"".

"This video can not be played Trump: I like Boris Johnson and Nigel Farage Donald Trump has said he ""may"" meet Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Conservative MP Boris Johnson during next week's state visit to the UK. The US president described them as ""friends"" and ""good guys"". Mr Trump's three-day visit includes a Buckingham Palace dinner and breakfast with Prime Minister Theresa May. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he will not attend Mr Trump's state banquet, accusing the president of using ""racist and misogynist rhetoric"". Donald Trump state visit: All you need to know The president's trip, from 3 to 5 June, will also include a ceremonial welcome in the Buckingham Palace garden and a commemorative event in Portsmouth for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Mr Trump praised Mr Farage's ""big victory"" in the European elections, in which the Brexit Party received 32% of UK votes. Nigel Farage spoke at a campaign rally for Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential race He described both Mr Farage and Mr Johnson, who is among 11 contenders to replace Mrs May as Conservative leader, as ""big powers"" adding: ""I think they have done a good job."" Asked if he supported them, Mr Trump relied: ""Well, I like them. They are friends of mine but I haven't thought about supporting them. ""Maybe it's not my business to support people, but I have a lot of respect for both of those men."" During the visit, the Americans are expected to express concern over giving the Chinese company Huawei access to the UK 5G network. Leaked reports from the UK's National Security Councilsuggested the firm could be allowed to build ""non-core"" parts of the network, such as antennas, despite fears this could increase the risk of espionage. The US has put Huawei on a trade blacklist and US National Security Adviser John Bolton said the firm posed ""a different kind of threat"". A six-metre blimp - depicting the president as a baby - was flown outside Parliament during Mr Trump's last visit to the UK The president's visit to the UK last yearprompted tens of thousands of people to protestin London. The upcoming trip has been condemned by shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry who said the president had ""systematically assaulted all the shared values that unite our two countries"". In addition to Mr Corbyn, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable has declined an invitation to attend the state banquet hosted for Mr Trump. House of Commons Speaker John Bercow has said he would be ""strongly opposed"" to Mr Trump addressing the Houses of Parliament.

"Some children at the Nazareth House orphanages in Scotland were subjected to sexual abuse of the ""utmost depravity"", the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry has found. Chairwoman Lady Smith said the children's homes were places of fear, hostility and confusion. Youngsters were physically abused and emotionally degraded ""with impunity"". The Sisters of Nazareth charity said it had apologised for any abuse that took place in its institutions. Over 27 days last year, the inquiry heard evidence from former residents of four institutions in Aberdeen, Glasgow, Midlothian and Ayrshire. Helen Holland told the inquiry she suffered years of physical and emotional cruelty as a child at Nazareth House in Kilmarnock, where she was raped by a priest. She welcomed the fact that Lady Smith had believed her evidence to the inquiry. ""It is almost as if she reached beyond me as an adult and spoke to the child inside, and said to that child: 'This wasn't your fault. This shouldn't have happened. What happened was wrong.' ""That in itself is massive."" The inquiry'scase study report about the Nazareth Houses,externalbetween 1933 and 1984 will form part of a wider investigation into the abuse of children in care in Scotland. And it follows a similar publication on orphanages run by the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul, which found the homes were places of fear, threat and excessive discipline. What happened at Nazareth House orphanages? Orphanages were places of 'threat and abuse' Abuse inquiry to look at 17 more groups The abuse at the Nazareth Houses was similar in terms of nature and extent but the sexual abuse of children in the care of the Sisters of Nazareth ""was of a particularly depraved nature"", the latest report adds. It says children were targeted by staff, volunteers, visitors, priests and nuns, and adults who were aware of the abuse took no action. Lady Smith is chairing the inquiry Lady Smith said: ""The Nazareth Houses in Scotland were, for many children, places of fear, hostility and confusion, places where children were physically abused and emotionally degraded with impunity. ""There was sexual abuse of children which, in some instances, reached levels of the utmost depravity. Children in need of kind, warm, loving care and comfort did not find it. Children were deprived of compassion, dignity, care and comfort."" She also rejected all suggestions that witnesses colluded on ""fictitious accounts"" about their time in care. The latest report outlines in detail the abuse endured by children at the homes, including: Children were hit with belts, canes, sticks, broom handles, hairbrushes, shoes and wooden crucifixes. Carbolic soap was forced into their mouths, their heads banged together and they were made to kneel in corridors for long periods. For many children, this was part of daily life Runways were beaten when they returned. Those who reported their abuse to police were not believed Bed-wetters were humiliated. They were beaten, put into cold baths, made to wear wet sheets and called names by nuns Children were force-fed They had to queue for a bath in a state of undress and shared bathwater that was too hot or cold or dirty Emotional abuse included humiliation, coercive control, insults, denigration and unjustified punishments. Children were locked in cupboards They were routinely separated from their siblings and punished if they tried to make contact with them. Nazareth House in Cardonald, Glasgow, closed in 1985 It also highlights how the nuns' vow of obedience meant they did not question existing practices. Most of the sisters who gave evidence denied having seen abuse take place. The report concludes that they now find it hard to face up to the reality but ""that does not mean that the abuse did not happen"". The Sisters of Nazareth charity, which no longer runs any residential services for children in the UK, said it was grateful to Lady Smith for her report. In a statement, it said: ""Her report details the suffering and abuse endured by some of the children in our homes and for that we are deeply ashamed. ""As we have said before, we apologize wholeheartedly and unreservedly to those who suffered any form of mistreatment."" The religious order also paid tribute to the courage of those survivors who testified to the inquiry. The statement concluded: ""From listening to their testimonies and reading the report we know how deeply the experiences of those years in care have affected their lives.

"University tuition fees in England should be cut to Â£7,500, says a landmark review commissioned by the government. This will be balanced by extending repayments from 30 to 40 years - so that people could be paying back student loans into their 60s. But the review calls for the return of maintenance grants, which were axed in 2016, for poorer students. Prime Minister Theresa May said scrapping them had been a mistake. The review, chaired by the banker Philip Augar, has come up with ideas to provide better value for money in higher and further education. His big conclusions are that fees are too high in university - and that funding is too low in further education. Would the changes help poorer students? John Pienaar: A cause dear to May's heart Universities told not to 'scaremonger' over fee cut Biggest winners and losers from degree courses Universities have seen ""generous funding"" while other sectors have faced austerity, he argues, and he suggests that more support should be switched towards vocational education. The review proposes: Maximum for tuition fees should be reduced from Â£9,250 to Â£7,500 per year Any unpaid debts would not be cancelled until 40 years after graduating, rather than 30 years Repayments start at a lower point, when graduates earn Â£23,000 rather than Â£25,725 Means-tested, non-repayable maintenance grants of up to Â£3,000, for both university and higher-level technical courses More funding for further education and more access to loans for students on vocational courses ""Lifelong learning loan allowance"" to support students of all ages University funding would be targeted towards high-cost subjects and those considered a priority and away from those seen as ""low value"" The review is the prime minister's personal project and she pressed ahead with publishing its findings in her final days in office. It will be one of the last major announcements before she leaves No 10 - and she spoke with conviction about trying to drive ""social mobility"". Echoing her own words at the beginning of her premiership, she called for an end to ""burning injustices"". Mrs May accepted that her party's abolition of maintenance fees had not worked. But she argued the package of measures would remove barriers and make sure that no-one should feel that ""because of who they are or where they are from, the world of higher education is not open to them"". She also made a strong call for better funding for further education, saying that colleges had been ""overlooked, undervalued and underfunded"". But in terms of how it went down - the conversation afterwards, in an audience of education leaders, was about the curious gap between the strength of the message and the absence of such activity while in office. Or perhaps that Brexit had consumed everything else around it. It sounded like a rallying call going into government, rather than a legacy on leaving it. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says that the biggest winners will be the highest earners. They pay off their debts relatively quickly, saving on interest charges. The cut in fees will mean that they will pay even less, with the IFS estimating that the highest earning 20% could cut payments by 30%. The review wants to switch more support into improving skills and vocational training The losers could be lower earners, who currently might never have paid off their debts and had them written off. Extending the repayments to 40 years could mean they have to pay off more of their loans. Former universities minister Jo Johnson said the system was ""regressive"". But there are other factors to be considered. The return of non-repayable grants will cut costs for poorer students. This video can not be played Justine Greening told the World at One: ""This plan is like rearranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.â And the longer-term aim is to reduce the number of ""low value"" courses, so that fewer students are taking degrees which are going to give them low earnings in the jobs market. The prime minister was unambiguous about the scope for cuts in fees. ""Plenty of courses do not cost the full current rate of Â£9,250 per student per year to teach,"" she said at the launch of the review. Dr Augar said universities had enjoyed rising incomes, while other sectors had faced a decade of austerity - and there was room for ""efficiencies"". This video can not be played The author of a government report says fees should be cut to Â£7,500 There are also proposals for direct funding to fill the gap of reduced fees. But this will also be a lever for the government to influence the courses being offered - by giving more funding to courses which are either expensive to deliver, such as some sciences. Or else it will be a financial incentive for universities to teach courses which are seen as being of ""high value"" to the economy. The Russell Group of universities says there would need to be a ""cast-iron guarantee"" that any shortfall would be replaced. The Association of Colleges, facing a boost in income for further education, was much more enthusiastic. ""For too long, we've had a system that works for half the population whilst neglecting the other half,"" said chief executive David Hughes. A snap poll from YouGov showed that the idea of lowering fees is popular - backed by 59%. But Conservative and Brexit supporters are the least likely to want lower fees, say the pollsters. There is also a question of perception. Shakira Martin, president of the National Union of Students, said it would help to address ""the debt aversion caused by high fees, high living costs and the lack of maintenance grants"". Dr Augar also reminded the launch event about how negatively high fees and debts could be viewed, and the misunderstandings of the system. He said research for the review had come across a grandparent wondering whether they should sell their house to pay off a grandchild's student debt. The review says a fee cut would not happen before 2021-22 at the earliest. But there remains another significant political catch. Changes in the level of tuition fees have to be approved by both houses of Parliament. With the current political deadlock it seems unlikely that such a measure will be pushed forward any time soon - and the future of the plans will depend on the response of the next prime minister. Labour, which wants to completely scrap tuition fees, has already dismissed the review as ""all talk, empty promises and very little action"". Universities told not to 'scaremonger' on fee cut Tuition fees cut expected as May's legacy Â£7,500 tuition fees plan faces Brexit delay Short-term politics 'harms skills training' Would the proposed student finance changes help poorer students?

"The proposal would copy encrypted chats and share them with the security services A ""hypothetical"" proposal by UK security agency GCHQ to eavesdrop on encrypted messages has been criticised by tech firms and rights groups. Google and Apple were among 47 firms to sign an open letter, saying it,externalwas a ""serious threat"" to trust and security. The GCHQ plan would mean, in some circumstances, security services got copies of encrypted messages. The technique resembled the way that GCHQ currently used wiretaps to listen to unencrypted chat, said the agency. Theplan for a so-called ""ghost protocol"" was first floated,externalby the UK National Cyber Security Centre's technical director Ian Levy and GCHQ's chief codebreaker Crispin Robinson in November 2018. The proposal was intended to add to the debate about strongly encrypted messaging systems that security services have struggled to break. Instead of asking for encryption systems to be weakened so they can be cracked, the plan would instead copy messages and send the duplicate on to a third recipient. That other recipient would be able to read the message because they possessed a key corresponding to the one with which it was encrypted. The ghosting system would only be used in ""exceptional circumstances"" to gather information about suspects, said the discussion paper about the technology. Spies from GCHQ take part in covert charity bike ride Prince William works with security agencies on attachment Drab London office block was GCHQ spy base In their letter, rights groups, industry bodies and tech firms said the idea would ""violate"" important human rights principles. Signatories include Google, Apple, WhatsApp and Microsoft as well as Big Brother Watch, Privacy International and the Center for Democracy and Technology. The letter said that implementing GCHQ's idea would require changes that ""undermine user security and trust"" and potentially introduce vulnerabilities into messaging systems. ""The overwhelming majority of users rely on their confidence in reputable providers to perform authentication functions and verify that the participants in a conversation are the people they think they are, and only those people,"" said the letter. ""GCHQ's ghost proposal completely undermines this trust relationship and the authentication process,"" it added. It would also threaten privacy and free speech, wrote the signatories. In response, Mr Levy said its idea was ""hypothetical"" and intended as a ""starting point for discussion"". He added: ""We will continue to engage with interested parties and look forward to having an open discussion to reach the best solutions possible.""

Stokes earlier made 89 and Jason Roy, Joe Root and Eoin Morgan hit half-centuries to take England to 311-8, a total that seemed no better than par. Quinton de Kock's 68 had South Africa in the hunt at 129-2, but he pulled Liam Plunkett to long leg to become the first of three wickets to fall for 15 runs. When Stokes took two wickets in two balls, the world number ones and favourites completed an ideal start to the tournament. In a competition where the 10 teams play each other once to determine the semi-finalists, the hosts travel to Nottingham to meet Pakistan at Trent Bridge on Monday. South Africa, who showed enough with the ball to suggest they will contend for the semis, are back at The Oval on Sunday to take on Bangladesh. TMS podcast: Stokes stunner lights up The Oval This video can not be played 'Incredible' Stokes catch removes Phehlukwayo England have been building to this competition for the four years since their dismal first-round exit at the last World Cup, sweeping all before them mainly thanks to their power-packed batting line-up. But for three-quarters of a day that began with the Duke of Sussex opening the tournament, they were in danger of being upset by a well-drilled South Africa. Indeed, on a slow pitch that produced intriguing rather than entertaining cricket, this was at times a low-key start to the tournament. Under grey skies even the crowd was subdued for long periods. The exceptions to all of this were Archer and Stokes. For Archer, pace, aggression and hostility made it seem like a wicket was likely every time he had the ball in his hand. However, the moment of the day belonged to Stokes, who took the most incredible catch, one that is unlikely to be bettered throughout the whole tournament. As Phehlukwayo swept Adil Rashid towards the mid-wicket boundary, the ball seemed to be too high for Stokes to reach. He leapt, flinging himself backwards with his right arm outstretched. As he clung on in one hand, the crowd gasped and his team-mates mobbed him for disbelieving celebrations. This video can not be played Archer takes first World Cup wicket to make England breakthrough Born in Barbados to a British father, Archer only qualified to play for England in March and here showed exactly why he was fast-tracked into the World Cup squad. The wickets he took were all, at least in some part, down to his pace. After Amla took a nasty blow to the grille, Aiden Markram fended to slip and Faf du Plessis hooked to long leg. With South Africa in danger of subsiding, De Kock added 85 with Rassie van der Dussen. Both had moments of fortune - Rashid looked to have bowled De Kock only for the bails not to come off, while Van der Dussen was dropped by wicketkeeper Jos Buttler. This video can not be played Watch De Kock's amazing escape after ball hits stumps The game turned after De Kock helped a short ball from Plunkett to Root at long leg. JP Duminy holed out off Moeen and Dwaine Pretorius was run out by Stokes' bullet throw from the deep as three wickets fell in 21 balls. Archer returned to remove Van der Dussen with another short ball and, though Amla came back before gloving Plunkett behind, Stokes took over. First came the wonder catch, then the wickets of Kagiso Rabada and Imran Tahir completed an impressive England bowling and fielding display. For a variety of reasons - the control of the South Africa bowlers, the sluggish nature of the pitch and maybe even a few nerves - this was not the free-scoring England of the past four years. The tone was set by a clever piece of captaincy from Du Plessis. Leg-spinner Tahir was chosen to open the bowling and Jonny Bairstow edged his second ball behind to become the first opener to get a golden duck in the first innings of a World Cup tournament. To their credit, England steadied. Roy and Root added 106 and, after they both fell in the space of four balls, Morgan and Stokes shared 106 of their own. Roy played powerful drives while Root scored almost exclusively off his pads. Morgan pulled and drove, playing the aggressor in his stand with Stokes until he was athletically caught by a diving Markram at long-on off Tahir. Stokes began calmly - his first 31 runs came from 36 balls - but he gradually upped his scoring. Still, the biggest blow to England's late charge came when Buttler dragged on to his stumps. In the face of some intelligent South Africa bowling, England's assault never materialised, but their total proved to be more than adequate.

To come away with a win is a fantastic start. ""That's the best we've fielded in about two or three years. The amount of runs we saved was absolutely brilliant."" Former England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS:""Any team's success is generally geared around the all-rounder. Ben Stokes finding form in the first game of the World Cup is a huge boost for England. ""His innings with the bat was really smart - and that's the way I'd describe this England performance: smart."" England captain Eoin Morgan:""We were very good today. We were good as a batting unit even though we couldn't score a considerable total, which was our Plan A. ""But we felt that the score we had on the board was above average. We won't have days like this every time. ""Jofra Archer bowled fast and accurate on a slow pitch it was outstanding from a young guy. He's taking everything in his stride. It's very exciting. South Africa captain Faf du Plessis:""We were outplayed in all three departments. I thought 300 was par - we were bowling cutters, but there were some really good batting performances from England. ""Hashim Amla is OK now. He was all over the place when he came off the field but hopefully he is OK for the next game."" Former South Africa captain Graeme Smith on the TMS podcast:""All of our fears came up today - the balance and the batting are the weak parts for South Africa. Chasing just over 300 against a very good team, they never really looked in it.""

"Education Secretary Damian Hinds has told England's universities not to ""scaremonger"" over their finances, ahead of a review which is expected to call for a cut in tuition fees. There have been warnings that lowering the fees to Â£7,500 per year could put some at risk of going bust. But Mr Hinds accused universities of ""distorting the picture"" and said the sector was in good financial health. The fees review is set to promise students better ""value for money"". The review into student finance and university and college funding, chaired by Philip Augar, is due to report next week. The review could include: Tuition fees lowered from a maximum of Â£9,250 per year to Â£7,500 This fee income would be replaced by direct funding to universities from government More money in students' pockets while they are studying, with access to more maintenance loans and the return of means-tested grants Students on vocational courses having wider access to student loans and financial support Changes to the repayment terms and interest charges, such as lengthening the payback time beyond 30 years A way of limiting student numbers, such as a minimum grade threshold of three Ds at A-level An individual ""lifelong"" entitlement to student finance up to the value of an undergraduate degree, which could be used for vocational or academic courses Different levels of funding for different subjects, which would recognise that some degree courses, such as arts subjects, are much cheaper to deliver. Different levels of fees would be more controversial. More incentives for shorter, cheaper two-year accelerated degrees Centralise the budgets for widening access to university, rather than taking it from tuition fees Examine the cost of university accommodation Commissioned by the prime minister, the review is expected to be one of the last major announcements before Theresa May leaves No 10. It was launched in the wake of the 2017 general election, countering Labour's promise to young voters that it would completely scrap tuition fees. The review will seek to make university more affordable and give more support to students in vocational and further education. Mr Hinds has highlighted the problem of ""low value"" degree courses, where there is likely to be little financial return for students. The further education sector is expected to benefit from the review, with the suggestion that more students should consider getting technical skills and qualifications rather than going to university. These will be proposals rather than final decisions - and the cost of any changes will have to be linked to the government's spending review later this year. Universities will want to know whether any drop in fees will be compensated by direct funding. Tuition fee cut expected as Theresa May's departing legacy Will universities really go bust if fees are cut? Â£7,500 fees plan delayed by Brexit Biggest winners and losers from degree courses There have been reports of universities being on the brink of bankruptcy - and one was revealed as having needed a bailout from the Office for Students. But Mr Hinds said that while most sectors had to ""tighten their belts"" after the financial crash, universities have seen rising fee incomes. ""I do understand universities are facing some challenges, but reports of financial hardship across the entire sector is scaremongering,"" says Mr Hinds. But Alistair Jarvis, chief executive of Universities UK, hit back, saying any cut in fees ""must be made up in full by a government teaching grant"". The review, commissioned by the prime minister, is expected in the days before Theresa May leaves office Otherwise he said it would be a ""political choice which harms students, the economy and communities that benefit from universities"". Vanessa Wilson, head of the University Alliance, representing universities with strong industry links, said ""cutting front-line university budgets"" would harm rather than help students. But she said the ""political vacuum"" surrounding Mrs May's resignation could make the report ""dead on arrival"". ""We need to move quickly to end the uncertainty, confusion and damage to colleges and universities' finances,"" she said. Further education colleges are expected to gain from the review and David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, welcomed the shift in emphasis away from universities. ""The relentless focus on traditional higher education has been a major failing of successive governments, because it has been at the expense of other options,"" said Mr Hughes. ""Most people will never go to university but have been consistently overlooked. The post-18 review needs to urgently redress that situation,"" he said.

"A government-commissioned review of funding for over-18 education has come out with its recommendations. There has been much discussion of whether the changes are progressive (better for lower earners) or regressive (better for higher earners). The key proposals for higher education are: reducing the maximum annual fees that universities can charge - from Â£9,250 a year to Â£7,500 instead of any unpaid loans being cancelled 30 years after graduation, deductions would continue for 40 years reducing the amount graduates can earn before they have to start repaying - from Â£25,725 a year to Â£23,000 reintroducing maintenance grants for poorer students. At first glance, you may think lowering fees would be good for all students - but that is not true because so few of them are expected to pay off their loans in full. TheOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates,externalthat only 38% of the money and interest will be repaid, whilethe Sutton Trust estimates,externalthat 81% of students will not pay off their loans in full. And if you are a middle earner who would not have paid off your loan in full under the old system, making you pay for an extra 10 years and making you pay more each year is probably going to cost you more than you are going to save from paying lower annual fees. To its credit, the review has gone into considerable detail of the impact of the changes. It says: The highest earners would still pay the most but would pay less than they do under the current system Middle-earning graduates would make higher contributions each year and more of them would pay off their debt in full Low-earning graduates would still not pay anything if they did not earn above the threshold, although the threshold would be lower So while the new system would still be progressive overall, it would be less progressive than the old system and it would be reasonable to describe the changes as regressive. The review also looked at the impact of the proposed changes on the lifetime repayments of six example students with different earnings. So if you imagine looking at all the graduates who have borrowed money in order of their annual earnings, the first example is 10% of the way along, the second is 25% of the way along et cetera. So, the lowest earners are on the left of the chart and the highest are on the right. Again, it is clear that the changes are regressive. The lowest earner on the chart would not have earned enough to start making repayments under the old system and would not do so under the new system either. The next student along, who is at the 25th percentile, would also not have made any payments at all under the old system and would make only very small repayments under the new one because of the lower threshold. It is the middle earner who would really being hit by the new system, with estimated lifetime payments rising from Â£14,844 to Â£26,667, as a result of the lower payment threshold and having to pay for an extra 10 years. All of the higher earners would find themselves better off under the proposed system as a result of the lower annual fees and paying their loans off faster as a result of the lower threshold, which means they pay less interest overall. They may also benefit from a proposed cap that limits the amount of interest that may be paid by preventing anyone paying more than 1.2 times their original borrowing after adjusting for inflation. Having a maintenance grant rather than a loan is a progressive move under the proposed changes, although it is based on the student's family income at the point when they are considering going to university. As such, it is harder to consider alongside the rest of the system, which considers progressiveness based on earnings after the student graduates. So if a student from a poor background goes on to be a low earner, having a grant rather than a loan would not have made a financial difference because they would not have made any repayments anyway.

"There have been many different attempts to improve vocational skills Skills training in England has been undermined by ""short-term, disjointed and inconsistent"" policies, says the City and Guilds training body. Chief executive Chris Jones blamed a constant churn of initiatives and announcements from politicians wanting to be ""seen to be doing something"". He warned that spending on the new vocational T-levels could be wasted. But Education Secretary Damian Hinds has called on businesses to back the new T-level qualifications. There have been warnings about skills gaps and weaknesses in vocational training, but Mr Jones says it is ""deeply concerning"" that ""policy is not driving any sustainable improvement in raising skills"". He said there had been a high turnover of ministers with responsibility for skills - 70 in 35 years - with each tempted to launch another initiative. There have been warnings of skills shortages and the need to improve training ""Ministers think structural change is not only easy to implement - but I'll be seen to be doing something and I can claim something better will come from it,"" he says. But implementation is often ""fundamentally flawed"", says Mr Jones, head of the City and Guilds group, one of the longest-established bodies for accrediting crafts, trades and skills. ""Either a change of government cancels it or we haven't been clear at the outset what we were trying to achieve,"" says Mr Jones. The outcome, he warns is that too many ""badly-needed training and education programmes are not fit for purpose"". Vocational skills backed in review expected to cut tuition fees Institutes of Technology to boost skills training Craft workers should have their own titles First colleges to teach new T-levels Mr Jones, launching a report called Sense and Instability, wants a more independent body for skills policy, with a long-term, strategic approach and less political interference. The latest proposed change is the launch of T-levels, which are intended to be the vocational equivalent of A-levels. Mr Jones supports the principle of a high status vocational qualification, but he says that beyond ""warm words"" it is not clear what will make them successful or provide value for money. City and Guilds is one of the longest established bodies for trades and crafts Previous sets of qualifications, such as diplomas, were launched and then cancelled, and he says he wants a more objective approach to T-levels, rather than rhetoric. ""You cannot claim it to be a 'gold standard'. That is a hollow statement and is totally unsubstantiated,"" says Mr Jones. He warns of too much emphasis on volume targets such as numbers of learners, rather than the quality or purpose of qualifications. Too often with vocational and training initiatives, he says it is difficult to know whether hundreds of millions of pounds are ""going to waste"". Skills policy needs a more strategic approach, says Chris Jones, chief executive of City and Guilds. He says the lack of progress is frustrating for employers facing skills shortages, with warning of potentially ""devastating"" consequences for the UK's economy. A Department for Education spokeswoman says that T-levels ""represent the biggest shake up to technical education in a generation"". The new qualifications are designed to ""help businesses to build the skilled workforce they need for the future"". This weekend, the education secretary called on businesses to help create opportunities for young people to get work experience, as part of their T-levels. He promised Â£7m to support work-experience projects, for the qualifications being rolled out from September 2020. ""The completion of a high-quality industry placement will be at the heart of every T-level and is part of what will set these new courses apart from every attempt to reform technical and vocational education in the past 70 years,"" said Mr Hinds. ""To make a success of T-levels, we need businesses working in partnership with us and colleges. ""Industry placements will help young people build the confidence and skills they need to get a head start in their careers and they'll help business maximise their talent pipeline for the future.""

"This video can not be played Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg speaking in May: 'We're confident on the plane's safety' Boeing has admitted it ""fell short"" when it failed to implement a safety alert system on the 737 Max. The aircraft was grounded globally in March after two crashes within months. Boeing boss Dennis Muilenburg said a mistake had been made in the software for a cockpit warning light called an ""angle-of-attack (AOA) disagree alert"". He said: ""We clearly fell short and the implementation of this angle-of-attack disagree alert was a mistake, right, we did not implement it properly."" In an interview with Norah O'Donnell of CBS News he said Boeing was now fixing the problem. The alert could have notified pilots and maintenance crews that there was a problem early in the flight. One flight safety expert said if there had been an AOA disagree alert on board the Ethiopian airlines flight it ""would have been the very first clue"" for the pilots that something was wrong. Chris Brady, a pilot and author of The Boeing 737 Technical Guide said: ""I'm fairly confident that the Ethiopian Airlines flight probably would not have crashed if they had had the AOA disagree alert"" on the aircraft. The Ethiopian Airlines crash killed all 157 on board Ethiopian Airlines flight ET 302 crashed after an erroneous reading from one of the AOA sensors triggered a flight control system (MCAS) which repeatedly pushed the nose of the aircraft down. All 157 people on board were killed. Mr Brady believes that if there had been an alert warning light showing that the AOA sensors were giving different readings, then the pilots might have followed an emergency procedure at an earlier point in the doomed flight. The procedure, detailed by Boeing in a bulletin to airlines and pilots in November subsequent to the Lion Air crash off Indonesia, involves flipping two switches, and turns off an automatic control system for the plane's stabilisers. Boeing said in a statement a month ago that the ""alert has not been considered a safety feature on airplanes and is not necessary for the safe operation of the airplane"". This is perhaps the clearest admission so far from Boeing that at least one aspect of the aircraft's build wasn't done properly. We can't say for certain that an angle of attack disagree alert, which was missing, would have made a big difference. However, it could have provided the pilots with a useful clue, possibly within seconds of take-off, that something was not right. Ask any pilot if they would have wanted the alert in their cockpit and you'll get a resounding ""yes"". The alert is about flagging that the readings from the plane's two angle of attack sensors don't match. And the fact that an erroneous reading from one of those sensors kick-started a flight control system, which pushed the plane's nose repeatedly down before it crashed, means the missing alert will surely be of interest to investigators and lawyers representing relatives of those who were killed. Mr Muilenburg also admitted in the CBS interview that the company knew that the alert system was not active on all 737 Max jets in 2017 and yet did not tell the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for 13 months. He said: ""Our communication on that was not what it should have been."" And he issued another apology, saying ""it feels personal"". He said that the crashes have had ""the biggest impact on me"" of anything in his 34 years at the planemaker. The head of the airline industry's trade body, IATA has said the 737 Max is unlikely to re-enter service before August. Director General Alexandre de Juniac said ""we do not expect something before 10 or 12 weeks"", although he added a final decision was up to regulators. Mr de Juniac told reporters in Seoul on Wednesday that IATA was organising a summit with airlines, regulators and Boeing in five to seven weeks to discuss what is needed for the 737 Max to return to service, he said. Boeing's 737 Max aircraft was grounded in March He hoped that regulators could ""align their timeframe"" on when the aircraft would  be back in the skies. US operators United Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and American Airlines have removed the 737 Max from their flight schedules until early to mid-August. Earlier in the day, Mr Muilenburg had told shareholders Boeing aimed to ramp up its long-term production rate of the 737 Max to 57 a month after cutting monthly output to 42 planes in response to the groundings. Boeing 737 Max 'may be grounded for months' 737 Max return may be later than hoped FAA 'examining reports' for link between crashes.

"Muhammad Javed used a hammer and machete to kill his wife A ""controlling and coercive"" husband who battered his wife to death after he wrongly suspected her of having an affair has been found guilty of murder. Muhammad Javed, 59, used a hammer and machete to kill Saeeda Hussain, 53, in the living room of their east London home in February last year. The Old Bailey heard she had ""feared the shame"" if his violence towards her was reported to authorities. Javed, of Staines Road, Ilford, will be sentenced on 21 June. Prosecutor Julian Evans told the trial jury the couple's children were aware of Javed's ""violence and... mistreatment"" during their marriage of more than 30 years. However, Mr Evans said Ms Hussain ""did not want them to report it to the police or to others outside the family"". ""She feared that the defendant would be deported. ""She also feared the shame that, in her mind, such revelations would bring."" Mother-of-five Saeeda Hussain was murdered at the home she shared with her husband Mr Evans told the court that Javed had suspected his wife was ""having an affair or was seeing other men behind his back"", suspicions the prosecutor claimed ""were entirely without merit"". The court was told Javed had installed CCTV at their home to monitor the mother-of-five's behaviour and the couple slept in separate rooms. A pathologist estimated that there were at least 46 separate impacts from the machete and at least seven blows from the hammer from the attack on 13 February. The court heard Javed then changed out of his blood-stained clothes, left the weapons near his wife's body, locked the living-room door, and left by a window. He then contacted his daughter's father-in-law and told him: ""You are going to hear very bad news"". At about 18:00 GMT he then went to the local police station and told an officer: ""I have just killed my wife"". When police entered the house they found a discarded boiler suit covered in blood, which Det Insp John Marriott said was ""probably donned... to avoid getting his wife's blood on his clothes"". He added: ""If ever a case shows the importance of contacting police if you are in, or aware of, an abusive relationship, then this is it.""

"Endgame has taken more than $2.7bn globally A number of US media giants have publicly stated they will reconsider filming in Georgia if the state's strict new abortion law takes effect. Disney, Netflix and WarnerMedia have all objected to the legislation, which would ban abortion after a foetal heartbeat can be detected. The so-called ""heartbeat bill"" has caused a furious backlash in Hollywood and led to calls for a boycott. Georgia makes billions of dollars from film and television productions. The state's bill seeks to make abortion illegal as soon as a foetal heartbeat is detectable. In most cases, this is at the six-week mark of a pregnancy - before many women even know they are pregnant. It is one of a number of states to pass abortion restrictions in the past year, but they are expected to face legal challenges. US state's abortion law fuels boycott call What's behind Georgia's anti-abortion 'heartbeat bill'? Emotional abortion stories shared with #youknowme Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney says the law would make it ""difficult"" for the company to keep filming there. Blockbusters like Black Panther and Avengers: Endgame, were recently shot in the state, due to its generous tax breaks for film productions. However, Mr Iger said ""many people who work for us will not want to work there"" should the law go into effect. ""We will have to heed their wishes,"" he told Reuters. WarnerMedia meanwhile said it would reconsider Georgia ""if the new law holds"", after Netflix announced on Tuesday it would ""rethink"" its productions in the state should the law take effect. Jason Bateman and Kristen Wiig have both condemned the new law, which effectively bans abortion Earlier this week, Netflix said it would ""rethink"" its operations there with chief content officer Ted Sarandos explaining: ""We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,"" He said the streaming giant would ""work with the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] and others to fight it in court."" Meanwhile, stars including Amy Schumer, Ben Stiller, Christina Applegate, Laverne Cox and Alec Baldwinwrote to the governor,externalsaying they would ""do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women"". Comedy actress and writer Kristen Wiig also confirmed to CNN thather new comedy had pulled out of filming in the state,externalwhile the executive producers of a new Amazon show The Power said it was no longer scouting for filming locations in Georgia because of the controversial bill. Actor Jason Bateman, who stars in the Netflix show Ozark and in HBO's The Outsider, which are both currently filming in Georgia, told The Hollywood Reporter: ""I will not work in Georgia, or any other state, that is so disgracefully at odds with women's rights"". ""Right now we are watching it very carefully,"" said Disney's Bob Iger, adding he didn't ""see how it's practical for us to continue to shoot there."" Georgia was used as a location for Black Panther Disney's prospective withdrawal would be a huge blow to the state. Recently, Disney's Marvel Studios filmed portions of both Black Panther and Avengers: Endgame in Georgia. Georgia - which offers up to 30% tax breaks - has become a magnet for film and TV productions, employing more than 90,000 people. Website Film LAanalysed a sample of the 100 top-grossing feature films,externalreleased at the US box office in 2017 and found Georgia was tied for second place, behind California, as a location with the UK, each with 15 films in the top 100 in 2017. British location manager Steve Mortimore has worked with both Disney and Netflix and scouted for films including World War Z, the forthcoming Wonder Woman sequel and Ridley Scott's All The Money in the World. He told the BBC the clash over Georgia's abortion law could have ""massive ramifications"". Aside from Georgia's generous tax breaks for filmmakers, he said, ""they have trained so many people to work in the industry, and so many experts have moved there who will have to move away again"". Steve Mortimore scouted Glasgow as a stand-in for Philadelphia on World War Z, starring Brad Pitt Speaking about Disney and Netflix's threats to pull out of Georgia entirely, he told the BBC: ""I'd be surprised if they went ahead and pulled out unless they had a plan B or C. ""Those big Marvel films, they need huge spaces, 100,000 to 150,000 sq ft sound stages with all the facilities and they are limited. I know that Europe is absolutely fully booked up, there isn't anywhere else"". In 2014, the British-based Pinewood studios opened Pinewood Atlanta, spanning 700 acres and providing 18 sound stages. It has declined to comment on the news reports, but Mortimore said it could be be ""very painful for them"". He claimed that London has now displaced Hollywood as the film industry's new capital, adding ""the space just isn't available, people are queuing to film [in the UK] for the next three or four years"". ""It's an opportunity for somewhere else,"" he said. ""Maybe LA can step in. They have huge TV productions but its a chance to stick their flag in the sand and say they are a major hub for movies again, which they lost to London."" Recent productions based in Georgia include: Godzilla: King of Monsters, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, Black Panther, Pitch Perfect 3, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Stranger Things, Ozark and The Walking Dead. It is one of several US states to pass new, stricter laws on abortion, the latest being Louisiana. The new law prevents abortions in almost all circumstances once an embryonic heartbeat can be detected. Critics have pointed at what they see as an orchestrated challenge to a decades-old US Supreme Court ruling that protected a woman's right to choose an abortion.

"A government-commissioned review of funding for over-18 education has come out with its recommendations. There has been much discussion of whether the changes are progressive (better for lower earners) or regressive (better for higher earners). The key proposals for higher education are: reducing the maximum annual fees that universities can charge - from Â£9,250 a year to Â£7,500 instead of any unpaid loans being cancelled 30 years after graduation, deductions would continue for 40 years reducing the amount graduates can earn before they have to start repaying - from Â£25,725 a year to Â£23,000 reintroducing maintenance grants for poorer students. At first glance, you may think lowering fees would be good for all students - but that is not true because so few of them are expected to pay off their loans in full. TheOffice for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates,externalthat only 38% of the money and interest will be repaid, whilethe Sutton Trust estimates,externalthat 81% of students will not pay off their loans in full. And if you are a middle earner who would not have paid off your loan in full under the old system, making you pay for an extra 10 years and making you pay more each year is probably going to cost you more than you are going to save from paying lower annual fees. To its credit, the review has gone into considerable detail of the impact of the changes. It says: The highest earners would still pay the most but would pay less than they do under the current system Middle-earning graduates would make higher contributions each year and more of them would pay off their debt in full Low-earning graduates would still not pay anything if they did not earn above the threshold, although the threshold would be lower So while the new system would still be progressive overall, it would be less progressive than the old system and it would be reasonable to describe the changes as regressive. The review also looked at the impact of the proposed changes on the lifetime repayments of six example students with different earnings. So if you imagine looking at all the graduates who have borrowed money in order of their annual earnings, the first example is 10% of the way along, the second is 25% of the way along et cetera. So, the lowest earners are on the left of the chart and the highest are on the right. Again, it is clear that the changes are regressive. The lowest earner on the chart would not have earned enough to start making repayments under the old system and would not do so under the new system either. The next student along, who is at the 25th percentile, would also not have made any payments at all under the old system and would make only very small repayments under the new one because of the lower threshold. It is the middle earner who would really being hit by the new system, with estimated lifetime payments rising from Â£14,844 to Â£26,667, as a result of the lower payment threshold and having to pay for an extra 10 years. All of the higher earners would find themselves better off under the proposed system as a result of the lower annual fees and paying their loans off faster as a result of the lower threshold, which means they pay less interest overall. They may also benefit from a proposed cap that limits the amount of interest that may be paid by preventing anyone paying more than 1.2 times their original borrowing after adjusting for inflation. Having a maintenance grant rather than a loan is a progressive move under the proposed changes, although it is based on the student's family income at the point when they are considering going to university. As such, it is harder to consider alongside the rest of the system, which considers progressiveness based on earnings after the student graduates. So if a student from a poor background goes on to be a low earner, having a grant rather than a loan would not have made a financial difference because they would not have made any repayments anyway.

"Women studying maths at Oxford and men taking economics at Bristol get the biggest increase in earnings from going to university, says an analysis of salaries at the age of 29. The study, from the Department for Education and Institute for Fiscal Studies, says women are much more likely to gain from getting a degree. Women with a degree earn on average 28% more than non-graduate women. Men with degrees earn an average of 8% more than non-graduates. But a third of men go to universities which give them only a ""negligible"" pay advantage, despite the cost of fees. The lowest for earnings for men is studying philosophy at Sussex - and for women it is computing at Westminster. The report, based on tax records of people who went to school in England and then went to university in England, Wales or Scotland,looks at how going to university might affect earnings,external. Setting aside any social benefits, it's asking if it's worth the cash, when graduates are leaving with an average of Â£50,000 of debt. A woman with a degree on average earns Â£6,700 more per year than a non-graduate woman - with women improving their earnings for almost every course at every university. But the difference is much narrower for men, with a male graduate on average earning Â£2,700 more than a non-graduate. There are tougher questions for the one-third of men who go to universities which give ""negligible or negative impact"" on earnings compared with those without a degree. Are they getting value for money? The report says getting a degree is clearly an ""excellent investment"" for women, because their earnings are so much higher than non-graduate women. Much of this is because women without degrees are particularly likely to be low earners - and so the gap between them and graduates is likely to be wider. This could be because women without degrees are likely to be in particularly low-paid jobs. But another factor is that non-graduate women in their 20s are twice as likely to be working part-time as women with degrees. This could be because women who do not go to university tend to have children earlier than graduate women. So the big gains for women described in the report could include comparisons between full-time graduate earnings and those non-graduates working part-time. The report shows there is a huge difference in likely earnings depending on the subject studied. At the top end of the pay scale are medicine, economics, maths, business and law. Women studying medicine can expect to earn 78% more than non-graduate women. At the lower end are subjects such as creative arts, philosophy and English. Men taking these subjects are likely to get ""negative"" returns - as on average they will earn less than their male counterparts who did not go to university. For men taking creative arts, they can expect 14% less than non-graduates. There are significant earnings premiums for those at the top of the table - with women getting the best returns from four London universities - the LSE, Imperial, King's College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies - and Oxford. Bristol and Cambridge are added to the list of high earners for male students. At the bottom, for male graduates, are modern universities, such as Bath Spa, or colleges which also deliver further education, such as Leeds City. Almost all women are at universities which will boost their pay - although Bolton is an exception and is ranked lowest. It might not seem that surprising that modern universities do less well in future earnings. It might also be predictable that arts-based institutions get lower earnings, such as Ravensbourne, Goldsmiths and the University of the Arts. But there might be scrutiny of the scale of universities where there are negative outcomes - 26 institutions where male earnings are on average less than non-graduates and 39 where the returns are less than 2%. Essex, Hull, Leicester, Sussex, Keele and Bradford all have an earnings premium below 10% for male students. If you put together the subject and university choice you can see the extremes of high and low-earning courses. For women, maths at Oxford is the highest, followed by economics at the LSE. Economics at University College London gives a big return, as does medicine at Imperial. In fact, the highest earners are a narrow combination of maths, law, medicine, physics and economics taken at a handful of top universities. It's very similar for male graduates, headed by economics at Bristol and physics at Oxford. For women, the lowest paying is computing at Westminster. Psychology at Bolton is in the bottom five. But showing how much the course can drive the outcome, creative arts at Cambridge is among the least likely to deliver high earnings. For men, philosophy at Sussex is ranked as offering the lowest rate of return - and studying languages at Oxford is also in the bottom five for male earnings. The Universities Minister Sam Gyimah says that more transparency is vital to make sure that young people make informed choices about university places. This will help them to think about getting value for money from their degree. He also wants this to ""shine a light"" on courses that seem to deliver such a low rate of return. Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Half of university tuition fees spent on teaching The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't But in the background, the big political context is a review considering the future of tuition fees in England. This latest report could raise some very awkward questions. Is it reasonable to charge students Â£9,500 regardless of course or university when there are such different outcomes in earnings? And is it sustainable to have such a high level of fee and debt, when for so many, particularly men, the returns can be marginal or non-existent? Half of tuition fees spent on teaching Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Tuition fees cut to Â£6,500 but higher for science?

"Alastair Campbell's expulsion from the Labour Party should be reviewed, the shadow attorney general has said. Tony Blair's ex-communications chiefwas thrown outfor saying he had voted Lib Dem in the European elections because of his party's Brexit stance. Baroness Chakrabarti told the BBC that Labour members who had backed rivals should ""come forward"" and discuss their differences with the party. Mr Campbell said he was ""confident I could win an appeal"". The party's share of the vote fell to 14% in last week's European elections and several senior figures haveblamed its nuanced position on Brexit. Campbell expulsion 'spiteful', says Watson Labour still split over further referendum What the EU elections tell us about support for Brexit Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Baroness Chakrabarti said she hoped Mr Campbell and other Labour members who had expressed public support for other parties could ""come forward and talk about their future intentions and the case can be reviewed"". ""Merely voting for another party is not in itself a grounds for exclusion or expulsion or anything like that and I want the large numbers of people who did that last week for heart-felt reasons to rest assured,"" she said. Baroness Chakrabarti also said: ""Political parties have rules about people who support other parties, but I hope this case will be reviewed."" This video can not be played Corbyn on Campbell: We look forward to hearing what Alastair has to say Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Campbell's actions were ""not acceptable"", adding: ""We look forward to hearing what Alastair has to say about this and look forward to his support for Labour in the future."" Mr Campbell made his decision to vote for the Lib Dems public on the BBC's election night broadcast, accusing Labour of ""letting its own supporters down"" in ""failing to devise a policy the country could unite around"" over Brexit. Responding to Baroness Chakrabarti's comments, Mr Campbell tweeted: ""Pleased, if true that my 'expulsion' from Labour is being 'reviewed.'"" However, he added that he had ""not heard anything from the governance unit"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The decision to kick Mr Campbell out of the party was criticised by other Labour figures including the deputy leader Tom Watson who called it ""spiteful"". He called for ""an amnesty"" for members who voted for other parties adding - ""we should be listening to members rather than punishing them"". A number of other senior Labour figures have since confirmed they also voted for different parties in the European polls. Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke said he had voted Lib Dem, as did ex-MP Fiona Mactaggart, while former Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth said he had voted Green. Labour said supporting another party was ""incompatible"" with membership. A spokeswoman said the issue was not about voting, but Mr Campbell ""using media appearances to advertise and encourage support for another party"". Last week former Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltinewas suspended from the parliamentary partyafter admitting he was planning to vote for the Liberal Democrats in the elections. Concerning Labour's position on Brexit, Baroness Chakrabarti said her party would not necessarily back Remain in a future EU referendum. ""That would depend on what the deal was,"" she said. ""Was it going to be a Labour deal with the closest possible relationship with Europe, or was it going to be a deal that we thought less than satisfactory? ""We want to break the stasis in this country with a general election or a public vote.""

"Derek Mackay confirms the economy is predicted to grow 0.8% in 2019, down from 1.3% in 2018 Nicola Sturgeon was quizzed during FMQs Ruth Davidson asked about NHS waits, Richard Leonard raised problems at a rail works and Willie Rennie went on Brexit The disenfranchisement of EU nationals, access to care and poverty were also raised Louise Wilson and Bryn Palmer That's all from Holyrood Live on Thursday 30 May 2019. The Scottish economy is expected to grow by 0.8% in 2019, a fall from the 1.3% it experienced in 2018. Delivering his medium-term financial strategy, Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said the downgrade was due to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. The Scottish Fiscal Commission also released forecasts in income tax, estimating there would be less money for future Scottish budgets. Mr Mackay said the Scottish government may have to look at borrowing and expenditure in light of this but added it will be the next outturn figures which set the next budget. The Tory amendment to the government's motion on trade is not agreed with 51 MSPs backing it compared to 65 against. The Labour amendment is also not agreed. 51 MSPs backed it, 59 voted against 6 abstained. The Green amendment is not agreed (10 votes for and 87 against, with 18 abstentions). The government motion is agreed by 110 votes to 6. Trade Minister Ivan McKee wraps up the debate by praising the constructive input from Tom Mason and says there was much to agree with in the Green amendment, but the problem is it  ""deletes everything"". On Patrick Harvie's point about GDP, Mr McKee says the Scottish government is very much engaged in the wellbeing economy. In reference to the Labour amendment, he says there is a piece of work coming soon on foreign direct investment. He acknowledges Willie Rennie's point about anchoring businesses. Tory MSP Jamie Halcro Johnstone highlights issues relating to infrastructure, noting that A86 dualling is still being planned and airlinks are expensive. The Scottish government's 2011 economic strategy missed its export target ""by a wide margin"" the Tory MSP adds. He calls for ministers to focus resources on areas that will support businesses in exporting. Mr Halcro Johnston goes on to highlight that Scotland's biggest trading partner is other parts on the UK, adding this supports hundreds of thousands of jobs. Labour MSP James Kelly calls for the export strategy to take more account of low wages and other issues affecting workers. He goes on to say there is a real problem with skills gaps, noting for example there has been a drop in the number of computer science students in schools. Brexit and leaving the customs union is a threat to export growth, the Labour MSP states. He accuses the Scottish government of embarking on a ""vanity project"" in the Referendums Bill, suggesting it wastes money at a time when more measures are needed to support the economy. Concluding for the Scottish Greens, co-convenor Patrick Harvie says Scotland's export plan can only be achieved through international co-operation such as EU membership. He says the Tory party are ""economic nationalists"" and argues they should abandon their Brexit obsession and engage positively with ideas about how to modernise and change the UK. Whatever people see as the benefits of trade, ""there will be no jobs on a dead planet"", Mr Harvie says. The Green approach is not anti-trade, he argues, but the focus needs to move towards renewables and digital technology industries. One of the terms that keeps cropping up in the Brexit debate is ""the WTO option"". If the UK left the European Union without a deal, it would automatically fall back on World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. So what would that mean? Find out here. The value of goods exported by firms in Scotland rose by 5.6% last year to Â£30.3bn, according to new HMRC figures. The percentage increase was higher than any other part of the UK. Exports from England rose by 2.1%, while Wales and Northern Ireland saw rises of 4.2% and 1.9% respectively. The top five Scottish exports were mineral fuels (Â£10.2bn), machinery and transport (Â£7.2bn), beverages and tobacco (Â£4.3bn), chemicals (Â£2.5bn) and manufactured goods (Â£2bn). Read more here. Douglas FraserScotland business & economy editor Food and drink exports to the EU have been growing Scotland's economy has been growing more interlinked with that of the European Union as a whole since the Brexit referendum. That's according to a report by the Fraser of Allander Institute, which updates an analysis carried out for the GMB union and published in November 2017. That previous report showed 135,000 jobs were linked to demand from the European Union for Scottish exports. That relates to Â£14.9bn-worth of goods and services sold to the other 27 member states. The update, published by GMB on Monday, shows a further 9,000 jobs are tied to that trade, taking it to 144,000. Read more here. Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie welcomes the export plan published by the government, particularly its focus on different sectors. However, there are two big shadows over efforts to increase exports he warns: Brexit and indyref2. We must ensure we meet our export targets and also anchor businesses in this country, he argues. The best anchor is the quality of the Scottish workforce, Mr Rennie adds. Scottish Greens co-convenor Patrick Harvie bemoans how long-term economic strategy gives ""undue primacy"" to ""narrow metrics"" like GDP. De-growth is an urgent debate the world needs to be having, he says, when ""we are killing the living world around us"". Ever-lasting growth in our economy is not only causing these problems, it is unsustainable, Mr Harvie maintains. I regret the government's target is framed purely in terms of percentage growth in GDP, he adds. Labour MSP Rhoda Grant says the Scottish government missed its previous target in export growth. The largest number of businesses in Scotland are small businesses which are less likely to export than larger ones, she says. The export report does not highlight that the majority of firms which do export are not Scottish-owned, adds the Labour MSP. Ms Grant insists the Scottish government must ""end all talk"" of indyref2 because it would do more damage than Brexit. Tory MSP Dean Lockhart says export performance in the past decade has failed to meet targets by Â£22bn. Figures show that after 12 years of SNP government Scotland has not achieved its potential to become a first tier trading nation, he argues. He believes the fundamental flaw to the SNP's approach is its plan to introduce a new currency. How does this help business plan for the future, he asks. In January we reported the value of exports from Scotland had grown by Â£4bn in 2017, up 5% on the previous year, according to new estimates. Total exports from Scotland, excluding oil and gas, rose to Â£81.4bn - including Â£48.9bn to the rest of the UK, and Â£32.4bn of international sales. Scottish Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said the figures were ""great news"" and highlighted the growth in international exports. Scottish Secretary David Mundell said trade within the UK was ""essential"". Both politicians used the figures to make arguments about constitutional politics, with Mr Mackay warning of the ""risk"" of a no-deal Brexit and Mr Mundell arguing against Scottish independence.

He encourages members to engage with businesses in their constituencies to ensure they are aware of the trade plan. More than 100 actions have been identified in the plan which we will work to deliver upon in the coming months, he says. These include encouraging peer-to-peer relationships, the international trade partnership and expanding the GlobalScot network, Mr McKee explains. The minister says increasing exports will increase the tax revenue, thus generating more to spend on public services. We want to increase our internationalisation despite Brexit and support businesses on that journey, he concludes.

"Endgame has taken more than $2.7bn globally A number of US media giants have publicly stated they will reconsider filming in Georgia if the state's strict new abortion law takes effect. Disney, Netflix and WarnerMedia have all objected to the legislation, which would ban abortion after a foetal heartbeat can be detected. The so-called ""heartbeat bill"" has caused a furious backlash in Hollywood and led to calls for a boycott. Georgia makes billions of dollars from film and television productions. The state's bill seeks to make abortion illegal as soon as a foetal heartbeat is detectable. In most cases, this is at the six-week mark of a pregnancy - before many women even know they are pregnant. It is one of a number of states to pass abortion restrictions in the past year, but they are expected to face legal challenges. US state's abortion law fuels boycott call What's behind Georgia's anti-abortion 'heartbeat bill'? Emotional abortion stories shared with #youknowme Bob Iger, the CEO of Disney says the law would make it ""difficult"" for the company to keep filming there. Blockbusters like Black Panther and Avengers: Endgame, were recently shot in the state, due to its generous tax breaks for film productions. However, Mr Iger said ""many people who work for us will not want to work there"" should the law go into effect. ""We will have to heed their wishes,"" he told Reuters. WarnerMedia meanwhile said it would reconsider Georgia ""if the new law holds"", after Netflix announced on Tuesday it would ""rethink"" its productions in the state should the law take effect. Jason Bateman and Kristen Wiig have both condemned the new law, which effectively bans abortion Earlier this week, Netflix said it would ""rethink"" its operations there with chief content officer Ted Sarandos explaining: ""We have many women working on productions in Georgia, whose rights, along with millions of others, will be severely restricted by this law,"" He said the streaming giant would ""work with the ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] and others to fight it in court."" Meanwhile, stars including Amy Schumer, Ben Stiller, Christina Applegate, Laverne Cox and Alec Baldwinwrote to the governor,externalsaying they would ""do everything in our power to move our industry to a safer state for women"". Comedy actress and writer Kristen Wiig also confirmed to CNN thather new comedy had pulled out of filming in the state,externalwhile the executive producers of a new Amazon show The Power said it was no longer scouting for filming locations in Georgia because of the controversial bill. Actor Jason Bateman, who stars in the Netflix show Ozark and in HBO's The Outsider, which are both currently filming in Georgia, told The Hollywood Reporter: ""I will not work in Georgia, or any other state, that is so disgracefully at odds with women's rights"". ""Right now we are watching it very carefully,"" said Disney's Bob Iger, adding he didn't ""see how it's practical for us to continue to shoot there."" Georgia was used as a location for Black Panther Disney's prospective withdrawal would be a huge blow to the state. Recently, Disney's Marvel Studios filmed portions of both Black Panther and Avengers: Endgame in Georgia. Georgia - which offers up to 30% tax breaks - has become a magnet for film and TV productions, employing more than 90,000 people. Website Film LAanalysed a sample of the 100 top-grossing feature films,externalreleased at the US box office in 2017 and found Georgia was tied for second place, behind California, as a location with the UK, each with 15 films in the top 100 in 2017. British location manager Steve Mortimore has worked with both Disney and Netflix and scouted for films including World War Z, the forthcoming Wonder Woman sequel and Ridley Scott's All The Money in the World. He told the BBC the clash over Georgia's abortion law could have ""massive ramifications"". Aside from Georgia's generous tax breaks for filmmakers, he said, ""they have trained so many people to work in the industry, and so many experts have moved there who will have to move away again"". Steve Mortimore scouted Glasgow as a stand-in for Philadelphia on World War Z, starring Brad Pitt Speaking about Disney and Netflix's threats to pull out of Georgia entirely, he told the BBC: ""I'd be surprised if they went ahead and pulled out unless they had a plan B or C. ""Those big Marvel films, they need huge spaces, 100,000 to 150,000 sq ft sound stages with all the facilities and they are limited. I know that Europe is absolutely fully booked up, there isn't anywhere else"". In 2014, the British-based Pinewood studios opened Pinewood Atlanta, spanning 700 acres and providing 18 sound stages. It has declined to comment on the news reports, but Mortimore said it could be be ""very painful for them"". He claimed that London has now displaced Hollywood as the film industry's new capital, adding ""the space just isn't available, people are queuing to film [in the UK] for the next three or four years"". ""It's an opportunity for somewhere else,"" he said. ""Maybe LA can step in. They have huge TV productions but its a chance to stick their flag in the sand and say they are a major hub for movies again, which they lost to London."" Recent productions based in Georgia include: Godzilla: King of Monsters, Ant-Man and the Wasp, Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, Black Panther, Pitch Perfect 3, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, Spider-Man: Homecoming, Stranger Things, Ozark and The Walking Dead. It is one of several US states to pass new, stricter laws on abortion, the latest being Louisiana. The new law prevents abortions in almost all circumstances once an embryonic heartbeat can be detected. Critics have pointed at what they see as an orchestrated challenge to a decades-old US Supreme Court ruling that protected a woman's right to choose an abortion.

"The proportion of low-paid workers in Britain has fallen to its lowest level since 1980, a think tank has said, with young adults particularly benefitting. The number of low-paid workers dropped by 200,000 last year, with 120,000 of them aged between 21 and 30, the Resolution Foundation said. It said the introduction of the National Living Wage had ""significantly"" reduced low pay. Chancellor Philip Hammond has declared an ambition to eliminate low pay. ""The chancellor and the Labour Party have both announced ambitious plans for its future, either of which would result in the UK having one of the highest minimum wage rates in the world,"" the report said. The charity the Living Wage Foundation says the wage level needed to ""meet the costs of living"" isÂ£9 an hour across the UK and Â£10.55 an hour in London,external. Low pay is considered to be hourly pay below two-thirds of the median average across the country. This is the equivalent of Â£8.52 an hour. The National Living Wage is lower than this, but the Resolution Foundation said the NLW had a beneficial knock-on effect to other low-paid workers. The Foundation said that, in 2018, there were 4.7 million employees on low pay, 17.2% of the total. This was the lowest proportion since 1980, and the lowest number since 1997. ""Clearly, the UK still has a significant low pay problem, but it is a problem that is getting smaller after many years of stubbornly refusing to do so,"" the report said. Some 2.8 million (60%) of the 4.7 million low-paid employees in 2018 were women. Owing to the fact they were more likely to be low-paid than men, they saw a greater benefit from the shift to better pay. The number of low-paid women fell by 133,000 between 2017 and 2018. Minimum wage rates rise, but bills go up too Female unemployment rate lowest since 1971 Inequality driving 'deaths of despair' The biggest falls (110,000) in terms of the type of job were said to have taken place in administrative and support services, and the retail sector. The think tank said raising the living wage to a level which would end low pay, by setting it at two-thirds of median hourly earnings for workers aged 25 and over, would represent a further ""huge change"" to the labour market. ""An ambitious but cautious approach that saw the National Living Wage (NLW) continue to rise after 2020 - at a faster pace than the minimum wage has increased over its 20-year history would put Britain on course to eliminate low pay in the middle of the 2020s, while still giving the government room for manoeuvre if economic conditions change,"" said the report's author Nye Cominetti. Mr Hammond said that the NLW would be the equivalent of 60% of median average earnings by next year, and that he was ""naturally attracted"" to getting that to 66% in the future, thus eliminating low pay. Labour recently said it would extend its plans for a higher Â£10-an-hour minimum wage to include workers under the age of 18, if it were in government. Currently, under-18s are entitled to a minimum wage of Â£4.35 per hour, compared with Â£8.21 for those aged 25 and over. The National Living Wage is the legally binding hourly rate for workers aged 25 and over The real living wage was devised by charity the Living Wage Foundation. It argues the government's National Living Wage is not high enough to meet workers' needs and encourages employers to adopt its more generous, independently calculated rate Katherine Chapman, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said: ""It's positive to see some measures of low pay fall, but there are still around six million jobs paying less than the real living wage - the only rate that's calculated based on what it costs to live. That's millions of families struggling to keep their heads above water, squeezed by rising household bills."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""The government should raise the minimum wage to Â£10 per hour as soon as possible, and young workers, who are most likely to be stuck on low pay, must be given the same rate for the job."" Craig Caldwell works in the retail sector in roles paying the minimum wage and says it is hard work to make ends meet as in his current job he has a guarantee of 7.5 hours a week and the most he has worked in a week is 14 hours. He has turned to Christians against Poverty for help with his debts. ""Bills stack up and over time it gets really hard. For me the problem is paying bills. Your debts mount up because you haven't paid them one month, something else needs paying the next month. You've the rent, the council tax which you have to keep paying, when you're adding food and everything else it becomes a drag"". If he had full-time work on the minimum wage, he could survive - just. ""I wouldn't live like a king"". ""I'm averaging maybe Â£90, Â£100 a week. Universal credit is making it to Â£560 a month,"" he says, but after Â£350 a month of rent that does not leave much to pay off bills. A higher minimum wage ""in theory"" would help but he fears that other prices would go up too - and hours could be cut back. ""If (companies) were paying an extra 10% on a wage they will cut 10% of the hours. People are going to end up with less hours so the extra money won't materialise. ""The only solution is going to be protecting the rights of people on minimum wages"". Mr Hammond was asked on the BBC's Today programme whether the minimum wage should continue to rise after 2020. ""We would only do that if we can be confident that we can do that without damaging the employment prospects of people with lower skills,"" says Mr Hammond. He said initial fears in the 1990s that the minimum wage would cost jobs had not been realised, but said that did not necessarily mean further increases would not be damaging, so he has commissioned a review. ""The key challenge is to support businesses so they can raise their productivity performance as the wages of their employees rise,"" he says. ""Then you get a virtuous circle, where increases in the minimum wage incentivises improvements in productivity, which in turn allows employers to to pay higher wages still.""

"BMW's mini factory in Oxford was closed during April to prepare for a Brexit which didn't happen Factory shutdowns designed to cope with disruption from a 29 March Brexit, slashed UK car production in April by almost a half. Even though Brexit is delayed the factories still closed and production fell 44.5% according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). In what it called ""an extraordinary month"", the SMMT said only 70,971 cars rolled off production lines. That was 56,999 fewer than in April a year ago. Production for both home and overseas markets fell by 43.7% and 44.7% respectively. The SMMT said car firms had brought forward their annual stoppages normally scheduled for the summer holidays. It said the shutting of factories was part of a raft of costly measures, including stockpiling, training for new customs procedures and rerouting of logistics. It said the factories would not be able to repeat the process for the new 31 October Brexit deadline set by the European Union. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: ""Today's figures are evidence of the vast cost and upheaval Brexit uncertainty has already wrought on UK automotive manufacturing businesses and workers. ""Prolonged instability has done untold damage, with the fear of 'no deal' holding back progress, causing investment to stall, jobs to be lost and undermining our global reputation."" The stoppages in the factories have exacerbated a continuing slow down in the global car industry caused by the trade tensions between the US and China, uncertainties over the arrival of electric and self driving cars, and tougher environmental controls after the VW emissions scandal. April was the 11th consecutive month of output falls in the UK. In the year to date, 127,240 fewer cars have been built compared with the same period in 2018 - a decline of more than a fifth. The SMMT estimated production for the whole of 2019 would be about 10% down on last year. It said the market might pick up by the end of the year if there was a favourable deal between the UK and the EU and a substantial transition period to adapt to trading outside the single market. But it said a no-deal Brexit would make the declines worse with the threat of border delays, production stoppages and additional costs. UK car output hit by China slowdown What's behind the car industry crisis? Car sales see biggest fall since 2008 Mr Hawes said: ""This is why 'no deal' must be taken off the table immediately and permanently, so industry can get back to the business of delivering for the economy and keeping the UK at the forefront of the global technology race."" The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""The Government wants to see the UK automotive sector continue to grow and attract further investment. ""Through our modern industrial strategy we continue to invest in the future of our automotive industry, including Â£1bn for research and development into cleaner vehicles, and the Faraday Battery Challenge to develop the next generation of car battery technologies in the UK.""

"Parents have been warned to stop using eight child stair gates being sold in the UK, by a consumer group which says they failed its safety tests. Which? tested 12 gates and said eight failed to meet EU safety standards. Two of the tests are designed to establish the risk of the gates being dislodged by children rattling, shoving or kicking them. One stair gate, the Mothercare Wooden Wall Fix, failed both of those tests and has since been withdrawn from sale. For the ""impact resistance test"", the products were hit by a 10kg (22lbs) weight -roughly the average weight of a 15-month-old boy.,externalAny gate that moved more than 2.5cm (1in) from its starting point failed the test. The Mothercare gate, along with the Cuggl Wooden Extending gate, withstood just one impact before failing. The Cuggl Auto Close failed after just two impacts. Mothercare said the gate had been removed from sale ""as a precaution"" while it conducted further investigations but it complied with ""the required safety regulations"". The Mothercare Wooden Wall Fix gate has been withdrawn from sale after failing Which?'s tests Cuggl said in a statement: ""No issues with these products have been identified but we are investigating these results with our supplier."" The 12 products were also put through the ""fatigue test"" which involved a mechanical arm being clamped to the top of the gate and pulling it back and forth 10,000 times - designed to mimic the actions of a toddler shaking and rattling the gate over time. The Mothercare Wooden Wall Fix also failed this Which? test (after 6,738 attempts), as did the Lindam Sure Shut Orto (417), the Dreambaby Chelsea (1,456), the Dreambaby Liberty (2,727), the BabyDan Perfect Close (2,134), and the BabyDan Premier True Pressure (6,600). However, Which? found that the BabyDan Perfect Close and the two Dreambaby gates both passed the test when they were secured to the wall using screws as well as adhesive pads. People with these safety gates should secure theirs in this way if possible, according to the watchdog, or stop using them. Which? said parents should immediately stop using all of the other stair gates that failed its testing, adding that they should also be withdrawn from sale. It is the second time in less than a year that Which? has discovered safety issues with stair gates - three othersfailed the fatigue test in October 2018. Natalie Hitchins, Which?'s head of home products and services, said: ""It's deeply concerning that so many stair gates have failed our testing. ""The safety of children should be the number one priority, but too many are being put at an unacceptable level of risk."" Dreambaby said it disputed Which?'s findings and ""considers them invalid"". Munchkin, the company that owns Lindam, said it was not aware of any evidence supporting the allegations but would continue to monitor its products. BabyDan said all its safety gates complied with the relevant safety standards. Which? said it had reported its findings to Trading Standards and the Office for Product Safety and Standards.

"Women studying maths at Oxford and men taking economics at Bristol get the biggest increase in earnings from going to university, says an analysis of salaries at the age of 29. The study, from the Department for Education and Institute for Fiscal Studies, says women are much more likely to gain from getting a degree. Women with a degree earn on average 28% more than non-graduate women. Men with degrees earn an average of 8% more than non-graduates. But a third of men go to universities which give them only a ""negligible"" pay advantage, despite the cost of fees. The lowest for earnings for men is studying philosophy at Sussex - and for women it is computing at Westminster. The report, based on tax records of people who went to school in England and then went to university in England, Wales or Scotland,looks at how going to university might affect earnings,external. Setting aside any social benefits, it's asking if it's worth the cash, when graduates are leaving with an average of Â£50,000 of debt. A woman with a degree on average earns Â£6,700 more per year than a non-graduate woman - with women improving their earnings for almost every course at every university. But the difference is much narrower for men, with a male graduate on average earning Â£2,700 more than a non-graduate. There are tougher questions for the one-third of men who go to universities which give ""negligible or negative impact"" on earnings compared with those without a degree. Are they getting value for money? The report says getting a degree is clearly an ""excellent investment"" for women, because their earnings are so much higher than non-graduate women. Much of this is because women without degrees are particularly likely to be low earners - and so the gap between them and graduates is likely to be wider. This could be because women without degrees are likely to be in particularly low-paid jobs. But another factor is that non-graduate women in their 20s are twice as likely to be working part-time as women with degrees. This could be because women who do not go to university tend to have children earlier than graduate women. So the big gains for women described in the report could include comparisons between full-time graduate earnings and those non-graduates working part-time. The report shows there is a huge difference in likely earnings depending on the subject studied. At the top end of the pay scale are medicine, economics, maths, business and law. Women studying medicine can expect to earn 78% more than non-graduate women. At the lower end are subjects such as creative arts, philosophy and English. Men taking these subjects are likely to get ""negative"" returns - as on average they will earn less than their male counterparts who did not go to university. For men taking creative arts, they can expect 14% less than non-graduates. There are significant earnings premiums for those at the top of the table - with women getting the best returns from four London universities - the LSE, Imperial, King's College London and the School of Oriental and African Studies - and Oxford. Bristol and Cambridge are added to the list of high earners for male students. At the bottom, for male graduates, are modern universities, such as Bath Spa, or colleges which also deliver further education, such as Leeds City. Almost all women are at universities which will boost their pay - although Bolton is an exception and is ranked lowest. It might not seem that surprising that modern universities do less well in future earnings. It might also be predictable that arts-based institutions get lower earnings, such as Ravensbourne, Goldsmiths and the University of the Arts. But there might be scrutiny of the scale of universities where there are negative outcomes - 26 institutions where male earnings are on average less than non-graduates and 39 where the returns are less than 2%. Essex, Hull, Leicester, Sussex, Keele and Bradford all have an earnings premium below 10% for male students. If you put together the subject and university choice you can see the extremes of high and low-earning courses. For women, maths at Oxford is the highest, followed by economics at the LSE. Economics at University College London gives a big return, as does medicine at Imperial. In fact, the highest earners are a narrow combination of maths, law, medicine, physics and economics taken at a handful of top universities. It's very similar for male graduates, headed by economics at Bristol and physics at Oxford. For women, the lowest paying is computing at Westminster. Psychology at Bolton is in the bottom five. But showing how much the course can drive the outcome, creative arts at Cambridge is among the least likely to deliver high earnings. For men, philosophy at Sussex is ranked as offering the lowest rate of return - and studying languages at Oxford is also in the bottom five for male earnings. The Universities Minister Sam Gyimah says that more transparency is vital to make sure that young people make informed choices about university places. This will help them to think about getting value for money from their degree. He also wants this to ""shine a light"" on courses that seem to deliver such a low rate of return. Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Half of university tuition fees spent on teaching The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't But in the background, the big political context is a review considering the future of tuition fees in England. This latest report could raise some very awkward questions. Is it reasonable to charge students Â£9,500 regardless of course or university when there are such different outcomes in earnings? And is it sustainable to have such a high level of fee and debt, when for so many, particularly men, the returns can be marginal or non-existent? Half of tuition fees spent on teaching Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Tuition fees cut to Â£6,500 but higher for science?

"Parents have been warned to stop using eight child stair gates being sold in the UK, by a consumer group which says they failed its safety tests. Which? tested 12 gates and said eight failed to meet EU safety standards. Two of the tests are designed to establish the risk of the gates being dislodged by children rattling, shoving or kicking them. One stair gate, the Mothercare Wooden Wall Fix, failed both of those tests and has since been withdrawn from sale. For the ""impact resistance test"", the products were hit by a 10kg (22lbs) weight -roughly the average weight of a 15-month-old boy.,externalAny gate that moved more than 2.5cm (1in) from its starting point failed the test. The Mothercare gate, along with the Cuggl Wooden Extending gate, withstood just one impact before failing. The Cuggl Auto Close failed after just two impacts. Mothercare said the gate had been removed from sale ""as a precaution"" while it conducted further investigations but it complied with ""the required safety regulations"". The Mothercare Wooden Wall Fix gate has been withdrawn from sale after failing Which?'s tests Cuggl said in a statement: ""No issues with these products have been identified but we are investigating these results with our supplier."" The 12 products were also put through the ""fatigue test"" which involved a mechanical arm being clamped to the top of the gate and pulling it back and forth 10,000 times - designed to mimic the actions of a toddler shaking and rattling the gate over time. The Mothercare Wooden Wall Fix also failed this Which? test (after 6,738 attempts), as did the Lindam Sure Shut Orto (417), the Dreambaby Chelsea (1,456), the Dreambaby Liberty (2,727), the BabyDan Perfect Close (2,134), and the BabyDan Premier True Pressure (6,600). However, Which? found that the BabyDan Perfect Close and the two Dreambaby gates both passed the test when they were secured to the wall using screws as well as adhesive pads. People with these safety gates should secure theirs in this way if possible, according to the watchdog, or stop using them. Which? said parents should immediately stop using all of the other stair gates that failed its testing, adding that they should also be withdrawn from sale. It is the second time in less than a year that Which? has discovered safety issues with stair gates - three othersfailed the fatigue test in October 2018. Natalie Hitchins, Which?'s head of home products and services, said: ""It's deeply concerning that so many stair gates have failed our testing. ""The safety of children should be the number one priority, but too many are being put at an unacceptable level of risk."" Dreambaby said it disputed Which?'s findings and ""considers them invalid"". Munchkin, the company that owns Lindam, said it was not aware of any evidence supporting the allegations but would continue to monitor its products. BabyDan said all its safety gates complied with the relevant safety standards. Which? said it had reported its findings to Trading Standards and the Office for Product Safety and Standards.

"There have been many different attempts to improve vocational skills Skills training in England has been undermined by ""short-term, disjointed and inconsistent"" policies, says the City and Guilds training body. Chief executive Chris Jones blamed a constant churn of initiatives and announcements from politicians wanting to be ""seen to be doing something"". He warned that spending on the new vocational T-levels could be wasted. But Education Secretary Damian Hinds has called on businesses to back the new T-level qualifications. There have been warnings about skills gaps and weaknesses in vocational training, but Mr Jones says it is ""deeply concerning"" that ""policy is not driving any sustainable improvement in raising skills"". He said there had been a high turnover of ministers with responsibility for skills - 70 in 35 years - with each tempted to launch another initiative. There have been warnings of skills shortages and the need to improve training ""Ministers think structural change is not only easy to implement - but I'll be seen to be doing something and I can claim something better will come from it,"" he says. But implementation is often ""fundamentally flawed"", says Mr Jones, head of the City and Guilds group, one of the longest-established bodies for accrediting crafts, trades and skills. ""Either a change of government cancels it or we haven't been clear at the outset what we were trying to achieve,"" says Mr Jones. The outcome, he warns is that too many ""badly-needed training and education programmes are not fit for purpose"". Vocational skills backed in review expected to cut tuition fees Institutes of Technology to boost skills training Craft workers should have their own titles First colleges to teach new T-levels Mr Jones, launching a report called Sense and Instability, wants a more independent body for skills policy, with a long-term, strategic approach and less political interference. The latest proposed change is the launch of T-levels, which are intended to be the vocational equivalent of A-levels. Mr Jones supports the principle of a high status vocational qualification, but he says that beyond ""warm words"" it is not clear what will make them successful or provide value for money. City and Guilds is one of the longest established bodies for trades and crafts Previous sets of qualifications, such as diplomas, were launched and then cancelled, and he says he wants a more objective approach to T-levels, rather than rhetoric. ""You cannot claim it to be a 'gold standard'. That is a hollow statement and is totally unsubstantiated,"" says Mr Jones. He warns of too much emphasis on volume targets such as numbers of learners, rather than the quality or purpose of qualifications. Too often with vocational and training initiatives, he says it is difficult to know whether hundreds of millions of pounds are ""going to waste"". Skills policy needs a more strategic approach, says Chris Jones, chief executive of City and Guilds. He says the lack of progress is frustrating for employers facing skills shortages, with warning of potentially ""devastating"" consequences for the UK's economy. A Department for Education spokeswoman says that T-levels ""represent the biggest shake up to technical education in a generation"". The new qualifications are designed to ""help businesses to build the skilled workforce they need for the future"". This weekend, the education secretary called on businesses to help create opportunities for young people to get work experience, as part of their T-levels. He promised Â£7m to support work-experience projects, for the qualifications being rolled out from September 2020. ""The completion of a high-quality industry placement will be at the heart of every T-level and is part of what will set these new courses apart from every attempt to reform technical and vocational education in the past 70 years,"" said Mr Hinds. ""To make a success of T-levels, we need businesses working in partnership with us and colleges. ""Industry placements will help young people build the confidence and skills they need to get a head start in their careers and they'll help business maximise their talent pipeline for the future.""
