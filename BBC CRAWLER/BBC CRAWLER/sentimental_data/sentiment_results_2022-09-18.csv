Here, where Queen Elizabeth was married and crowned, we gather from across the nation, from the Commonwealth, and from the nations of the world, to mourn our loss, to remember her long life of selfless service, and in sure confidence to commit her to the mercy of God our maker and redeemer. With gratitude we remember her unswerving commitment to a high calling over so many years as Queen and Head of the Commonwealth. With admiration we recall her life-long sense of duty and dedication to her people. With thanksgiving we praise God for her constant example of Christian faith and devotion. With affection we recall her love for her family and her commitment to the causes she held dear. ""Now, in silence, let us in our hearts and minds recall our many reasons for thanksgiving, pray for all members of her family, and commend Queen Elizabeth to the care and keeping of almighty God. O merciful God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who is the resurrection and the life; in whom whosoever believeth shall live, though he die; and whosoever liveth, and believeth in him, shall not die eternally; who hast taught us, by his holy Apostle Saint Paul, not to be sorry, as men without hope, for them that sleep in him: We meekly beseech thee, O Father, to raise us from the death of sin unto the life of righteousness; that, when we shall depart this life, we may rest in him, as our hope is this our sister doth; and that, at the general Resurrection in the last day, we may be found acceptable in thy sight; and receive that blessing, which thy well-beloved Son shall then pronounce to all that love and fear thee, saying, Come, ye blessed children of my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world. Grant this, we beseech thee, O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ, our mediator and redeemer. Amen. All sang the hymn St Clement The day thou gavest, Lord, is ended, the darkness falls at thy behest; to thee our morning hymns ascended, thy praise shall sanctify our rest. We thank thee that thy Church unsleeping, while earth rolls onward into light, through all the world her watch is keeping, and rests not now by day or night. As o'er each continent and island the dawn leads on another day, the voice of prayer is never silent, nor dies the strain of praise away. The sun that bids us rest is waking our brethren 'neath the western sky, and hour by hour fresh lips are making thy wondrous doings heard on high. So be it, Lord; thy throne shall never, like earth's proud empires, pass away; thy kingdom stands, and grows for ever, till all thy creatures own thy sway. John Ellerton (1826-93) Clement Scholefield (1839-1904) arranged by James O'Donnell (b 1961) The Right Honourable the Baroness Scotland of Asthal KC, Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, read the first lesson: Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept. For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own order: Christ the first fruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming. Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.1 Corinthians 15: 20-26, 53-end A specially commissioned piece was sung by the choir. It was a setting of Psalm 42 to music composed by the Master of The King's Music, Judith Weir: Like as the hart desireth the water-brooks: so longeth my soul after thee, O God. My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God : when shall I come to appear before the presence of God? My tears have been my meat day and night: while they daily say unto me, Where is now thy God? Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself: for I went with the multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God; In the voice of praise and thanksgiving: among such as keep holy-day. Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul : and why art thou so disquieted within me? Put thy trust in God: for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his countenance. Prime Minister Liz Truss read the second lesson: Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father.John 14: 1-9a All sang the hymn 'The Lord's my shepherd' - which was was also sung at Prince Philip and the Queen's wedding in 1947: The Lord's my shepherd, I'll not want; he makes me down to lie in pastures green; he leadeth me the quiet waters by. My soul he doth restore again, and me to walk doth make within the paths of righteousness, e'en for his own name's sake. Yea, though I walk through death's dark vale, yet will I fear none ill; for thou art with me, and thy rod and staff me comfort still. My table thou hast furnished in presence of my foes; my head thou dost with oil anoint, and my cup overflows. Goodness and mercy all my life shall surely follow me; and in God's house for evermore my dwelling place shall be.Psalm 23, attributed to Jessie Seymour Irvine (1836-87) harmony by David Grant (1833-93) descant by William Baird Ross (1871-1950) The sermonwas delivered by the Most Reverend and Right Honourable Justin Welby Archbishop of Canterbury, Primate of All England and Metropolitan. The choir sang the Anthem: My soul, there is a country Far beyond the stars, Where stands a wingÃ¨d sentry All skilful in the wars: There above noise, and danger, Sweet Peace sits crowned with smiles, And One born in a manger Commands the beauteous files. He is thy gracious friend, And (O my soul, awake!) Did in pure love  descend, To die here for thy sake. If thou canst get but thither, There grows the flower of Peace, The Rose that cannot wither, Thy fortress, and thy ease. Leave then thy foolish ranges, For none can thee secure, But One who never changes, Thy God, thy Life, thy Cure.From Songs of Farewell, Hubert Parry (1848-1918), by Henry Vaughan (1621-95) The prayers The Reverend Mark Birch, Minor Canon and Precentor, lead the prayers from the High Altar: In confidence and trust, let us pray to the Father. The Reverend Dr Iain Greenshields, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, said: Let us give thanks to God for Queen Elizabeth's long life and reign, recalling with gratitude her gifts of wisdom, diligence, and service. O God, from whom cometh everything that is upright and true: accept our thanks for the gifts of heart and mind that thou didst bestow upon thy daughter Elizabeth, and which she showed forth among us in her words and deeds; and grant that we may have grace to live our lives in accordance with thy will, to seek the good of others, and to remain faithful servants unto our lives' end; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. Ms Shermara Fletcher, Principal Officer for Pentecostal and Charismatic Relations, Churches Together in England, said: Confident in God's love and compassion, let us pray for all those whose hearts are heavy with grief and sorrow. Almighty God, Father of all mercies and giver of all comfort: deal graciously, we pray thee, with those who mourn, that casting every care on thee, they may know the consolation of thy love; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. The Right Reverend and Right Honourable Dame Sarah Mullally DBE, Bishop of London and Dean of His Majesty's Chapels Royal, said: Let us pray for His Majesty The King and all the Royal Family; that they may know the sustaining power of God's love and the prayerful fellowship of God's people. Almighty God, the fountain of all goodness, we humbly beseech thee to bless our most gracious Sovereign Lord King Charles, Camilla The Queen Consort, William Prince of Wales, and all the Royal Family: endue them with thy Holy Spirit, enrich them with thy heavenly grace; prosper them with all happiness; and bring them to thine everlasting kingdom; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. The Reverend Canon Helen Cameron, Moderator of the Free Churches Group, said: In recognition of Queen Elizabeth's service to this United Kingdom, let us rejoice in her unstinting devotion to duty, her compassion for her subjects, and her counsel to her ministers; and we pray for the continued health and prosperity of this Nation. O almighty God, whose will it is that all thy children should serve thee in serving one another: look with love, we pray thee, on this Nation. Grant to its citizens grace to work together with honest and faithful hearts, each caring for the good of all; that, seeking first thy kingdom and its righteousness, they may possess all things needful for their daily sustenance and the common good; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. His Eminence Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, said: Let us give thanks for Queen Elizabeth's commitment to the Commonwealth throughout her reign, for her service and dedication to its peoples, and for the rich bonds of unity and mutual support she sustained. Almighty and everlasting God, hear our prayer for the Commonwealth, and grant it the guidance of thy wisdom. Inspire those in authority, that they may promote justice and the common good; give to all its citizens the spirit of mutual honour and respect; and grant to us all grace to strive for the establishment of righteousness and peace; for the honour of thy name. Amen. The Most Reverend and Right Honourable Stephen Cottrell, Archbishop of York, Primate of England and Metropolitan, said: We give thanks to God for Queen Elizabeth's loyalty to the faith she inherited through her baptism and confirmation, and affirmed at her coronation; for her unswerving devotion to the Gospel; and for her steadfast service as Supreme Governor of the Church of England. Lord, we beseech thee to keep thy household the Church in continual godliness; that through thy protection she may be free from all adversities, and devoutly given to serve thee in all good works, to the glory of thy name; through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen. The Precentor said: Let us pray that we may be given grace to live as those who believe in the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, and the resurrection to eternal life. Bring us, O Lord God, at our last awakening into the house and gate of heaven, to enter into that gate and dwell in that house, where there shall be no darkness nor dazzling, but one equal light; no noise nor silence, but one equal music; no fears nor hopes, but one equal possession; no ends nor beginnings, but one equal eternity; in the habitation of thy glory and dominion, world without end. Amen.John Donne (1572-1631) The choir sang 'O Taste and see how gracious the Lord is', composed by Ralph Vaughan Williams for the Queen's Coronation in 1953. The Precentor concluded: In confidence and hope, let us pray to the Father in the words our Saviour taught us, Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name; thy kingdom come; thy will be done; on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever. Amen. All stood to sing the hymn Blaenwern: Love divine, all loves excelling, joy of heaven, to earth come down, fix in us thy humble dwelling, all thy faithful mercies crown. Jesu, thou art all compassion, pure unbounded love thou art; visit us with thy salvation, enter every trembling heart. Come, almighty to deliver, let us all thy life receive; suddenly return, and never, never more thy temples leave. Thee we would be always blessing, serve thee as thy hosts above, pray, and praise thee, without ceasing, glory in thy perfect love. Finish then thy new creation, pure and spotless let us be; let us see thy great salvation, perfectly restored in thee, changed from glory into glory till in heaven we take our place, till we cast our crowns before thee, lost in wonder, love, and praise!Charles Wesley (1707-88) William Rowlands (1860-1937) arranged by James O'Donnell The Commendation, given by the Archbishop of Canterbury: Let us commend to the mercy of God, our maker and redeemer, the soul of Elizabeth, our late Queen. Heavenly Father, King of kings, Lord and giver of life, who of thy grace in creation didst form mankind in thine own image, and in thy great love offerest us life eternal in Christ Jesus; claiming the promises of thy most blessed Son, we entrust the soul of Elizabeth, our sister here departed, to thy merciful keeping, in sure and certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life, when Christ shall be all in all; who died and rose again to save us, and now liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, in glory for ever. Amen. Go forth, O Christian soul, from this world, in the name of God the Father almighty, who created thee; in the name of Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, who suffered for thee; in the name of the Holy Spirit, who was poured out upon thee and anointed thee. In communion with all the blessed saints, and aided by the angels and archangels and all the armies of the heavenly host, may thy portion this day be in peace, and thy dwelling in the heavenly Jerusalem. Amen. Anthem - the choir sings Romans 8: 35a, 38b-end, composed for this Service by Sir James MacMillan CBE (b 1959) Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?

"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the Queen told her she had to ""just get on with it"" when asked for advice about being both a leader and a new mother. In 2018, Ms Ardern became only the second elected head of government to give birth while in office. Speaking to the BBC, she also reiterated a belief that New Zealand would one day become a republic. Ms Ardern is one of hundreds of leaders in London ahead of the Queen's funeral. Appearing on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, she was shown footage of her first meeting with the Queen, which took place when she was pregnant. Asked about the conversation during that meeting, Ms Ardern said: ""One of the things on my mind alongside being a new prime minister was being a prime minister and a mum. ""And when you think about leaders who have been in that position..., there were so few to look to. ""So I said to her, 'How did you manage?', and I remember she just said, 'Well, you just get on with it'. And that was actually probably the best and most factual advice I could have."" Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were both born after the Queen took the throne. The only other elected leader to give birth in office was Benazir Bhutto, who served as prime minister of Pakistan from 1988 to 1990 and 1993 to 1996. Ms Ardern gave birth to daughter Neve Te Aroha in June 2018,returning to work in early Augustof that year. Ms Ardern, who previously lived in London, said she hadn't been surprised ""at all"" by the size of the public's response to the Queen's death. ""I've seen what London looks like day-to-day, and what it feels like day-to-day, the hustle and bustle,"" she said. ""And to see it just stand still, but do so so poetically, is a very moving thing to witness. The Queen was here for her people, and now her people are there for her."" This video can not be played New Zealand's PM says ""it makes sense"" that dignitaries attending the Queen's funeral should be bussed to Westminster Abbey She added that she had been surprised by the widespread discussion of the news that many world leaders will be bussed to the funeral instead of being allowed to take their own cars. ""I have to be honest, I'm interested that there's so much fuss about it,"" she said. ""Back in New Zealand, I often get our ministers to carpool in a van. So this just makes good sense."" Ms Ardern was also asked about recent comments in which she said she thought it was ""likely"" that New Zealand would become a republic in her lifetime. ""Even the Queen herself has observed and acknowledged the evolution over time in our relationships,"" she said. ""So my observation is that there will continue to be an evolution in our relationship. I don't believe that it will be quick or soon, but over the course of my lifetime."" She also said that the process of becoming republic was not one she had ""any intent of instigating"". She added that there would ""still be bonds between us as Commonwealth nations and still things to be gained through those relationships"".

"Police and protesters in Belgrave Road on Sunday afternoon Fifteen people have been arrested in an operation to ""deter further disorder"" in Leicester. There waslarge-scale unrest on Saturdayamid tensions involving mainly young men from sections of the Muslim and Hindu communities. Police said it had been sparked by an ""unplanned protest"". Another protest involving about 100 people followed on Sunday. Leicestershire Police said there had been no further disorder overnight. The force added that all 15 people arrested on Sunday remained in custody. Leicester's elected mayor, Sir Peter Soulsby, said he and community leaders were ""baffled"" by the events, saying they had been ""fanned by some very distorted social media"" and ""a lot of people who came in from outside"". Officers prevented people marching down Belgrave Road During Sunday's protest people congregated on Belgrave Road, with members of the crowd telling the BBC they were on the streets as a result of the recent unrest. Officers closed the road and some of the crowd briefly tried to push through police lines, complaining they were being prevented from marching. Later, the protesters walked along Green Lane Road, in the North Evington area, followed by officers. There was also a police presence on Humberstone Road, with several nearby streets closed off. The force said in a statement: ""Officers became aware of groups of young men gathering on Sunday afternoon in the North Evington area of the city. ""Officers spoke to them and took steps, including putting in place a temporary police cordon, to minimise harm and disturbance to communities."" Police had said they wanted to avoid a repeat of Saturday night's confrontations, and that dispersal powers would be used to break up any further gatherings. The force has also issued a warning about misinformation and rumours, and urged people to be careful about what they shared on social media. Later on Sunday, police closed several side streets in the Humberstone Road area Sir Peter said: ""It got fanned by some very distorted social media. And then fuelled by a lot of people who came in from outside as well as some young local lads who seemed to feel it was appropriate to frighten and disturb this peaceful city. ""I've seen a selection of the social media which is very, very distorted - some of it completely lying - about what had been happening between different communities. ""I also know there was also a concerted attempt on Saturday to bring people from as far as Birmingham, to ship them across to have a bit of a 'set-to' in Leicester. ""All of those things taken together seem to have escalated the celebration of a cricket match into something that for the city is very disturbing indeed. ""I don't want to minimise the impact but there is no obvious local cause for this at all."" He also paid tribute to police for ""stamping on it quickly"". Mr Soulsby added he and community leaders were ""confident Leicester is resilient enough to be able to return to normal relations very soon"". Community leaders in the city have called for ""peace and engagement"". Protesters could also been seen moving down Green Lane Road, flanked by police Sanjiv Patel, who represents Hindu and Jain temples across Leicester, said he was deeply saddened and shocked by the recent disturbances. He said: ""We are horrified and deplore what was going on [on Saturday] and across the last two weeks. ""Across the Hindu and Jain community and with our Muslim brothers and sisters and leaders we are consistently saying 'calm minds, calm heads'."" He added: ""Violence is not a solution to anything. This has to be a time for peace, calm and engagement."" Suleman Nagdi, of the Leicester-based Federation of Muslim Organisations, told the BBC: ""What we have seen on the streets is very alarming. ""There have been problems in the community since the India and Pakistan cricket match and while that game often sparks gatherings they have not in the past turned this ugly. ""We need calm - the disorder has to stop and it has to stop now. There are some very dissatisfied young men who have been causing havoc. ""We need to get the message out that this must end and try to do this through parents and grandparents talking to their sons."" Two men were arrested after Saturday's disorder - one on suspicion of conspiracy to commit violent disorder and another on suspicion of possession of a bladed article. They remain in custody.

"King Charles III has said he is ""deeply touched"" by the support he has received from across the world, ahead of the Queen's funeral. The King said he and Camilla, the Queen Consort, were ""moved beyond measure"" by everyone who took the trouble to pay their respects. ""As we prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you,"" he said. The state funeral service at Westminster Abbey began at 11:00 BST. Some 2,000 people are attending the ceremony, including 500 presidents, prime ministers, and foreign royals from around the world. The King is leading the nation in mourning for its longest-reigning monarch. Your guide to the Queen's funeral What time is the Queen's funeral? Who will wear uniform? Who's invited to the Queen's funeral - and who's not? In a written message issued by Buckingham Palace, the King said: ""Over the last 10 days, my wife and I have been so deeply touched by the many messages of condolences and support we have received from this country and across the world. ""In London, Edinburgh, Hillsborough and Cardiff we were moved beyond measure by everyone who took the trouble to come and pay their respects to the lifelong service of my dear mother, the late Queen. ""As we all prepare to say our last farewell, I wanted simply to take this opportunity to say thank you to all those countless people who have been such a support and comfort to my family and myself in this time of grief."" This photograph of the Queen at Windsor Castle was taken in May this year An unseen portrait of the Queen has also been released by Buckingham Palace on the eve of her funeral. The photograph, taken by Ranald Mackechnie ahead of the Platinum Jubilee Celebrations in May, shows the monarch beaming brightly at the camera in her Windsor Castle home. She is wearing a blue dress, her favourite three-strand pearl necklace, pearl earrings and her aquamarine and diamond brooches - an 18th birthday present from her father George VI in 1944 which she also wore on the 75th anniversary of VE Day in 2020. King Charles held a reception at Buckingham Palace on Sunday evening for heads of state attending the funeral. Later, at 20:00, a national minute's silence was observed at homes and doorsteps across the UK. Many thousands of people have queued this week to see the Queen's lying-in-state, which ended at 06:30 on Monday. The queue was closed to new entrants shortly after 22:40 on Sunday. At 10:44, her coffin was taken in procession from the Palace of Westminster to Westminster Abbey in the State Gun Carriage of the Royal Navy. King Charles walked behind, alongside the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and Earl of Wessex. Behind them were the Queen's grandsons, the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Sussex and Peter Phillips. Prince George and Princess Charlotte are also attending the Queen's funeral. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who will give the sermon, told the BBC people could expect ""a great deal of grandeur and pomp"" from the service but he also hoped it would help the Queen's family ""find a measure of comfort amidst the glare of publicity"". ""In the readings and the prayers, it will be something that, again, I pray will fit the Queen's character and person. You'll think not just this was a service fit for a Queen, this was a service fit for this person,"" he added. Following the service, the coffin will be drawn in a walking procession from the Abbey to Wellington Arch, at London's Hyde Park Corner. With the route lined with military personnel and police, Big Ben will toll at one-minute intervals as the procession moves slowly through the streets of the capital. Parliament officials said they were confident the bell would ring out during the procession after investigating a ""minor technical issue"" which prevented it from striking on Sunday, following the national minute's silence. Gun salutes will also fire every minute from Hyde Park during the procession and people can watch in person from designated viewing areas along the route. Once at Wellington Arch, at about 13:00, the coffin will be transferred to the new State Hearse for its final journey to Windsor Castle. There, the Queen's coffin will enter St George's Chapel for a committal service. Attended by a smaller congregation of about 800 guests, the committal service will be conducted by Dean of Windsor David Conner, with a blessing from the Archbishop of Canterbury. At a private family service later, the Queen will be buried alongside her late husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, at the King George VI memorial chapel, located inside St George's Chapel.

"The stabbing took place on Great Windmill Street A 24-year-old man has been charged in connection with the stabbing of two police officers in central London on Friday. Mohammed Rahman is accused of attempted murder and causing grievous bodily harm with intent. One of the officers suffered what have been described as ""life-changing"" injuries to her arm in the attack near Leicester Square. Another officer suffered neck wounds but is expected to recover fully.

"This video can not be played Hundreds of people can be seen on the streets in footage filmed at the scene Large-scale disorder broke out in Leicester on Saturday, with police and community leaders calling for calm. Officers tried to hold back crowds amid tensions involving mainly young men from sections of the Muslim and Hindu communities. Police said two arrests had been made, and that the trouble flared up after ""an unplanned protest"". It is the latest ofseveral incidents, including violence after an India and Pakistan cricket match on 28 August. A significant police operation will remain in the area in the coming days. Suleman Nagdi, of the Leicester-based Federation of Muslim Organisations told the BBC: ""What we have seen on the streets is very alarming. ""There have been problems in the community since the India and Pakistan cricket match and while that game often sparks gatherings they have not in the past turned this ugly. ""We need calm - the disorder has to stop and it has to stop now. There are some very dissatisfied young men who have been causing havoc. ""We need to get the message out that this must end and try to do this through parents and grandparents talking to their sons."" Sanjiv Patel, who represents Hindu and Jain temples across Leicester, said he was deeply saddened and shocked by Saturday night's disorder. He said: ""We have lived in harmony in the city for many decades but over the past few weeks it is clear there are things that need to be discussed around the table to get out what people are unhappy about. ""Resorting to violence is not the way to deal with this. ""We are horrified and deplore what was going on (yesterday) and across the last two weeks. ""Across the Hindu and Jain community and with our Muslim brothers and sisters and leaders we are consistently saying 'calm minds, calm heads'."" He warned people to be wary of disinformation on social media. He added: ""Violence is not a solution to anything. This has to be a time for peace, calm and engagement."" Police said one man was detained on suspicion of conspiracy to commit violent disorder and another on suspicion of possession of a bladed article. They remain in police custody. Leicestershire's chief constable was among the police officers on the ground Leicester city mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said:  ""I don't think anyone saw the confrontation (on Saturday) as a likely outcome and police had been given reassurance things were calming down a lot. ""Things got very nasty indeed last night and I am very worried on behalf of the people who were caught up in it and I was impressed by the way police responded to it - it can't have been an easy task."" He added: ""It's mostly young men in their late teens and early 20s and I have heard suggestions people have come in (to the city) from outside looking for an opportunity to have a set-to. ""It's very worrying for people in the areas where this has happened."" Sir Peter said it was important community leaders continued to try to de-escalate the situation but he acknowledged it was a challenge to get through to young people. Speaking on Saturday night, Leicestershire Police's temporary chief constable Rob Nixonsaid in a video,external: ""We've had numerous reports of an outbreak of disorder in parts of the East Leicester area of the city. ""We have got officers there, we are taking control of that situation, there are additional officers that are en route, and dispersal powers, and stop and search powers have been authorised. ""Please do not get involved, we are calling for calm."" Police said they were ""taking control"" of the situation Community leaders from East Leicester were on the ground with officers, and were calling for calm and encouraging people to go home, the force added. In the early hours on Sunday, police said the situation was calming and ""under control"", and large number of searches had been carried out. ""Several incidents of violence and damage have been reported to the police and are being investigated,"" a spokesperson said. ""We are aware of a video circulating showing a man pulling down a flag outside a religious building on Melton Road, Leicester. ""This appears to have taken place while police officers were dealing with public disorder in the area. The incident will be investigated."" A woman who witnessed Saturday's disturbances said there were people wearing balaclavas or with masks over their faces, and with hoods pulled up. She told the BBC they were ""just everywhere, it was like crowds walking away from a football match"". ""There were police blocking the road; officers literally stood shoulder to shoulder blocking Uppingham Road,"" she said. Footage online showed police attempting to hold back crowds as objects including bottles were thrown. A resident from Green Lane Road said what she witnessed on Saturday evening was ""very intimidating"". ""The whole situation seemed really out of control,"" she said. ""The police were there but it didn't seem like they had a great handle on things. ""People were still feeling very scared, unsure and uncertain, and with everything else that's gone on recently, there's also a lot of tension building up in the few weeks that we've had this happen and unfold.""

"New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the Queen told her she had to ""just get on with it"" when asked for advice about being both a leader and a new mother. In 2018, Ms Ardern became only the second elected head of government to give birth while in office. Speaking to the BBC, she also reiterated a belief that New Zealand would one day become a republic. Ms Ardern is one of hundreds of leaders in London ahead of the Queen's funeral. Appearing on the Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, she was shown footage of her first meeting with the Queen, which took place when she was pregnant. Asked about the conversation during that meeting, Ms Ardern said: ""One of the things on my mind alongside being a new prime minister was being a prime minister and a mum. ""And when you think about leaders who have been in that position..., there were so few to look to. ""So I said to her, 'How did you manage?', and I remember she just said, 'Well, you just get on with it'. And that was actually probably the best and most factual advice I could have."" Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were both born after the Queen took the throne. The only other elected leader to give birth in office was Benazir Bhutto, who served as prime minister of Pakistan from 1988 to 1990 and 1993 to 1996. Ms Ardern gave birth to daughter Neve Te Aroha in June 2018,returning to work in early Augustof that year. Ms Ardern, who previously lived in London, said she hadn't been surprised ""at all"" by the size of the public's response to the Queen's death. ""I've seen what London looks like day-to-day, and what it feels like day-to-day, the hustle and bustle,"" she said. ""And to see it just stand still, but do so so poetically, is a very moving thing to witness. The Queen was here for her people, and now her people are there for her."" This video can not be played New Zealand's PM says ""it makes sense"" that dignitaries attending the Queen's funeral should be bussed to Westminster Abbey She added that she had been surprised by the widespread discussion of the news that many world leaders will be bussed to the funeral instead of being allowed to take their own cars. ""I have to be honest, I'm interested that there's so much fuss about it,"" she said. ""Back in New Zealand, I often get our ministers to carpool in a van. So this just makes good sense."" Ms Ardern was also asked about recent comments in which she said she thought it was ""likely"" that New Zealand would become a republic in her lifetime. ""Even the Queen herself has observed and acknowledged the evolution over time in our relationships,"" she said. ""So my observation is that there will continue to be an evolution in our relationship. I don't believe that it will be quick or soon, but over the course of my lifetime."" She also said that the process of becoming republic was not one she had ""any intent of instigating"". She added that there would ""still be bonds between us as Commonwealth nations and still things to be gained through those relationships"".

"We've been sharing your tributes to Queen Elizabeth II following her death aged 96 You've told us what she meant to you, moments you remember from her life and your stories of meeting the UK's longest-reigning monarch On Monday, the nation paid a final farewell to the Queen, with a state funeral and military procession Our tributes page has been a reminder that hundreds of thousands of us felt a personal connection with the Queen, says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito ""She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life,"" says Simone Kennett, who was head teacher of a school when it was visited by the Queen We'll be preserving this page so people in the UK and around the world can continue to read the tributes so many of you have left for the Queen Deborah TurnessCEO, BBC News and Current Affairs As the Chief Executive of BBC News I
have the honour to write the closing message on this page of thousands of
tributes to Queen Elizabeth II. And itâs a message of thanks to every single
person who has taken the time to share their story. When the death of Queen Elizabeth was
announced, we at the BBC wanted to create a place where people could come
together to share their tributes, their photos and recollections. The
response has been incredible. We have received thousands of touching stories of
meeting the Queen, special moments, memories and messages of condolence. Thank you to everyone - from all
over the world - for coming together here in this virtual space for very real
acts a of remembrance. Looking at the contributions, the
common theme that emerges is that the Queen had a way of making each person she
met feel like the most important person in that moment. Thank you again for helping us remember
a woman whose promise to serve her people was fulfilled through a life of duty,
which touched so many people. Over the past 10 days, we've been asking you to share your memories of seeing and meeting Queen Elizabeth II or to send in your personal tributes. Thousands of people have sent their own messages of condolence. ""The stories speak to how many people felt a personal connection to Her Majesty,"" says BBC Media and Arts Correspondent David Sillito. ""It reminds us that, while the official record of the life of the Queen will be a series of great moments of national pageantry, those were rare special occasions. ""Her life was much more about handshakes, birthday cards and meeting ordinary, but often remarkable, people. ""No-one forgets a conversation with the Queen. And our tributes page has been a little reminder that for hundreds of thousands of us, the Queen was more than a distant figure in a palace. She was someone with whom they felt a personal connection."" You can read more from David on the tributes here. Sibella Laing went to Cambridge University with King Charles III, has known the Royal Family since she was a child and has met the Queen. She was, is, and always has been, incredibly kind to everybody, always anxious to put people at their ease, always anxious to make you feel you are the only person in the room.  Iâm sure this huge support across the country that Charles must have been seeing will have been really inspirational and uplifting for him. He has had the Queen as a wonderful role model all his life and I think in a sense his whole life has been preparation for this, so I think he is ready for it."" Sibella Laing Dinkie Flowers in the queue to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II in Westminster Hall Dinkie Flowers (nee Stapleton), aged 101, queued for several hours on Saturday to pay her respects to Queen Elizabeth II.

We always felt that she belonged here. This was her home. I am glad that she is in Windsor now, this was her favourite place. She will be missed."" Marie Wood Frances came from Italy to leave a portrait of the Queen drawn by her son Alex I have been living in Italy for the last 22 years. My son, Alex (13) drew this portrait of the Queen and I asked him if he wanted me to take it to London so I could leave it as a tribute for the Queen. He said yes.  On Saturday I got on a plane from Verona to come especially to leave the portrait before the funeral. Yesterday I took the 5.20am train from Havant to London and I left his portrait in Green Park. The policemen were very kind to take it for me as the park had already closed for laying flowers."" Frances King Simone Kennett was head teacher of Jersey College for Girls when the Queen visited to open a new building in 2001. The Queen said we had a beautiful school and that she had really enjoyed this visit. She made you feel as if you were important at that moment in her life. The students did the college proud and it was a successful visit.  We also had a light-hearted moment during the her visit. The Queen stamped her foot on the school's front terrace and said: 'This is hollow.' I said, 'Yes, Your Majesty, and if Your Majesty continues to bounce up and down she will find herself sitting in Home Economics,' and she absolutely roared with laughter!"" Simone Kennett, Former head of Jersey College for Girls Glyn Sherman, from Coventry, was serving in the Royal Horse Artillery in 1984 when as a guard of honour he met the Queen at a birthday parade. When she came along I said 'all right, Liz'? The top brass went to come down and she put her hand up to stop them, so I was lucky. I felt bad about it but had to explain to her that I've got a daughter called Elizabeth and it just came out like that.  She turned around and said 'I like to be unofficial sometimes'. It was brilliant. The memory will never go out of me.  Her death has left me heartbroken. I don't look at her as being Her Majesty. We call her our boss. Glyn Sherman I was born in 1926, a Londoner, and saw the Queen on the balcony with her parents on the day her father was crowned George VI. That memory is still very vivid in my mind. Beryl Smith Alicia Finn-OâShea, who is 10, met the Queen as a four-month-old baby. The family were so impressed by that encounter they named Alicia's little sister Elizabeth. She's now aged seven and prefers to be called Eliza, but they came to the Mall on Monday to watch the funeral procession with their mum Claire. It was really magical and amazing but also upsetting. The nice thought is the Queen is having marmalade sandwiches and tea with her family in heaven."" Alicia Finn-OâShea We arrived early from Birmingham to secure our place opposite Buckingham Palace gates to bid farewell to Her Majesty. We are really tired today but so happy we made it. It was an absolutely amazing day."" Claire Finn-O'Shea I used to make cakes and pastries for Her Majesty when I worked at Buckingham Palace from 2001 to 2002 and Sandringham from 2005 to 2006. I got really lucky. I did a modern apprenticeship under the patronage of the now King Charles III... On my days off I went and worked at Buckingham Palace two days a week. Over time I ended up working in the pastry kitchen and had the privilege of making some of the cakes and pastries that used to go out to the Queen during her teatime.  When I heard the news of the Queen's death I stepped outside for a good 10 minutes and really cried, I needed to get away from everyone. There are no Brits near me [in America] and so it's more of a challenge for people to understand what's going on.  It feels like more of a part of you has gone rather than a parent or relative. It feels a little bit of your identity has been lost. Kieron Hales Peter John Wailes, who served in the RAF for 25 years, met the Queen many times and headed to Windsor on the day of her funeral to pay his respects. The 63-year-old recalls how once at Buckingham Palace during a VJ Day parade the Queen noticed a veteran was struggling in the heat and ordered an officer to get them some water. âShe was fantastic and in charge of everything,â he says. Iâm here to pay respects to my ex-boss, I feel great respect for her and want to say thanks for everything - I enjoyed working for her and meeting her.â Peter John Wailes Paul Hayden and his sister handing flowers to the Queen during her visit to Essex My memory is a rather distant one: I think I was about five, and the Queen visited the Essex county show. I was photographed handing a bouquet of flowers to the Queen with my younger sister. Prince Phillip stood alongside the Queen. The photo ended up on the front page of the local newspaper and a framed photo was proudly displayed by my parents in their hallway for at least 20 years.  You can imagine the enjoyment all my friends (and my sister) have had over the years making fun of their once angelic mate and his little sister giving flowers to the Queen but I must admit to being rather proud of the occasion, particularly now.  Rest in Peace HRH Queen Elizabeth II."" Paul Hayden The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell shared a jigsaw puzzle and watched TV with the Queen at Sandringham. It was a great privilege to be alongside her. We sat down after dinner and did a jigsaw and the television was on.  It's a bereavement, and with every bereavement there is shock, there is loss but there is also thankfulness for a life lived well. A life of astonishing service. She was a person of simple but profound faith, and it was that faith that shaped her."" Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell Raven Harlow Aspenwood is severely visually impaired and has channeled her grief into her portrait of the young Queen Elizabeth II I am registered severely visually impaired, but I felt compelled to do something to channel my overwhelming and surprising level of grief following the sad passing of HRH, Queen Elizabeth II. I think my strongest memory of the queen is how comforting her presence has been during every stage of my 28 years of life, when something difficult has happened she has comforted us with her words, when something wonderful has happened she has filled our hearts with joy, with her wonderful smile and calming presence. She has been the grandmother of our nation, the matriarch we all need in times of hardship and times of joy. Her dignity, strength and consistency has been a great comfort and I thank her for her seventy years of steadfast service. Raven Harlow Aspenwood from East Yorkshire What a smile. She could lift a room with that wonderful smile and that genuine interest that she has in the people of this country."" Warwickshire County Council Leader, Izzi Seccombe I do remember her smile, I experienced that myself. It not only lit up a room, it lit up a nation - and she had the capacity to make us smile too."" Bishop of Coventry, Reverend Christopher Cocksworth Zara Umar gave flowers to the Queen in 2002 My daughter Zara and I went down to the City Square in Dundee to see the Queen in 2002. We waited for a long time. Soon the time came and the Queen was walking towards us. She was about five or six steps away from us when one of her security personnel guided the Queen away to the car to leave. Zara was so disappointed and my heart sank. Just then a plain clothes man came and asked me if he could lift Zara over the barrier. Much to my delight, Zara presented the flowers to the Queen and said 'here you are then, take your flowers.' I couldnt believe it! The Queen must have found it funny though and watched Zara return to me with a big smile on her face. I will treasure this memory forever."" Ishrat Umar, Dundee Three army veterans from Worcestershire pay tribute to the Queen... She was our head, she was our leader, she was the person we were serving and she's the one that we would follow. It hits you, it hits your heart."" Eric Braithwaite, who served for 23 years with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers Everyone called her the boss in one way or another. I've actually guarded the Queen and Prince Philip on other duties. A big lump in the throat, lost the boss, getting a new one."" Dave Sandy, who served in the territorial army from the late 1970s until the 1990s I've done a lot of parades for the Queen, she was a lovely lady and worked so hard for the country. I was in tears, I will be honest. It was an honour to be with her and be a soldier for her."" Anthony Goodway, who spent two years in national service from 1958 until 1960 I met the Queen when she visited the Isle of Skye as part of her Golden Jubilee tour. As a nurse then at the local care home, myself and other staff members were invited to bring some of our residents to meet Her Majesty. The great day came, our ladies looking beautiful, wheelchairs polished. One of our residents had worked at the palace as a younger woman and had photos of the Queen all around her room in the care home, so, if any one was to be there that day, it was her.  As the Queen approached our little group that day she asked me: âAre these the ladies from the care home?' I replied in the positive and then said this resident had worked in the palace. The Queen looked down a little and asked her: âWhen did you work at the palace?â To which, the lady looked up and and replied, in a rather gruff voice: âAnd who are you?â What a moment. I apologised. The Queen just smiled and moved on.  I was quite overwhelmed, I donât have photos of the Queen all over the house, but Iâve always respected her, especially as a Christian woman. She had a real true faith, so meeting her was very special. I didnât expect to be so overcome by the moment. Her demeanour was that of interest and she handled the situation really well. She left us all feeling very special and honoured. Barbara Matheson from Glasgow Barbara Matheson has recalled the moment she met the Queen during Her Majesty's Golden Jubilee tour Â© 2025 BBC.

"The Crown of Scotland (l) on Her Majesty's coffin in Edinburgh was replaced by the Imperial State Crown in London King Charles has done two things simultaneously this week that reveal much about what kind of reign he aspires to. First, he has led the nation in the ritualising of its sorrow - a sorrow that has been quietly expressed and subdued but it is nonetheless real. And second he has signalled to us in the clearest terms possible that this is a reign that will put the future of the Union - the integrity of the United Kingdom itself - at the heart of its concerns. In choosing to visit Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff, as well as return to London, King Charles has demonstrated how fully the Royal Family and household have understood the nature of the United Kingdom as a Union state - a partnership of nations. Everywhere he went there were gestures of respect and, indeed, affection for the distinctiveness of each of the three devolved nations. And in that, as in much else, he is following what he called, in Northern Ireland, the ""shining example"" set by his mother. We saw the coffin of the Queen for the first time as it slipped through the gates of Balmoral in its glass-sided hearse. She is the first reigning monarch to die in Scotland in nearly 500 years. ""I have to be seen to be believed,"" she had famously remarked in life; now she was performing the same service in death. The cortege made its way slowly through royal Deeside, slowing down to pass through towns and villages, where the people know her not just as the Queen, but as their neighbour. She had known this landscape since she was a child: Aboyne, Ballater, Banchory, Peterculter, through Aberdeen to Bridge of Muchalls, Stonehaven and south to the Scottish capital. They stood by the side of the road as the cortege passed, in quiet contemplation. What was the symbolism of this measured progress through the green spaces, the little neighbourhoods, she loved, if not to say: ""I am rooted here; this has been my home."" For that's what Balmoral was - a private home and not a royal residence. She made no secret of the fact that she loved it more than any place in the world. It was where she found respite from the burdens of state and the unyielding gaze of the public. The new Queen Elizabeth with a young Prince Charles at Balmoral in September 1952 I have been struck all week by that gaze. It has followed the new King and those closest to him throughout. Other than a brief time at Highgrove spent in quiet contemplation, King Charles and the Queen Consort have spent almost every waking hour since the Queen died in the public eye. This, at a time when they and their family are carrying what must be an intense private sorrow. This is a family on whose grief the eyes of the world intrude. Duty calls them to sublimate their private sorrow to the imperatives and demands of public ritual This, too, is surely the legacy of the late Queen - it is the steadfastness and constancy with which she adhered to her idea of public service, now visible in her son. Crowds gathered in the streets of Edinburgh's magnificent old town as her coffin was taken to lie in the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the monarch's official residence in Scotland. You could sense the intimacy and informality of that journey from Balmoral gradually yielding to the rituals of statehood and official mourning. History seeps from every stone of that house. This was where the Queen's ancestor King James VI of Scotland learned, in the middle of the night, that he had inherited the throne of England on the death of the first Elizabeth, thus uniting the two kingdoms under one Crown for the first time. In that sense, the Queen was brought to lie in rest in the building that could be said to be the birthplace of the first Kingdom of Great Britain. The Royal Household's attention to the sensibilities and distinctiveness of the three devolved nations of the UK has been striking, not just this week, but for many years. When, in 1999, the Queen opened the first Scottish Parliament in 300 years, she gave permission for the then presiding officer to refer to her by what he called her proper title - Elizabeth, Queen of Scots. Mother and son sharing a laugh at the Braemar Highland Gathering in 2012 She, herself, when she was in Scotland, referred to her son and heir not as the Prince of Wales but as the Duke of Rothesay, his Scottish title. When they took the Queen's coffin to lie in rest at St Giles' Cathedral, they placed upon it the Crown of Scotland, the centrepiece of the Scottish crown jewels. It is 500 years old, the oldest surviving royal crown in Britain and Ireland, made for the Queen's ancestor King James V. Consider the symbolism - it is a gesture toward the distinctiveness of Scotland and its historic nationhood. What have we learned about the kind of reign that the King aspires to? This week, above all, he has sought visibility; like his mother he wants to be seen, to forge a strong link between Crown and people. It was those moments outside, in the street, among the people crowding to see him, hands stretched out to take his, that he seemed to come alive. These were the moments - moments of easy informal engagement - that seemed to energise and excite him. We watched him at Hillsborough Castle in Northern Ireland, being addressed by Sinn Fein leaders who do not recognise the legitimacy of his Crown in their country. And yet they spoke to him with sympathy for his loss, and spoke with immense warmth about his late mother. In May 2022's election, for the first time, nationalist Sinn Fein won most seats to the Northern Ireland Assembly Alex Maskey, the Sinn Fein speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, a man who was twice interned without trial during the Troubles, stood in the Throne Room at Hillsborough and spoke directly to the British King of the leadership qualities of his late mother. He also praised the role those qualities had played in bringing peace to Northern Ireland. He said she had deployed gestures that seemed small, but which had an enormous impact in promoting reconciliation. King Charles replied that he would seek to follow what he called his mother's ""shining example"" in bringing together ""those whom history has separated"". King Charles with Northern Ireland Assembly Speaker, Alex Maskey of Sinn Fein - and the party's Vice President Michelle O'Neill The last leg of his tour was to the country whose title, he said, he had borne with pride for more than half a century: the title Prince of Wales, one he now passes to his own heir. His relationship with Wales is intimate. As a student he learned Welsh here, and spoke Welsh at his investiture as Prince of Wales in 1969. Here, bilingualism is part of the distinctive character of the country. He and the Queen Consort attended a Service of Prayer and Reflection for the life of Queen Elizabeth, at which the First Minister, Mark Drakeford, read from the First Book of Kings in Welsh. It incudes the verse: ""And now, Oh Lord, you have made your servant King."" Llandaff Cathedral, where, the service took place, is almost 1,000 years old. It was rebuilt after being bombed in the Cardiff blitz. It connects us - and the Royal Family - to the great shared British experience of the World War Two. Queen Elizabeth's visit here in 1960 marked its restoration, a symbol of the long recovery from war and its aftermath that characterised the early years of her reign. Queen Elizabeth, too, hugged the devolved nation close. She made multiple visits to the Scottish Parliament, and attended every opening of the Welsh Assembly and Senedd. But among the cheers from the crowds Charles encountered in Wales, there were also boos and chants of ""Not my King"". This dissent was an echo of pockets of anti-monarchy protests in other places throughout the week. ""I think the biggest danger to the union is arrogance around its continuation,"" Laura McAllister, professor of public policy at Cardiff University told me the day before the King's visit to Cardiff. ""I suspect the monarchy has got perhaps even greater sensitivity than politicians to this because there's a real sense of understanding the cultural and political heritages of each of the nations is very different,"" she said. In Cardiff, King Charles smiled with members of the public after a service at Llandaff Cathedral in memory of his mother The Queen received a similar welcome when she visited the village of Treherbert on her birthday in April 1989 She said the Queen had reflected that in her remarks when she was opening the National Assembly and then the Senedd and expected King Charles to do the same. And he did. Here, too, he spoke of his late mother's - and his own - affection for the country. Perhaps more telling there was the gesture toward the distinctiveness of the character of the country. On the floor of the Senedd, he replied to a motion of condolence from members of the assembly in both languages. ""Through all the years of her reign,"" he said, ""the land of Wales could not have been closer to my mother's heart. I know she took immense pride in your many great achievements - even as she also felt with you deeply in time of sorrow. ""It must surely be counted the greatest privilege to belong to a land that could inspire such devotion. I am resolved to honour that selfless example, in the spirit of the words by which I have always tried to live my own life: 'Ich Dien, I Serve'."" When his mother came to the throne in 1952, the integrity of the United Kingdom was a given. It is telling that King Charles has chosen, as the first act of his reign, to tour the devolved nations. For the landscape is changing. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein, a party that seeks to lead Northern Ireland out of the Kingdom and into the Republic, is now the biggest single party. In Scotland, support for independence remains a little below 50 per cent, and has much higher support among the young. Which of his many homes will King Charles live in? How Maori remember the Queen Mammoth task of organising '100 state visits at once' The early decades of Queen Elizabeth's reign were characterised by the long, slow contraction of British imperial power overseas and, in the end, the dissolution of the Empire - an outcome that would have shocked and dismayed earlier generations. It was her leadership that transformed the Empire into the Commonwealth. Most of its members chose to become republics. Fourteen Commonwealth realms remain, in which King Charles becomes head of state, including Jamaica, Australia and New Zealand. King Charles will be alert to the possibility that that process could resume, with the potential that some of those realms will also become republics. He will also be alert to the possibility that his own reign could come to be defined by the loosening of the bonds that have traditionally held the Union together. Queen Elizabeth was a powerful force for unity. She came to embody much of the character of Britain itself. We looked at her and saw a set of values - though each of us would have defined those values differently - around which the country cohered. She was the last living royal link with WW2, perhaps the founding shared experience of the modern British identity. King Charles III enters Buckingham Palace for the first time as the new monarch, accompanied by the Queen Consort What will happen to that legacy, to the way of being British that she reflected back to us, when this period of mourning is over and she begins to slip into the middle distance of our collective memory? That the new king inherits a powerful legacy of public affection for his mother has been clear this week. But the enthusiasm of those who turned out in Edinburgh, Belfast, Cardiff, London and across the country will not disguise for long the strains that the country is under. King Charles signalled to us this week that he intends to put the future of the Union at the heart of his reign. The Royal household will not make the mistake of seeing those crowds as incontrovertible proof that the Union is secure.
