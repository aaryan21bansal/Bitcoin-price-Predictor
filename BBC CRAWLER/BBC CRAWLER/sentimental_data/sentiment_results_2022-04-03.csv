"This video can not be played WATCH: Police in Sri Lanka fire tear gas and water cannon at protesters in Kandy Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is trying to stabilise his government after mass protests prompted most of the cabinet to resign. Only the president's brother, the prime minister, Mahinda, stayed on as the government grapples with a major economic crisis. Earlier, Mr Rajapaksa invited opposition parties to join the cabinet. But spontaneous public protests have continued against shortages of essential goods and rolling power cuts. On Sunday, many defied a curfew to take to the streets in several cities. Many of the protesters have been calling for the resignation of the president. The curfew, along with a ban on social media sites including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter, was meant to halt a planned day of protests,after a demonstration outside the president's house on Thursday night turned violent. Two opposition parties - the Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB), with 54 seats, and the Janatha Vinukthi Peramuna (JVP), with three - have also rejected the president's invitation to form a national unity government and told him to resign instead. Why Sri Lanka resignations won't appease protesters Sri Lanka is struggling to pay for imports of fuel and other goods because of a shortage of foreign exchange, which has exacerbated its worst economic crisis since independence from the UK in 1948. Sri Lanka needs foreign currency to pay for imports of fuel. With power cuts lasting half a day or more and shortages of food, medicines and fuel, public anger has reached a new high. The 26 cabinet ministers who resigned included the prime minister's own son, Namal Rajapaksa, who tweeted that he hoped it would help the president and PM's ""decision to establish stability for the people and the government"". Mr Sabry, who was justice minister in the previous government, now becomes finance minister, replacing another of the president's brothers, Basil Rajapaksa, who was due to visit Washington this month for talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a loan programme. Previous ministers of foreign affairs, education and highways were reappointed to their old positions. Many protesters who allege that the president and his family are to blame for the situation in the country are angry at the fact that he will remain in power.

The demonstrations mark a massive turnaround in popularity for Mr Rajapaksa, who swept into power with a majority win in 2019, promising stability and a ""strong hand"" to rule the country. Protesters confronted security forces in Colombo on Sunday I met opposition leader Sajith Premadasa at another impromptu protest on Sunday, where he along with other members of his party were stopped at police barricades as they tried to enter the city's Independence square. ""The supreme law of the land protects the right of the people to share their opinions, to demonstrate and to engage in peaceful democratic activities, so that right cannot be violated,"" he said, adding that the curfew and social media ban were dictatorial, autocratic and draconian steps. I also met several people who had defied the curfew to come out and protest. Suchitra was one of dozens gathered at a protest outside an Asian restaurant by what's usually a busy road. As he cradled his 15 month-old baby boy, who shares his name, Suchitra told me about the daily problems he faced with power cuts. ""Without electricity our fans don't even work. In this heat it's impossible for the baby, or us, to sleep."" ""I came out today because my rights have been taken away, and I'm very angry,"" said Anjalee Wandurgala, one of a few hundred students who gathered in a part of Colombo. ""Why have they put this curfew? Is it to protect us?"" she asked. ""It doesn't make sense at all"". Freelance advertising copywriter Sathsara says it is the first time he has ever protested. ""I'm freelance, but I can't earn money as there's no gas, no electricity. I'm totally broke,"" he says. He's one of many young Sri Lankans struggling to see a way forward through this crisis.

"This video can not be played Watch: Moment Hungary PM makes dig at President Zelensky in victory speech Hungary's nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban has won a fourth term by a landslide in the country's general election, near-complete results show. His right-wing Fidesz party won 135 of 199 seats with almost 99% of the votes counted, preliminary results show. The opposition alliance led by Peter Marki-Zay was far behind with 56 seats. In his victory speech, Mr Orban criticised Brussels bureaucrats and Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, calling them ""opponents"". Mr Zelensky has repeatedly criticised Mr Orban's ban on the transfer of arms to Ukraine, with which it shares a border. However, Mr Orban - who has close ties with Moscow - has condemned the Russian invasion and taken in half a million refugees since the war began in February. ""We never had so many opponents,"" he said, quoted by AFP. ""Brussels bureaucrats... the international mainstream media, and the Ukrainian president."" Following the result, Russian President Vladimir Putin sent Mr Orban a congratulatory message on the Telegram messaging app, according to the Kremlin. ""Despite the difficult international situation, the further development of bilateral ties of partnership fully accords with the interests of the peoples of Russia and Hungary,"" Mr Putin wrote. Mr Orban said that his ""huge victory"" could be seen ""from the Moon, but certainly from Brussels as well"". When officially confirmed by Hungary's electoral commission, the victory will be Fidesz's fourth successive win since 2010. The National Election Office said Fidesz would have 135 seats, a two-thirds majority, and the opposition alliance would have 56 seats - again, based on preliminary results. Mr Orban, 58, has had a fraught relationship with the EU, which considers that Fidesz has undermined Hungary's democratic institutions. Victory for Hungary's Orban means a headache for the EU The man who thinks Europe has been invaded In his 12 years in power, Mr Orban has rewritten the constitution, filled the top courts with his appointees and changed the electoral system to his advantage. During campaigning, the opposition's catchphrase was ""Orban or Europe"". Their candidate Peter Marki-Zay argued that Hungary should join Poland, the UK and others in supplying arms to Ukraine. And if called upon, and only within a Nato framework, should even consider sending troops. The opposition complained that Fidesz had isolated Hungary from the European mainstream, and from consensual democracy, fairness and decency. You could almost hear the collective thud of EU hearts sinking last night. A self-styled illiberal democrat, Hungary's leader has repeatedly clashed with Brussels over rule of law issues such as press freedom and migration. They've fallen out over Moscow too. Mr Orban is famed for his warm relations with Vladimir Putin. He signed up to Western sanctions - but refuses to supply Ukraine with weapons. He's the only EU leader to openly criticise President Zelensky. Hungary is becoming increasingly isolated in the EU and Nato - but Mr Orban knows neither institution is keen to ostracise him. They want a show of Western unity to display to Russia. His new term in office means he'll remain an unpredictable thorn in their side. More than 200 international observers monitored the election in Hungary, along with thousands of volunteers from across the political spectrum. Turnout hit 68.69%, almost matching the record number of voters in the last national elections in 2018. Mr Marki-Zay, the conservative opposition leader, conceded defeat late on Sunday evening. ""I will not hide my sadness and my disappointment,"" he told supporters, accusing Fidesz of running a campaign of ""hate and lies"". He claimed the opposition had done ""everything humanly possible"" but that the campaign had been ""an unequal fight"" as anti-Fidesz politicians got so little showing in state media.

"Prince Andrew was a helicopter pilot with HMS Invincible during the Falklands War Prince Andrew returned from the Falklands War ""a changed man"", he said in a now deleted piece posted on his ex-wife's Instagram account. The Duke of York recalled his time as a helicopter pilot in the conflict 40 years ago in three posts on Saturday. His piece was initially signed off as HRH The Duke of York, before the reference to His Royal Highness was soon removed. And only hours later all the posts were removed. It is unclear why the 700-word account was taken down. Is Prince Andrew trying to return to public life? Princess's 'wedding gift' claim in court case But Andrew gave up the right to use HRH in an official capacity in January when theQueen stripped her son of his honorary military rolesas he faced a US civil action over sexual assault allegations, which he denied. Virginia Giuffre sued Andrew for allegedly sexually assaulting her on three occasions when she was 17. The case later reached a multi-million pound settlement out of court. In the first Instagram post, Sarah, Duchess of York wrote that she had asked Andrew for his reflections on the 40th anniversary of his sailing from Portsmouth to the Falklands. Prince Andrew began: ""As I sit here at my desk on this cold crisp spring morning thinking back to April 1982 I've tried to think what was going through my mind as we sailed out of Portsmouth lining the flight deck of HMS INVINCIBLE."" He concludes: ""So whilst I think back to a day when a young man went to war, full of bravado, I returned a changed man. ""I put away childish things and false bravado and returned a man full in the knowledge of human frailty and suffering."" The 62-year-old said he was thinking about those experiencing conflict today. Prince Andrew has found himself firmly back in the headlines this week, but presumably not in the way he'd hoped. The Instagram posts, via the account of his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York, have just made a bad week worse. It is unclear why Prince Andrew decided to record his reflections on his Falklands experience. As a veteran he clearly has memories to share, but he isn't a working royal. He no longer has an official status within public life. Nobody within the royal household speaks on his behalf and he has deleted all of his own social media accounts. Crucially, he should no longer be using the HRH style alongside his name, as the Duchess of York initially did in the posts before swiftly removing it. Whatever the intention, it all looked clumsy and ill-conceived. Add to that Prince Andrew's role supporting his mother at Westminster Abbey last Tuesday during the Thanksgiving service for his father. He was at the event because it was deemed a ""family occasion"". Prince Andrew escorted the Queen at a memorial service for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey These things are carefully choregraphed. There had been a clear timetable of arrival times, with the prince originally scheduled to enter Westminster Abbey alongside his daughters. There was no mention of him escorting his mother - so something changed. Coming up are the official celebrations to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Will Prince Andrew be involved in any of these events? He may want to be. The rest of his family may have other ideas. In the posts, Andrew also described being shot at: ""I was flying and saw a chaff shell fired from one of our ships that passed not that far in front of us. ""For a moment it was on a steady bearing before it began to cross to our left. ""The terror that that was going to be that, just for a moment, has had a lasting and permanent effect on me."" Andrew spoke about how the war had affected him during his 2019 Newsnight interview in which he denied allegations of sexual assault. Responding to a claim he went on a night out with Ms Guiffre, who claimed he was sweating heavily, Andrew said:""I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply... it was almost impossible for me to sweat.""

"Ksenia and Maksim met while working at the same travel agency in Kyiv The drone footage shows three cars speeding along an empty main road just outside the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, when they suddenly turn around and race back - all except one. This white car turns, but then stops. A man steps out and raises his hands. Then his body falls to the ground. Moments later, Russian soldiers approach. An elderly woman and child leave the car, and a soldier walks them away. The man on the ground was Maksim Iovenko. The 31-year-old was shot dead by Russian forces that were positioned at the roadside. His wife Ksenia, who was in the car, was also killed. Their six-year-old son and the elderly friend of the family who were with them escaped, although she was wounded and remains in hospital. (Both families asked us not to name them.) ""Until I saw the video, I still had some hope,"" Maksim's father Sergiy Iovenko tells the BBC in Kyiv, where he lives. ""I was hoping that he was alive."" The incident happened on 7 March, when Maksim and his family joined a convoy of about 10 cars of civilians trying to reach Kyiv from the western outskirts of the city, which had become a conflict zone. It was filmed by a Ukrainian territorial defence group doing aerial reconnaissance, and widely shared. This video can not be played Video captured by a Ukrainian aerial reconnaissance group appears to show Russian forces shooting at civilians When a friend of Maksim's who was part of the convoy called Sergiy to tell him the news, Sergiy says he immediately knew something was wrong. There was silence when he picked up the phone, and eventually the friend said: ""Stay strong, your son and daughter-in-law are gone."" Maksim lived in Kyiv and worked for a travel agency, which is where he and Ksenia met. Sergiy describes his son as a family man with a kind heart who liked to sing karaoke. But his biggest hobby was his family, he says. ""He loved his son very much, and this was his passion."" Like many other Ukrainians, Sergiy says he and his family didn't believe Russian President Vladimir Putin would invade. Once Putin did, Maksim thought Kyiv would be one of the first cities to be shelled. Having discussed the situation with an old school friend, Maksim and his family moved west to the friend's second home, or dacha, on the outskirts of Kyiv, not far from the E-40 highway where the shooting would happen. Maksim told his father he thought it would be quieter there. ""It turned out the opposite,"" Sergiy says. While Russia's main focus appeared to be on the east and south of the country, Russian forces also started bombing towns and cities to the west of the capital, such as Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel - close to where Maksim was staying. Sergiy says he would often hear the sound of the heavy bombing from his home in Kyiv. Maksim wouldn't say much about conditions at the dacha, Sergiy says. ""He would say, 'it is quiet, peaceful, all is normal.'"" Maksim and his friend, also called Maksim, would take turns patrolling the area overnight, Sergiy says. Power outages and poor mobile signal meant regular contact was difficult. As the bombing continued, they moved into the basement, leaving only to buy food. Then, on 7 March, they lost all power. With no electricity, heating or food, Maksim, Ksenia and other families staying in the area decided to return to Kyiv. They knew they risked running into Russian troops along the highway, but they thought they could make it through safely. Maksim's car was third in the convoy, made up of about 50 people in total, including other children. In the windows of his car, he had put handwritten signs on white paper that read: ""Children."" His friend was part of the same convoy, and it was his mother who was in the car with Maksim and Ksenia, and he was able to tell Sergiy what happened. When the shooting started, Maksim's car was hit. ""The car's engine stalled,"" Sergiy says. ""My son jumped out of the car, he raised his hands and started shouting that there was a child in the car, so that the child would be saved."" It's not clear why the rest of the convoy fell behind the first three cars, but Sergiy believes many of those driving behind turned back when they saw the cars in front turning and heard the gunshots. After the shooting, Maksim's body was left on the highway and Ksenia's was left in the car. Maksim's son and his friend's mother were told by Russian soldiers to walk back along the road. When they got a safe distance from the Russian soldiers, she called her husband, who came to take them to safety. They returned to the dacha, and were evacuated safely to Kyiv the next day. A burned out car on the road where Maksim and Ksenia were killed The boy is with his grandmother in a safe location in Ukraine but away from Kyiv, where Sergiy remains. On Friday, Sergiy received a call informing him that the area had been re-taken by Ukrainian forces. There was more bad news. ""They burned everyone. Burned the cars as well,"" Sergiy says. A team of BBC journalists taken to the same stretch of road saw many burned cars and bodies. Among them was Maksim's car, riddled with shrapnel and reduced to a shell by fire, with the burned remains of a body inside it and one on the road beside it, still wearing a wedding ring. READ MORE:Gruesome evidence points to war crimes on road outside Kyiv Sergiy says he is heartbroken by what has happened, and by what his grandson has had to witness. The child remembers seeing the Russian soldiers with their weapons and is receiving support from family and specialists, Sergiy says.

"This video can not be played Highlights: England thrash Italy in the Women's Six Nations TikTok Women's Six Nations 2022: Italy v England Italy (0) 0 England (31) 74 Tries:McKenna 2, Thompson 3, Davies, Brown, Matthews, Fleetwood, Bern, Sing, ScarrattCons:Harrison 3, Rowland 4 England crushed Italy in Parma as they racked up a 20th successive win and stayed firmly on course for a fourth straight Women's Six Nations title. The Red Roses, whothrashed Scotland 57-5 last weekend,crossed for the first of 12 tries when Sarah McKenna skipped over in the fourth minute. The one-way traffic continued as Lydia Thompson, Lark Davies, Shaunagh Brown and Alex Matthews followed suit. Thompson scored two more tries in the second half to complete her hat-trick. Prop Sarah Bern's extraordinary 50-metre burst was the pick of the scores, 30 seconds after her arrival off the bench. Fellow replacements Vicky Fleetwood, Emma Sing and Emily Scarratt - with her 50th England try - also added their names to the scoresheet after the break, with McKenna picking up her second. Depth of squad gives coach Middleton 'good problems' 'That backline was ridiculous' - relive England's victory England have been playing under fatigue so far in the the tournament with high levels of training in the build-up to matches. But the Red Roses were far too fresh and bright for the hosts as they ground down Italy with big carries and smart handling. Italy's players never lost heart, throwing themselves into tackles despite the scoreboard damage. But any faint hopes of a huge underdog victory, after defeats in all 22 of the teams' previous meetings, were soon snuffed out. England take on an unbeaten Wales side next weekend, but the final-weekend showdown with old foes France, who have beaten Italy and Ireland by more than 30 points in their two openers, looms ever larger. England's win takes them back to the top of the table, courtesy of a 126-point points difference. England have surpassed 50 points in six of their past seven meetings with Italy In sparkling sunshine at the Stadio Sergio Lanfranchi, England took advantage of the conditions from the start, with forward runners offloading and punching holes in wide channels. It was a piece of prime opportunism that delivered the first try however, as McKenna darted blind and scrum-half Natasha Hunt, playing her first Test since November 2020, provided the pass for her to walk in unopposed. Opposite wing Thompson scooted in for her 39th England try after Vickii Cornborough's charge-down and regather, while Davies and Brown rumbled over from close range to guarantee the bonus point within 28 minutes. The impressive Matthews, who staked her claim to a regular spot in England's well-stocked back row, scattered blue shirts with a fifth first-half try. Coach Simon Middleton promised in the build-up to the match that his sidewould never ease off their opposition,with internal competition for places and the quest to regain the World Cup from New Zealand later this year keeping the pedal to the metal. His side duly showed little mercy after the break. Thompson rounded her opposite number two minutes after the interval while Fleetwood was the beneficiary at the back of a steamrolling maul. Bern's score, thirty seconds after her arrival off the bench, followed as she showed an extraordinary turn of pace to scamper home after Hunt's half break. Scarratt pounced on Zoe's Harrison's deliciously weighted grubber for her first Test score since she suffered a broken leg at the end of last year. Middleton faces cutting his squad down, potentially to just 30 players, for October's World Cup. It was another performance to show the depth of talent at his disposal. And the difficult decisions ahead. Hunt put in a livewire performance in her first Test appearance since November 2020 Italy:Ostuni Minuzzi; Muzzo, Sillari, Rigoni, Magatti; Madia, Stefan; Maris, Bettoni, Gai, Tuonesi, Duca, Sberna, Locatelli, Giordano (capt).

"This video can not be played WATCH: Police in Sri Lanka fire tear gas and water cannon at protesters in Kandy Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is trying to stabilise his government after mass protests prompted most of the cabinet to resign. Only the president's brother, the prime minister, Mahinda, stayed on as the government grapples with a major economic crisis. Earlier, Mr Rajapaksa invited opposition parties to join the cabinet. But spontaneous public protests have continued against shortages of essential goods and rolling power cuts. On Sunday, many defied a curfew to take to the streets in several cities. Many of the protesters have been calling for the resignation of the president. The curfew, along with a ban on social media sites including Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter, was meant to halt a planned day of protests,after a demonstration outside the president's house on Thursday night turned violent. Two opposition parties - the Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB), with 54 seats, and the Janatha Vinukthi Peramuna (JVP), with three - have also rejected the president's invitation to form a national unity government and told him to resign instead. Why Sri Lanka resignations won't appease protesters Sri Lanka is struggling to pay for imports of fuel and other goods because of a shortage of foreign exchange, which has exacerbated its worst economic crisis since independence from the UK in 1948. Sri Lanka needs foreign currency to pay for imports of fuel. With power cuts lasting half a day or more and shortages of food, medicines and fuel, public anger has reached a new high. The 26 cabinet ministers who resigned included the prime minister's own son, Namal Rajapaksa, who tweeted that he hoped it would help the president and PM's ""decision to establish stability for the people and the government"". Mr Sabry, who was justice minister in the previous government, now becomes finance minister, replacing another of the president's brothers, Basil Rajapaksa, who was due to visit Washington this month for talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on a loan programme. Previous ministers of foreign affairs, education and highways were reappointed to their old positions. Many protesters who allege that the president and his family are to blame for the situation in the country are angry at the fact that he will remain in power.

The demonstrations mark a massive turnaround in popularity for Mr Rajapaksa, who swept into power with a majority win in 2019, promising stability and a ""strong hand"" to rule the country. Protesters confronted security forces in Colombo on Sunday I met opposition leader Sajith Premadasa at another impromptu protest on Sunday, where he along with other members of his party were stopped at police barricades as they tried to enter the city's Independence square. ""The supreme law of the land protects the right of the people to share their opinions, to demonstrate and to engage in peaceful democratic activities, so that right cannot be violated,"" he said, adding that the curfew and social media ban were dictatorial, autocratic and draconian steps. I also met several people who had defied the curfew to come out and protest. Suchitra was one of dozens gathered at a protest outside an Asian restaurant by what's usually a busy road. As he cradled his 15 month-old baby boy, who shares his name, Suchitra told me about the daily problems he faced with power cuts. ""Without electricity our fans don't even work. In this heat it's impossible for the baby, or us, to sleep."" ""I came out today because my rights have been taken away, and I'm very angry,"" said Anjalee Wandurgala, one of a few hundred students who gathered in a part of Colombo. ""Why have they put this curfew? Is it to protect us?"" she asked. ""It doesn't make sense at all"". Freelance advertising copywriter Sathsara says it is the first time he has ever protested. ""I'm freelance, but I can't earn money as there's no gas, no electricity. I'm totally broke,"" he says. He's one of many young Sri Lankans struggling to see a way forward through this crisis.

"Edible Oils Ltd bottles cooking oils for 75% of the UK's retail market The biggest cooking oil bottler for UK shops has said it only has a few weeks' supply of sunflower oil left. Ukraine and Russia produce most of the world's sunflower oil and the war is disrupting exports, said Edible Oils. The company, which packages oil for 75% of the UK retail market, is ramping up supplies of other oils for shoppers. Meanwhile, manufacturers of foods that contain sunflower oil, like crisps, oven chips and cereal bars, are reworking their recipes. The Food Standards Agency has advised people with allergies to look out for extra information from shops and food makers. Kim Matthews, commercial director at Edible Oils said 80% of the global supply of sunflower oil comes out of Russia and Ukraine. ""So obviously, with everything going on out there, we physically can't get sunflower to be coming out of the country,"" he said. Kim Matthews is commercial director of Edible Oils which usually fills 32 million bottles of sunflower oil a year If you buy any cooking oil on the supermarket shelves, chances are it has come from the Edible Oils plant in Erith, on the outskirts of south-east London. It bottles oil for brands and retailers own label products. ""From a UK consumer perspective, sunflower oil is the biggest oil. It's used more than anything else,"" said Mr Matthews. ""It's a fast moving situation. We're still trying to see if we can get some more but it's looking very tight."" Edible Oils Ltd has upped production to 24/7 to try to make sure it has plenty of rapeseed and other oils to put on the shelves when the sunflower oil goes. ""Sunflower is great because you can cook at high temperatures. Rapeseed is very similar. You can do exactly the same with it,"" he said. But it was far from clear when sunflower oil supplies will be back to normal, he said. ""At the moment, Ukrainian farmers should be sowing the seeds now for the harvest in October and November. ""Clearly that's not going to happenâ¦ we're probably going to miss the season so we could be impacted for 12-18 months."" The recipes for hundreds of food products are being reformulated due to the lack of sunflower oil Sunflower oil can also be found in many hundreds of products, like ready meals, biscuits and mayonnaise. Food manufacturers are now racing to find alternative ingredients. The British Snack Company makes a small but popular range of hand cooked crisps for sale in pubs. After potatoes, its other key ingredient is sunflower oil. ""The supply of sunflower oil is something that we've always taken for granted,"" said founder Tom Lock. Shortly after the invasion, he had to quickly come up with a plan B and has already switched to rapeseed oil, which is very similar. ""There's an incredible scramble. Everyone's doing the same thing. So while sunflower oil is impossible to get at the moment, rapeseed oil is possible but difficult to get as well obviously because everyone's having the same idea, as prices are skyrocketing at the moment."" Tom Lock has switched to rapeseed oil to cook his crisps Rapeseed is used far more in the food supply chain, according to the National Edible Oil Distributors' Association. British farmers grow rapeseed but there won't be enough to go round. ""Prices for rapeseed oil have risen 50-70% since the attack,"" said NEODA's President Gary Lewis. ""But there's a limited supply to cover all this demand so some shortfall will be expected."" Mr Lock's crisp business had to pay through the nose because otherwise he would have run out of crisps, which makes up more than two-thirds of his sales. He says he'll absorb the costs as much as he can, but if the situation carries on he'll have to increase prices. One immediate headache he and other food manufacturers don't have to worry about is labelling. They're being allowed to switch ingredients without having to print new packaging, which can take up to 12 weeks. Emily Miles, chief executive at the Food Standards Agency, said allergic reactions to rapeseed oil were""very rare and if they do occur are mild"",,externaland advised anyone with allergies to look out for extra information. Ged Futter said the UK's food supply issues were a once in a lifetime situation For grocery expert, Ged Futter, the food industry is now grappling with supply issues not experienced since the end of World War Two. ""Retailers and suppliers have to work much more closely than they ever have before and to be much more flexible in their approach to make sure the products are on the shelf,"" he said. ""The immediate focus is sunflower oil and rapeseed oil, but there will be many more products which will be affected over the coming months. It's some of the ingredients you don't even think about, like starch, which comes from wheat."" He believes thousands of products will have to be reformulated. Mr Futter runs a business advising suppliers on how to deal with retailers. He says the ripple effects from the war are creating ""scarily high"" price rises, adding to already rising prices on the supermarket shelves. ""I think the level of food inflation we are now going to be seeing will be in excess of 15%.""

"Refugees and volunteers at Medyka border crossing between Poland and Ukraine Public response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis has shown people to be ""more generous than a lot of the media and... politicians would like them to be,"" according to Dr Rowan Williams. The former Archbishop of Canterbury said he felt the UK government ""expects the worst"" of people but the population was ""readier to give its best"". More than 10,000 people in Wales haveexpressed interest in housing refugees. The UK government has been asked to respond. More than10 million people have fled their homes in Ukraine, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. At the start of Russia's invasion, Boris Johnson defended criticism of the number ofUkrainian refugees who had been granted visas. As of 31 March,24,400 Ukraine family visas had been issued,external, against 32,800 applications received. Speaking onBBC Politics Wales, Dr Williams, who is also a former Archbishop of Wales, said: ""The government's response has been on the slow side... and it wasn't a particularly good start, but it's improving. Man buys Â£100k house for Ukrainian refugee family Family blinded in bombing given back their sight ""I've often felt that the British people, when it comes to crises, are more generous than a lot of the media and a lot of the politicians would like them to be. ""Then there's that slightly double-edged aspect to the situation - 'Ukrainians are more like us, these are Europeans' and so it's a bit easier to welcome,"" saidDr Williams, from Swansea. ""Even when you're talking about refugees from further afield from Syria or from Afghanistan or wherever, local generosity is extraordinary... and I do often feel that the government expects the worst of the British population and the British population is readier to give its best."" Dr Rowan Williams said people's ""generosity is extraordinary"" On climate change, he questioned whether people and politicians are ""grasping the magnitude"" of the crisis. ""In the last maybe five to eight years it's come up the agenda, pretty rapidly for a lot of people, and far more people now are both aware of it and aware that they need to be doing something about it,"" he said. ""The problem often is they don't know quite what they can do or they feel that whatever they do is inadequate to the scale of the problem."" A recent report by the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said many of theimpacts of global warming are now simply ""irreversible""and over 40% of the world's population are ""highly vulnerable"" to climate. What can you do to reduce your carbon footprint? Top 10 tips for combating climate change revealed Dr Williams also questioned whether ""sheer, unbridled, capitalist expansion"" was compatible with dealing with a climate emergency. ""That's not to say that the market has no role, it's not to say we go straight over to a kind of command economy,"" he said. ""It's to note that already within quite a lot of the commercial world, business world, there is a sense that profit alone is a kind of fiction because you can't sustain profit in an unsustainable social and material environment."" Global warming: ""Far more people now are both aware of it and aware that they need to be doing something"" Speaking ahead of Easter, Dr Williams was asked on Politics Wales as to how he reflected on an increasingly godless society. ""What we are facing is, I think, a general loss of confidence and trust in institutional religion, which has been going on for the last, probably the last century, all told. ""We're looking at the heritage sadly, of abuse and misconduct... so the institutions are not looking particularly good. ""At the same time I don't sense that there is overall a massive principled hostility to religion and I think there is, as the pandemic indicated, a remarkably widespread hunger for some sort of nourishment from spiritual sources. ""How do we solve this problem and say well, here we are, this is our offer and look as if we were a bit more confident, a bit more grateful about it. Maybe that would help,"" he added.

"Prince Andrew was a helicopter pilot with HMS Invincible during the Falklands War Prince Andrew returned from the Falklands War ""a changed man"", he said in a now deleted piece posted on his ex-wife's Instagram account. The Duke of York recalled his time as a helicopter pilot in the conflict 40 years ago in three posts on Saturday. His piece was initially signed off as HRH The Duke of York, before the reference to His Royal Highness was soon removed. And only hours later all the posts were removed. It is unclear why the 700-word account was taken down. Is Prince Andrew trying to return to public life? Princess's 'wedding gift' claim in court case But Andrew gave up the right to use HRH in an official capacity in January when theQueen stripped her son of his honorary military rolesas he faced a US civil action over sexual assault allegations, which he denied. Virginia Giuffre sued Andrew for allegedly sexually assaulting her on three occasions when she was 17. The case later reached a multi-million pound settlement out of court. In the first Instagram post, Sarah, Duchess of York wrote that she had asked Andrew for his reflections on the 40th anniversary of his sailing from Portsmouth to the Falklands. Prince Andrew began: ""As I sit here at my desk on this cold crisp spring morning thinking back to April 1982 I've tried to think what was going through my mind as we sailed out of Portsmouth lining the flight deck of HMS INVINCIBLE."" He concludes: ""So whilst I think back to a day when a young man went to war, full of bravado, I returned a changed man. ""I put away childish things and false bravado and returned a man full in the knowledge of human frailty and suffering."" The 62-year-old said he was thinking about those experiencing conflict today. Prince Andrew has found himself firmly back in the headlines this week, but presumably not in the way he'd hoped. The Instagram posts, via the account of his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York, have just made a bad week worse. It is unclear why Prince Andrew decided to record his reflections on his Falklands experience. As a veteran he clearly has memories to share, but he isn't a working royal. He no longer has an official status within public life. Nobody within the royal household speaks on his behalf and he has deleted all of his own social media accounts. Crucially, he should no longer be using the HRH style alongside his name, as the Duchess of York initially did in the posts before swiftly removing it. Whatever the intention, it all looked clumsy and ill-conceived. Add to that Prince Andrew's role supporting his mother at Westminster Abbey last Tuesday during the Thanksgiving service for his father. He was at the event because it was deemed a ""family occasion"". Prince Andrew escorted the Queen at a memorial service for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey These things are carefully choregraphed. There had been a clear timetable of arrival times, with the prince originally scheduled to enter Westminster Abbey alongside his daughters. There was no mention of him escorting his mother - so something changed. Coming up are the official celebrations to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Will Prince Andrew be involved in any of these events? He may want to be. The rest of his family may have other ideas. In the posts, Andrew also described being shot at: ""I was flying and saw a chaff shell fired from one of our ships that passed not that far in front of us. ""For a moment it was on a steady bearing before it began to cross to our left. ""The terror that that was going to be that, just for a moment, has had a lasting and permanent effect on me."" Andrew spoke about how the war had affected him during his 2019 Newsnight interview in which he denied allegations of sexual assault. Responding to a claim he went on a night out with Ms Guiffre, who claimed he was sweating heavily, Andrew said:""I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply... it was almost impossible for me to sweat.""

Edible Oils Ltd has upped production to 24/7 to try to make sure it has plenty of rapeseed and other oils to put on the shelves when the sunflower oil goes. ""Sunflower is great because you can cook at high temperatures. Rapeseed is very similar. You can do exactly the same with it,"" he said. But it was far from clear when sunflower oil supplies will be back to normal, he said. ""At the moment, Ukrainian farmers should be sowing the seeds now for the harvest in October and November. ""Clearly that's not going to happenâ¦ we're probably going to miss the season so we could be impacted for 12-18 months."" The recipes for hundreds of food products are being reformulated due to the lack of sunflower oil Sunflower oil can also be found in many hundreds of products, like ready meals, biscuits and mayonnaise. Food manufacturers are now racing to find alternative ingredients. The British Snack Company makes a small but popular range of hand cooked crisps for sale in pubs. After potatoes, its other key ingredient is sunflower oil. ""The supply of sunflower oil is something that we've always taken for granted,"" said founder Tom Lock. Shortly after the invasion, he had to quickly come up with a plan B and has already switched to rapeseed oil, which is very similar. ""There's an incredible scramble. Everyone's doing the same thing. So while sunflower oil is impossible to get at the moment, rapeseed oil is possible but difficult to get as well obviously because everyone's having the same idea, as prices are skyrocketing at the moment."" Tom Lock has switched to rapeseed oil to cook his crisps Rapeseed is used far more in the food supply chain, according to the National Edible Oil Distributors' Association. British farmers grow rapeseed but there won't be enough to go round. ""Prices for rapeseed oil have risen 50-70% since the attack,"" said NEODA's President Gary Lewis. ""But there's a limited supply to cover all this demand so some shortfall will be expected."" Mr Lock's crisp business had to pay through the nose because otherwise he would have run out of crisps, which makes up more than two-thirds of his sales. He says he'll absorb the costs as much as he can, but if the situation carries on he'll have to increase prices. One immediate headache he and other food manufacturers don't have to worry about is labelling. They're being allowed to switch ingredients without having to print new packaging, which can take up to 12 weeks. Emily Miles, chief executive at the Food Standards Agency, said allergic reactions to rapeseed oil were""very rare and if they do occur are mild"",,externaland advised anyone with allergies to look out for extra information. Ged Futter said the UK's food supply issues were a once in a lifetime situation For grocery expert, Ged Futter, the food industry is now grappling with supply issues not experienced since the end of World War Two. ""Retailers and suppliers have to work much more closely than they ever have before and to be much more flexible in their approach to make sure the products are on the shelf,"" he said. ""The immediate focus is sunflower oil and rapeseed oil, but there will be many more products which will be affected over the coming months. It's some of the ingredients you don't even think about, like starch, which comes from wheat."" He believes thousands of products will have to be reformulated. Mr Futter runs a business advising suppliers on how to deal with retailers. He says the ripple effects from the war are creating ""scarily high"" price rises, adding to already rising prices on the supermarket shelves. ""I think the level of food inflation we are now going to be seeing will be in excess of 15%.""

"Safer Wales fears locking up women splits families apart and leaves them vulnerable to domestic abuse Prison sentences for Welsh women are not working, according to a charity which works with offenders. Safer Wales said uprooting women for short sentences can break up families and leave women vulnerable to domestic abuse. Data obtained by Cardiff University shows 218 Welsh women were sent to prisons in England in 2021. The Ministry of Justice said custodial sentences should be a last resort. Safer Wales helped more than 1,000 Welsh women involved with the criminal justice system last year. Simon Borja, project development manager at the charity, said women were likely to be imprisoned for short sentences which were ""not working and we're seeing it not work"". The night my baby died as I gave birth in prison 'I went to prison three times - I'm so ashamed' 'Prison is the safest place for my mum' There are no female prisons in Wales so women are sent to England. Women from north Wales are more likely to go to HMP Styal near Manchester, while women from south and west Wales go to HMP Eastwood Park in Gloucestershire. They are separated from families and support networks and are at risk of losing their home, said Mr Borja. He said the causes of offending, including domestic abuse and trauma, are better addressed in a community setting. Simon Borja says the causes of offending are better addressed in the community ""What's happened in the prison is adding on to it,"" he said. Cardiff University's Wales Governance Centre showed almost a fifth of Welsh women in prison were sentenced to less than 12 months in 2021. After committing a series of minor offences, Louisa, not her real name, is on her last warning. Any breach of her suspended sentence conditions could see the 28 year old, from Cardiff, back in prison. She has been the victim of domestic violence in care, and has learning and mental health difficulties. ""I think they should address the issue and see why this is happening, and see what other support they can give before a person is locked up,"" she said. Louisa has been helped by Safer Wales, and volunteers with them as well as studying at college. She has two children in care and has visitation rights, which would be at risk if she went to prison. ""I'll lose my contact with my children, it would make a big impact. I would feel like I have nothing to fight for,"" she said. Eleri Cosslett runs Grow Inspires, which helps re-integrate ex-offenders by helping them start businesses and develop professional skills. She launched the company after her own experience of serving 16 months in HMP Eastwood Park while her daughter moved in with grandparents. ""The reality is it tears families apart to the core and they will never really come back together again,"" she said. Eleri Cosslett, left, with her team from Grow Inspires, who help re-integrate ex-offenders She says community sentencing would be more effective at helping women get back on their feet by reducing the stigma around offenders. ""Many of them have been sentenced to relatively short term sentences, but the effects are draconian and will last the rest of their lives,"" she said. The sentencing council sets guidelines for judges, and says the impact of removing women from their communities and families should always be considered. The council's Judge Rosa Dean said: ""Now that we have these very clear guidelines, it just makes everything a lot fairer and clearer to everybody. ""When you're dealing with women, it's just so important to make sure you have all the right information."" In 2020, a residential centre was launched in south Wales for women convicted of low-level crimes. A pilot was due to start in 2021, but has been delayed. Rhys ab Owen is worried there at the lack of detail about a women's residential centre set to be piloted in Wales Plaid CymruMember of the SeneddRhys ab Owen said: ""We know next to nothing about its details, its location, how many women will be there. Will it be a prison in all but name?"" The Ministry of Justice said jailing women should be a last resort. A spokesman said: ""Since we launched our female offender strategy the number entering the criminal justice system has fallen by almost a third. ""We are investing tens of millions into community services like drug rehabilitation and women's centres, and our joint Women's Justice Blueprint in Wales is diverting women away from crime.""

"Aleksandar Vucic's Progressive SNS party came to power in 2012 It may not be the first time that a household fridge has made a prominent appearance in an election campaign. But when Serbia's president emerged in a couple's kitchen in a promotional video, it raised hackles as well as eyebrows. With barely a shiver, Aleksandar Vucic proceeded to reel off a list of his Progressive Party's achievements during their decade in power. The ad was supposed to poke fun at the president's critics. They complain that Mr Vucic is ubiquitous and they did not see the funny side. As far as Serbia's opposition parties are concerned, the president's frequent - and usually positively framed media appearances - are evidence of an unhealthy relationship between the Progressive Party and the country's most popular newspapers and broadcasters. They say that makes it hard to challenge a party that has won the last four parliamentary elections, and is looking for a hat-trick of presidential victories in Sunday's elections. ""The regime is in absolute control of the media,"" complains Borko Stefanovic, deputy leader of the centre-left Party of Freedom and Justice. Election monitor CRTA reports that representatives of the government have gained two-thirds of national TV coverage during the election campaign - and three-quarters of the airtime on news programmes. The Serbian office of anti-corruption organisation Transparency International refers to ""the media dominance of Aleksandar Vucic and his [candidate] list"". The monitors complain that Mr Vucic has blurred the lines between his presidential duties and campaign activities. They cite as an example the opening in March of the first section of a new, high-speed rail line between Belgrade and Budapest. The president is accused of using the opening of a high-speed rail link to Budapest to further his campaign As the pristine Swiss-built train sped towards Serbia's second city, Novi Sad, camera crews jostled around the first-class leather seats where Mr Vucic was hosting Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban. On arrival, a crowd of thousands was waiting to hear an address from the two leaders in front of the freshly renovated station. During the return journey, Mr Vucic told the BBC that he had no sympathy with opposition allegations of unfair dominance. ""Do you want me to be helpful to my political opponents in beating me, or what?"" he asked. ""I didn't mention a single name of my political opponents in this campaign. There is no campaign against them - and there is a 24/7 campaign against me. I know one thing: I'm more diligent and more dedicated than them. That's what people here appreciate - and I'm proud of that."" Indeed, political analysts agree that the appeal of Mr Vucic and the Progressives cannot be explained by media ubiquity alone. Aleksandar Vucic's critics say he has turned Serbia into a semi-authoritarian state ""Vucic is remarkably good at delivering on things that ordinary Serbs want to see,"" says James Ker-Lindsay, a Balkans specialist at the London School of Economics. ""From the outside, we see someone who is very authoritarian and there's a lot of concerns about the possibility of illiberal turns. But on the ground, ordinary Serbs talk about the fact that he's delivering economic development and big infrastructure projects. These are the things that many ordinary Serbs think should have been done before under previous administrations, but weren't. It has been rather trickier for Mr Vucic to give voters what they want when it comes to relations with Russia. He is all too aware that many of his party's voters favour traditional ties with Moscow over the European Union membership negotiations that started in 2014. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has turned a long-running balancing act into more of a tightrope walk, without a safety net. Serbia has declined to join EU sanctions against Moscow - but did vote in favour of UN resolutions condemning the invasion. There have been demonstrations against Russia's war as well as in favour. This video can not be played Watch as thousands of pro-Russia Serbs march through the centre of Belgrade Mr Vucic has made ""peace and stability"" something of a catchphrase during the campaign - though if he is re-elected, Brussels is likely to increase the pressure on Belgrade to choose where its loyalties lie: East or West. Natasa Kandic, founder of Belgrade's Humanitarian Law Centre, agrees that the president is a ""pragmatic politician"" who has won popularity through attracting foreign investment which has brought ""jobs and salaries"". But an atomised opposition has also helped his cause. ""The main problem is that there is no democratic opposition,"" says Ms Kandic. ""How can you win without a strong leader?"" That problem has persisted since the Democratic Party lost power in 2012 and splintered into multiple, competing factions. Most of those parties boycotted the last elections in 2020, claiming the conditions for a free and fair vote didn't exist. That just allowed the Progressives to consolidate their hold on power. This time around, there's no opposition boycott. Parties from across the political spectrum have signed up to a coalition called United Serbia in a joint campaign against the Progressives. Their candidate for president is a former general, Zdravko Ponos. He is a conservative figure - which illustrates the awkward nature of the opposition alliance. In essence, all they have in common is a desire to dethrone Mr Vucic - and analysts doubt that will be enough to appeal to the electorate. After 10 years and six elections, Serbia's people already know plenty about the Progressive Party. Sunday's vote will show whether they buy the president's vision of progress - or accept the opposition's line that it is a manipulated media mirage.

"Prince Andrew was a helicopter pilot with HMS Invincible during the Falklands War Prince Andrew returned from the Falklands War ""a changed man"", he said in a now deleted piece posted on his ex-wife's Instagram account. The Duke of York recalled his time as a helicopter pilot in the conflict 40 years ago in three posts on Saturday. His piece was initially signed off as HRH The Duke of York, before the reference to His Royal Highness was soon removed. And only hours later all the posts were removed. It is unclear why the 700-word account was taken down. Is Prince Andrew trying to return to public life? Princess's 'wedding gift' claim in court case But Andrew gave up the right to use HRH in an official capacity in January when theQueen stripped her son of his honorary military rolesas he faced a US civil action over sexual assault allegations, which he denied. Virginia Giuffre sued Andrew for allegedly sexually assaulting her on three occasions when she was 17. The case later reached a multi-million pound settlement out of court. In the first Instagram post, Sarah, Duchess of York wrote that she had asked Andrew for his reflections on the 40th anniversary of his sailing from Portsmouth to the Falklands. Prince Andrew began: ""As I sit here at my desk on this cold crisp spring morning thinking back to April 1982 I've tried to think what was going through my mind as we sailed out of Portsmouth lining the flight deck of HMS INVINCIBLE."" He concludes: ""So whilst I think back to a day when a young man went to war, full of bravado, I returned a changed man. ""I put away childish things and false bravado and returned a man full in the knowledge of human frailty and suffering."" The 62-year-old said he was thinking about those experiencing conflict today. Prince Andrew has found himself firmly back in the headlines this week, but presumably not in the way he'd hoped. The Instagram posts, via the account of his ex-wife Sarah, Duchess of York, have just made a bad week worse. It is unclear why Prince Andrew decided to record his reflections on his Falklands experience. As a veteran he clearly has memories to share, but he isn't a working royal. He no longer has an official status within public life. Nobody within the royal household speaks on his behalf and he has deleted all of his own social media accounts. Crucially, he should no longer be using the HRH style alongside his name, as the Duchess of York initially did in the posts before swiftly removing it. Whatever the intention, it all looked clumsy and ill-conceived. Add to that Prince Andrew's role supporting his mother at Westminster Abbey last Tuesday during the Thanksgiving service for his father. He was at the event because it was deemed a ""family occasion"". Prince Andrew escorted the Queen at a memorial service for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey These things are carefully choregraphed. There had been a clear timetable of arrival times, with the prince originally scheduled to enter Westminster Abbey alongside his daughters. There was no mention of him escorting his mother - so something changed. Coming up are the official celebrations to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Will Prince Andrew be involved in any of these events? He may want to be. The rest of his family may have other ideas. In the posts, Andrew also described being shot at: ""I was flying and saw a chaff shell fired from one of our ships that passed not that far in front of us. ""For a moment it was on a steady bearing before it began to cross to our left. ""The terror that that was going to be that, just for a moment, has had a lasting and permanent effect on me."" Andrew spoke about how the war had affected him during his 2019 Newsnight interview in which he denied allegations of sexual assault. Responding to a claim he went on a night out with Ms Guiffre, who claimed he was sweating heavily, Andrew said:""I didn't sweat at the time because I had suffered what I would describe as an overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands War when I was shot at and I simply... it was almost impossible for me to sweat.""

Alex HartleyEngland spinner on BBC Test Match Special We often talk about the domestic set-up - Australia have a professional domestic set-up for five or six years longer than England have. England only started a couple of years and the first year, realistically, was heavily impacted by Covid. We've had professional players in England for one year effectively and that is only 10 or 15 games - it isn't many at all. This Australia side have played domestic cricket for years and years - they've got over 150 domestic games and experience under their belt. It will take a while for England to catch up, but they are not a million miles away, and I guess that is the exciting thing. We've got the likes of India, West Indies and New Zealand who are all investing in their domestic set-up. This World Cup has probably been the closest in terms of competition but Australia have absolutely walked it. It may have been a comprehensive win for Australia but there is plenty for England to take away from this. Sophie Ecclestone's rise to world number one, the emergence of Charlie Dean, Nat Sciver's batting heroics and Sophia Dunkley's growth as a middle order batter. The futures of some of England's older players remain undecided but with a big year of cricket ahead, they've got a promising blend of youth and experience to work with. Unsurprisingly, Alyssa Healy is named Player of the Match and Player of the Tournament for her incredible tally of 509 runs across the campaign, including centuries in both the semi-final and that incredible 170 today. Up there with the greatest ODI innings of all time. A masterclass. BBC Radio 5 Live Australia captain Meg Lanning on BBC Radio 5 Live:""I'm really pleased with that. This tournament has been a long time coming to be fair - it has been in the back of our minds and there are no doubts that we wanted this trophy in our cabinet. It has been an amazing effort over a number of years and to finish it off like this is amazing. ""I have loved the last cycle. All the players and staff are so great to be around and be involved with. Everybody does their bit, but everyone is slightly different and brings their something important. We just really enjoy each others company and we've got each others backs. Through the highs and lows we just continue to live by the way we want to play and the values we've created."" Alex HartleyEngland spinner on BBC Test Match Special It has been a long winter tour for England and there was some emotion in Heather Knight's voice. They have spent a long time away. They have just lost a World Cup final though, of course she is going to be emotional. It will take a few days before this sinks in. BBC Radio 5 Live Finally from England captain Heather Knight on BBC Radio 5 Live:""It could be a very different side by the time the next 50-over World Cup comes round. I guess it is three years, rather than four years, with the Covid delay. I don't think there will be any emotional decisions but who knows what the next three years hold. ""You'll have to ask me if I'll look back fondly on this tournament in a couple of months I think. Potentially. To not be able to go one more and take home the trophy is gutting and will take some time for the disappointment to settle in."" It was such a complete performance in the end from Australia, proving exactly why they are the best in the world - potentially the best sports team in the world, given their dominance. They had players missing, too, and Ellyse Perry barely had a say in that final. Their strength in depth is remarkable. A word on Alana King, who bowled beautifully for her three wickets. Australia have another gem of a leggie at their disposal for the future. BBC Radio 5 Live England captain Heather Knight on BBC Radio 5 Live:""I was pretty 50/50 at the toss - it was one of those where you wouldn't have been unhappy if you'd lost it. I think it showed it was probably the right decision - it was a good wicket to chase on if we had more wickets at the end there and if someone had batted with Nat [Sciver] you can extend the partnership and there is a chance you can chase it down. There are no regrets and I guess judgement in hindsight is a completely different thing."" Australia batter Alyssa Healy:""That was a special game of cricket, very high scoring but it
was pretty special from our group, something we have worked towards for a long
time. To get it over the line was very cool. ""We knew we had a pretty good total but with their line-up you
never knew. The bowlers held their nerve, Nat Sciver played a very special
innings. ""I was tired (batting), it was nice to get a big total on the board, I am
proud of the batting group and nice to finish it off like this. ""Everyone has worked really hard for this, itâs been a long
five-year wait to win a title people said we should have won before. It's been a
long few months but the girls deserve to let their hair down!"" BBC Radio 5 Live England captain Heather Knight on BBC Radio 5 Live:""Credit to Australia. It was a remarkable innings from Alyssa Healy - to do that in a final and for them to put that on the board was tough. We probably didn't have an answer at times - they batted outstandingly. It was a very good track and it made it very hard to defend. We fought hard in the chase - Nat Sciver was unbelievable, what an innings. We are disappointed but credit to Australia for the way they played today."" Stephan ShemiltBBC Sport's chief cricket writer It may take England four or five years to catch up with the Australians and that is a really scary thought. Alex HartleyEngland spinner on BBC Test Match Special England dropping two chances in the over changed the game. If England had taken those chances it may have been a different game. You can't take anything away from Australia though - they have been absolutely fantastic today and throughout the tournament and they deserve to be world champions. Stay with us for post-match reaction from players, coaches, pundits. We'll also look back on the highlights from that remarkable game. We witnessed two incredible batting performances, one from Alyssa Healy and one from Nat Sciver and it was a privilege to witness them both. Alex HartleyEngland spinner on BBC Test Match Special Australia deserve to be World Cup champions - they have been brilliant throughout this tournament. They have been clinical today. They batted so, so well. Alyssa Healy's century just blew England out of the water. Australia have once again proved why they are the best team in the world. Henry MoeranBBC Test Match Special A stream of green and gold runs onto the field! There's now an embrace as they celebrate a remarkable achievement. Five years ago they crashed out at the semi-final stage and they have rebuilt and come back stronger. The best team in the world will be lifting the World Cup. What a game. Nat Sciver finishes on 148 not out and that is a phenomenal effort. She left everything out on that field and that is not an innings that deserves to be on the losing side. But just look at what it means to Australia. They are delighted, a lot of work has gone in to this victory. An incredible performance. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Princess Beatrice has featured in a legal dispute between a Turkish millionaire and her business adviser A Turkish millionaire claims her payment to Prince Andrew was falsely described as a wedding gift for his daughter Princess Beatrice. Nehebat Isbilen is claiming at the High Court in London that her business adviser Selman Turk ""dishonestly misappropriated"" Â£38m of her assets. Mrs Isbilen paid Â£750,000 to Prince Andrew and claims Mr Turk had wrongly told her bank it was a wedding gift. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by Princess Beatrice or Prince Andrew. The Duke of York has now returned the Â£750,000 to Mrs Isbilen. Mr Turk has rejected the allegations made against him. This complex court case revolves around accusations that Mrs Isbilen's money was fraudulently used by her business adviser, Mr Turk. Prince Andrew pays back cash in financial dispute Prince Andrew: Where does he get his money from? Mrs Isbilen, aged 77, is from a wealthy Turkish business family, but when her politician husband was jailed she wanted advice on moving her assets out of Turkey. Prince Andrew has returned Â£750,000 But the High Court has heard accusations that Mr Turk ""misappropriated"" her assets - and her lawyers have been trying to track down and recover her money. According to court papers, this revealed that ""substantial sums"" had been paid to Prince Andrew and Sarah, Duchess of York. Mrs Isbilen claims Mr Turk advised her to make a ""gift"" of Â£750,000 to Prince Andrew, which she was misled into believing was for assistance with her passport. This amount was transferred from her account on 15 November 2019. ""The representation that Mrs Isbilen needed to make a gift to the Duke of York in connection with her passport [or for any other purpose] was false,"" says her legal team in their claim of dishonesty against Mr Turk. But Mrs Isbilen's testimony in an affidavit also says that she saw an email from Mr Turk to her bank explaining the Â£750,000 payment as being a ""wedding gift"" for the Duke of York's daughter, Princess Beatrice. This claim was ""entirely false"" says Mrs Isbilen in her affidavit. A week before the payment by Mrs Isbilen, Mr Turk's firm had also been a winner of an award at the Pitch at the Palace business initiative, headed by Prince Andrew. Representatives of Prince Andrew have not commented on the ongoing court case. A spokesman for the Duchess of York said: ""The duchess was completely unaware of the allegations that have since emerged against Mr Turk. She is naturally concerned by what has been alleged against him."" The court has heard claims of further payments to the Duke and Duchess of York, via a company called Alphabet Capital. According to court documents, about Â£900,000 of Mrs Isbilen's money was paid into this company in two payments, despite her claim: ""I did not know about or authorise either of these payments."" This company then made payments to Prince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah, with Peters and Peters, the law firm representing Mrs Isbilen, claiming Prince Andrew received Â£350,000 and the Duchess of York Â£225,000. The discovery of payments to Prince Andrew emerged after a court order allowed a search of Mr Turk's financial dealings. Court papers show that some of the expenditure had been attributed by Mr Turk to professional costs and unsuccessful investments, but there were claims of significant amounts still to be explained. Jonathan Tickner, Mrs Isbilen's lawyer, said she had been ""the victim of serious fraud and financial wrongdoing"", and was determined to pursue her claim against all those involved. Court documents show that Mr Turk has disputed the allegations and disagrees with Mrs Isbilen's understanding of how her assets have been handled.

"Shocking images of bodies of civilians in the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv, have led to an outpouring of international condemnation of Russia US President Biden calls Vladimir Putin a war criminal â and says he should face trial over the incidents Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky - on a visit to Bucha - accuses Russian forces of committing genocide The BBC has seen further evidence of civilian killings near Kyiv - a shallow grave where four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces were buried Downing Street says the attacks on civilians are ""barbaric"" and that the UK will push forward on more sanctions and military aid Russia says it rejects ""all allegations"" and is claiming videos have been faked, without providing any evidence Edited by Jude Sheerin Yogita LimayeBBC News Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksander are all said to have been killed In the town of Bucha, just outside Kyiv, the horror of what unfolded during the Russian occupation is finally coming to light. In the basement of a building that once housed a children's community centre, five bodies lay crumpled on the ground - five men dressed in civilian clothes, their hands bound behind their backs. Some were shot in the head, others in the chest. They were yet to be identified, but Ukrainian officials said the men were taken hostage by Russian soldiers and executed. ""We heard them being shot,"" said Vlad, one of the volunteers who carried the bodies up from the basement. ""We heard mines go off in the area. Around us there are mines. We are lucky we are alive."" Read more. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised to zealously pursue allegations of war crimes against Russian forces in occupied regions of the country. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said investigators would do their upmost to identify the perpetrators of alleged atrocities. ""We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible,"" he said. ""This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court."" ""All crimes of the occupiers are documented. The necessary procedural basis is provided for bringing the guilty Russian military to justice for every crime they commit."" The Ukrainian leader added that he had discussed the status of the investigations with EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. More from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been addressing the Ukrainian people from his office in Kyiv. Zelensky accused Russian forces of killing and torturing more than 300 civilians in the formerly occupied city of Bucha, where evidence of alleged Russian war crimes have been discovered. The BBC cannot independently verify this claim. ""We have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done,"" Zelensky said. ""At present, there is information about more than three hundred people killed and tortured in Bucha alone. It is likely that the list of victims will be much larger when the whole city is checked. And this is only one city."" ""There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities,"" he went on. ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago. The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will address an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said it is in Kyiv's interest to have an open and transparent investigation into the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha. ""I would like to emphasise that we are interested in the
most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which
will be known and explained to the entire international
community,"" Zelensky said. Airbnb has completed its cancellation of operations in Russia and Belarus. The policy was announced on 3 March, preventing new reservations in the two countries
from that point forward, though the home rental company allowed a month for reservations that had already been booked. Travellers located in Russia and Belarus are unable to book stays at other Airbnb listings. The policy was first announced after Russian shelling sparked a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia. Belarus has served as a staging post for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. US and Spanish agents seized the ship on Monday US authorities say they have seized a yacht belonging to Viktor Vekselberg, an ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin. According to a warrant, the Ukrainian-born oligarch violated 2018 sanctions placed on him by the US. He was again sanctioned last month after Russia's invasion. The 78-meter (255ft) luxury vessel named Tango and valued at $90m (Â£70m) was held in a raid by Spanish  police on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, following a US request. The action was the first from the newly-created US Justice Department initiative dubbed Task Force KleptoCapture, which was created to punish Russian oligarchs for violating US sanctions. Officials allege Vekselberg continued to make payments through US banks for the support and maintenance of the Tango. ""Today marks our task forceâs first seizure of an asset belonging to a sanctioned individual with close ties to the Russian regime. It will not be the last,â said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. Civilians who fled Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, to safer regions should wait several more days before returning, the city's mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, has said, according to Reuters. ""Firstly, there is currently a round-the-clock curfew in the Kyiv region,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Secondly, in certain towns near Kyiv, it's likely that Russian occupiers left landmines, and there are [likely] a lot of unexploded munitions."" Earlier, we reported that Klitschko brandedthe killings near the Ukrainian capital as horror scenes. Authorities in the Brovary, Bucha and Vyshhorod districts of the wider Kyiv region have also said that a curfew will remain in place until April 7, Ukrainian media report. They said that Ukrainian forces would spend the coming days clearing the area of ""explosive 'surprises' left behind by the invaders"". The Ukrainian intelligence service has published what itâ claims is a list of Russian personnel ""who committed war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha"". The list, published on the website of the Ministry of Defense, included the names, dates of birth, passport numbers and ranks of about 2,000 servicemen. A message read: ""Remember! All war criminals will be brought to justice for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine."" It comes after senior government sources told the BBC that the UK government is considering action to target captains, majors, and colonels in the Russian military. The measures could include sanctions as well as ways to hold individuals legally accountable forâ any crimes committed in Ukraine. Russiaâs ambassador to UN has insisted no civilians were harmed during the month-long Russian occupation of the Ukrainian town of Bucha - and accused Ukraine of fabricating evidence. As we've been reporting,the bodies of dozens of civilians as well as a mass gravehave been found following the withdrawal of Russian troops. But, speaking at a press conference in New York, Vasily Nebenzia said it was ""staged provocation"" by Western countries. He also accused the UK of ""unprecedented abuse"" in its role this month as president of the UN Security Council, said it was refusing to allow Russia to bring the Bucha incidents up. The BBC has verified footage in Buchain recent days and found the bodies in the streets would have been there for a number of days, and while the town was under Russian control. The BBC's Yogita Limaye visited the basement of a home in Bucha where the bodies of five men wearing civilian clothes were left. They had their hands bound behind their backs and appeared to have been shot. She also saw a shallow grave in the village of Motyzhyn - west of Kyiv - that contained the bodies of four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent A weekend of appalling images and harrowing stories has triggered a fresh wave of international outrage, and, inevitably, talk of more sanctions. No concrete announcements yet, butJoe Biden said those were coming and that heâd been right, in mid-March, to condemn Vladimir Putin in the harshest terms. War crimes trials may have to wait, but leaders agree new sanctions are needed. Franceâs president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for more measures to target Russian oil and coal. Germanyâs chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said Mr Putin and his supporters would, in his words, âfeel the consequencesâ of what happened in Bucha. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, said Germany was working towards an embargo on Russian energy, but that it couldnât happen immediately. The small Baltic republic of Lithuania is leading the way. After years of reducing its heavy reliance on Russian gas, its government announced, on Sunday, that imports had finally been reduced to zero. ""If we can do it,"" the countryâs president said, ""the rest of Europe can too"". The UK's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said tough new sanctions will be announced at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers later this week. After meeting her Ukrainian counterpart in Warsaw, she said these would include banning Russian ships from western ports, cracking down further on Russian banks and going after new industries which she said were filling Mr Putinâs war chest, including gold. Since the withdrawal of Russian troops from Bucha, horrific images of bodies lying in the streets and accounts of killings have emerged. The reports have sparked widespread condemnation and the United Nations has called for an independent investigation into what happened in the town. Ukraine accused Russia of a ""deliberate massacre"" but Russia called it ""a staged provocation by the Kyiv regime"". It made a series of unfounded claims about the footage from Bucha, including that people shown are not actually dead and that no civilians in Bucha were harmed. The BBC has fact checked the claims. Read thefull report here.  The US State Department says the US is supporting a multi-national team of international prosecutors going to the region to collect, preserve and analyse evidence, at the request of Ukrainian officials. The aim is to pursue criminal accountability against Russia, a spokesperson for the State Department said. ""Those responsible for atrocities must be held accountable as must those who ordered them. ""They cannot and will not act with impunity."" They said the US is tracking and documenting atrocities and sharing information with institutions working to hold responsible those accountable.  France is the latest country to decide to expel Russian diplomatic staff, after its foreign ministry announced it was expelling many Russian diplomats. ""Their actions go against our national security interests,"" the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. ""This move is part of a European initiative."" The French news agency AFP quoted a source close to the Foreign Ministry as saying 35 people would be expelled. It follows a similar decision taken by Germanywhich expelled 40 Russian envoysover the killings of civilians in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. HARDtalkBBC News programme This video can not be played Ukraine war: Bucha massacre is a game changer - Ukraine foreign minister The killings in Bucha should be a ""game changer"" for the support the West is willing to provide Ukraine, the country's foreign minister has said. Speaking to the BBC's Hardtalk programme, Dmytro Kuleba said: ""The Bucha massacre should
remove any kind of hesitation and reluctance in the West to provide Ukraine
with all necessary weapons... to defend our country and to free it from the
Russian occupants."" He said additional support should include planes, tanks, multiple launch rocket systems, and armoured vehicles as well as a strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Kuleba added that the outcome of the war would be decided not only on the battleground, but in the ""offices in Europe and
North America"" where decisions about the level of additional support will be taken. ""I'm ready to exchange every word of sympathy
and admiration for a tank or a plane that will help me, or or an embargo on gas
and oil that will help me to save human lives in Ukraine,"" he said. A mass grave has been found outside a church in Bucha More now from the joint press conference this afternoon between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. In addition to calling for a ""tough new wave of sanctions"" from the UK and its allies to stop Putin's war efforts, Truss backed Kuleba's call for Russia to be expelled from the European Human Rights Council after ""appalling crimes"" including the killing of civilians in Bucha. Kuleba said any G7 and EU nations countries that ""still have doubts"" and are continuing to trade with Russia - by buying fossil fuels, for example - should make their minds up by visiting any of the mass graves in Ukraine. The horrors seen in Bucha are ""just the tip of the iceberg"" of what war crimes have been committed by Russian forces, Kuleba added. ""I can tell you without exaggeration, but with great sorrow, that the situation in Mariupol is much worse,"" he said. Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, which has been reduced to rubble by weeks of Russian shelling. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live reporter Olha Sukhenko, her son Oleksander and husband Igor were found dead more than a week after going missing As we've been reporting, a family who disappeared in their village west of Kyiv last month have been found dead in a shallow grave. Our correspondent, Yogita Limaye,visited the site, located in a wood near destroyed homes. Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksanderare alleged to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers.A fourth body was also found but has not been identified. Russian forces took Olha - who served as the head of her village of Motyzhyn - and her family  from their home on 23 March, an investigation by the Ukrainian chief prosecutor found. In Olha's last Facebook post before her death, posted in late February after the Russian invasion, she talked about there being ""someone else's scum in our village"" and warned residents to keep calm and not to leave their houses. Two days after the family were allegedly disappeared by Russian forces, a woman called Daria appealed on social media for information on their whereabouts, saying they were her ""second family"" and ""helped people to the end"". She said Russian forces had stolen Oleksander's car and were ""riding around the village"". After it emerged that the family had been killed, Daria posted
an update: I don't have enough words and strength to describe how I and my
whole family feel. This is a crime - in every sense. All involved will beappear
incourt. Referring to Oleksander, she wrote: Sasha, myHero.
You didn't leave your parents behind. You will forever be in my heart. In our
hearts. Heroes don't die. We've been hearing about the possibility of more sanctions against Russia in response to discoveries of civilian killings in northern Ukraine. New European sanctions could include measures targeting the Russian energy sector, according to European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni. ""Nothing is off the table and I think that this is more true now than ever,"" he said before a meeting with eurozone finance ministers to discuss possible new sanctions. Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron called for further sanctionstargeting Russia's coal and oil exports, telling French media there were âclear indications of war crimes"". He did not mention targeting Russian gas, which accounts forabout 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. Tom BatemanReporting from Zaporizhzhia Weâve arrived at a refugee staging centre in the city of Zaporizhzhia at the same time as a long convoy of cars. Theyâve driven here across Russian lines from the south. Many have white cloth or scarves tied to the wing-mirrors to stop them being targeted.

"Edible Oils Ltd bottles cooking oils for 75% of the UK's retail market The biggest cooking oil bottler for UK shops has said it only has a few weeks' supply of sunflower oil left. Ukraine and Russia produce most of the world's sunflower oil and the war is disrupting exports, said Edible Oils. The company, which packages oil for 75% of the UK retail market, is ramping up supplies of other oils for shoppers. Meanwhile, manufacturers of foods that contain sunflower oil, like crisps, oven chips and cereal bars, are reworking their recipes. The Food Standards Agency has advised people with allergies to look out for extra information from shops and food makers. Kim Matthews, commercial director at Edible Oils said 80% of the global supply of sunflower oil comes out of Russia and Ukraine. ""So obviously, with everything going on out there, we physically can't get sunflower to be coming out of the country,"" he said. Kim Matthews is commercial director of Edible Oils which usually fills 32 million bottles of sunflower oil a year If you buy any cooking oil on the supermarket shelves, chances are it has come from the Edible Oils plant in Erith, on the outskirts of south-east London. It bottles oil for brands and retailers own label products. ""From a UK consumer perspective, sunflower oil is the biggest oil. It's used more than anything else,"" said Mr Matthews. ""It's a fast moving situation. We're still trying to see if we can get some more but it's looking very tight."" Edible Oils Ltd has upped production to 24/7 to try to make sure it has plenty of rapeseed and other oils to put on the shelves when the sunflower oil goes. ""Sunflower is great because you can cook at high temperatures. Rapeseed is very similar. You can do exactly the same with it,"" he said. But it was far from clear when sunflower oil supplies will be back to normal, he said. ""At the moment, Ukrainian farmers should be sowing the seeds now for the harvest in October and November. ""Clearly that's not going to happenâ¦ we're probably going to miss the season so we could be impacted for 12-18 months."" The recipes for hundreds of food products are being reformulated due to the lack of sunflower oil Sunflower oil can also be found in many hundreds of products, like ready meals, biscuits and mayonnaise. Food manufacturers are now racing to find alternative ingredients. The British Snack Company makes a small but popular range of hand cooked crisps for sale in pubs. After potatoes, its other key ingredient is sunflower oil. ""The supply of sunflower oil is something that we've always taken for granted,"" said founder Tom Lock. Shortly after the invasion, he had to quickly come up with a plan B and has already switched to rapeseed oil, which is very similar. ""There's an incredible scramble. Everyone's doing the same thing. So while sunflower oil is impossible to get at the moment, rapeseed oil is possible but difficult to get as well obviously because everyone's having the same idea, as prices are skyrocketing at the moment."" Tom Lock has switched to rapeseed oil to cook his crisps Rapeseed is used far more in the food supply chain, according to the National Edible Oil Distributors' Association. British farmers grow rapeseed but there won't be enough to go round. ""Prices for rapeseed oil have risen 50-70% since the attack,"" said NEODA's President Gary Lewis. ""But there's a limited supply to cover all this demand so some shortfall will be expected."" Mr Lock's crisp business had to pay through the nose because otherwise he would have run out of crisps, which makes up more than two-thirds of his sales. He says he'll absorb the costs as much as he can, but if the situation carries on he'll have to increase prices. One immediate headache he and other food manufacturers don't have to worry about is labelling. They're being allowed to switch ingredients without having to print new packaging, which can take up to 12 weeks. Emily Miles, chief executive at the Food Standards Agency, said allergic reactions to rapeseed oil were""very rare and if they do occur are mild"",,externaland advised anyone with allergies to look out for extra information. Ged Futter said the UK's food supply issues were a once in a lifetime situation For grocery expert, Ged Futter, the food industry is now grappling with supply issues not experienced since the end of World War Two. ""Retailers and suppliers have to work much more closely than they ever have before and to be much more flexible in their approach to make sure the products are on the shelf,"" he said. ""The immediate focus is sunflower oil and rapeseed oil, but there will be many more products which will be affected over the coming months. It's some of the ingredients you don't even think about, like starch, which comes from wheat."" He believes thousands of products will have to be reformulated. Mr Futter runs a business advising suppliers on how to deal with retailers. He says the ripple effects from the war are creating ""scarily high"" price rises, adding to already rising prices on the supermarket shelves. ""I think the level of food inflation we are now going to be seeing will be in excess of 15%.""

"Aleksandar Vucic's Progressive SNS party came to power in 2012 It may not be the first time that a household fridge has made a prominent appearance in an election campaign. But when Serbia's president emerged in a couple's kitchen in a promotional video, it raised hackles as well as eyebrows. With barely a shiver, Aleksandar Vucic proceeded to reel off a list of his Progressive Party's achievements during their decade in power. The ad was supposed to poke fun at the president's critics. They complain that Mr Vucic is ubiquitous and they did not see the funny side. As far as Serbia's opposition parties are concerned, the president's frequent - and usually positively framed media appearances - are evidence of an unhealthy relationship between the Progressive Party and the country's most popular newspapers and broadcasters. They say that makes it hard to challenge a party that has won the last four parliamentary elections, and is looking for a hat-trick of presidential victories in Sunday's elections. ""The regime is in absolute control of the media,"" complains Borko Stefanovic, deputy leader of the centre-left Party of Freedom and Justice. Election monitor CRTA reports that representatives of the government have gained two-thirds of national TV coverage during the election campaign - and three-quarters of the airtime on news programmes. The Serbian office of anti-corruption organisation Transparency International refers to ""the media dominance of Aleksandar Vucic and his [candidate] list"". The monitors complain that Mr Vucic has blurred the lines between his presidential duties and campaign activities. They cite as an example the opening in March of the first section of a new, high-speed rail line between Belgrade and Budapest. The president is accused of using the opening of a high-speed rail link to Budapest to further his campaign As the pristine Swiss-built train sped towards Serbia's second city, Novi Sad, camera crews jostled around the first-class leather seats where Mr Vucic was hosting Hungary's Prime Minister, Viktor Orban. On arrival, a crowd of thousands was waiting to hear an address from the two leaders in front of the freshly renovated station. During the return journey, Mr Vucic told the BBC that he had no sympathy with opposition allegations of unfair dominance. ""Do you want me to be helpful to my political opponents in beating me, or what?"" he asked. ""I didn't mention a single name of my political opponents in this campaign. There is no campaign against them - and there is a 24/7 campaign against me. I know one thing: I'm more diligent and more dedicated than them. That's what people here appreciate - and I'm proud of that."" Indeed, political analysts agree that the appeal of Mr Vucic and the Progressives cannot be explained by media ubiquity alone. Aleksandar Vucic's critics say he has turned Serbia into a semi-authoritarian state ""Vucic is remarkably good at delivering on things that ordinary Serbs want to see,"" says James Ker-Lindsay, a Balkans specialist at the London School of Economics. ""From the outside, we see someone who is very authoritarian and there's a lot of concerns about the possibility of illiberal turns. But on the ground, ordinary Serbs talk about the fact that he's delivering economic development and big infrastructure projects. These are the things that many ordinary Serbs think should have been done before under previous administrations, but weren't. It has been rather trickier for Mr Vucic to give voters what they want when it comes to relations with Russia. He is all too aware that many of his party's voters favour traditional ties with Moscow over the European Union membership negotiations that started in 2014. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has turned a long-running balancing act into more of a tightrope walk, without a safety net. Serbia has declined to join EU sanctions against Moscow - but did vote in favour of UN resolutions condemning the invasion. There have been demonstrations against Russia's war as well as in favour. This video can not be played Watch as thousands of pro-Russia Serbs march through the centre of Belgrade Mr Vucic has made ""peace and stability"" something of a catchphrase during the campaign - though if he is re-elected, Brussels is likely to increase the pressure on Belgrade to choose where its loyalties lie: East or West. Natasa Kandic, founder of Belgrade's Humanitarian Law Centre, agrees that the president is a ""pragmatic politician"" who has won popularity through attracting foreign investment which has brought ""jobs and salaries"". But an atomised opposition has also helped his cause. ""The main problem is that there is no democratic opposition,"" says Ms Kandic. ""How can you win without a strong leader?"" That problem has persisted since the Democratic Party lost power in 2012 and splintered into multiple, competing factions. Most of those parties boycotted the last elections in 2020, claiming the conditions for a free and fair vote didn't exist. That just allowed the Progressives to consolidate their hold on power. This time around, there's no opposition boycott. Parties from across the political spectrum have signed up to a coalition called United Serbia in a joint campaign against the Progressives. Their candidate for president is a former general, Zdravko Ponos. He is a conservative figure - which illustrates the awkward nature of the opposition alliance. In essence, all they have in common is a desire to dethrone Mr Vucic - and analysts doubt that will be enough to appeal to the electorate. After 10 years and six elections, Serbia's people already know plenty about the Progressive Party. Sunday's vote will show whether they buy the president's vision of progress - or accept the opposition's line that it is a manipulated media mirage.

Edible Oils Ltd has upped production to 24/7 to try to make sure it has plenty of rapeseed and other oils to put on the shelves when the sunflower oil goes. ""Sunflower is great because you can cook at high temperatures. Rapeseed is very similar. You can do exactly the same with it,"" he said. But it was far from clear when sunflower oil supplies will be back to normal, he said. ""At the moment, Ukrainian farmers should be sowing the seeds now for the harvest in October and November. ""Clearly that's not going to happenâ¦ we're probably going to miss the season so we could be impacted for 12-18 months."" The recipes for hundreds of food products are being reformulated due to the lack of sunflower oil Sunflower oil can also be found in many hundreds of products, like ready meals, biscuits and mayonnaise. Food manufacturers are now racing to find alternative ingredients. The British Snack Company makes a small but popular range of hand cooked crisps for sale in pubs. After potatoes, its other key ingredient is sunflower oil. ""The supply of sunflower oil is something that we've always taken for granted,"" said founder Tom Lock. Shortly after the invasion, he had to quickly come up with a plan B and has already switched to rapeseed oil, which is very similar. ""There's an incredible scramble. Everyone's doing the same thing. So while sunflower oil is impossible to get at the moment, rapeseed oil is possible but difficult to get as well obviously because everyone's having the same idea, as prices are skyrocketing at the moment."" Tom Lock has switched to rapeseed oil to cook his crisps Rapeseed is used far more in the food supply chain, according to the National Edible Oil Distributors' Association. British farmers grow rapeseed but there won't be enough to go round. ""Prices for rapeseed oil have risen 50-70% since the attack,"" said NEODA's President Gary Lewis. ""But there's a limited supply to cover all this demand so some shortfall will be expected."" Mr Lock's crisp business had to pay through the nose because otherwise he would have run out of crisps, which makes up more than two-thirds of his sales. He says he'll absorb the costs as much as he can, but if the situation carries on he'll have to increase prices. One immediate headache he and other food manufacturers don't have to worry about is labelling. They're being allowed to switch ingredients without having to print new packaging, which can take up to 12 weeks. Emily Miles, chief executive at the Food Standards Agency, said allergic reactions to rapeseed oil were""very rare and if they do occur are mild"",,externaland advised anyone with allergies to look out for extra information. Ged Futter said the UK's food supply issues were a once in a lifetime situation For grocery expert, Ged Futter, the food industry is now grappling with supply issues not experienced since the end of World War Two. ""Retailers and suppliers have to work much more closely than they ever have before and to be much more flexible in their approach to make sure the products are on the shelf,"" he said. ""The immediate focus is sunflower oil and rapeseed oil, but there will be many more products which will be affected over the coming months. It's some of the ingredients you don't even think about, like starch, which comes from wheat."" He believes thousands of products will have to be reformulated. Mr Futter runs a business advising suppliers on how to deal with retailers. He says the ripple effects from the war are creating ""scarily high"" price rises, adding to already rising prices on the supermarket shelves. ""I think the level of food inflation we are now going to be seeing will be in excess of 15%.""

"Shocking images of bodies of civilians in the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv, have led to an outpouring of international condemnation of Russia US President Biden calls Vladimir Putin a war criminal â and says he should face trial over the incidents Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky - on a visit to Bucha - accuses Russian forces of committing genocide The BBC has seen further evidence of civilian killings near Kyiv - a shallow grave where four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces were buried Downing Street says the attacks on civilians are ""barbaric"" and that the UK will push forward on more sanctions and military aid Russia says it rejects ""all allegations"" and is claiming videos have been faked, without providing any evidence Edited by Jude Sheerin Yogita LimayeBBC News Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksander are all said to have been killed In the town of Bucha, just outside Kyiv, the horror of what unfolded during the Russian occupation is finally coming to light. In the basement of a building that once housed a children's community centre, five bodies lay crumpled on the ground - five men dressed in civilian clothes, their hands bound behind their backs. Some were shot in the head, others in the chest. They were yet to be identified, but Ukrainian officials said the men were taken hostage by Russian soldiers and executed. ""We heard them being shot,"" said Vlad, one of the volunteers who carried the bodies up from the basement. ""We heard mines go off in the area. Around us there are mines. We are lucky we are alive."" Read more. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised to zealously pursue allegations of war crimes against Russian forces in occupied regions of the country. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said investigators would do their upmost to identify the perpetrators of alleged atrocities. ""We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible,"" he said. ""This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court."" ""All crimes of the occupiers are documented. The necessary procedural basis is provided for bringing the guilty Russian military to justice for every crime they commit."" The Ukrainian leader added that he had discussed the status of the investigations with EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. More from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been addressing the Ukrainian people from his office in Kyiv. Zelensky accused Russian forces of killing and torturing more than 300 civilians in the formerly occupied city of Bucha, where evidence of alleged Russian war crimes have been discovered. The BBC cannot independently verify this claim. ""We have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done,"" Zelensky said. ""At present, there is information about more than three hundred people killed and tortured in Bucha alone. It is likely that the list of victims will be much larger when the whole city is checked. And this is only one city."" ""There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities,"" he went on. ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago. The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will address an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said it is in Kyiv's interest to have an open and transparent investigation into the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha. ""I would like to emphasise that we are interested in the
most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which
will be known and explained to the entire international
community,"" Zelensky said. Airbnb has completed its cancellation of operations in Russia and Belarus. The policy was announced on 3 March, preventing new reservations in the two countries
from that point forward, though the home rental company allowed a month for reservations that had already been booked. Travellers located in Russia and Belarus are unable to book stays at other Airbnb listings. The policy was first announced after Russian shelling sparked a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia. Belarus has served as a staging post for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. US and Spanish agents seized the ship on Monday US authorities say they have seized a yacht belonging to Viktor Vekselberg, an ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin. According to a warrant, the Ukrainian-born oligarch violated 2018 sanctions placed on him by the US. He was again sanctioned last month after Russia's invasion. The 78-meter (255ft) luxury vessel named Tango and valued at $90m (Â£70m) was held in a raid by Spanish  police on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, following a US request. The action was the first from the newly-created US Justice Department initiative dubbed Task Force KleptoCapture, which was created to punish Russian oligarchs for violating US sanctions. Officials allege Vekselberg continued to make payments through US banks for the support and maintenance of the Tango. ""Today marks our task forceâs first seizure of an asset belonging to a sanctioned individual with close ties to the Russian regime. It will not be the last,â said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. Civilians who fled Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, to safer regions should wait several more days before returning, the city's mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, has said, according to Reuters. ""Firstly, there is currently a round-the-clock curfew in the Kyiv region,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Secondly, in certain towns near Kyiv, it's likely that Russian occupiers left landmines, and there are [likely] a lot of unexploded munitions."" Earlier, we reported that Klitschko brandedthe killings near the Ukrainian capital as horror scenes. Authorities in the Brovary, Bucha and Vyshhorod districts of the wider Kyiv region have also said that a curfew will remain in place until April 7, Ukrainian media report. They said that Ukrainian forces would spend the coming days clearing the area of ""explosive 'surprises' left behind by the invaders"". The Ukrainian intelligence service has published what itâ claims is a list of Russian personnel ""who committed war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha"". The list, published on the website of the Ministry of Defense, included the names, dates of birth, passport numbers and ranks of about 2,000 servicemen. A message read: ""Remember! All war criminals will be brought to justice for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine."" It comes after senior government sources told the BBC that the UK government is considering action to target captains, majors, and colonels in the Russian military. The measures could include sanctions as well as ways to hold individuals legally accountable forâ any crimes committed in Ukraine. Russiaâs ambassador to UN has insisted no civilians were harmed during the month-long Russian occupation of the Ukrainian town of Bucha - and accused Ukraine of fabricating evidence. As we've been reporting,the bodies of dozens of civilians as well as a mass gravehave been found following the withdrawal of Russian troops. But, speaking at a press conference in New York, Vasily Nebenzia said it was ""staged provocation"" by Western countries. He also accused the UK of ""unprecedented abuse"" in its role this month as president of the UN Security Council, said it was refusing to allow Russia to bring the Bucha incidents up. The BBC has verified footage in Buchain recent days and found the bodies in the streets would have been there for a number of days, and while the town was under Russian control. The BBC's Yogita Limaye visited the basement of a home in Bucha where the bodies of five men wearing civilian clothes were left. They had their hands bound behind their backs and appeared to have been shot. She also saw a shallow grave in the village of Motyzhyn - west of Kyiv - that contained the bodies of four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent A weekend of appalling images and harrowing stories has triggered a fresh wave of international outrage, and, inevitably, talk of more sanctions. No concrete announcements yet, butJoe Biden said those were coming and that heâd been right, in mid-March, to condemn Vladimir Putin in the harshest terms. War crimes trials may have to wait, but leaders agree new sanctions are needed. Franceâs president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for more measures to target Russian oil and coal. Germanyâs chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said Mr Putin and his supporters would, in his words, âfeel the consequencesâ of what happened in Bucha. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, said Germany was working towards an embargo on Russian energy, but that it couldnât happen immediately. The small Baltic republic of Lithuania is leading the way. After years of reducing its heavy reliance on Russian gas, its government announced, on Sunday, that imports had finally been reduced to zero. ""If we can do it,"" the countryâs president said, ""the rest of Europe can too"". The UK's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said tough new sanctions will be announced at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers later this week. After meeting her Ukrainian counterpart in Warsaw, she said these would include banning Russian ships from western ports, cracking down further on Russian banks and going after new industries which she said were filling Mr Putinâs war chest, including gold. Since the withdrawal of Russian troops from Bucha, horrific images of bodies lying in the streets and accounts of killings have emerged. The reports have sparked widespread condemnation and the United Nations has called for an independent investigation into what happened in the town. Ukraine accused Russia of a ""deliberate massacre"" but Russia called it ""a staged provocation by the Kyiv regime"". It made a series of unfounded claims about the footage from Bucha, including that people shown are not actually dead and that no civilians in Bucha were harmed. The BBC has fact checked the claims. Read thefull report here.  The US State Department says the US is supporting a multi-national team of international prosecutors going to the region to collect, preserve and analyse evidence, at the request of Ukrainian officials. The aim is to pursue criminal accountability against Russia, a spokesperson for the State Department said. ""Those responsible for atrocities must be held accountable as must those who ordered them. ""They cannot and will not act with impunity."" They said the US is tracking and documenting atrocities and sharing information with institutions working to hold responsible those accountable.  France is the latest country to decide to expel Russian diplomatic staff, after its foreign ministry announced it was expelling many Russian diplomats. ""Their actions go against our national security interests,"" the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. ""This move is part of a European initiative."" The French news agency AFP quoted a source close to the Foreign Ministry as saying 35 people would be expelled. It follows a similar decision taken by Germanywhich expelled 40 Russian envoysover the killings of civilians in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. HARDtalkBBC News programme This video can not be played Ukraine war: Bucha massacre is a game changer - Ukraine foreign minister The killings in Bucha should be a ""game changer"" for the support the West is willing to provide Ukraine, the country's foreign minister has said. Speaking to the BBC's Hardtalk programme, Dmytro Kuleba said: ""The Bucha massacre should
remove any kind of hesitation and reluctance in the West to provide Ukraine
with all necessary weapons... to defend our country and to free it from the
Russian occupants."" He said additional support should include planes, tanks, multiple launch rocket systems, and armoured vehicles as well as a strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Kuleba added that the outcome of the war would be decided not only on the battleground, but in the ""offices in Europe and
North America"" where decisions about the level of additional support will be taken. ""I'm ready to exchange every word of sympathy
and admiration for a tank or a plane that will help me, or or an embargo on gas
and oil that will help me to save human lives in Ukraine,"" he said. A mass grave has been found outside a church in Bucha More now from the joint press conference this afternoon between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. In addition to calling for a ""tough new wave of sanctions"" from the UK and its allies to stop Putin's war efforts, Truss backed Kuleba's call for Russia to be expelled from the European Human Rights Council after ""appalling crimes"" including the killing of civilians in Bucha. Kuleba said any G7 and EU nations countries that ""still have doubts"" and are continuing to trade with Russia - by buying fossil fuels, for example - should make their minds up by visiting any of the mass graves in Ukraine. The horrors seen in Bucha are ""just the tip of the iceberg"" of what war crimes have been committed by Russian forces, Kuleba added. ""I can tell you without exaggeration, but with great sorrow, that the situation in Mariupol is much worse,"" he said. Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, which has been reduced to rubble by weeks of Russian shelling. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live reporter Olha Sukhenko, her son Oleksander and husband Igor were found dead more than a week after going missing As we've been reporting, a family who disappeared in their village west of Kyiv last month have been found dead in a shallow grave. Our correspondent, Yogita Limaye,visited the site, located in a wood near destroyed homes. Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksanderare alleged to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers.A fourth body was also found but has not been identified. Russian forces took Olha - who served as the head of her village of Motyzhyn - and her family  from their home on 23 March, an investigation by the Ukrainian chief prosecutor found. In Olha's last Facebook post before her death, posted in late February after the Russian invasion, she talked about there being ""someone else's scum in our village"" and warned residents to keep calm and not to leave their houses. Two days after the family were allegedly disappeared by Russian forces, a woman called Daria appealed on social media for information on their whereabouts, saying they were her ""second family"" and ""helped people to the end"". She said Russian forces had stolen Oleksander's car and were ""riding around the village"". After it emerged that the family had been killed, Daria posted
an update: I don't have enough words and strength to describe how I and my
whole family feel. This is a crime - in every sense. All involved will beappear
incourt. Referring to Oleksander, she wrote: Sasha, myHero.
You didn't leave your parents behind. You will forever be in my heart. In our
hearts. Heroes don't die. We've been hearing about the possibility of more sanctions against Russia in response to discoveries of civilian killings in northern Ukraine. New European sanctions could include measures targeting the Russian energy sector, according to European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni. ""Nothing is off the table and I think that this is more true now than ever,"" he said before a meeting with eurozone finance ministers to discuss possible new sanctions. Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron called for further sanctionstargeting Russia's coal and oil exports, telling French media there were âclear indications of war crimes"". He did not mention targeting Russian gas, which accounts forabout 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. Tom BatemanReporting from Zaporizhzhia Weâve arrived at a refugee staging centre in the city of Zaporizhzhia at the same time as a long convoy of cars. Theyâve driven here across Russian lines from the south. Many have white cloth or scarves tied to the wing-mirrors to stop them being targeted. One has a makeshift red cross painted on a white piece of paper in the windscreen. Many are families. One woman is in tears as she tells me of her relief at fleeing to relative safety.

The horrors seen in Bucha are ""just the tip of the iceberg"" of what war crimes have been committed by Russian forces, Kuleba added. ""I can tell you without exaggeration, but with great sorrow, that the situation in Mariupol is much worse,"" he said. Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, which has been reduced to rubble by weeks of Russian shelling. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live reporter Olha Sukhenko, her son Oleksander and husband Igor were found dead more than a week after going missing As we've been reporting, a family who disappeared in their village west of Kyiv last month have been found dead in a shallow grave. Our correspondent, Yogita Limaye,visited the site, located in a wood near destroyed homes. Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksanderare alleged to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers.A fourth body was also found but has not been identified. Russian forces took Olha - who served as the head of her village of Motyzhyn - and her family  from their home on 23 March, an investigation by the Ukrainian chief prosecutor found. In Olha's last Facebook post before her death, posted in late February after the Russian invasion, she talked about there being ""someone else's scum in our village"" and warned residents to keep calm and not to leave their houses. Two days after the family were allegedly disappeared by Russian forces, a woman called Daria appealed on social media for information on their whereabouts, saying they were her ""second family"" and ""helped people to the end"". She said Russian forces had stolen Oleksander's car and were ""riding around the village"". After it emerged that the family had been killed, Daria posted
an update: I don't have enough words and strength to describe how I and my
whole family feel. This is a crime - in every sense. All involved will beappear
incourt. Referring to Oleksander, she wrote: Sasha, myHero.
You didn't leave your parents behind. You will forever be in my heart. In our
hearts. Heroes don't die. We've been hearing about the possibility of more sanctions against Russia in response to discoveries of civilian killings in northern Ukraine. New European sanctions could include measures targeting the Russian energy sector, according to European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni. ""Nothing is off the table and I think that this is more true now than ever,"" he said before a meeting with eurozone finance ministers to discuss possible new sanctions. Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron called for further sanctionstargeting Russia's coal and oil exports, telling French media there were âclear indications of war crimes"". He did not mention targeting Russian gas, which accounts forabout 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. Tom BatemanReporting from Zaporizhzhia Weâve arrived at a refugee staging centre in the city of Zaporizhzhia at the same time as a long convoy of cars. Theyâve driven here across Russian lines from the south. Many have white cloth or scarves tied to the wing-mirrors to stop them being targeted. One has a makeshift red cross painted on a white piece of paper in the windscreen. Many are families. One woman is in tears as she tells me of her relief at fleeing to relative safety. 

Inside a tent, bread, dumplings and hot tea are being handed out. Children at a refugee staging centre in the city of Zaporizhzhia Thereâs a board containing pictures of the missing and appeals for help to reach those stranded in the besieged city of Mariupol. âHelp us to pick up our parents from Mariupol!â, urges one notice, adding an address next to black and white photos of an elderly couple, Natalia and Evgenii. âSon Vladimir is waiting for them."" This video can not be played Ukraine war: President Zelensky visits site of alleged atrocities in Bucha If you're just joining us, here's the latest as more evidence emerges of atrocities on the ground in Ukraine - and the world reacts: Civilian killings and fears of worse to come  International condemnation  This video can not be played US seeks more sanctions on ""war criminal"" Putin US President Joe Biden has called for Russian President Vladimir Putin to face trial over the killings of civilians in Bucha. ""This guy is brutal,"" Biden said, adding that he's seeking to bring in more sanctions against the Kremlin. The US president previously caused outrage in Moscow when he first accused Putin of war crimes last month. ""Well the truth of the matter, you saw what happened in Bucha - he is a war criminal... but we have to gather all the detail so this can have a war crimes trial,"" Biden said. Â© 2025 BBC.

Alex HartleyEngland spinner on BBC Test Match Special We often talk about the domestic set-up - Australia have a professional domestic set-up for five or six years longer than England have. England only started a couple of years and the first year, realistically, was heavily impacted by Covid. We've had professional players in England for one year effectively and that is only 10 or 15 games - it isn't many at all. This Australia side have played domestic cricket for years and years - they've got over 150 domestic games and experience under their belt. It will take a while for England to catch up, but they are not a million miles away, and I guess that is the exciting thing. We've got the likes of India, West Indies and New Zealand who are all investing in their domestic set-up. This World Cup has probably been the closest in terms of competition but Australia have absolutely walked it. It may have been a comprehensive win for Australia but there is plenty for England to take away from this. Sophie Ecclestone's rise to world number one, the emergence of Charlie Dean, Nat Sciver's batting heroics and Sophia Dunkley's growth as a middle order batter. The futures of some of England's older players remain undecided but with a big year of cricket ahead, they've got a promising blend of youth and experience to work with. Unsurprisingly, Alyssa Healy is named Player of the Match and Player of the Tournament for her incredible tally of 509 runs across the campaign, including centuries in both the semi-final and that incredible 170 today. Up there with the greatest ODI innings of all time. A masterclass. BBC Radio 5 Live Australia captain Meg Lanning on BBC Radio 5 Live:""I'm really pleased with that. This tournament has been a long time coming to be fair - it has been in the back of our minds and there are no doubts that we wanted this trophy in our cabinet. It has been an amazing effort over a number of years and to finish it off like this is amazing. ""I have loved the last cycle. All the players and staff are so great to be around and be involved with. Everybody does their bit, but everyone is slightly different and brings their something important. We just really enjoy each others company and we've got each others backs. Through the highs and lows we just continue to live by the way we want to play and the values we've created."" Alex HartleyEngland spinner on BBC Test Match Special It has been a long winter tour for England and there was some emotion in Heather Knight's voice. They have spent a long time away. They have just lost a World Cup final though, of course she is going to be emotional. It will take a few days before this sinks in. BBC Radio 5 Live Finally from England captain Heather Knight on BBC Radio 5 Live:""It could be a very different side by the time the next 50-over World Cup comes round. I guess it is three years, rather than four years, with the Covid delay. I don't think there will be any emotional decisions but who knows what the next three years hold. ""You'll have to ask me if I'll look back fondly on this tournament in a couple of months I think. Potentially. To not be able to go one more and take home the trophy is gutting and will take some time for the disappointment to settle in."" It was such a complete performance in the end from Australia, proving exactly why they are the best in the world - potentially the best sports team in the world, given their dominance. They had players missing, too, and Ellyse Perry barely had a say in that final. Their strength in depth is remarkable. A word on Alana King, who bowled beautifully for her three wickets. Australia have another gem of a leggie at their disposal for the future. BBC Radio 5 Live England captain Heather Knight on BBC Radio 5 Live:""I was pretty 50/50 at the toss - it was one of those where you wouldn't have been unhappy if you'd lost it. I think it showed it was probably the right decision - it was a good wicket to chase on if we had more wickets at the end there and if someone had batted with Nat [Sciver] you can extend the partnership and there is a chance you can chase it down. There are no regrets and I guess judgement in hindsight is a completely different thing."" Australia batter Alyssa Healy:""That was a special game of cricket, very high scoring but it
was pretty special from our group, something we have worked towards for a long
time. To get it over the line was very cool. ""We knew we had a pretty good total but with their line-up you
never knew. The bowlers held their nerve, Nat Sciver played a very special
innings. ""I was tired (batting), it was nice to get a big total on the board, I am
proud of the batting group and nice to finish it off like this. ""Everyone has worked really hard for this, itâs been a long
five-year wait to win a title people said we should have won before. It's been a
long few months but the girls deserve to let their hair down!"" BBC Radio 5 Live England captain Heather Knight on BBC Radio 5 Live:""Credit to Australia. It was a remarkable innings from Alyssa Healy - to do that in a final and for them to put that on the board was tough. We probably didn't have an answer at times - they batted outstandingly. It was a very good track and it made it very hard to defend. We fought hard in the chase - Nat Sciver was unbelievable, what an innings. We are disappointed but credit to Australia for the way they played today."" Stephan ShemiltBBC Sport's chief cricket writer It may take England four or five years to catch up with the Australians and that is a really scary thought. Alex HartleyEngland spinner on BBC Test Match Special England dropping two chances in the over changed the game. If England had taken those chances it may have been a different game. You can't take anything away from Australia though - they have been absolutely fantastic today and throughout the tournament and they deserve to be world champions. Stay with us for post-match reaction from players, coaches, pundits. We'll also look back on the highlights from that remarkable game. We witnessed two incredible batting performances, one from Alyssa Healy and one from Nat Sciver and it was a privilege to witness them both. Alex HartleyEngland spinner on BBC Test Match Special Australia deserve to be World Cup champions - they have been brilliant throughout this tournament. They have been clinical today. They batted so, so well. Alyssa Healy's century just blew England out of the water. Australia have once again proved why they are the best team in the world. Henry MoeranBBC Test Match Special A stream of green and gold runs onto the field! There's now an embrace as they celebrate a remarkable achievement. Five years ago they crashed out at the semi-final stage and they have rebuilt and come back stronger. The best team in the world will be lifting the World Cup. What a game. Nat Sciver finishes on 148 not out and that is a phenomenal effort. She left everything out on that field and that is not an innings that deserves to be on the losing side. But just look at what it means to Australia. They are delighted, a lot of work has gone in to this victory. An incredible performance. Â© 2025 BBC.
