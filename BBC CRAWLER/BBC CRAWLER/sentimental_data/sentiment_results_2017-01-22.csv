"Australian Open 2017 Venue:Melbourne Park, MelbourneDates:16-29 Jan Coverage:Daily live commentary on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text on selected matches on the BBC Sport website; TV highlights on BBC Two and online from 21 January. Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray have so much shared history. And now, in the space of just four days in Melbourne, the world's top two players have both been on the receiving end of upsets almost without parallel in the past 10 years. Former players were cheeringMischa Zverevon from the locker room - not because of any antipathy towards Murray, but because his opponent was playing the style of tennis many of them used to play to great effect. Serving and volleying against the Briton seems counter-intuitive. Along with Djokovic, he is the best returner in the world - and if he does not manage to pass you, then he is more than likely to send a top spin lob fizzing over your head to within inches of the baseline. But Zverev served superbly, and volleyed even better, again and again and again. The German hit some astonishing returns and made short shrift of Murray's second serve. And when the pressure started to rise, his level did not start to fall. Pinned behind the baseline too frequently for comfort, Murray started missing more regularly. The Scot was unable to turn the tide or summon up the aggression that served him so well in the second half of last season. Melbourne defeat tough to take - Murray Murray knocked out of Australian Open Has Djokovic's obsession burnt itself out? Watch: Cash reflects on Djokovic exit Andre Agassi addressed this subject before the match. The four-time Australian Open champion was very complimentary about Murray in a video link to Melbourne Park on Saturday, as he explained how the 29-year-old could improve still further. ""I have always sort of talked about Andy as a person that has never really utilised his game to his maximum potential. He's so good at certain things that it almost makes him a bit indecisive,"" Agassi said. ""If you actually minimised his defensive skills just 5%, he might even actually be a better player. ""He puts himself through unnecessary wear and tear on a court, because his offensive upside is, I think, still more than he shows."" This video can not be played Australian Open: Andy Murray on shock defeat by Mischa Zverev Murray says he will now reflect on whether he could have done anything differently to prepare for the first Grand Slam of the year. He only had time for two weeks off after a frenetic end to last season, and must now balance the need for rest with his instinctive desire to play in Great Britain's Davis Cup first-round tie in Canada the week after next. Murray suggested in the immediate aftermath of defeat that he intends to play in Ottawa, but his coaching team may well argue he should take a longer break before heading to Dubai in late February. The first two Masters events of the year follow in Indian Wells and Miami. There is no immediate threat to Murray's world number one ranking - he will be 1,715 points ahead of Serb Djokovic when the list is refreshed at the end of the Australian Open. He is certain to be number one until at least May because he has just a handful of ranking points to defend between now and the start of the clay court season. This video can not be played Djokovic stunned by world number 117 Can anything further be read into the early exits of both Murray andDjokovic,who will both have turned 30 by the time the next Grand Slam is staged at Roland Garros in four months? Ageing players are once again doing very well at this Australian Open, with half of the 12 men left in the draw on Sunday night older than the pair of them. And yet in the modern era, men have found it tricky to win Grand Slam titles in their thirties. Stan Wawrinka and Agassi have each done it twice, but even Roger Federer has managed it only once. Mats Wilander, who won the last of his seven Grand Slam titles at the age of 24, explains why it can become harder to find the consistency required over seven rounds. ""You have good days and you have bad days when you get older,"" Wilander told BBC Sport. ""You don't have to call on anything when you are younger - it's just there naturally. You don't worry about the consequences, you just play and you fight until the bitter end. I think the mind gets in your way when you get older."" There are still three Grand Slam champions left in the draw, withFederer,Wawrinka andRafael Nadalall now over 30. The younger challenge is led by Milos Raonic, Dominic Thiem and Grigor Dimitrov. Along with Federer - who will not now have to face Murray in the quarter-finals - it may be Raonic who takes most heart from Sunday's events. You will not find him at the net as often as Zverev, but he did add the 1996 Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek to his team in December with the explicit intention of trying to move forward on a more regular basis. We are a long way from declaring a new serve-and-volley era, but Melbourne Park's quicker courts have contributed to an enthralling first week - unless, that is, you happen to be ranked number one or two in the world.

"The revelation of a reported malfunction during the test firing of a Trident missile in June is widely covered in Monday's press. TheDaily Mail says it is likely the unarmed missile was made to crash,externalharmlessly into the sea but the ""fiasco"" caused major panic in Downing Street. Prime Minister Theresa May, reports the Times, will face intense pressure,externalto answer charges of a cover-up after she refused to say whether she knew about the incident when questioned on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. TheDaily Mirror describes it as ""May's Missile crisis"",external, saying in a leading article the ""official news blackout only fans suspicions this was a serious failure"". TheGuardian, which leads with the story,,externalsays critics of Trident may now seize on the failure to argue that the debate about renewing the system should be reopened. Several papers report international trade will be one of the big issues when Theresa May meets Donald Trump on Friday. TheTimes thinks it is a historic chance,externalto make the case for genuine free trade, and an advantageous deal with Britain. TheDaily Telegraph says Mrs May and Mr Trump will hold talks over a deal that slashes tariffs,externaland makes it easier for hundreds of thousands of workers to move between the two countries. Kevin Maguire of the Daily Mirror thinks Mrs May is ""a fool"" for flitting over to America,external""to be photographic cover for a divisive, lying, racist, sexual predator"". ButTrevor Kavanagh of the Sun,externalsays the ""world is a reality show... and Britain has woken up as one of the biggest stars"". He sees opportunities, and dangers, and has this advice: ""Hold tight... We are in for the ride of our lives."" Elsewhere,Mrs May has penned an article for the i explaining her new industrial strategy.,external She refers to seeking a brighter future after Brexit, and making Britain a country that works for everyone.  And she invites ""the industries of the future"" to tell the government what they need in order to grow and prosper. The lead story in the Sun refers to aFood Standards Agency warning of a link between burned starchy foods and cancer,external- that pizza, chips and toast ""are killers"". The headline on the front of paper is stark: ""You've had your chips."" But not everyone is willing to agree. The  Daily Express asks: ""Do scientists actually want us to lead miserable lives?"" Alcohol, then sugar, fat, and now crispy roast potatoes.  ""Why can't people be left to lead their own lives without others meddling?"" Few things, says the Daily Telegraph, bring families together on a cold winter's day like a Sunday roast.,externalAnd the paper cannot be enthusiastic about boiled beef, with steamed vegetables but no Yorkshire pudding or wine. Acartoon in the Daily Mail shows an insolent boy smoking,external.  His concerned mother says: ""And remember, if anyone offers you a crunchy roast potato at the party - you know what to say."" Meanwhile, the Guardian has reassurance for shoppers,externalwho have been unable to find lettuce, spinach, or courgettes on their supermarket shelves. Vast amounts of rain in south-eastern Spain, then heavy snow, wiped out much of their crops.  But now, the farmers of Murcia believe the worst is over, and normal production looks set to resume, it reports.

"In the space of 24 hours, Washington was the scene of two Americas. President Trump's supporters came feeling they've just taken their country back. The protesters on the women's march feel they have just lost theirs. It is that stark. The mood at the march was determinedly cheerful, there were men, children and lots and lots of women. Grandmothers teaching their granddaughters the political ropes. But the underlying message was clear - liberal America has just been shoved out of power. These marches were enormous and they came out in cities across the country to repudiate not just Donald Trump, but his whole world view. They didn't just protest about women's issues, there were also signs addressing his positions on climate change, healthcare and Muslims. Carmen Perez, Gloria Steinem, Linda Sarsour and (front row) Mia Ives-Rublee Can they change President Trump's agenda? Probably not. But approval ratings matter - they are a form of political capital and when this many people really dislike the new president, that makes it harder for him to persuade members of Congress to support him on difficult issues. The polls show us that Mr Trump is the most unpopular new president in American history. Those are the facts. These marches put faces to those numbers.

"For such a divisive figure, Donald Trump managed to unify hundreds of thousands of Americans at the Women's March on Washington. Moments after Mr Trump was sworn in as the 45th president on Friday, he delivered a thundering speech in which he promised to improve the lives of millions of Americans. A day later, throngs of women, men and children streamed into the same area where he made that pledge, in order to take a stand for gender and racial equality. Though Mr Trump's named was mentioned frequently, the march, which organisers estimate attracted more than half a million, was not only about the new US president. Messages ranged from ""Thank you for making me an activist Trump"" to ""We will not be silenced,"" but the common thread throughout the patchwork of signs was hope. ""It's about solidarity and visualising the resistance,"" said Jonathon Meier, who took a bus from New York. ""And I think it not only helps with the healing process, but it gives me hope for the next four years."" Washington rally leads Trump protests Obama asks: What shall I do now? This video can not be played Washington DC is leading anti-Trump protests around the world. A sea of activists, some clad in knitted,pink ""pussy"" hatsand others draped in American flags, ambled about the National Mall, stopping to catch a glimpse of some of the high-profile speakers and singing along to songs like ""This Little Light of Mine"". Peppered among the many protest signs were images of ovaries and female genitals, a nod to concerns over losing access to birth control and abortion care under a Trump administration. Jellema Stewart, who travelled from Buffalo, New York, said she was marching for her grandmother, who died at age 38 during an illegal abortion in the 1950s. ""I'm here to make sure her voice is heard,"" she said. ""I marched in 2004 for reproductive rights and it's now 2017 and we're still fighting for the same thing."" Ms Stewart also said she was energised by thousands at the rally, insisting that it sends a message to the new president. ""He gave racism a voice again,"" she said of Mr Trump. ""So we have to be louder than the racism and discrimination that came out of this election and show him that we are definitely a force. To show him that we count and we will be watching."" This video can not be played Women's March on Washington: The 'pussyhats' explained All eyes across the world seemed to be watching, not only the march in Washington, but the dozens of other sister marches that took place in more than 60 countries. Aerial images showed thousands massing in so-called ""solidarity marches"" in the UK, Canada, and Australia as well as in US cities including New York, Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles. For demonstrator Chrystian Woods, the marches signalled that the US would not be defined by who was in White House. ""It's not about being anti-Trump,"" she explained. ""It's letting the world know that America is more than just that. America is love, inclusiveness and unity and that America is accepting people who are not like us."" ""I believe deeply this country is for all of us,"" said Brooklyn resident Amy Briggs. ""I would have been very dejected yesterday if I wasn't able to be here and experience this solidarity,"" she said as a young female approached her to sign a rainbow flag. The mood was festive among the peaceful protesters, but some were cautious about what comes after the pink hats come off. Leigh Caputo, a Baltimore public school teacher, said she did not want people to think a march was the only solution. ""I'm hopeful that this [march] mobilises people because there's a lot of work to be done,"" said Ms Caputo. In the months leading up to the event, the organisers faced intense scrutiny over claims that the name exploited past African-American movements and catered to white women. Critics on Facebook told white women to ""check their privilege"", leading to heated discussions about racial divisions and what the march could achieve. It is difficult to ignore the fact that 53% of white women did vote for Mr Trump while the female half of more than 90 million eligible voters did not cast a ballot at all.  So what about the sea of white women at the march? Lesley Mansfield, who travelled from Sante Fe, New Mexico, agreed that it was puzzling that so many women voted for Mr Trump. ""It's a reality we have to be aware of,"" she said. ""But being here reminds us that there are people who think like we do - like the majority who voted for Hillary Clinton."" Those sobering statistics did not seem to loom over those in attendance on Saturday, and like the Trump supporters who stood in the same spot 24 hours earlier, they were full of hope for America's future.

"(l-r) Sophie Pegg, Jasmine Graham, Nancy Pegg, Shamira Graham joined the Women's March in London ""Stand united, we will never be divided,"" was the message chanted by the crowd as people marched through central London. Cheers erupted every few minutes as the crowd held up placards to the beat of drum and bass music from a portable sound system. ""Girls just wanna have fundamental rights"", ""Women won't be trumped"" and ""Burn bras not bridges"" were some of the messages directed at US President Donald Trump from the UK. Women - and men - of all ages descended on the capital for the Women's March in London on the first full day of his presidency. There was a united message from the crowd, who came with glitter on their faces and even fancy dress to take part in the two-mile walk. Many were parents who said they wanted to send out a message for the next generation that they have a voice and can stand up for the women's rights they believe to be under threat from the new US administration. Danae Savvidou said she had attended the march for her 10-month-old daughter Mum-of-one Danae Savvidou, 25, travelled alone from Gloucestershire to London to take part in the event for the sake of her 10-month-old daughter. She said: ""She was born during the presidency of a man who openly supported women's rights and protected them. ""I feel like we've gone back 100 years and I feel sad for her generation. ""Donald Trump isn't presidential material. He's openly misogynistic and racist as well. I see America as a leader and partners in the Western world. He represents such a big nation. ""Our leaders over here are right wing as well. It's not going the right way for me. ""Brexit is a concern. I hope we protect the rights the EU offers, such as employment rights and maternity. These issues need to be spoken about. When a nation is doing badly, women suffer. ""Personally I want my daughter to see what I've done today to show you can do things to change the world and she does have the power."" It was a message which resonated with many other parents as they walked with their children in the fresh winter's air along Piccadilly. The march had many parents attending with their children Nancy Pegg, 39, a mum-of-two from south-west London, came along with her daughter Sophie, nine, who carried a yellow banner emblazoned with the words ""Yes to equality"". She said: ""This is about equality for girls not in a fortunate position. ""Trump is a concern but empowering women is the main motivation. I think it's important for my daughter to have a powerful voice and to know she can be a strong force. ""We live in a male-dominated world. I want to show her anything her brother can do, she can do too. There are no boundaries."" Although the event was labelled a Women's March, there were hundreds of men in the crowd showing their support. Car horns beeped to galvanise the demonstrators who, in turn, greeted the drivers with cheers as the march progressed to its rally in Trafalgar Square. The Raise Voices Choir motivated the protesters by singing ""Don't let Trump get his way"" to their own version of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"". Patrick Bone (l) and his friend Twyla Doone Student Patrick Bone, from Shepherd's Bush, London, attended because he felt ""progress made in the last decades is in threat of being eroded"". He added: ""Trump's election signalled a rise of the populist right who look to blame economic problems on minorities or disenfranchised groups. ""His election was a catalyst for something that's been coming a long time. ""This march is to show we will stand and be counted. This is only the beginning. The work begins today."" Tom Amies, 33, a doctor from Middlesex, walked beside his wife Lydia, 34, as he carried their 11-month-old daughter Niamh in a baby carrier sling. ""This is for my daughter, he said. ""There has been a political slide to the right and a sense of misplaced trust. Trump wants to repeal Obamacare. It shows how good we have it with the NHS. ""There are going to be people there who have that healthcare for life-saving treatment and they will no longer be able to afford it."" Lydia Amie, husband Tom and daughter Niamh attended the march as a family The demonstration brought representatives from all nationalities, including Americans who felt they needed to take a stand even though they were thousands of miles away from their country. Retired banker Carol Moore, 68, originally from New York, came to represent the Democrats Abroad UK Women's Caucus. She said: ""I've come because of the horror of seeing Donald Trump win. He is divisive and will hurt the middle classes by repealing the healthcare act. ""This march has taken on huge visibility here in the UK because the issues are global. Women's pay was an issue when I worked in the City. ""There is still the issue of sexual violence and how it's prosecuted and handled here. ""I hope this is a message to women to recognise they have a voice to fight issues here in the UK and around the world."" (l-r) Stacey De Souza, Rachel Callander, Anna McDermott Business development manager Anna McDermott, 29, originally from California, has been in the UK for 11 years. She said: ""As an American, I cannot accept what Donald Trump says and I can't accept him as a president. ""I do hope this sends out a message. 'Good morning. Welcome to day one of the resistance. This is the world shouting back'."" As the crowd moved into Trafalgar Square, the noise quietened so demonstrators could listen to the speakers on the stage, who included TV presenter Sandi Toksvig and Labour MP Yvette Cooper. However, the final address was given by 10-year-old Sumayah Siddiqi who read out a poem to the crowd which had a message of optimism with the words ""I shall stand for love"".

"The UK is set for a hard Brexit from the EU So the UK, it seems, is headed out of the European Union's single market, perhaps also out of the customs union. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she wants to preserve barrier-free trade between the UK and the EU as far as possible. One option that has been floated, if the two sides can't agree a comprehensive free trade agreement, is sectoral deals. They might cover cars, for example, or perhaps financial services. But there is a problem with this approach:  World Trade Organization rules. Perhaps the most fundamental idea behind the WTO's rule book is non-discrimination. It goes by the rather confusing name of ""most favoured nation"". It is Article 1 of the WTO's main legal agreement. It means that you must give the same degree of access to your home market that you give to the most favoured nation to all WTO members. A favour for one should be given to all. You should not discriminate for or against any WTO member. There are a few situations where the rules allow countries to depart from this principle - the one that is relevant here is for free-trade areas and customs unions (the two have important similarities, but are not the same). The World Trade Organization is based in Geneva and came into being in 1995 The WTO's rule book says the member countries ""recognise the desirability of increasing freedom of trade by the development, through voluntary agreements, of closer integration between the economies of countries parties to such agreements"". So a trade agreement between the UK and the EU would be allowed under WTO rules, in fact welcomed, even though it is something that is intrinsically discriminatory. It would involve the EU and the UK discriminating in favour of each other against outside countries. Of course, the EU itself has the same effect, offering EU members better access to each other's markets than is available to either China or the United States, for example. But there is a catch. The WTO rules say such agreements should cover ""substantially all the trade"" between the members of the customs union or free-trade area. What does ""substantially all"" mean? There is some case law which touched on this. A dispute between Turkey (which has a customs union agreement with the EU) and India went to the WTO's appeals body, which said in its report: ""It is clear, though, that 'substantially all the trade' is not the same as all the trade, and also that 'substantially all the trade' is something considerably more than merely some of the trade."" Not as cut and dried as you might hope, but all the trade experts I have spoken to say that a deal covering just a few sectors wouldn't qualify. That seems to be reinforced by what a WTO dispute panel said in another case. This one, as it happens was about cars, an agreement between the US and Canada in the 1960s known as the Auto Pact. Nations living in protectionist glass houses shouldn't throw free-trade stones There is one line in the panel's ruling that is particularly relevant here: ""The Auto Pact, nevertheless, is a purely sectoral agreement which does not meet the requirements of Article XXIV:8"" - that is the provision that sets out the ""substantially all the trade"" requirement. So such a narrow sectoral deal might well be vulnerable to challenge in the WTO. But would it actually happen? There seems to be a great deal of reluctance to challenge these agreements. (The India v Turkey and Auto Pact disputes were not fundamentally about the wider trade agreements, but about very specific restrictions that the complaining country thought were against the rules.) More than 600 of them have been notified to the WTO or its predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Many are thought to stretch the credibility of ""substantially all trade"", by having various sectors uncovered. But that makes countries reluctant to challenge others, for fear of shining an unwelcome light on their own agreements. As one senior trade official put it to me: ""It's a glass houses kind of thing."" So a sectoral agreement between the UK and the EU might be challenged, but it would depend on whether any country wanted to do so. Think of cars.  There is another factor that might make a challenge less likely. Japan and the United States have car industries that have a presence in Europe and might well benefit from a deal between the EU and UK. So perhaps we might get away with a narrow trade agreement. Even so, the uncertainty would be unwelcome to the industry concerned. There is also the possibility of simply ignoring any unwelcome WTO ruling. The WTO has no real powers of enforcement. It can allow the other side to retaliate, but it can't arrest the trade minister. On the other hand, the British government appears to be keen on the rules-based system of international trade and would probably be very uncomfortable about defying a ruling. All the more reason, if the UK and the EU are going to have a trade agreement, to get as many sectors covered as possible, to reduce the chances of a WTO challenge.

"In the space of 24 hours, Washington was the scene of two Americas. President Trump's supporters came feeling they've just taken their country back. The protesters on the women's march feel they have just lost theirs. It is that stark. The mood at the march was determinedly cheerful, there were men, children and lots and lots of women. Grandmothers teaching their granddaughters the political ropes. But the underlying message was clear - liberal America has just been shoved out of power. These marches were enormous and they came out in cities across the country to repudiate not just Donald Trump, but his whole world view. They didn't just protest about women's issues, there were also signs addressing his positions on climate change, healthcare and Muslims. Carmen Perez, Gloria Steinem, Linda Sarsour and (front row) Mia Ives-Rublee Can they change President Trump's agenda? Probably not. But approval ratings matter - they are a form of political capital and when this many people really dislike the new president, that makes it harder for him to persuade members of Congress to support him on difficult issues. The polls show us that Mr Trump is the most unpopular new president in American history. Those are the facts. These marches put faces to those numbers.

"Two British officials failed to win favour from German business leaders in Berlin The distinguished audience members were too polite to heckle. But the eye rolling, frowns and audible tutting made it quite clear how the Brexiteers' message was going down with German business leaders. Owen Paterson, a former minister and Conservative MP, and John Longworth, co-chair of Leave Means Leave, came to Berlin on Saturday with a clear mission - to persuade German business leaders to lobby Chancellor Angela Merkel to give Britain a good trade deal. They should have been on safe territory. The two men are confident, witty speakers with impressive business and free-trade credentials. Mr Longworth is a former head of the British Chamber of Commerce. Mr Paterson's years spent trading in Germany meant he could open his address with a few remarks in German - which drew an appreciative round of applause - and a well-judged joke about multilingual trade. But it turned out they had entered the lion's den. Brexiteers in warning to German business Lagarde warns UK of pain ahead as Brexit approaches May: UK will lead world on free trade The laughter from the audience quickly turned to sniggers as they heard the UK described as ""a beacon of open, free trade around the world"". Westminster's decision to leave the world's largest free trade area does not look like that to Germany. When Europe was blamed for spending cuts and a lack of British health care provision, there were audible mutters of irritation from the audience. The occasional light-hearted attempts at EU-bashing - usually guaranteed to get a cheap laugh with some British audiences - was met with stony silence. Brexiteers argue German manufacturers will want to still sell to UK customers In another setting - at another time - this gathering of the elite of Germany's powerful business community would have lapped up the British wit. Every ironic quip would ordinarily have had them rolling in the aisles. But British charm does not travel well these days. Rattled by the economic havoc Brexit could unleash, Germans are not in the mood for gags. Britain used to be seen by continentals as quirky and occasionally awkward - but reliably pragmatic on the economy. However, since the Brexit vote, Europeans suspect endearing eccentricity has morphed into unpredictable irrationality. The UK has become the tipsy, tweedy uncle, who after too much Christmas sherry has tipped over into drunkenly abusive bore. When the audience was asked how many of them welcomed Brexit, only one hand went up - and it turned out that belonged to a businessman who wanted more EU reform and was fed up with Britain slowing things down. Brexiteer rhetoric over the past year has often focused on the size of Britain's market and how keen German manufacturers are to sell to British customers. Many leave campaigners remain convinced that German business leaders will force Mrs Merkel to grant the UK a special free trade deal in order not to lose British trade. But that's not what's happening. Angela Merkel has said Britain will not be able to cherry-pick the best bits of the single market Instead German firms are remarkably united in their support of the chancellor in her rejection of British ""cherry-picking"" - even if it means losing business in the short-term. When you talk to German bosses they say their top priority is in fact the integrity of the single market, rather than hanging on to British customers. That's because their supply chains span across the EU. A German car might be designed in Germany, manufactured in Britain, with components made in various parts of eastern Europe, to be sold in France. This only works if there are no cross-border tariffs, paperwork or red tape. German companies - more often family-owned and with deeper connections to their regional heartlands - tend to look at the wider picture, sometimes thinking more long-term. They supported Mrs Merkel on sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, even though that meant a blow to trade. The financial hit was deemed less bad for business than worsening unrest in nearby Ukraine. The same calculations are being made over Brexit. Theresa May's speech on Brexit last week made front page news in Germany This doesn't mean German business is thinking politically, and not economically. But rather, it indicates a wider attitude towards how business can thrive long-term. German business leaders tell you that the British market may be important. But it is only one market, compared to 27 markets in the rest of the EU. Leave campaigners also still underestimate the political and historical significance of the EU for Germany, where it is seen as the guarantor of peace after centuries of warfare. It is tempting to see the clashes between Westminster and the EU27 as one big decades-long misunderstanding of what the EU is. An idealistic peace-project versus a pragmatic free-trade zone. This makes it even more ironic that London may reject the free-trade area it spent so much time creating. Germany was shocked and saddened by the UK's vote to leave the EU. But the decision was quickly accepted in Berlin. ""The Brits never really wanted to be members of the European Union anyway,"" is something you often hear these days. Many Germans now want to just work out a solution that does the least amount of harm to the European economy. Hence the irritation in Germany when British politicians keep rehashing the pre-referendum debate. ""It was frustrating to hear the same old arguments from the referendum campaign,"" one business leader told me when I asked him what he had thought about Saturday's discussion. Germany has moved on, he said. Maybe Britain should too. The Brexiteers might not have persuaded their audience in Berlin. But if they return to London with a better idea of the mood in Germany's business community, then the trip may well have been worthwhile.

"Mr Spicer is a Washington PR veteran In a 2014 lecture to students at his former high school, Sean Spicer outlined a set of 17 ""rules for life"" that they would be wise to follow. Rule number 16, he told the students at Portsmouth Abbey in Rhode Island: ""Follow your mom's advice: It's not what you say, but how you say it. The tone and tenor of your words count."" The now White House press secretary also told students that they should be true to themselves. Rule number eight, was relevant here,he said,external. ""Trust your gut. If it does not feel right, use caution."" With that guidance in mind, Mr Spicer's bellicose press conference with the White House press corps on Saturday suggests that the new presidential spokesman will not sugar-coat his words over the next four years. While the press secretary-journalist relationship is naturally an adversarial one, Mr Spicer has, in his first few days in the role, already cast himself as being in open conflict with much of the mainstream media, pledging to ""hold the press accountable"". This, it appears, is the frontline of a strategy that White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus described as a will to ""fight back tooth and nail every day"" at supposed media efforts to ""delegitimise"" the president. This video can not be played Sean Spicer, White House press secretary said ""no-one had numbers"" for the inauguration Mr Spicer, 45, is not a new hand at managing negative press coverage. He previously served as spokesman and chief strategist for the Republican National Committee (RNC) and has long criticised coverage of his party and Mr Trump. He took the post of communications director at the RNC in 2011, a time when it ""was deep in debt and had a badly tarnished brand"",according to the Republican Party website,external. He is said to have helped turn around its fortunes by boosting the social media team, leading rapid response efforts to combat attacks, setting up an in-house video and production team and expanding the use of surrogates - people who can publicly appear on behalf of candidates, defend them and boost their appeal. Trump attacks 'dishonest' media How will US media cover President Trump Mr Spicer has not shied away from criticising Mr Trump in the past. In July 2015, speaking on behalf of the RNC after Mr Trump questioned Republican Senator John McCain's status as a war hero, he said that there was ""no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honourably"". Mr Spicer claimed President Trump's inauguration was the ""largest inaugural crowd ever"" He also described Mr Trump's June 2015 comments about Mexican immigrants being rapists and criminals as not being ""helpful to the cause"". Before joining the RNC, he worked as Assistant US Trade Representative for Media and Public Affairs in the George W. Bush administration: a role that involved promoting the kind of free trade that his boss now fiercely criticises as being unfair for the American worker. Still, Mr Spicer was loyal to Mr Trump on the campaign trail even as the path-breaking candidate split the party and many Republican luminaries distanced themselves from him. The broad-shouldered, compulsively gum-chewing Republican (""Two and a half packs by noon,"" he told the Washington Post) is a long-time member of the US Navy Reserve. He received a Masters degree in National Security and Strategic Studies from the Naval War College in Newport in 2012 and is known to be fierce, and deeply competitive. One editor who has been blasted many times by Mr Spicertold the Post,externalthat her young child recognises his voice on the phone and bursts into tears. His wife Rebecca is the chief of communications at the National Beer Wholesalers Association and previously worked in the Bush White House after a career in television news. As press secretary, Mr Spicer will serve as President Trump's most visible spokesman, and is expected to hold daily televised media briefings, though he has spoken of his desire to shake up the way White House media is managed. While he has said that Mr Trump will do press conferences, he also wants to utilise technology to ""have a conversation with the American people and not just limit it through the filter of the mainstream media"". He has also described White House press briefings as having become ""somewhat of a spectacle"".  Many would use that word to describe the first under the Trump administration.

"The group holds regular ""gentlemen's gatherings"" - photoshoots Conflict and militancy may be first things that occur to many about Iraq, but a group of young fashion-conscious Kurds are hoping to help project a brighter, more optimistic image - and perhaps effect social change along the way. The group calls itself Mr Erbil, after the capital of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq that has been at the frontline of the struggle against the militants of the Islamic State (IS) group. Mr Erbil's launch and first photoshoot last February quickly made waves on social media. Dubbed ""gentlemen's gatherings"" in a recentprofile in Vocativ,external, it took place at the city's ancient citadel, a UN world heritage site. Mr Erbil hopes to promote a new image for the region The pictures of the 20 men posing in latest Western men's fashion - specifically, the style recently associated with hipsters, replete with the trademark sharp suits, tight trousers and lovingly trimmed beards - became wildly popular on Instagram. Widely dubbed ""Iraq's first gentleman's fashion club"", Mr Erbil now has some 30 core members and more than 25,000 fans onInstagram,external, and aFacebook,externalpresence too. The style may be Western, but Mr Erbil stress that what they are doing mixes ""modernity"" and cultural heritage, by harking back to the lifestyles of the traditional Kurdish landowning class, the effendis. The favoured style appears to be mostly hipster-inspired According to the Vocativ article, in days past, the ""effendis"" - literally, ""lord"" or ""master"" - would dress in their finest clothes to attend cultural salons or visit tea shops. The group says that the focus of their activity is to organise trade shows and cultural events to promote fashion as ""aesthetic expression"". But it is not just about fashion - there is also a serious, almost political side. Mr Erbil sees itself as something almost akin to a movement representing young Iraqi Kurds who are looking for a better life and want to promote Kurdish culture to the world. The group even hopes to effect social change and challenge traditional attitudes, particularly on women's rights. The Mr Erbil account frequently posts pictures and musings about women's issues in Kurdistan, Iraq and the world. The group's account is very popular on social media The effect Iraq's near-constant conflict has had on women's lives is also a frequent subject. Every Thursday, Mr Erbil writes a post on the ""girl inspiration"", in which they promote women working on behalf of the community. One of them is Dashni Morad, who gives workshops in leadership skills to women who survived the massacre and rape of members of northern Iraq's Yazidi sect by IS militants. ""The effort she puts in for humanity, love and peace is so impressive!"" says a post by Mr Erbil post on 19 January. ""Keep up the good work, you are making us proud.""

"""He reached his arms out for a hug, but he had a switchblade in his hand. He flipped it open and he started stabbing me over and over again."" Melissa Dohme, from Florida, was 20 years old when she was stabbed more than 30 times and left for dead by her ex-boyfriend. ""I later learned from the trauma surgeons that I died on the table several times and they had to resuscitate me over and over,"" she says. Amazingly, Melissa survived.

""There is a great need for a daily regime focused onâ¦ hyper-perfusing the blood with alkalinity,"" the man supervising her treatment, Robert O Young, told her. Inevitably, the treatment failed and Naima later died, aged 27. Young, an alternative health writer, now faces a jail sentence for practising medicine without a licence. Dr Giles Yeo and Tristan Quinn went to California to challenge him about pseudo-science and the manipulation of vulnerable patients. The dying officer treated for cancer with baking soda ""They looked at our curriculum and were horrified by how much we were trying to teach,"" says head teacher Ben McMullen who went to Shanghai to see how maths is taught in primary school there. ""They wouldn't teach fractions until year four or five. By that time, they assume that the children were very fluent in multiplication and division. This is essentially a 'teaching for mastery' approach: covering less and making smaller incremental movements forward, ensuring the class move together as one and that you go over stuff again and again until it's truly understood.""

Evans said he plans to work on his fitness after his Australian Open run came to an end with defeat by Tsonga Evans had to fend off four break points in the first set, while having only one on the Tsonga serve, before threatening to repeat the shocks of earlier rounds by taking the tie-break. However, Tsonga heeded the warning and quickly went 4-0 up in the second set as he began to dominate the Briton with his powerful and accurate hitting. While Evans sporadically threatened the 2008 finalist, and managed 43 winners to Tsonga's 59, the Frenchman was always in control after the first set and won the match with a service game to love. ""Dan played good tennis and he had nothing to lose,"" said Tsonga. ""It was difficult for me because he was hitting the ball really early. After that the game was pretty difficult, then I went over him and finished strong. ""I've played pretty good since the start of the tournament. It will be a good challenge against Stan Wawrinka - he's playing unbelievably."" Birmingham-born Evans described his exploits at the Australian Open as the best and ""most exciting"" week of his tennis career. He now plans to go home before joining up with the Great Britain team for their Davis Cup tie in Canada from 3-5 February. ""I need to maybe get a bit fitter,"" added Evans. ""I think today I was flagging pretty much after the first set. I did feel that. ""My body was sore. Maybe that's something I can improve on a bit. ""But, you know, I've still come a long way from where I was last year."" Leon Smith, Great Britain's Davis Cup captain on BBC Radio 5 live It was just an amazing run for Dan.  He's played unbelievably well. Getting two top 10 wins - beating Dominic Thiem and Marin Cilic in the space of a week - really tells him where he's at just now in terms of his level, never mind his ranking, what his level could be. His schedule suddenly looks a lot different to this time last year when he was setting off to Asia for some Challenger matches and now he can get ready for all the Masters Series events.

"In Cuba's capital, armies of stray cats and dogs prowl the streets. The state does little to look after them, so responsibility lies with the public - as Will Grant found when he befriended a ginger tomcat. My younger sister sometimes reminds me of the apparent indifference I showed when our family cat, Pippit, died in 1991. A slender tabby who lived well beyond her expected years, Pippit enjoyed a long and happy life with us. Finally, at the impressive age of 21, she died just as we returned from a family holiday. Waking up to find that Pippit hadn't lasted the night, I took it upon myself to break the news to my sister. Sensitivity and tact weren't exactly high in my repertoire when I was 15 - I simply crashed into her room with the line: ""Helen, the cat's dead!"" I don't know if you've ever seen anyone wake up and immediately burst into tears, but I should take this opportunity to apologise to Helen for what was probably the meanest thing I did to her when we were growing up. Find us on Facebook,external So, given she has this image of me as callous when it comes to pets - unfair, I hasten to add - she was surprised, when she visited Havana recently, to find just how much Cuba has influenced my attitude towards animals. There are no state-funded pet rescue organisations on this communist island, so caring for neighbourhood strays is down to local businesses or residents. Around a dozen state institutions, from the Central Bank to the Museum of Metalwork, have adopted their own stray dogs. Under the scheme, the homeless hounds are named and duly issued with ID cards, which are placed on their collars to save them from the dog-catcher. Vladimir, a former street dog, with his ID collar in Havana The adoption system operates under the premise that they are now officially considered the government buildings' guard dogs, although the ones I've seen are docile street mutts rather than fierce Rottweilers. The city government does operate a programme for neutering and spaying strays in Old Havana, but the handful of voluntary animal protection organisations that exist simply can't deal with the sheer numbers across the island. Cubans are by and large dog people. There is a pretty significant culture of dog ownership, even among those who are barely scraping by. Cats, on the other hand get a raw deal. Especially stray ones. So, since we arrived in Cuba, we've tried to do our bit. We've already taken in two kittens we found lost and half-drowned during a torrential downpour one night. My girlfriend's mother is now the proud owner of the uniquely named Honorato and Carilda. But for my sister, on her recent visit, it was my relationship with Django which really stood out. A ginger-and-white tomcat, he started life inside our building's parking garage. We would often hear a faint mewing after we parked the car. Django As a kitten, Django would hide deep inside the motor of some diplomat's SUV, seeking refuge by nestling near the carburettor. Once he grew a bit and emerged from the darkness of the car park, he was almost instantly adopted by the building. We would leave food out for him. As would some Russian neighbours. So, apparently, did Sindi, one of the doormen. He looks like he could find a second job as a nightclub bouncer, but fell for the scruffy, soot-stained Django as much as we did. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 BST and Saturdays at 11:30 BST Django was the name my Mum gave the kitten when she came to Havana and it stuck. We were smitten. Evenings would be  interrupted and conversations broken off mid-flow so we could go out and feed him a mixture of leftovers and expensive kibble specially brought in from Mexico. The treatment Django received in our building was well above the experience of most alley cats in Cuba with food regularly provided - if not by one neighbour, then another. Sometimes, both. That brought with it the inevitable interest of other local waifs and strays. At one time there were three or four more trying to get in on the act. Fair enough - it's a dog-eat-dog world out there for a Cuban cat. Still, we began to worry. There is a nasty habit in Cuba of angry neighbours removing a constantly barking dog or an unsightly stray cat by feeding it mince laced with rat-poison. Alternatively - almost as cruelly - the witless pet might be shoved into the back of the car, driven out to the countryside and let out on the roadside, far from home. Noisy neighbourhood dog dealt with, even if the owners are now frantic with worry. In the end, nothing like that befell poor Django. It was a far more inevitable fate, under the wheels of a car thundering down 70th Street. The headlines of 2016 werefull of high-profile deaths. But spare a thought for one of the year's final victims, taken on New Year's Eve in Havana - a much loved, slightly grubby, ginger-and-white street cat called Django.

"This video can not be played The people trying to identify Bosnia's war missing A mid-afternoon congregation of mourners waits outside the mortuary in Visoko, about half an hour's drive from Bosnia's capital, Sarajevo. A funeral parade is due to begin, and finally some families will be able to pay their last respects. Inside the building, work continues on the remains of unidentified victims from Bosnia's conflict of the 1990s. Eight thousand people reported missing have yet to be found - while the remains of 3,000 people exhumed from mass graves still have not been identified. Somewhere between the two figures is the potential to bring solace to thousands of families. Balkans war: a brief guide Srebrenica's survivors mourn fall of Aleppo Town tries to move on from massacre Victims' bodies brought back for burial Both the tiles and the workers' scrubs cast a green tint in the room, where a small group of specialists methodically set about their task. They sit at tables, sifting through evidence that could help identify the missing. Investigators check existing DNA samples and collect new ones with the aim of identifying more victims Bones are set out in neat rows, alongside personal items - tattered Yugoslav-era identity documents, wallets and coins. Some workers squat on the floor, cleaning dirt from fragments of clothing. ""We do a full anthropological re-examination of the case,"" says Dijana Sarzinski, who is managing the ""No Name"" project for the International Commission on Missing Persons. As its title suggests, this is an effort to identify remains that have been kept, unclaimed, in mortuaries across Bosnia. The remains of thousands of Bosnian war victims are yet to be identified ""We reassess previously taken DNA samples, determine whether new DNA samples need to be taken and review all the accompanying documentation. We're trying to find out any bit of information that could lead us to identity."" With the project more than two-thirds complete, the ICMP has so far identified 80 missing people. ""I'm really proud. The ratio may seem small, but those are 80 people that we helped bring home,"" says Ms Sarzinski. Ms Sarzinski says the number of successes has been small but important Smilja Mitrovic hopes the efforts will help her to identify and bury her son, Dragan. He was a 19-year-old conscript in the Bosnian Serb army who was two days away from completing his military service when he disappeared in September 1995. On a visit to the ICMP's Sarajevo headquarters, she explains that hers is more than simply a personal quest. ""The missing persons issue is an open and painful issue that Bosnia is struggling with,"" she says. The next step will need to be approached with some considerable delicacy. It involves collecting blood samples from relatives of people who were identified visually, before the ICMP developed its world-leading DNA-testing technology. If there is a positive match with the unidentified remains, it may mean the wrong body was buried all those years ago. But this would offer an opportunity to set matters right. Families would be able to lay the correct remains to rest - and Bosnia might move a little closer towards reconciliation.

"(l-r) Sophie Pegg, Jasmine Graham, Nancy Pegg, Shamira Graham joined the Women's March in London ""Stand united, we will never be divided,"" was the message chanted by the crowd as people marched through central London. Cheers erupted every few minutes as the crowd held up placards to the beat of drum and bass music from a portable sound system. ""Girls just wanna have fundamental rights"", ""Women won't be trumped"" and ""Burn bras not bridges"" were some of the messages directed at US President Donald Trump from the UK. Women - and men - of all ages descended on the capital for the Women's March in London on the first full day of his presidency. There was a united message from the crowd, who came with glitter on their faces and even fancy dress to take part in the two-mile walk. Many were parents who said they wanted to send out a message for the next generation that they have a voice and can stand up for the women's rights they believe to be under threat from the new US administration. Danae Savvidou said she had attended the march for her 10-month-old daughter Mum-of-one Danae Savvidou, 25, travelled alone from Gloucestershire to London to take part in the event for the sake of her 10-month-old daughter. She said: ""She was born during the presidency of a man who openly supported women's rights and protected them. ""I feel like we've gone back 100 years and I feel sad for her generation. ""Donald Trump isn't presidential material. He's openly misogynistic and racist as well. I see America as a leader and partners in the Western world. He represents such a big nation. ""Our leaders over here are right wing as well. It's not going the right way for me. ""Brexit is a concern. I hope we protect the rights the EU offers, such as employment rights and maternity. These issues need to be spoken about. When a nation is doing badly, women suffer. ""Personally I want my daughter to see what I've done today to show you can do things to change the world and she does have the power."" It was a message which resonated with many other parents as they walked with their children in the fresh winter's air along Piccadilly. The march had many parents attending with their children Nancy Pegg, 39, a mum-of-two from south-west London, came along with her daughter Sophie, nine, who carried a yellow banner emblazoned with the words ""Yes to equality"". She said: ""This is about equality for girls not in a fortunate position. ""Trump is a concern but empowering women is the main motivation. I think it's important for my daughter to have a powerful voice and to know she can be a strong force. ""We live in a male-dominated world. I want to show her anything her brother can do, she can do too. There are no boundaries."" Although the event was labelled a Women's March, there were hundreds of men in the crowd showing their support. Car horns beeped to galvanise the demonstrators who, in turn, greeted the drivers with cheers as the march progressed to its rally in Trafalgar Square. The Raise Voices Choir motivated the protesters by singing ""Don't let Trump get his way"" to their own version of ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"". Patrick Bone (l) and his friend Twyla Doone Student Patrick Bone, from Shepherd's Bush, London, attended because he felt ""progress made in the last decades is in threat of being eroded"". He added: ""Trump's election signalled a rise of the populist right who look to blame economic problems on minorities or disenfranchised groups. ""His election was a catalyst for something that's been coming a long time. ""This march is to show we will stand and be counted. This is only the beginning. The work begins today."" Tom Amies, 33, a doctor from Middlesex, walked beside his wife Lydia, 34, as he carried their 11-month-old daughter Niamh in a baby carrier sling. ""This is for my daughter, he said. ""There has been a political slide to the right and a sense of misplaced trust. Trump wants to repeal Obamacare. It shows how good we have it with the NHS. ""There are going to be people there who have that healthcare for life-saving treatment and they will no longer be able to afford it."" Lydia Amie, husband Tom and daughter Niamh attended the march as a family The demonstration brought representatives from all nationalities, including Americans who felt they needed to take a stand even though they were thousands of miles away from their country. Retired banker Carol Moore, 68, originally from New York, came to represent the Democrats Abroad UK Women's Caucus. She said: ""I've come because of the horror of seeing Donald Trump win. He is divisive and will hurt the middle classes by repealing the healthcare act. ""This march has taken on huge visibility here in the UK because the issues are global. Women's pay was an issue when I worked in the City. ""There is still the issue of sexual violence and how it's prosecuted and handled here. ""I hope this is a message to women to recognise they have a voice to fight issues here in the UK and around the world."" (l-r) Stacey De Souza, Rachel Callander, Anna McDermott Business development manager Anna McDermott, 29, originally from California, has been in the UK for 11 years. She said: ""As an American, I cannot accept what Donald Trump says and I can't accept him as a president. ""I do hope this sends out a message. 'Good morning. Welcome to day one of the resistance. This is the world shouting back'."" As the crowd moved into Trafalgar Square, the noise quietened so demonstrators could listen to the speakers on the stage, who included TV presenter Sandi Toksvig and Labour MP Yvette Cooper. However, the final address was given by 10-year-old Sumayah Siddiqi who read out a poem to the crowd which had a message of optimism with the words ""I shall stand for love"".

"Donald Trump has already pulled off a series of presidential ""firsts"" Donald Trump is guaranteed to make history as the 45th president of the United States. And whether you love or loathe him, it's a fact that the Republican will set a range of records as soon as he occupies the Oval Office. From his age to his bank balance, via his notable lack of pets - here are just some of ""The Donald's"" historic ""firsts"". Donald Trump celebrated his 70th birthday on 14 June, which makes him the oldest man in US history to assume the presidency. The previous record-holder, Ronald Reagan, was 69 when he took office in 1981. Perhaps keen to allay fears about his senior status, the business mogulhad his doctor prepare a gushing letterpledging that he would be ""the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency"". Right-wing Indian activists celebrate The Donald's 70th birthday in New Delhi The average age of all 44 previous incoming presidents is a sprightly 55. The youngest ever incumbent - Theodore Roosevelt - got the job aged 42 years and 322 days, after President William McKinley's assassination in 1901. Mr Trump is the first billionaire president. Exact estimates of his personal wealth vary, with Forbes putting it at $3.7bn (Â£3bn) and the man himself claiming in a statement that it's ""in excess of TEN BILLION DOLLARS"". Many of America's past presidents have also been extremely wealthy, of course. Recent estimates say George Washington's estate would be worth half a billion in today's dollars. Donald Trump has said he will take only a dollar in salary - like former governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger (L) Before his 1963 assassination, JFK reportedly lived off a $10m trust fund thanks to the vast wealth of his father - investor and alleged bootlegger Joseph P Kennedy, Sr. Mr Trump will be following in the footsteps of former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger bytaking just a symbolic dollar as a salary. When Mr Trump began unveiling his cabinet picks, the number with fat wallets quickly drew the scorn of Democrats. ""Donald Trump's administration: of, by and for the millionaires and billionaires,"" tweeted Vermont Senator and Democrat presidential contender Bernie Sanders. For better or worse, this will be the wealthiest administration in modern American history. Trump picks America's 'richest cabinet' Ethics concerns swirl around Trump team According to the Washington Post,external, commerce secretary nominee Wilbur Ross is worth around $2.5bn on his own - roughly 10 times what George W Bush's first cabinet were worth in 2001, when the media branded them an assembly of millionaires. Treasury appointee Steven Mnuchin quite literally bought a bank after 17 years at Goldman Sachs, and reports put his wealth at over $40m. It has been estimated that the cabinet could be good for an eye-watering $35bn, all told.As Quartz pointed out,external, this is more than the annual gross domestic product of Bolivia. Mr Trump's triumph is also significant because, until now, no-one has been elected president in more than 60 years without experience as a state governor or in Congress. The last president with no political experience, Dwight Eisenhower, was Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in World War Two, before he was elected to office in 1953. Some Trump voters saw his lack of political experience as a guarantee of authenticity But as Mr Trump tells it, his lack of links to the Washington establishment is an asset not a flaw - and more than made up for by his experience as a deal-maker. Mr Trump has named his son-in-law, real estate developer Jared Kushner, as a senior adviser - promptingcries of nepotism from opponents. Some claim the appointment makes the 36-year-old the most powerful presidential son-in-law in US history. A list of Trump's potential conflicts Trump hands Scottish businesses to sons What now for Ivanka Trump? He isn't the first to fit that profile, however. President Woodrow Wilson's Treasury Secretary, William Gibbs McAdoo, was also married to his daughter, Eleanor. First Daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are set to wield considerable clout That said, their case pre-dates America's 1967 anti-nepotism statute, and Mr McAdoo was already a cabinet secretary when he wed. Ivanka Trump, Mr Trump's elder daughter and wife of Mr Kushner, is also being spoken of as the most influential ""First Daughter"" ever. So much fuss has been made of what Donald Trump owns that you might have missed one glaring absence - a pet. It looks likely that he'll be the first US President in over a century not to have an animal pal in the White House, after plans to have him adopt a goldendoodle dog reportedly fell through. According to the Presidential Pet Museum,external, almost every commander-in-chief has had a pet, and some had a virtual menagerie. John F Kennedy stands out for owning a veritable Noah's Ark - everything from a rabbit named Zsa Zsa to a canary called Robin - but the crown belongs to Calvin and Grace Coolidge (White House occupants from 1923-1929), who the museum says ""quite literally had a zoo"". Barack Obama's Portuguese Water Dog, Bo, is among the more traditional pets to live at the White House Their animal companions included at least a dozen dogs, a donkey named Ebenezer, and various creatures presented as gifts by foreign dignitaries - among them lion cubs, a wallaby, a pygmy hippo named Billy, and a black bear. Donald Trump won the presidency on a pro-job platform, and has blamed free-trade policies for the collapse of the US manufacturing industry. This is a rare stance for a US president, probably last seen in his fellow Republican Herbert Hoover in the 1930s. In September 2015, Mr Trump told the Economist China is ""killing us"",external, and that millions of Americans are ""tired of being ripped off"". He said that as president, he would consider a 12% import tax to make the Chinese ""stop playing games"". US to quit Pacific trade deal - Trump What is the Trans-Pacific Partnership? During his election campaign, Mr Trump also threatened to rip up Nafta, the free trade agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, which has been in place for 23 years. The Republican has long been opposed to the TPP, which he views as a poor deal for the US He also vowed that the US would quit the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, a 12-nation agreement, on his first day in the White House. Former model Melania Trump is as trailblazing as her husband. She will be the first presidential spouse from Slovenia, and the first non-native English speaker. She is only the second FLOTUS born outside the US, though - the first being Louisa Adams, wife of the sixth US President, John Quincy Adams (1825-1829), who was born in London. As Mr Trump has been married twice before, Melania will also be the first third wife to reside in the White House. The only other US president to have divorced was Ronald Reagan, who split from his first wife, actress Jane Wyman, long before leading the nation. Designers split over dressing Melania Is Melania's White House snub unusual? Melania speaks Slovenian, English, French, German, and Serbian, and may be the most competent linguist to hold the role of FLOTUS.

"As a pro-coal president strides into the White House, the rest of the world is rallying in defence of the climate. Donald Trump has called climate change ""a hoax"" and filled his cabinet with representatives of fossil fuel industries. One of the world's leading climate scientists told me she was positively scared about his potential impact on the planet. But so far the leaders who joined with President Barack Obama in Paris in 2015 to sign the global climate deal are standing firm. As Mr Trump ponders pulling out of the UN climate deal, China, India, Germany, the EU and the UK have all reaffirmed their promise to curb CO2 emissions. And in the USA itself, moves have already been made to consolidate the low-carbon economy in a sign that fossil fuel companies will still face a battle over CO2 emissions, even with support from the White House. Only this week, China's President, Xi Jin Ping, warned Mr Trump that walking away from the Paris deal would endanger future generations. As Mr Trump promises to boost jobs by scrapping President Obama's clean energy plans, China is pushing on with a $361bn (Â£293bn) investment in renewable energy by 2020. China's Xie Zhenhua says the world will pressure the Trump administration over clean energy China's green aspirations are undermined by its expansion of coal-fired power stations, but this week it also suspended plans for 104 new coal plants. Xie Zhenhua, the veteran climate negotiator who forged a close partnership on clean energy between the two mega-powers,told China Daily,externalthat the global momentum behind low-carbon technology was unstoppable. He was quoted as saying: ""Industrial upgrades aiming for more sustainable growth is a global trendâ¦ it is not something that can be reversed by a single political leader. ""The international community and US citizens will pressurethe Trump administration,externalto continue clean energy policies."" Donald Trump win 'won't sway world on climate' Trump team moving away from supporters on climate science What does the Paris climate agreement mean for me? The State Department may not dismiss this flippantly: while US-Chinese relations may be increasingly frosty in many areas, climate change and clean energy remain a valuable sphere of co-operation. American politicians may also be wary of watching China seize the moral heights as world leader in tackling climate change. India is also standing firm. Its energy minister, Piyush Goyal, said this week: ""We respect the fact that America has chosen its leader. ""However, clean energy is not something that we are working on because somebody else wants us to do it - it's a matter of faith and the faith of the leadership in India. ""Nothing on Earth is going to stop us from doing that."" Solar energy prices are now on a par with coal in India, which boaststhe world's biggest solar farm and the first chemical plant to eat its own CO2 emissions. It will continue to expand coal-fired generation for the next few years, but its National Electricity Plan projects no further increase in coal-based capacity after 2022 - much earlier than previously suggested. India's Tuticorin plant is the world's first zero-emission chemical facility Dollars, technology and jobs will pour into clean energy in these countries, and the USA will surely be keen not to miss out. Meanwhile, moves are being made to consolidate President Obama's climate legacy. The US previously pledged $3bn to the UN's green fund to help poor countries adapt to climate change and get clean technology. Mr Trump won support among some voters for promising to stop payments and spend the cash on American citizens instead. But this week President Obamaslipped the fund a further $500m. And it won't just be on the international stage that Mr Trump's team will face fossil fuel battles. Some early skirmishes on American soil are already under way. This week, the Environmental Protection Agency cemented stricter efficiency standards for cars. Republicans will try to reverse this - but when carmakers previously resisted efficiency rules, they ended up producing such uncompetitive gas-guzzlers that the industry had to be bailed out. Even Republican plans to boost extraction of fossil fuels, while popular in some states because the industries create jobs, will provoke local resistance from people who don't want oil pipelines, or don't want the tops blown off their mountains to get to coal. It may be hard to persuade investors to put cash into coal anyway. Many states will resist fossil fuels, too. California has long led the way on car emissions and recently insisted it will keep its right to set its own tighter regulations for cars. Mr Trump's team may try to rescind this. The Paris climate agreement resulted in 195 nations pledging to reduce emissions There are already CO2 trading schemes between states on the east and west coasts, and last week New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced plans to build enough offshore wind capacity by 2030 to power 1.25 million homes. Here's the big picture: as the world moves together to tackle climate change, it is clearly problematic if the biggest historic polluter threatens to pull in the opposite direction. Will Angela Merkel, for instance, be so sanguine about Germany's controversial switch to renewables if the US forces its already-low energy prices even lower, triggering protests from German industry? In the words of Jo Haigh, professor of atmospheric physics at Imperial College, London: ""If Trump does what he said he'd do, and others follow suit, my gut feeling is that I'm scared. Very scared."" But he may not. And they may not.
