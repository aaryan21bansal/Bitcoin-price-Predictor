"Peng Shuai was not seen in public for three weeks after making allegations of sexual assault The Women's Tennis Association has announced the immediate suspension of all tournaments in China amid concern for Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai. Peng, 35, disappeared from public view for three weeks after accusing a top Chinese official of sexual assault. WTA chief Steve Simon said he had ""serious doubts"" that Peng was ""free, safe and not subject to intimidation"". ""In good conscience, I don't see how I can ask our athletes to compete there,"" he said. In response, China said it ""opposes the politicisation of sports"". News of the WTA suspending tournaments in China has been removed from the internet in the country, although the WTA's account on Chinese social media site Weibo is still available. The WTA has repeatedly called for a full investigation into Peng's claims. There was widespread concern for Peng after she accused former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. She said she was""safe and well""during a video call with Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, in November. However, the WTA said the video was ""insufficient evidence"" of Peng's safety. In a lengthy statement, Simon said he was ""greatly concerned"" about the risks players and staff could face if events were held in China in 2022. ""The leadership in China has not addressed this very serious issue in any credible way,"" he said. ""If powerful people can suppress the voices of women and sweep allegations of sexual assault under the rug, then the basis on which the WTA was founded - equality for women - would suffer an immense setback. ""I will not and cannot let that happen to the WTA and its players."" The suspension also includes tournaments in Hong Kong. Eighteen-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratiolva tweeted in support of the WTA's stance World number one Novak Djokovic backed the WTA's ""very bold and very courageous"" move and said Peng's health was of the ""utmost importance to the world of tennis"". ""I support fully the WTA's stance because we don't have enough information about Peng Shuai and her well-being,"" he added. Former world number one and WTA founder Billie Jean King praised the organisation for taking a strong stand. ""This is another reason why women's tennis is the leader in women's sports,"" King wrote on Twitter. ""The WTA is on the right side of history in supporting our players."" A number of players, including two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova and US Open quarter-finalist Shelby Rogers, tweeted their support for the WTA's decision. Julian Knight MP, who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said he welcomed the stance, adding: ""If only other sports showed this solidarity and moral clarity."" There have been no WTA events in China for the past two years because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the governing body has heavily relied on Chinese investment in its tour in recent years, leading to a number of lucrative tournaments being held in the country. China hosted nine tournaments in the 2019 season, including the season-ending WTA Finals, with a total of $30.4m (Â£22.6m) in prize money. Simon told BBC Sport he was worried about the financial implications of not playing in China, but that Peng's case is ""bigger than the business"". ""This is something that we simply cannot walk away from,"" he said. ""If we walk away from what we have requested, what we are telling the world is [that] not addressing sexual assault with the respect and seriousness that it requires is OK, and it is just not. ""It is just something that we cannot let happen and we cannot walk away from that."" Peng Shuai: What we know so far How China censored a tennis star Peng, a former world number one in doubles, wrote on Chinese social media site Weibo that she was forced into a sexual relationship with Zhang. The post was taken down minutes later and Peng was not seen in public for some time. A number of tennis players have used the hashtag #WhereisPengShuai on Twitter to draw attention to the issue. Simon told BBC Sport that he would not ask the ATP to make a similar stance in the men's game, but added that the governing body was supportive of their stance. ""I do not think it [ATP not suspending tournaments] undermines our position,"" he said. ""Our position is about what is best for the WTA and women's athletes and we are going to stick with that position. ""Others will make the decisions they think are appropriate to them."" He added that he remained hopeful that the Chinese authorities would take steps to ""legitimately address"" Peng's claims. Simon added: ""I very much regret it has come to this point but China's leaders have left the WTA with no choice. ""Unless China takes the steps we have asked for, we cannot put our players and staff at risk by holding events in China."" China issued a statement on October, stating ""people should stop deliberately and maliciously hyping [the issue] up, let alone politicise this issue"". Zhang Gaoli, who retired from his government role in 2018, hasyet to address,externalthe claims. The 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics are set to be held in Beijing in February and March. Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Steve Simon is resolute in his view that this is not a matter for compromise. Equality was the founding pillar of the WTA 48 years ago. What was all that hard work for, he reasons, if serious sexual assault allegations are allowed to be swept under the carpet? Simon is promising to pursue a parallel path next year. The suspension will end if the Chinese authorities ""do what is appropriate."" But conversations will also begin with cities which may be able to stage alternative WTA events. He admits a permanent withdrawal from China could be financially catastrophic for the WTA. He says he worries about it morning, noon and night, but says that this is ""bigger than the business"".

"Array Collective's SÃ­bÃ­n installation - ""a pub without permission"" Belfast-based activist group the Array Collective, have been crowned winners of the prestigious Turner Prize 2021. Judges praised the group for addressing social and political issues in Northern Ireland, and for translating their activism into artwork. Their work includes a mock Irish pub adorned in banners advocating reproductive rights and protesting against conversion therapy. They beat four other collectives to take the Â£25,000 prize. The award was presented by The Selecter singer Pauline Black at Coventry Cathedral on Wednesday evening during a live broadcast of BBC Radio 4's Front Row, presented by Samira Ahmed. This video can not be played Watch the Array Collective receive their award ""What they deal with is really serious stuff, LGBT issues, feminist perspectives on issues today in a divided society, even a sectarian society,"" said jury chair and Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson. ""What the jury feels is remarkable is that kind of amazing lightness of touch and play and conviviality and sense of hospitality, and the sense of carnival that they bring to the work."" The first Northern Irish artists ever to collect the award, Array described their win as ""surreal"" and said they would put the money towards the rent for their inner city studio. Laura O'Connor from the group said: ""It's really pushed us to create something new - especially because we've not been making work over the last year, or showing work over the last year or two, with lockdown and everything. ""So it's really motivated us and it's pushed [us] and it's changed maybe how we work."" Fellow artist Stephan Millar added: ""We are so proud to be from Belfast, to be of Belfast and the communities we work with. ""The SÃ­bÃ­n [the pub installation] was for everyone of Belfast but it's also for all the collectives in this room. We see you we support you. We're with you."" Jokes, songs, papier-mÃ¢chÃ© models, funny costumes, a large pink poster saying ""Stop Ruining Everything""...  Array Collective's art is deeply political but while the artists are, for the most part, supporters of liberal and progressive causes, there is a wider ambition: Changing the mood of debate. For a society in which marches, murals, banners and symbols play a huge role, Array Collective wants to make the street theatre of Northern Ireland politics more cheerful and less combative. Presenting a recreation of an Irish drinking den as their Turner exhibition is a reminder of the importance of how and where we talk can affect outcomes. It is slightly subversive. At first, the bar feels deeply traditional but, when you look deeper, it reveals hidden political messages about sexuality and identity. Might this be a gay bar? But perhaps most important message comes in the list of pub rules, which insist you must ""have a laugh."" In the often deeply serious and self-important world of Turner modern art, it is a welcome invitation to lighten up. In a community where street parades and street art are all too often layered in sectarian meanings,  Array wants to create new events and symbols; and to subvert local mythology to cater to different identities beyond the familiar divide. Above all, they're trying to create a place to talk and disagree that is open, welcoming and good humoured. The group were praised for having tackled taboo topics in Northern Ireland In May, Turner Prize organisers announced that this year's nominees would all be collectives who hadhelped to ""inspire social change through art""and by working collaboratively with local communities. They added that, due to many galleries being closed intermittently during lockdown, the list was not constrained to artists who had held major shows in that period. The runners-up - Black Obsidian Sound System, Cooking Sections, Gentle/Radical and Project Art Works - have each been awarded Â£10,000 for their efforts. Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is the most high-profile award in British art. It wastemporarily scrapped last yearbecause of the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic. At the previous ceremony, in 2019,all four nominated artists elected to share the awardafter urging the judges not to choose any of them as a single winner. They said they wanted to make a ""collective statement"" at a time when there was ""already so much that divides and isolates people and communities"". Array Collective's work focuses on gay rights, marriage equality, feminism, reproductive rights and anti-austerity activism Array Collective's work encompasses performances, protests, exhibitions and events. The jury commended the way the group ""fuses seriousness with humour, and addresses contemporary issues using ancient folk imagery"". Recent projects have included public artworks in support of the decriminalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland, challenging legislative discrimination of the queer community, and participation in the group exhibition Jerwood Collaborate! in London. ""Array invite us into a place of contradictions where trauma, dark humour, frustration and release coexist,"" the Turner Prize organisers noted. ""It is a place to gather outside the sectarian divides that have dominated the collective memory of the North of Ireland for the last hundred years."" A free exhibition showcasing their work and that of the other four shortlisted collectives is being displayed at The Herbert Art Gallery & Music in Coventry - the UK's City of Culture - until 12 January 2022.

"The government has promised more help for disabled people to adapt their homes, under plans to improve social care services in England. A policy paper says additional support, alongside a new service for small repairs, will help people receive care in their own home for longer. More investment in technologies such as motion alarms has also been promised. Labour said the plans ""fall woefully short of the mark"" and would not solve an immediate crisis in the sector. The proposals have been detailed in a new long-termstrategy paper,externalfor improving care services over the next decade. They will be paid for using money from a planned increase to National Insurance (NI), a tax paid by working people, from next April. What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? MPs back change to social care funding in England What are the challenges facing social care? The government says the tax rise is expected to raise Â£12bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS. In October, it confirmed it plans to spend Â£5.4bn on social care over the next three years, with Â£1.7bn earmarked for improving services. The remaining Â£3.6bn will fund a more generous means test for receiving local council support, and a new Â£86,000lifetime cap on care fees. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. In its paper published on Wednesday, it detailed plans to spend just under Â£1bn of this Â£1.7bn amount on services, including: Â£300m for supported housing, where accommodation is provided alongside care support Â£150m to invest in new technologies, such as personal alarm systems and online rotas for staff Â£500m will be put towards improving training and qualifications for staff Â£5m to find new ways to inform people about how they can access available support The government has also said it will allow disabled people to claim bigger payments from their local authority for home adaptations. This will be delivered by increasing the current Â£30,000 upper limit of an existing scheme, called the Disabled Facilities Grant. The grants can be put towards the cost of changes such as installing stairlifts, wetrooms and home technologies. Ministers say they will also consult next year on changing the financial means-test that allows people to qualify for payments. They also say they will launch a separate ""practical support service"" to help people with more minor repairs to their homes. There was a lot of hope riding on Wednesday's announcement of government plans for adult social care. In a care system that has been in crisis for a long time, people wanted a clear vision for the future. The care minister said she was setting out an ambitious 10-year plan, on an issue that other governments had ducked for too long. The aim to provide outstanding personalised care which is fair and accessible will be welcomed, but for many in the care sector the actual details of what is proposed are disappointing. They argue they do nothing to fix the acute problems they face now. They had hoped much more would be done to attract care workers, as care providers are struggling to recruit enough staff. Council officials had asked for extra funding over winter because an estimated 400,000 people in England are either waiting for services, or waiting to be assessed. The paper provides a future vision, but it doesn't deal with the immediate bumps in the road ahead. Unveiling the plans in the Commons, Health Minister Gillian Keegan said they would give people more choice and support to lead ""independent lives"". She added that successive governments had ducked the challenges posed by the sector, but ministers were now ""determined to get it right"". But shadow social care minister Liz Kendall said the paper lacked a ""long-term strategy"" to improve carers' pay and conditions, or recruit additional people into the sector to meet growing demand. She told MPs that the document would not help clear waiting lists for those waiting to get care support from their local council. ""Hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people are being left without the vital support they need, piling even more pressure on their families and the NHS at the worst possible time,"" she added. Camille Leavold, who manages Abbots Care, says low pay and poor prospects for care workers mean she struggles to recruit and retain staff. The company, which she co-founded, has 500 employees, who provide support to 1,000 people in their own homes. She says that without additional funding to allow employers to boost salaries, a lack of availability of homecare will only worsen. She also wants social care professionalised, with all care workers on a professional register, ""in the same way nursing was professionalised"". Read more here The Local Government Association said the ambitions in the paper should be balanced against the ""wider reality of the funding backdrop"" for local authorities in England, which it represents. Tory councillor David Fothergill, who chairs the LGA's community wellbeing board, said funding was ""insufficient to meet current and rising demand"". ""While councils share the government's ambition and want nothing more than to deliver it, they will need a substantially bigger share of the new health and social care levy for that to happen,"" he added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said a lack of investment meant changes to the sector would be modest and slow. She added: ""Rather than the Formula One vehicle that was required, the paper is an underpowered saloon car at best."" What is happening to the cap on care costs?

"There is no need to call off Christmas parties despite the emergence of the Omicron variant, the health secretary has said, as he urged people to get a booster jab to fight Covid. Sajid Javid said people should consider measures such as taking Covid tests or wearing face masks when socialising. But NHS Providers said some NHS trusts had asked staff ""not to mix in big groups"" in the run-up to Christmas. It comes amid an expansion of the booster vaccination rollout. Is an office Christmas party too risky? When can I get my booster jab? What Covid rules are being toughened? Can the NHS boost the booster programme? Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News some trusts were setting an example by making that request to staff because of the ""potential threat to their health and what they will be available to do"". The booster jab programme was expanded amid concern that the Omicron variant of coronavirus may spread more quickly and make vaccines less effective. In light of the variant, the government has accelerated new contracts with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to buy 114m additional Covid vaccine doses for 2022 and 2023. The deals - which are made up of 60m Moderna and 54m more Pfizer doses - include access to modified vaccines if they are needed to protect against Omicron and future variants of concern. The government said it already has enough Moderna and Pfizer doses for the expanded booster programme, with Mr Javid adding the agreements would ""future proof"" the vaccine rollout. The latest agreements come on top of the 35m extra Pfizer doses ordered in August for delivery in the second half of 2022, and 60m Novavax and 7.5m GSK/Sanofi doses which are also expected next year. The Novavax and GSK/Sanofi vaccines have yet to receive regulatory approval for use in the UK. Government scientists have said the impact of the variant on the UK is ""highly uncertain""but it may require a ""very stringent response""to avoid unsustainable pressure on the NHS. A total of 32 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK so far - 22 in England and 10 in Scotland. On Wednesday, the UK recorded a further 48,374 coronavirus cases and another 171 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. More than 18 million people in the UK have already had a booster jab, with a further 392,589 recorded on Tuesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to book in for their booster as soon as it is offered to them and suggested there was no reason that companies should be considering cancelling their annual staff Christmas parties. At Prime Minister's Questions - where he insisted thatall Covid rules were followed at Downing Street last Christmasafter media claims of parties during lockdown - he said the government had taken ""balanced and proportionate"" measures to protect people from the new variant. This video can not be played Watch: Health Secretary Sajid Javid says there's no need to change Christmas plans On Tuesday UK Health Security Agency head Dr Jenny Harries said people should not socialise ""when we don't particularly need to"". Mr Javid said the right thing to do was to follow the existing guidance, including the changes made in England in the last few days. Covid restrictions have been strengthenedin response to the Omicron variant. New measures include: Face masks are once again mandatory on public transport and in shops in England. Recent contacts of people identified as having contracted the Omicron variant are now required to self-isolate for 10 days even if they are fully vaccinated. All arrivals to the UK must now take a PCR test within two days - but Labour has called forthe reintroduction of pre-departure testing for travellers to the UK, after scientists advising the government said they would be ""valuable"" to limit further cases of the Omicron variant. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch told Times Radio people should do a ""version of Covid certification"" without the law telling them to, by ensuring they are vaccinated but also taking a lateral flow test each time before they attend a social event. Some hospitality businesses havealready reported cancellationssince the confirmation of the first cases of the new variant being found in the UK. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UK Hospitality, told BBC Breakfast the industry hoped the prime minister's words would give people the confidence to continue to make Christmas plans and would ""stem the flow of cancellations which we are starting to see"". This video can not be played Yvette Cooper says it is ""really irresponsible"" for the government not to make Covid testing before travelling a requirement NHS England is to issue detailed guidance to hospitals, pharmacists and GPs about the major expansion of the Covid booster vaccine programme. The government aims to offer all adults in England a top-up shot by 31 January. People become eligible to book a booster jab three months after their second. Hospital hubs will be asked to offer vaccines to the public as well as NHS staff and more pharmacies will be used in a bid to meet the January target. 'We could miss our son's wedding over travel rules' What does Omicron mean for Christmas parties? Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast the vaccination programme needed to deliver one million more jabs a week to reach that target and said more volunteers were needed to help with tasks at vaccination centres. He said there was ""nothing more important"" than the two-month booster push, but acknowledged it was a ""tough ask"". The health secretary said the NHS was working with GP representatives to suspend some of the workload of GPs so they can ""concentrate on vaccine delivery"". Northern Ireland has also announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Scotland and Wales have said their booster programmes will be ramped up, but are yet to lay out the full details. There's been much talk of the ability of Omicron to get around some of the defences built up by vaccination. So why bother with boosters? Why not tweak the vaccines like manufacturers say they can? When it comes to immunity vaccines do two things - protect us from infection and from serious illness. Some of the variants that have emerged, including Delta which is dominant in the UK, have reduced the ability of the vaccines to protect against infection. On paper it looks like Omicron may do the same, although it's still too early to tell. But the vaccines have held up very well in protecting against serious illness for all variants so far. The booster dose has been shown to significantly increase the immune response, so will be clearly beneficial even if the worst fears are realised about Omicron. What's more, new vaccines would take 100 days to produce and then you've got to get them into arms. Whereas the current vaccines are available right now. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said accelerating the booster rollout would have ""consequences"" for a health service that was already stretched. Meanwhile, the doctors' union, the BMA,warned GPs were already working extra hoursand would struggle to maintain their existing workload if they were required to help roll out boosters.

"The fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins happened on the New Mexico set of the Western film Rust Police investigating the fatal shooting on the set of the Alec Baldwin movie Rust have obtained a further warrant to search the premises of an arms supplier in the US. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died and director Joel Souza was injured in October, when Baldwin was practicing drawing a prop gun. An affidavit with the warrant said police were told ammunition for the film had come from several sources, including PDQ Arm & Prop. The affidavit said the ammunition supplier's owner, Seth Kenney, had told investigators the live round may have been from some ""reloaded ammunition"". He said the ammunition he supplied for the film consisted of dummy rounds and blanks, according to the affidavit. A lawsuit against Mr Baldwin, who was the film's star and producer, alleges that the script did not require him to fire a gun at the time when Ms Hutchins was fatally wounded. No reason for Alec Baldwin to fire gun - lawsuit Dead cinematographer 'was an incredible artist' Alec Baldwin shares post defending film set safety The Hollywood star, who thought the prop gun was ""cold"", or safe for use, previously shared comments from a crew member rejecting suggestions the set of his Western was unsafe. The fourth search warrant issued, which waspublished by Deadline,external, was approved by a New Mexico judge on Tuesday and included a statement from Rust armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed's father, Thell Reed. According to the affidavit, Mr Reed, a veteran armourer and stunt-man himself, told Santa Fe police he delivered an ""ammo can"" with 200 to 300 live rounds to Mr Kenney to help train actors on another production they were working on in August or September. He reportedly said Mr Kenney had ""requested he bring live ammunition in the event they ran out of what was supplied"". The affidavit stated that after that production ended, Mr Reed said Mr Kenney took the ammo can and remaining live bullets back to his company's New Mexico office. This video can not be played The director who worked with Halyna Hutchins on the 2020 action film Archenemy says her death is ""unfathomable"" Mr Reed also allegedly told police that the ammo can still contained 45 calibre colt bullets. When he later inquired about the bullets, Mr Kenney allegedly dismissed him, asking him to ""write it off"", the affidavit stated. ""Thell [Reed] stated this ammunition may match the ammunition found on the set of Rust,"" the statement read. The document also stated that either Gutierrez-Reed or Rust prop master Sarah Zachry picked up the dummy rounds from Kenney's PDQ Arm & Prop. Ms Zachry told police the ammunition was procured from multiple sources, including Mr Kenney. She added that she checked the box of ammunition after the fatal shooting, and found that some cartridges would rattle [which signified they were dummy rounds] while others did not, suggesting to her that there were more live rounds in the box. The actor and producer has described the shooting as a ""one-in-a-trillion event"" Mr Baldwin, meanwhile, has reportedly given his first formal interview since the incident to ABC News. In an initial statement given after the shooting, Mr Baldwin said he had ""no words to convey"" his ""shock and sadness"" over Ms Hutchins' death. ""My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna."" The BBC has contacted Mr Kenney for comment. In a statement to ABC News, his lawyer said: ""Mr Kenney is fully-cooperating with the authorities, as he has been since the tragic incident took place. ""Neither Mr Kenney nor PDQ Arm & Prop, LLC provided live ammunition to the Rust production.""

"The government has promised more help for disabled people to adapt their homes, under plans to improve social care services in England. A policy paper says additional support, alongside a new service for small repairs, will help people receive care in their own home for longer. More investment in technologies such as motion alarms has also been promised. Labour said the plans ""fall woefully short of the mark"" and would not solve an immediate crisis in the sector. The proposals have been detailed in a new long-termstrategy paper,externalfor improving care services over the next decade. They will be paid for using money from a planned increase to National Insurance (NI), a tax paid by working people, from next April. What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? MPs back change to social care funding in England What are the challenges facing social care? The government says the tax rise is expected to raise Â£12bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS. In October, it confirmed it plans to spend Â£5.4bn on social care over the next three years, with Â£1.7bn earmarked for improving services. The remaining Â£3.6bn will fund a more generous means test for receiving local council support, and a new Â£86,000lifetime cap on care fees. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. In its paper published on Wednesday, it detailed plans to spend just under Â£1bn of this Â£1.7bn amount on services, including: Â£300m for supported housing, where accommodation is provided alongside care support Â£150m to invest in new technologies, such as personal alarm systems and online rotas for staff Â£500m will be put towards improving training and qualifications for staff Â£5m to find new ways to inform people about how they can access available support The government has also said it will allow disabled people to claim bigger payments from their local authority for home adaptations. This will be delivered by increasing the current Â£30,000 upper limit of an existing scheme, called the Disabled Facilities Grant. The grants can be put towards the cost of changes such as installing stairlifts, wetrooms and home technologies. Ministers say they will also consult next year on changing the financial means-test that allows people to qualify for payments. They also say they will launch a separate ""practical support service"" to help people with more minor repairs to their homes. There was a lot of hope riding on Wednesday's announcement of government plans for adult social care. In a care system that has been in crisis for a long time, people wanted a clear vision for the future. The care minister said she was setting out an ambitious 10-year plan, on an issue that other governments had ducked for too long. The aim to provide outstanding personalised care which is fair and accessible will be welcomed, but for many in the care sector the actual details of what is proposed are disappointing. They argue they do nothing to fix the acute problems they face now. They had hoped much more would be done to attract care workers, as care providers are struggling to recruit enough staff. Council officials had asked for extra funding over winter because an estimated 400,000 people in England are either waiting for services, or waiting to be assessed. The paper provides a future vision, but it doesn't deal with the immediate bumps in the road ahead. Unveiling the plans in the Commons, Health Minister Gillian Keegan said they would give people more choice and support to lead ""independent lives"". She added that successive governments had ducked the challenges posed by the sector, but ministers were now ""determined to get it right"". But shadow social care minister Liz Kendall said the paper lacked a ""long-term strategy"" to improve carers' pay and conditions, or recruit additional people into the sector to meet growing demand. She told MPs that the document would not help clear waiting lists for those waiting to get care support from their local council. ""Hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people are being left without the vital support they need, piling even more pressure on their families and the NHS at the worst possible time,"" she added. Camille Leavold, who manages Abbots Care, says low pay and poor prospects for care workers mean she struggles to recruit and retain staff. The company, which she co-founded, has 500 employees, who provide support to 1,000 people in their own homes. She says that without additional funding to allow employers to boost salaries, a lack of availability of homecare will only worsen. She also wants social care professionalised, with all care workers on a professional register, ""in the same way nursing was professionalised"". Read more here The Local Government Association said the ambitions in the paper should be balanced against the ""wider reality of the funding backdrop"" for local authorities in England, which it represents. Tory councillor David Fothergill, who chairs the LGA's community wellbeing board, said funding was ""insufficient to meet current and rising demand"". ""While councils share the government's ambition and want nothing more than to deliver it, they will need a substantially bigger share of the new health and social care levy for that to happen,"" he added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said a lack of investment meant changes to the sector would be modest and slow. She added: ""Rather than the Formula One vehicle that was required, the paper is an underpowered saloon car at best."" What is happening to the cap on care costs?

"The fatal shooting of Halyna Hutchins happened on the New Mexico set of the Western film Rust Police investigating the fatal shooting on the set of the Alec Baldwin movie Rust have obtained a further warrant to search the premises of an arms supplier in the US. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins died and director Joel Souza was injured in October, when Baldwin was practicing drawing a prop gun. An affidavit with the warrant said police were told ammunition for the film had come from several sources, including PDQ Arm & Prop. The affidavit said the ammunition supplier's owner, Seth Kenney, had told investigators the live round may have been from some ""reloaded ammunition"". He said the ammunition he supplied for the film consisted of dummy rounds and blanks, according to the affidavit. A lawsuit against Mr Baldwin, who was the film's star and producer, alleges that the script did not require him to fire a gun at the time when Ms Hutchins was fatally wounded. No reason for Alec Baldwin to fire gun - lawsuit Dead cinematographer 'was an incredible artist' Alec Baldwin shares post defending film set safety The Hollywood star, who thought the prop gun was ""cold"", or safe for use, previously shared comments from a crew member rejecting suggestions the set of his Western was unsafe. The fourth search warrant issued, which waspublished by Deadline,external, was approved by a New Mexico judge on Tuesday and included a statement from Rust armourer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed's father, Thell Reed. According to the affidavit, Mr Reed, a veteran armourer and stunt-man himself, told Santa Fe police he delivered an ""ammo can"" with 200 to 300 live rounds to Mr Kenney to help train actors on another production they were working on in August or September. He reportedly said Mr Kenney had ""requested he bring live ammunition in the event they ran out of what was supplied"". The affidavit stated that after that production ended, Mr Reed said Mr Kenney took the ammo can and remaining live bullets back to his company's New Mexico office. This video can not be played The director who worked with Halyna Hutchins on the 2020 action film Archenemy says her death is ""unfathomable"" Mr Reed also allegedly told police that the ammo can still contained 45 calibre colt bullets. When he later inquired about the bullets, Mr Kenney allegedly dismissed him, asking him to ""write it off"", the affidavit stated. ""Thell [Reed] stated this ammunition may match the ammunition found on the set of Rust,"" the statement read. The document also stated that either Gutierrez-Reed or Rust prop master Sarah Zachry picked up the dummy rounds from Kenney's PDQ Arm & Prop. Ms Zachry told police the ammunition was procured from multiple sources, including Mr Kenney. She added that she checked the box of ammunition after the fatal shooting, and found that some cartridges would rattle [which signified they were dummy rounds] while others did not, suggesting to her that there were more live rounds in the box. The actor and producer has described the shooting as a ""one-in-a-trillion event"" Mr Baldwin, meanwhile, has reportedly given his first formal interview since the incident to ABC News. In an initial statement given after the shooting, Mr Baldwin said he had ""no words to convey"" his ""shock and sadness"" over Ms Hutchins' death. ""My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna."" The BBC has contacted Mr Kenney for comment. In a statement to ABC News, his lawyer said: ""Mr Kenney is fully-cooperating with the authorities, as he has been since the tragic incident took place. ""Neither Mr Kenney nor PDQ Arm & Prop, LLC provided live ammunition to the Rust production.""

"Array Collective's SÃ­bÃ­n installation - ""a pub without permission"" Belfast-based activist group the Array Collective, have been crowned winners of the prestigious Turner Prize 2021. Judges praised the group for addressing social and political issues in Northern Ireland, and for translating their activism into artwork. Their work includes a mock Irish pub adorned in banners advocating reproductive rights and protesting against conversion therapy. They beat four other collectives to take the Â£25,000 prize. The award was presented by The Selecter singer Pauline Black at Coventry Cathedral on Wednesday evening during a live broadcast of BBC Radio 4's Front Row, presented by Samira Ahmed. This video can not be played Watch the Array Collective receive their award ""What they deal with is really serious stuff, LGBT issues, feminist perspectives on issues today in a divided society, even a sectarian society,"" said jury chair and Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson. ""What the jury feels is remarkable is that kind of amazing lightness of touch and play and conviviality and sense of hospitality, and the sense of carnival that they bring to the work."" The first Northern Irish artists ever to collect the award, Array described their win as ""surreal"" and said they would put the money towards the rent for their inner city studio. Laura O'Connor from the group said: ""It's really pushed us to create something new - especially because we've not been making work over the last year, or showing work over the last year or two, with lockdown and everything. ""So it's really motivated us and it's pushed [us] and it's changed maybe how we work."" Fellow artist Stephan Millar added: ""We are so proud to be from Belfast, to be of Belfast and the communities we work with. ""The SÃ­bÃ­n [the pub installation] was for everyone of Belfast but it's also for all the collectives in this room. We see you we support you. We're with you."" Jokes, songs, papier-mÃ¢chÃ© models, funny costumes, a large pink poster saying ""Stop Ruining Everything""...  Array Collective's art is deeply political but while the artists are, for the most part, supporters of liberal and progressive causes, there is a wider ambition: Changing the mood of debate. For a society in which marches, murals, banners and symbols play a huge role, Array Collective wants to make the street theatre of Northern Ireland politics more cheerful and less combative. Presenting a recreation of an Irish drinking den as their Turner exhibition is a reminder of the importance of how and where we talk can affect outcomes. It is slightly subversive. At first, the bar feels deeply traditional but, when you look deeper, it reveals hidden political messages about sexuality and identity. Might this be a gay bar? But perhaps most important message comes in the list of pub rules, which insist you must ""have a laugh."" In the often deeply serious and self-important world of Turner modern art, it is a welcome invitation to lighten up. In a community where street parades and street art are all too often layered in sectarian meanings,  Array wants to create new events and symbols; and to subvert local mythology to cater to different identities beyond the familiar divide. Above all, they're trying to create a place to talk and disagree that is open, welcoming and good humoured. The group were praised for having tackled taboo topics in Northern Ireland In May, Turner Prize organisers announced that this year's nominees would all be collectives who hadhelped to ""inspire social change through art""and by working collaboratively with local communities. They added that, due to many galleries being closed intermittently during lockdown, the list was not constrained to artists who had held major shows in that period. The runners-up - Black Obsidian Sound System, Cooking Sections, Gentle/Radical and Project Art Works - have each been awarded Â£10,000 for their efforts. Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is the most high-profile award in British art. It wastemporarily scrapped last yearbecause of the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic. At the previous ceremony, in 2019,all four nominated artists elected to share the awardafter urging the judges not to choose any of them as a single winner. They said they wanted to make a ""collective statement"" at a time when there was ""already so much that divides and isolates people and communities"". Array Collective's work focuses on gay rights, marriage equality, feminism, reproductive rights and anti-austerity activism Array Collective's work encompasses performances, protests, exhibitions and events. The jury commended the way the group ""fuses seriousness with humour, and addresses contemporary issues using ancient folk imagery"". Recent projects have included public artworks in support of the decriminalisation of abortion in Northern Ireland, challenging legislative discrimination of the queer community, and participation in the group exhibition Jerwood Collaborate! in London. ""Array invite us into a place of contradictions where trauma, dark humour, frustration and release coexist,"" the Turner Prize organisers noted. ""It is a place to gather outside the sectarian divides that have dominated the collective memory of the North of Ireland for the last hundred years."" A free exhibition showcasing their work and that of the other four shortlisted collectives is being displayed at The Herbert Art Gallery & Music in Coventry - the UK's City of Culture - until 12 January 2022.

"Peng Shuai was not seen in public for three weeks after making allegations of sexual assault The Women's Tennis Association has announced the immediate suspension of all tournaments in China amid concern for Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai. Peng, 35, disappeared from public view for three weeks after accusing a top Chinese official of sexual assault. WTA chief Steve Simon said he had ""serious doubts"" that Peng was ""free, safe and not subject to intimidation"". ""In good conscience, I don't see how I can ask our athletes to compete there,"" he said. In response, China said it ""opposes the politicisation of sports"". News of the WTA suspending tournaments in China has been removed from the internet in the country, although the WTA's account on Chinese social media site Weibo is still available. The WTA has repeatedly called for a full investigation into Peng's claims. There was widespread concern for Peng after she accused former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. She said she was""safe and well""during a video call with Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, in November. However, the WTA said the video was ""insufficient evidence"" of Peng's safety. In a lengthy statement, Simon said he was ""greatly concerned"" about the risks players and staff could face if events were held in China in 2022. ""The leadership in China has not addressed this very serious issue in any credible way,"" he said. ""If powerful people can suppress the voices of women and sweep allegations of sexual assault under the rug, then the basis on which the WTA was founded - equality for women - would suffer an immense setback. ""I will not and cannot let that happen to the WTA and its players."" The suspension also includes tournaments in Hong Kong. Eighteen-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratiolva tweeted in support of the WTA's stance World number one Novak Djokovic backed the WTA's ""very bold and very courageous"" move and said Peng's health was of the ""utmost importance to the world of tennis"". ""I support fully the WTA's stance because we don't have enough information about Peng Shuai and her well-being,"" he added. Former world number one and WTA founder Billie Jean King praised the organisation for taking a strong stand. ""This is another reason why women's tennis is the leader in women's sports,"" King wrote on Twitter. ""The WTA is on the right side of history in supporting our players."" A number of players, including two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova and US Open quarter-finalist Shelby Rogers, tweeted their support for the WTA's decision. Julian Knight MP, who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said he welcomed the stance, adding: ""If only other sports showed this solidarity and moral clarity."" There have been no WTA events in China for the past two years because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the governing body has heavily relied on Chinese investment in its tour in recent years, leading to a number of lucrative tournaments being held in the country. China hosted nine tournaments in the 2019 season, including the season-ending WTA Finals, with a total of $30.4m (Â£22.6m) in prize money. Simon told BBC Sport he was worried about the financial implications of not playing in China, but that Peng's case is ""bigger than the business"". ""This is something that we simply cannot walk away from,"" he said. ""If we walk away from what we have requested, what we are telling the world is [that] not addressing sexual assault with the respect and seriousness that it requires is OK, and it is just not. ""It is just something that we cannot let happen and we cannot walk away from that."" Peng Shuai: What we know so far How China censored a tennis star Peng, a former world number one in doubles, wrote on Chinese social media site Weibo that she was forced into a sexual relationship with Zhang. The post was taken down minutes later and Peng was not seen in public for some time. A number of tennis players have used the hashtag #WhereisPengShuai on Twitter to draw attention to the issue. Simon told BBC Sport that he would not ask the ATP to make a similar stance in the men's game, but added that the governing body was supportive of their stance. ""I do not think it [ATP not suspending tournaments] undermines our position,"" he said. ""Our position is about what is best for the WTA and women's athletes and we are going to stick with that position. ""Others will make the decisions they think are appropriate to them."" He added that he remained hopeful that the Chinese authorities would take steps to ""legitimately address"" Peng's claims. Simon added: ""I very much regret it has come to this point but China's leaders have left the WTA with no choice. ""Unless China takes the steps we have asked for, we cannot put our players and staff at risk by holding events in China."" China issued a statement on October, stating ""people should stop deliberately and maliciously hyping [the issue] up, let alone politicise this issue"". Zhang Gaoli, who retired from his government role in 2018, hasyet to address,externalthe claims. The 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics are set to be held in Beijing in February and March. Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Steve Simon is resolute in his view that this is not a matter for compromise. Equality was the founding pillar of the WTA 48 years ago. What was all that hard work for, he reasons, if serious sexual assault allegations are allowed to be swept under the carpet? Simon is promising to pursue a parallel path next year. The suspension will end if the Chinese authorities ""do what is appropriate."" But conversations will also begin with cities which may be able to stage alternative WTA events. He admits a permanent withdrawal from China could be financially catastrophic for the WTA. He says he worries about it morning, noon and night, but says that this is ""bigger than the business"".

News of the WTA suspending tournaments in China has been removed from the internet in the country, although the WTA's account on Chinese social media site Weibo is still available. The WTA has repeatedly called for a full investigation into Peng's claims. There was widespread concern for Peng after she accused former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of sexual assault. She said she was""safe and well""during a video call with Thomas Bach, the president of the International Olympic Committee, in November. However, the WTA said the video was ""insufficient evidence"" of Peng's safety. In a lengthy statement, Simon said he was ""greatly concerned"" about the risks players and staff could face if events were held in China in 2022. ""The leadership in China has not addressed this very serious issue in any credible way,"" he said. ""If powerful people can suppress the voices of women and sweep allegations of sexual assault under the rug, then the basis on which the WTA was founded - equality for women - would suffer an immense setback. ""I will not and cannot let that happen to the WTA and its players."" The suspension also includes tournaments in Hong Kong. Eighteen-time Grand Slam champion Martina Navratiolva tweeted in support of the WTA's stance World number one Novak Djokovic backed the WTA's ""very bold and very courageous"" move and said Peng's health was of the ""utmost importance to the world of tennis"". ""I support fully the WTA's stance because we don't have enough information about Peng Shuai and her well-being,"" he added. Former world number one and WTA founder Billie Jean King praised the organisation for taking a strong stand. ""This is another reason why women's tennis is the leader in women's sports,"" King wrote on Twitter. ""The WTA is on the right side of history in supporting our players."" A number of players, including two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova and US Open quarter-finalist Shelby Rogers, tweeted their support for the WTA's decision. Julian Knight MP, who chairs the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee, said he welcomed the stance, adding: ""If only other sports showed this solidarity and moral clarity."" There have been no WTA events in China for the past two years because of the coronavirus pandemic. However, the governing body has heavily relied on Chinese investment in its tour in recent years, leading to a number of lucrative tournaments being held in the country. China hosted nine tournaments in the 2019 season, including the season-ending WTA Finals, with a total of $30.4m (Â£22.6m) in prize money. Simon told BBC Sport he was worried about the financial implications of not playing in China, but that Peng's case is ""bigger than the business"". ""This is something that we simply cannot walk away from,"" he said. ""If we walk away from what we have requested, what we are telling the world is [that] not addressing sexual assault with the respect and seriousness that it requires is OK, and it is just not. ""It is just something that we cannot let happen and we cannot walk away from that."" Peng Shuai: What we know so far How China censored a tennis star Peng, a former world number one in doubles, wrote on Chinese social media site Weibo that she was forced into a sexual relationship with Zhang. The post was taken down minutes later and Peng was not seen in public for some time. A number of tennis players have used the hashtag #WhereisPengShuai on Twitter to draw attention to the issue. Simon told BBC Sport that he would not ask the ATP to make a similar stance in the men's game, but added that the governing body was supportive of their stance. ""I do not think it [ATP not suspending tournaments] undermines our position,"" he said. ""Our position is about what is best for the WTA and women's athletes and we are going to stick with that position. ""Others will make the decisions they think are appropriate to them."" He added that he remained hopeful that the Chinese authorities would take steps to ""legitimately address"" Peng's claims. Simon added: ""I very much regret it has come to this point but China's leaders have left the WTA with no choice. ""Unless China takes the steps we have asked for, we cannot put our players and staff at risk by holding events in China."" China issued a statement on October, stating ""people should stop deliberately and maliciously hyping [the issue] up, let alone politicise this issue"". Zhang Gaoli, who retired from his government role in 2018, hasyet to address,externalthe claims. The 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics are set to be held in Beijing in February and March. Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Steve Simon is resolute in his view that this is not a matter for compromise. Equality was the founding pillar of the WTA 48 years ago. What was all that hard work for, he reasons, if serious sexual assault allegations are allowed to be swept under the carpet? Simon is promising to pursue a parallel path next year. The suspension will end if the Chinese authorities ""do what is appropriate."" But conversations will also begin with cities which may be able to stage alternative WTA events. He admits a permanent withdrawal from China could be financially catastrophic for the WTA. He says he worries about it morning, noon and night, but says that this is ""bigger than the business"".

"Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg is being investigated over a possible breach of rules on declaring outside earnings. Commons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone did not reveal details of the allegations. But they are understood to relate to Â£6m in loans Mr Rees-Mogg received from one of his own companies to help buy and renovate his Westminster home. The watchdog is also investigating Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross for possible standards breaches. Scottish Tory leader in second job 'sleaze' row Mr Rees-Mogg borrowed up to Â£2.94m a year in director's loans from Saliston Ltd, a UK-based property company owned by him, between 2018 and 2020. Labour's shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire said: ""It is right that the standards commissioner is investigating what appears to be yet another egregious breach of the rules, with Jacob Rees-Mogg failing to declare millions of pounds of director's loans. ""The prime minister also needs to investigate whether the ministerial code has been breached."" Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner separately wrote to the independent adviser on ministers' interests, Lord Geidt, over the loans. In her letter, Mrs Rayner said that failing to declare directors' loans worth Â£2.94m a year ""allowed Mr Rees-Mogg to borrow a large sum of money at a very low interest rate"" and argued that it ""should have been declared"". Douglas Ross admits not fully declaring his income as a football referee Mr Rees-Mogg said said the loans had been properly declared, after the story wasfirst reported in the Mail on Sunday,external. In a statement, he told BBC News: ""Saliston is 100% owned by me and this is declared clearly in the Commons register and to the Cabinet Office. It has no activities that interact with government policy."" He said the loans were primarily taken out for the purchase and refurbishment of his Westminster home ""as temporary cash flow measures"". ""All loans have either been repaid with interest in accordance with HMRC rules or paid as dividends and taxed accordingly,"" he added. ""The register asks for earnings, not loans, which is why I was declared an as a non-remunerated director until I resigned on entering government. Loans are not earnings and are not declarable in the register of interests."" Mr Rees-Mogg resigned as a director of Saliston in 2019, but his wife Helena remains on the board. A spokesman for the North East Somerset MP said he would comply with commissioner's investigation fully and answer all questions. Conservative MP Douglas Ross is also among the MPs being investigated for possible breaches of the MPs' code of conduct. He referred himself to the watchdog last month for failing to declare about Â£17,000 of earnings while serving as an MP. Mr Ross, who is leader of the Scottish Tories, apologised for failing to fully record his MSP salary and earnings as a football referee in his register of interests at Westminster. At the time, he said it was a ""bad errorâ¦of my own making"".

"People in the north-east of Scotland could be without power until Friday, energy company SSEN has warned. It means some homes in the region will have been without electricity for seven days following Storm Arwen. SSEN said there were about 4,100 properties - mainly in Aberdeenshire, Aberdeen, Angus and Moray - still to be reconnected. It hopes to restore energy supplies within the next three days. The company described the storm damage as a ""once in a generation event"". SSEN has recorded 1,000 points of damage in the north east. The previous high from a single weather event was 150. It said power had now been restored to over 120,000 customers, with the majority of villages impacted now back on supply. Frustration as thousands remain without power Thousands in England spend 'exhausting' fifth night in the dark In the south of Scotland, Scottish Power Energy Networks estimated 1,000 properties in the Borders had spent another night without power. Scottish Water said supplies had been restored to rural communities in Aberdeenshire and Perthshire, with teams on standby for issues still affecting ""pockets of customers"". A bike shop in the Aberdeenshire village of Monymusk operated as a welfare facility to provide hot food On Wednesday afternoon, Deputy First Minister John Swinney confirmed the Bellwin Scheme had been activated. This gives local councils financial support from the Scottish government to deal with emergency incidents. Liam Kerr, Scottish Conservative MSP for north east Scotland, earlier criticised ministers' response to the storm - claiming it had been a ""monumental failure of planning"". Aberdeenshire East SNP MSP Gillian Martin called for a resilience review to be undertaken. She said she had ""never before"" seen such damage from high winds in her constituency. Most of Aberdeenshire's 170 schools have reopened but about 20 remain closed. Robert Weatherspoon said hundreds of engineers have been working around the clock since the storm struck Among the hundreds of SSEN workers battling to get powered restored is project manager Robert Weatherspoon. He described the past five days as ""very challenging"" but said it was getting easier as more lines are reconnected. ""It could be anything, a wire down, trees on the line, damage to the insulators, wires sitting on the steel which wouldn't be immediately obvious,"" he said. ""With the amount of debris that's been blown about, you just don't know. So you've got to really think and have a good look at what you're dealing with. ""It's long hours, but when you speak to the customers and they've been without power for three or four days, in a remote location, you're quite happy to keep working on to get those people restored."" Graeme Keddie, SSEN's director of corporate affairs, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotlandthe storm had caused ""devastation"" to parts of the network. He said: ""We are confident we have a handle on what we can restore in the next couple of days. ""We are looking at making really good progress today and tomorrow and we expect it will be the last final few homes on Friday."" Mr Keddie's comments came after power companiesfaced criticism for poor communication, with some residents claiming they were ""completely abandoned"". SSEN said it would reimburse reasonable accommodation costs for customers unable to make alternative arrangements. Those unable to access the company's welfare facilities for hot food and drinks can also claim the cost of takeaways or meals, up to Â£15 per person. Kenny Anderson said it had been ""pretty grim"" since the power went off on Friday In Castle Fraser, Aberdeenshire, home worker Kenny Anderson said his power was finally reconnected on Wednesday afternoon. He used an open fire and a gas hob on a propane bottle supply in the interim. He believed the response could have been better handled by SSEN. ""The storm on Friday was catastrophic, but they could have mitigated the situation if they had maintained the infrastructure better,"" he said. Mr Anderson said he was twice on hold at SSEN's call centre for 90 minutes. He declined an offer by SSEN to go into hotel accommodation, as he keeps animals on his land. ""The guys on the ground are working hard but the biggest problem is their communications,"" he added. ""We are only 15 miles west of Aberdeen here, it's supposed to be the energy capital of Europe. And yet we can't get decent power infrastructure."" Thousands of people in the north of England are alsostill living with power outages. In the House of Commons, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said he had been assured that the ""overwhelming majority"" of customers would see power restored in the next day or two. He promised his department would be looking at ways to build ""an even more resilient power system"". The Met Office has advised there is a risk of further cold and wet conditions over the next 24 hours - including winds of up to 60mph. It said damage could occur where trees and property had been destabilised by Storm Arwen. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency also warned of high tides and overtopping on the east coast.

"Rapper Travis Scott says he is devastated by what happened at the Astroworld festival Travis Scott's offer to pay the funeral costs of Astroworld victims has been rejected by half of the bereaved families. This includesthe family of nine-year-old Ezra Blount- the youngest of 10 concertgoers killed during a crush at the rapper's festival in Texas. Scott made the offer last week, amidmultiple lawsuits over the tragedy. A lawyer for the family of 14-year-old John Hilgert called the gesture ""demeaning and inappropriate"". ""Of all the things this case is about, that's the least of any concern,""he told Rolling Stone,external. ""This family is set on making change, and ensuring this never happens at a concert again."" The crowd surge occurred during Scott's headline set on Friday, 5 November. At the time, there were about 50,000 people attending the festival at Houston's NRG Park complex. Ten of the victims have now died. The eldest was 27. Blount, who lived in Dallas, died nine days after the concert. He had previously been placed in medically induced coma due to the severity of his injuries. Scott's lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, wrote to the nine-year-old's family the day after his funeral, on 23 November, offering to pay for the service. ""Travis is devastated by the tragedy that occurred at the Astroworld Festival and grieves for the families whose loved ones died or were injured,"" the letter read. ""Travis is committed to doing his part to help the families who have suffered and begin the long process of healing in the Houston community.

""I have no doubt Mr Scott feels remorse,"" he wrote in a letter to the musician's representative. ""His journey ahead will be painful.

Philip Corboy, the lawyer for the families of 21-year-old friends Jacob Jurinek and Franco Patino, said the rapper's approach through legal teams had left the impression ""that all he was trying to do was... lessen the public outcry"".

Tony Buzbee, representing the family of Axel Acosta, 21, also questioned Scott's motives in choosing to make the announcement through ""a press release for everyone to see"". ""He says he feels sorry for them but he's quick to say it wasn't his fault. He's no different than any defendant pointing fingers to someone else. They don't want funeral expenses from him.

"Twenty three senior clinicians have written a letter calling the criticism of Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board ""unfounded"". It comes as Scottish Labour are to call for the sacking of the board's leaders in a Holyrood debate on Wednesday. Labour's Anas Sarwar alleges there is a culture of ""cover up and secrecy"" at the health board. Infections linked to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is the subject of an ongoing public inquiry. The hospital campus opened in 2015 but has been repeatedly hit by concerns over safety and the spread of infections. More child deaths 'linked to hospital infections' Widow demands answers over Covid official's death Hospital building 'almost killed our son' 'Serious failings' over hospital infections The inquiry was called after it emerged that patients had died from infections linked to pigeon droppings and contaminated water supplies. Anearlier review,externalfound the hospital environment was at least partly to blame for the deaths of two children, including 10-year-old Milly Main. She was a leukaemia patient whose deathwas linked to a hospital-acquired infectionwhile being treated at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in the QEUH campus. The wife of Andrew Slorance believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect the reputation of the hospital And the widow of Scottish government official Andrew Slorance believes her husband caught Covid and another infection while receiving cancer treatment. Mrs Slorance thinks the full details of his illness were concealed to protect the reputation of the flagship hospital. Last Thursday, Labour's leader Anas Sarwar said he had been contacted by two ""senior clinicians"" from the hospital abouttwo further deaths of children at the hospital. He said they were afraid to speak out publicly because of a culture of ""bullying and intimidation"". The party will call for MSPs to vote that they have no confidence in health board bosses, and that it should be taken under government control. However, in a letter to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, the 23 senior clinicians said they were writing to express their ""immense disappointment and frustration"" about the way their hospitals, colleagues and the treatment of their patients was being portrayed in the press and in the Scottish Parliament. ""We have been, and remain, fully committed to being completely open and transparent in all that we do and we are dismayed that the integrity of our staff has been repeatedly called into question,"" the letter says. ""Do we always get everything right when we discuss issues with families? Perhaps not. Do we ever wilfully withhold information from them? Absolutely not. ""We have grave concerns that the continued undermining nature of the current negative headlines will result in an erosion of trust between clinical staff and patients and their families."" Ten-year-old Milly Main died after contracting an infection at the Royal Hospital for Children The clinicians said staff had reported that families were ""very anxious about the safety of their relatives while in our care"". The letter adds: ""We are particularly disappointed that individual patients are being discussed in parliament without the knowledge of the families concerned, causing untold distress to families already grieving the loss of their loved one."" ""This unfounded criticism of our clinical teams and staff as well as the safety of our hospitals, is also hugely detrimental to staff morale at a time when so much is being asked of them."" The clinicians said they accepted there would always be improvements that could be made but said there was a commitment from every clinician working within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to provide the best quality of care and to be open and honest with patients and families about their diagnosis and treatment. These photographs were taken at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow Scottish Labour have shared photographs revealing examples of mould growth inside the hospital. The photographs come from an academic paper published earlier this year exposing the risks of water in seeding infection inside hospitals. Mr Sarwar said: ""It has been two years since the culture of cover-up and secrecy at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde was brought to light. People are still dying from preventable hospital-acquired infections. ""Today's vote is a line in the sand... MSPs have a choice, they can side with families, clinicians and those campaigning for patient safety or they can back a culture of secrecy, cover-up and incompetence which has had fatal consequences."" A statement from the health board said: ""For continued claims to be made that we are less than fully open and transparent across all areas of patient care and building safety is of serious concern, and we are deeply saddened by the way in which the commitment and working practices of our staff at the QEUH and RHC are being portrayed. ""Previous investigations into such claims, including by the independent review, concluded that there is no culture of organisational bullying within NHS GGC. We are very concerned that these allegations persist as we have seen no additional evidence to substantiate any such claims."" The statement added that the health board remained ""fully committed"" to addressing any concerns raised by patients, families and staff. Speaking about the photographs of mould, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""Where there is any evidence of mould, steps are taken to remove it with full infection prevention and control oversight."" He said the academic paper made it clear that there was no harm to patients caused by the mould and that mould grows in UK hospitals on a regular basis. ""NHS staff in the QEUH and across Scotland continue to provide exceptional care to their patients and are currently doing so in the face of unprecedented pressures brought by the pandemic,"" the spokesman said. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he would enact any public inquiry recommendations.

It has been a busy few hours in the House of Commons, so here is a run down of what's happened: Alison HoltSocial affairs editor There was a lot of hope riding on todayâs announcement of
government plans for adult social care. In a care system that has been in
crisis for a long time, people wanted a clear vision for the future. The care
minister said she was setting out an ""ambitious"" 10-year plan on an issue that
other governments had ducked for too long. The aim to provide outstanding
personalised care which is fair and accessible will be welcomed, but for many
in the care sector, the actual details of what is proposed are disappointing. They argue they do nothing to fix the acute problems they face now. They had
hoped much more would be done to attract care workers, as care providers are
struggling to recruit enough staff. Council officials had asked for extra
funding over winter because an estimated 400,000 people in England are
either waiting for services or waiting to be assessed. The white paper provides
a future vision, but it doesnât deal with the immediate bumps in the road
ahead. Conservative Robert Buckland makes the last contribution to the statement, saying the proposed Â£300m to help local authorities for supported housing is an ""excellent initiative"". The MP and former justice secretary asks how the government is going to make sure the money is used to ""enrich the lives"" of adults living with disabilities, adding currently they ""just don't have the choice that they deserve"". Gillian Keegan praises him for all his ""excellent work"" on the issue of support for disabled people, adding the money is specifically to provide better support them She adds they have also included detail in the proposal to help young adults with disabilities get into work, arguing ""not enough of them are getting that support today"". Conservative Paul Bristow tells MPs he spoke to a social care user who told him that living in supported housing ""made him feel like a king"" because he had access to his own private shower. ""The small differences between hospital care and being supported to live independently are striking,"" Bristow says. He asks the minister to confirm that one of the aims of the government's strategy is to ensure that ""people can live as independently as possible for as long as possible"". The minister agrees and says the government wants to ensure people get the right care. The government's white paper on social care ""sets out some important, long overdue policy advances"", says Caroline Abrahams, director of the charity Age UK. But, she argues, ""lack of investment means any changes will be modest and slow to arrive, whereas the scale of the challenge is huge and demands urgent action now"". Abrahams demands a rise in care sector pay to tackle ""chronic workforce shortages"", saying pressures on staff are likely to increase if Covid surges this winter. ""There are similar concerns about unpaid carers collapsing after an unbelievably challenging 20 months too,"" she adds. Earlier, Gillian Keegan told MPs the government would be producing a separate white paper on plans to integrate the NHS and social care. Conservative Andrew Murrison says there is ""a certain irony"" in having two white papers to deal with something around integration. He asks the minister how she will solve the ""crying shame of elderly and vulnerable people languishing in acute hospital beds"" instead of receiving care at home or in a care home. Gillian Keegan says this is a problem which is putting pressure on the system and that integration will help. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tory MP Andrew Mitchell praises the plans, arguing they represent ""good and steady progress"" on reforming the social care system. He adds that his constituency of Sutton Coldfield, given its elderly demographics, is particularly invested in the changes. Mitchell says the UK government has come up with ""coherent policies"" that allow older people to live at home for as long as possible"". Gillian Keegan adds that expensive areas with older populations must enabled to live at home, using technology, adaptive housing and working with local groups and health services to achieve this. Lib Dem Daisy Cooper says the minister's statement is ""incredibly thin"" and compares it to ""fiddling with the light bulbs on the Titanic"". She says hospitals are struggling to discharge patients because the care isn't available. And she accuses the minister of failing to ""address the problem"" of integration between the NHS and social care. Gillian Keegan says the integration of health and social care is key to the government's reforms and promises MPs that a separate white paper on the issue will be coming early next year. While the government outlined its reforms in September, today it published its white paper on social care. The white paper sets out more details of how Â£1bn of spending will be allocated over the next three years. It says: Conservative MP Damian Green calls for more detail on how housing and technology can be adapted to help elderly people live at home for longer. Those who are ""frail"" can have a ""better quality of life"" if there is detailed reform in this area, he adds. Gillian Keegan says there will be more help for supported housing and, with councils, ministers will be work on how the money can be raised for this. If you cast your minds back to last week, the government narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back its social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs, However, 19 Conservative MPs voted against the proposal and it is believed 28 more refused to vote for it and abstained instead. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. But Boris Johnson has insisted it is more generous than the current system, and still managed to pass the plan thanks to his large majority. If you'd like to read more about the controversy in the commons over the social care plans, clickhere. Conservative MP - and former health secretary - Jeremy Hunt praises the social care cap, which he says will make a big difference to many people. However, he says the government's plan ""doesn't really give confidence in two crucial areas"". Firstly, he says local authorities ""barely"" have enough money to provide social care. Secondly, he says it is ""hard to seen an end to the workforce crisis"" in the social care sector. Minister Gillian Keegan acknowledges the government's plan is ""only a start"", but says the government will offer more information about money for local councils in the local government finance settlement. On staffing problems, she says: ""We do need to invest in training and learning and provide career routes."" ""Is that it?"" asks Labour's Liz Kendall as she responds to the government statement. She says the plan ""utterly fails to deal with the immediate pressures facing social care"". ""Where was the plan to end waiting lists for care... where was the long-term strategy to transform the pay and conditions of care workers,"" she asks. ""No wonder staff are leaving the sector in droves."" She says the government's white paper ""falls woefully short of the mark"". In the Commons, the minister, Gillian Keegan, says the government's plans to introduce a Health and Social Care Levy were a ""vital first step"" in fixing the social care system. She then sets out a further plan of action for the government, including Â£300m in housing investment to help people with minor repairs and changes to help independent living, increasing the upper limit. She also sets out Â£150m for adoption of digital technology in the social care system. Keegan adds that at least Â£500m will be spent on the social care workforce over the next few years, focusing on training for staff and mental health and wellbeing support. Amid deep concerns over a growing funding shortfall for social care in England, the government announced a new tax in September, which it said would raise Â£12bn a year. The Health and Social Care Levy will begin in April 2022 as a 1.25% rise in National Insurance. From 2023, it will then become a separate tax on earned income. As the name suggests, it won't just apply to social care, but will also go towards fixing the funding gap in the NHS, caused by dealing with the treatment backlogs created by Covid. In fact, most of the money will go on this in the early stages, with more switching to social care over time. The tax will apply UK-wide, and an extra 1.25% will also be charged on share dividends. The administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who oversee their own health and care policy, will receive an extra Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. Here are more details Â© 2025 BBC.

"The government has promised more help for disabled people to adapt their homes, under plans to improve social care services in England. A policy paper says additional support, alongside a new service for small repairs, will help people receive care in their own home for longer. More investment in technologies such as motion alarms has also been promised. Labour said the plans ""fall woefully short of the mark"" and would not solve an immediate crisis in the sector. The proposals have been detailed in a new long-termstrategy paper,externalfor improving care services over the next decade. They will be paid for using money from a planned increase to National Insurance (NI), a tax paid by working people, from next April. What will the new Health and Social Care tax cost me? MPs back change to social care funding in England What are the challenges facing social care? The government says the tax rise is expected to raise Â£12bn a year, which will go initially towards easing pressure on the NHS. In October, it confirmed it plans to spend Â£5.4bn on social care over the next three years, with Â£1.7bn earmarked for improving services. The remaining Â£3.6bn will fund a more generous means test for receiving local council support, and a new Â£86,000lifetime cap on care fees. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. In its paper published on Wednesday, it detailed plans to spend just under Â£1bn of this Â£1.7bn amount on services, including: Â£300m for supported housing, where accommodation is provided alongside care support Â£150m to invest in new technologies, such as personal alarm systems and online rotas for staff Â£500m will be put towards improving training and qualifications for staff Â£5m to find new ways to inform people about how they can access available support The government has also said it will allow disabled people to claim bigger payments from their local authority for home adaptations. This will be delivered by increasing the current Â£30,000 upper limit of an existing scheme, called the Disabled Facilities Grant. The grants can be put towards the cost of changes such as installing stairlifts, wetrooms and home technologies. Ministers say they will also consult next year on changing the financial means-test that allows people to qualify for payments. They also say they will launch a separate ""practical support service"" to help people with more minor repairs to their homes. There was a lot of hope riding on Wednesday's announcement of government plans for adult social care. In a care system that has been in crisis for a long time, people wanted a clear vision for the future. The care minister said she was setting out an ambitious 10-year plan, on an issue that other governments had ducked for too long. The aim to provide outstanding personalised care which is fair and accessible will be welcomed, but for many in the care sector the actual details of what is proposed are disappointing. They argue they do nothing to fix the acute problems they face now. They had hoped much more would be done to attract care workers, as care providers are struggling to recruit enough staff. Council officials had asked for extra funding over winter because an estimated 400,000 people in England are either waiting for services, or waiting to be assessed. The paper provides a future vision, but it doesn't deal with the immediate bumps in the road ahead. Unveiling the plans in the Commons, Health Minister Gillian Keegan said they would give people more choice and support to lead ""independent lives"". She added that successive governments had ducked the challenges posed by the sector, but ministers were now ""determined to get it right"". But shadow social care minister Liz Kendall said the paper lacked a ""long-term strategy"" to improve carers' pay and conditions, or recruit additional people into the sector to meet growing demand. She told MPs that the document would not help clear waiting lists for those waiting to get care support from their local council. ""Hundreds of thousands of older and disabled people are being left without the vital support they need, piling even more pressure on their families and the NHS at the worst possible time,"" she added. Camille Leavold, who manages Abbots Care, says low pay and poor prospects for care workers mean she struggles to recruit and retain staff. The company, which she co-founded, has 500 employees, who provide support to 1,000 people in their own homes. She says that without additional funding to allow employers to boost salaries, a lack of availability of homecare will only worsen. She also wants social care professionalised, with all care workers on a professional register, ""in the same way nursing was professionalised"". Read more here The Local Government Association said the ambitions in the paper should be balanced against the ""wider reality of the funding backdrop"" for local authorities in England, which it represents. Tory councillor David Fothergill, who chairs the LGA's community wellbeing board, said funding was ""insufficient to meet current and rising demand"". ""While councils share the government's ambition and want nothing more than to deliver it, they will need a substantially bigger share of the new health and social care levy for that to happen,"" he added. Caroline Abrahams, charity director of Age UK, said a lack of investment meant changes to the sector would be modest and slow. She added: ""Rather than the Formula One vehicle that was required, the paper is an underpowered saloon car at best."" What is happening to the cap on care costs?

"A cap on the amount people in England pay for social care is to be postponed by two years. Councils had warned adult care services could worsen if the rollout was not delayed. The cap on care costs was due to be introduced in October 2023. The delay was announced in Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement. It means some people will continue to pay more than Â£86,000 for lifelong care needs. Following concern overchallenges including staffing and financial pressures, the government said an extra Â£2.8bn would be available for adult social care next year and Â£4.7bn the following year. This includes delaying the cap on social care costs, allowing councils to increase council tax by up to 5% and Â£1bn of extra funding next year, followed by Â£1.7bn the next year. Money for schools, care and NHS - but is it enough? Health Secretary Stephen Barclay said 200,000 more care packages would be delivered with this funding. Sir Andrew Dilnot, who helped to devise the care cap plan, said the delay was ""extraordinarily disappointing"". He said Mr Hunt had broken the government's2019 manifesto commitment,externalto fix social care. However, the National Care Forum - which represents not-for-profit health and social care providers - said funding increases were welcome, but ""much more is needed to put the sector on a sustainable long-term footing"". People would no longer pay more than Â£86,000 towards their care during their lifetime. The Â£86,000 limit, or cap, would only cover personal care, such as help washing or dressing. It would not cover living costs such as food, energy bills or accommodation After people reach the Â£86,000 cap, personal care would be paid for by local authorities People with assets under Â£20,000 wouldn't have to contribute to care costs (compared with Â£14,250 now). However, they might have to contribute from their income. Assets are things you own - like a house or savings Those with between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 would get help towards costs from their local council. This would be means-tested - so, it depends on things like income and property MPs back change to social care funding in England What are the challenges facing social care? Critics warned that people with fewer savings might end up using a bigger proportion of their own assets than better-off people. For example, after reaching the Â£86,000 cap, someone with a Â£100,000 house would be left with Â£20,000 - 20% of the value. (The first Â£20,000 of someone's assets is protected under the proposals). However, someone with a Â£500,000 house would be left with Â£414,000 after reaching the cap - leaving them about 83% of the value. Also under the proposals: Means-tested help that people get from their local councilwould not count towards the Â£86,000 cap,external Only money from someone's own income or savings would count So, if someone's care costs Â£860 a week and they were meeting the cost themselves, it would take 100 weeks to hit the cap. However, if the same person received council help it would take longer than 100 weeks. That means poorer people receiving means-tested help would make contributions from their own money for longer. The cap wouldn't cover living costs, like rent, food and utility bills. The guidance says people would have to meet these themselves - ""including after they reach the cap"". The government said living costs would be up to Â£200 a week. Will people still have to sell their homes? Government changes rules on social care cap Social care works differently across the UK. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies. Personal care, such as help with washing and dressing, is currently free,externalinScotlandfor those assessed by their local authority as needing it.

"Boris Johnson has narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back his social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced last week to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. The PM has insisted it is more generous than the current system. The cap will cover fees for personal care, like help with washing and dressing. It will not cover living costs such as care home fees, food or utility bills. Under the government's wider social care plan, from October 2023: those with assets of less than Â£20,000 will not have to pay anything from these towards care fees - although they might have to pay from their income those with more than Â£100,000 in assets - the value of their home, savings or investments - will not get any financial help from the council those with assets between Â£20,000 and Â£100,000 will qualify for council help, but will have to pay Â£86,000 out of their own pocket to reach the cap On Monday night, MPs backed an amendment to the Health and Care Bill required to implement the government's proposed cap by 272 votes to 246. Nineteen Conservative MPs voted against the government. It is believed a further 28 defied party orders to back the plan and abstained instead. The bill will now head to the House of Lords, where peers are widely expected to push for changes to the government's blueprint for how the cap will work. What could care changes cost you and your family? Claims about social care fact-checked What are the challenges facing social care? Will the cap really fix the social care system? Defending the policy, health minister Edward Argar said no one would lose from the reforms compared with the current system and the majority of people would win. Pushed by colleagues, he said he believed it was important that an assessment of the impact should be made available before the bill completed its passage through Parliament. The Tory rebels included former senior ministers Esther McVey and Mark Harper, while former health secretary Jeremy Hunt was among those who abstained. Mr Hunt told BBC Breakfast the government's wider plans for social care were a ""step in the right direction"" and ""an improvement on what we have today"". But he said its plans for calculating the cap were a ""big disappointment"" and ""not as generous as people like me wanted"". After a self-proclaimed mistake over sleaze that led to a fortnight of grisly headlines, and howls of complaint about plans for the railways last week, Boris Johnson's appearance at an important annual business conference could have been a moment to reassert his authority, to remind his backbenchers what the might of a leader with an 80-seat majority looks like. But that is really not what panned out. If anything the day gave his backbench troops a painful visual metaphor to agonise over of a prime minister, leafing through the pages of his prepared speech, asking for forgiveness because he has quite literally lost his place. And on Monday night he faced more challenge from his own side over the less generous than expected plans for care for the elderly and vulnerable. The vote was not lost, but the chunky number of quiet abstentions tell a story of their own. Read Laura's blog in full Under the new plans, money spent on living costs such as food, bills and accommodation would not count towards the limit. The threshold for getting some council support to pay for costs will be more generous, with people with assets up to Â£100,000 able to qualify, rather than Â£23,250 currently. The governmentannounced last week,externalthat only the payments people made out of their own pocket - not those from councils - would count towards the cap. Local authorities will meet care costs beyond the Â£86,000 cap, which ministers say will be funded througha new health and social care tax. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own policies for health and social care. Sally Warren, policy director at the King's Fund health think tank, criticised the change that was ""sprung upon MPs with very little notice and with no impact assessment"". ""The change to the social care cap is a regressive step that will leave people with low levels of wealth still exposed to very high care costs,"" she said. ""It is likely to mean that some people with moderate assets living in poorer areas will still be forced to sell their home to pay for their care, while wealthier people from richer parts of the country will be protected from this."" When asked whether people may still have to sell their homes to pay for care, Mr Johnson's official spokesman said: ""I can't predict individual situations."" After the vote result, Labour's Liz Kendall, shadow minister for social care, said: ""Tory MPs broke the promise they were elected on that nobody would have to sell their home to pay for care. ""Instead they voted to tax ordinary working people, while the wealthiest in our country are unaffected."" But the prime minister said the new system would be ""progressive"" and ""much better"" than the existing one. ""Under the existing system nobody gets any support if they have assets of Â£23,000 or more - now you get support if you have Â£100,000 or less, so we're helping people,"" Mr Johnson said. He added: ""We're addressing a longstanding social injustice and it will benefit the people of this country."" Lorraine, pictured as a child, and her mother Roma Lorraine Hershon from Northumberland says her mother Roma, who lives in a care home, has spent ""every penny that she ever earned"" on care. Despite selling her house and drawing on her savings, a total bill of Â£140,000 and rising has left Roma unable to afford items such as new slippers and clothes, she adds. She says for her mother, 83, selling her home was ""probably the worst thing ever"". ""She was a single parent, she worked night and day to have her own home - and then it's all gone,"" Lorraine adds. ""Nobody thinks it will happen to them... They have no idea the system is there to suck every penny out of you, regardless of your circumstances."" Every adult receiving care will have an account measuring how much they spend on care fees from their own income or assets Those with total assets worth more than Â£100,000 will have to pay all the care fees themselves Once assets fall below Â£100,000, people will be able to claim means-tested payments from their council to help with costs If they cannot pay for care from their income, they will have to contribute Â£1 for every Â£250 they have in assets Care home fees - such as for food and rent - will not count towards the Â£86,000 limit but will be capped at Â£200 a week People with assets under Â£20,000 won't have to contribute to their care costs, although they might have to contribute from their income.

"There is no need to call off Christmas parties despite the emergence of the Omicron variant, the health secretary has said, as he urged people to get a booster jab to fight Covid. Sajid Javid said people should consider measures such as taking Covid tests or wearing face masks when socialising. But NHS Providers said some NHS trusts had asked staff ""not to mix in big groups"" in the run-up to Christmas. It comes amid an expansion of the booster vaccination rollout. Is an office Christmas party too risky? When can I get my booster jab? What Covid rules are being toughened? Can the NHS boost the booster programme? Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News some trusts were setting an example by making that request to staff because of the ""potential threat to their health and what they will be available to do"". The booster jab programme was expanded amid concern that the Omicron variant of coronavirus may spread more quickly and make vaccines less effective. In light of the variant, the government has accelerated new contracts with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to buy 114m additional Covid vaccine doses for 2022 and 2023. The deals - which are made up of 60m Moderna and 54m more Pfizer doses - include access to modified vaccines if they are needed to protect against Omicron and future variants of concern. The government said it already has enough Moderna and Pfizer doses for the expanded booster programme, with Mr Javid adding the agreements would ""future proof"" the vaccine rollout. The latest agreements come on top of the 35m extra Pfizer doses ordered in August for delivery in the second half of 2022, and 60m Novavax and 7.5m GSK/Sanofi doses which are also expected next year. The Novavax and GSK/Sanofi vaccines have yet to receive regulatory approval for use in the UK. Government scientists have said the impact of the variant on the UK is ""highly uncertain""but it may require a ""very stringent response""to avoid unsustainable pressure on the NHS. A total of 32 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK so far - 22 in England and 10 in Scotland. On Wednesday, the UK recorded a further 48,374 coronavirus cases and another 171 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. More than 18 million people in the UK have already had a booster jab, with a further 392,589 recorded on Tuesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to book in for their booster as soon as it is offered to them and suggested there was no reason that companies should be considering cancelling their annual staff Christmas parties. At Prime Minister's Questions - where he insisted thatall Covid rules were followed at Downing Street last Christmasafter media claims of parties during lockdown - he said the government had taken ""balanced and proportionate"" measures to protect people from the new variant. This video can not be played Watch: Health Secretary Sajid Javid says there's no need to change Christmas plans On Tuesday UK Health Security Agency head Dr Jenny Harries said people should not socialise ""when we don't particularly need to"". Mr Javid said the right thing to do was to follow the existing guidance, including the changes made in England in the last few days. Covid restrictions have been strengthenedin response to the Omicron variant. New measures include: Face masks are once again mandatory on public transport and in shops in England. Recent contacts of people identified as having contracted the Omicron variant are now required to self-isolate for 10 days even if they are fully vaccinated. All arrivals to the UK must now take a PCR test within two days - but Labour has called forthe reintroduction of pre-departure testing for travellers to the UK, after scientists advising the government said they would be ""valuable"" to limit further cases of the Omicron variant. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch told Times Radio people should do a ""version of Covid certification"" without the law telling them to, by ensuring they are vaccinated but also taking a lateral flow test each time before they attend a social event. Some hospitality businesses havealready reported cancellationssince the confirmation of the first cases of the new variant being found in the UK. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UK Hospitality, told BBC Breakfast the industry hoped the prime minister's words would give people the confidence to continue to make Christmas plans and would ""stem the flow of cancellations which we are starting to see"". This video can not be played Yvette Cooper says it is ""really irresponsible"" for the government not to make Covid testing before travelling a requirement NHS England is to issue detailed guidance to hospitals, pharmacists and GPs about the major expansion of the Covid booster vaccine programme. The government aims to offer all adults in England a top-up shot by 31 January. People become eligible to book a booster jab three months after their second. Hospital hubs will be asked to offer vaccines to the public as well as NHS staff and more pharmacies will be used in a bid to meet the January target. 'We could miss our son's wedding over travel rules' What does Omicron mean for Christmas parties? Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast the vaccination programme needed to deliver one million more jabs a week to reach that target and said more volunteers were needed to help with tasks at vaccination centres. He said there was ""nothing more important"" than the two-month booster push, but acknowledged it was a ""tough ask"". The health secretary said the NHS was working with GP representatives to suspend some of the workload of GPs so they can ""concentrate on vaccine delivery"". Northern Ireland has also announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Scotland and Wales have said their booster programmes will be ramped up, but are yet to lay out the full details. There's been much talk of the ability of Omicron to get around some of the defences built up by vaccination. So why bother with boosters? Why not tweak the vaccines like manufacturers say they can? When it comes to immunity vaccines do two things - protect us from infection and from serious illness. Some of the variants that have emerged, including Delta which is dominant in the UK, have reduced the ability of the vaccines to protect against infection. On paper it looks like Omicron may do the same, although it's still too early to tell. But the vaccines have held up very well in protecting against serious illness for all variants so far. The booster dose has been shown to significantly increase the immune response, so will be clearly beneficial even if the worst fears are realised about Omicron. What's more, new vaccines would take 100 days to produce and then you've got to get them into arms. Whereas the current vaccines are available right now. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said accelerating the booster rollout would have ""consequences"" for a health service that was already stretched. Meanwhile, the doctors' union, the BMA,warned GPs were already working extra hoursand would struggle to maintain their existing workload if they were required to help roll out boosters.

"Plans to reform the way people pay for social care in England have been voted on by MPs. The government's proposals were approved but it faced significant opposition from other political parties and some of its own MPs - with concerns that not enough is being done to protect the poorest pensioners. The reforms include a cap - or limit - on the amount people will have to pay towards their personal care. It will be set at Â£86,000. After this has been reached, the local authority will pay for the care. This does not include living costs such as food, energy bills or accommodation. MPs back change to social care cost cap funding There have been claims about how much these changes will benefit people - we've been looking at some of them. As well as the cap, people will be eligible for some financial help from their local council towards the cost of care. This is means-tested and will be available to people who need social careand have less than Â£100,000 in assets.,external If someone has less than Â£20,000 in assets, then they won't have to spend any of those assets on their personal care. Social care: Boris Johnson defends his plan amid criticism over the cost cap The question being discussed by the prime minister is when your home counts towards your assets. He's right in his explanation. If you are receiving social care at home or if you are in a care home and your spouse is living in your home, the value of the home is not counted towards your assets. That's called the housing disregard. If you go into a care home and you do not have a spouse living in your home, then the value of your home is counted towards your assets and you may have to sell it, although there are schemes that allow you to defer the costs, and for the property to be sold after you die. This is controversial because it is at odds with what the Conservative Party's 2019 manifesto said. It promised that: ""nobody needing care should be forced to sell their home to pay for it"". You can read more about how the new system will work here But,as we've pointed out before, the government's language around this has shifted since the manifesto pledge. The Health Secretary Sajid Javid has said ""no-one will have to sell their house in their lifetime"". And Business Minister Paul Scully told Sky News today: ""There will be fewer people selling their houses and hopefully none."" The first thing to say about this claim from Labour's shadow health secretary is that this would only be the case if somebody was receiving social care in a care home - not if they were getting care in their own home. If they were receiving care at home or had a spouse living at home, then the home would not count towards their assets - under the housing disregard. If this wasn't the case, the rules mean that you would have to contribute from your savings and other assets towards your social care until you got down to having assets worth Â£20,000. This could include having to agree to sell your home in future. So in Mr Ashworth's example, if the Â£80,000 house was your only asset, you could lose three-quarters of your assets. And remember, these figures cover personal care and not other costs such as accommodation and food. People may be eligible for means-tested benefits to help with those costs. This piece was updated on 23 November to clarify the means-testing for social care support. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

"Mohamed Isa Omar was one of just two people to survive last week's tragedy It has been almost a week since Mohamed Isa Omar was pulled from the cold waters of the Channel, one of only two people to survive the deadliest crossing on record. But as he sits in a wheelchair in a French car park, the 28-year-old is clearly still traumatised. He speaks softly, telling the BBC he is haunted by what he saw that night. ""I saw people dying in front of me,"" Mohamed says. ""Those of us who could not swim, drowned and died within minutes. ""It was so cold the water, so cold."" Mohamed was among at least 29 people who set off from the coast of France at about 22:00 local time (21:00 GMT) a week ago. The other occupants were strangers to him - simply more people willing to risk the dangerous crossing over the Channel to reach the UK, a journey made by more than 25,000 migrants this year. They had been travelling for about three-and-a-half hours when the boat started to sink, Mohamed said. At this point, the occupants who still had phones began to make desperate calls for help. A fellow survivor told Kurdish media they had called both French and English sides of the Channel. Calais activists: Migrants call us from boats asking for help Why do migrants leave France for the UK? ""Our mobiles were already in the water,"" Mohamed recalls. ""But one of us had his mobile still working, he called, and the [British] authorities told him to send the location. ""But before he does that, the mobile went into the water too and we could not send anything."" Mohamed heard a second man make a call via speakerphone, saying the person at the other end spoke English. ""But he also didn't have any chance,"" Mohamed told BBC Persian. ""The water got his mobile too before he sends anything. ""That's why people started to drown and die. I saw people dying in front of me, but I started to swim. I saw a big ship far away and started to swim towards it."" It would be hours, though, until Mohamed was rescued. According to the only other survivor, an Iraqi Kurd named as Mohammed Shekha Ahmed, a number of people tried to cling onto the deflated boat until the sun rose. ""Then when the light shone, no one could take it any more,"" he told Iraq's Rudaw network. Their bodies were spotted by a French fisherman at almost 13:00 on Wednesday. A rescue operation was launched, but the two men were the only ones left alive. ""That's why they found their way to us, took us to the hospital, and we were saved, thanks be to Allah,"" Mohamed said. His legs are bandaged, recovering from injuries sustained during hours at sea. All of the names of those who died are not yet known. Only one person has been officially named:a young woman hoping to reach her fiancÃ©. Among the missing are amother and her three children-  including a little girl who was just seven years old. Both the men who made the calls died, Mohamed said. It is unclear who they reached when calling for help, or where they actually were. This video can not be played Channel disaster: A father's anguish, a missing family The remains of the boat and its occupants were in French territorial waters when the Coastguard was asked for assistance. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The French led a search and rescue operation for an incident that occurred in French territorial waters on Wednesday 24 November, where 27 people tragically died. ""As part of this operation, the French requested support from the UK, which was provided by HMG Coastguard as soon as it was requested."" A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesperson said that on that date, they received ""more than 90 alerts, including 999 emergency calls, from the English Channel, and we responded to all of them"". ""HM Coastguard does not routinely enter French waters unless asked to assist with a response by our search and rescue partners in France, as we were last week,"" the spokesperson told the BBC. ""On that occasion, we sent HM Coastguard's helicopter from Lydd to support the search and rescue effort and the RNLI lifeboat from Ramsgate also participated in the search.""

"House prices in the UK have returned to double-digit growth following a slowdown in the market after the stamp duty holiday came to an end. Annual house price growth hit 10% in November, according to the Nationwide Building Society. That was an increase from the 9.9% growth seen the month before. But Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said it was still unclear what impact the new Omicron variant would have on a ""buoyant"" housing market. The average price of a UK house was Â£252,687 in November - nearly 15% higher than March 2020, when the coronavirus crisis started. Mr Gardner said: ""There have been some signs of cooling in housing market activity in recent months; for example, the number of housing transactions were down almost 30% year on year in October."" ""But this was almost inevitable, given the expiry of the stamp duty holiday [in England and Northern Ireland] at the end of September, which gave buyers a strong incentive to bring forward their purchase to avoid additional tax."" He added that fewer people being made redundant than expected after the end of the furlough scheme could provide a further boost to the market. Consumer confidence, however, has been dented by a sharp increase in everyday prices since the economy reopened, Nationwide suggested. The increase in the cost of living surged at its fastest pace in almost 10 years, hitting 4.2% in the year to October,according to the Office for National Statistics. The Bank of England has said it may have to raise interest rates in the ""coming months"" to tackle soaring costs. 40-year mortgages pose questions for homeowners Slow rise from ultra-low mortgage rates predicted Why is the cost of living going up? Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, suggested linked mortgage rates could also head upwards as a result. ""Households can lengthen mortgage terms to offset the hit to monthly repayments from higher rates,"" he said. ""In addition, the proportion of incomes that households are prepared to devote to housing might have risen permanently due to the pandemic and the long-term shift to working from home."" But he still expects that house prices will stagnate in the first half of 2022, and only rise slowly in the second half if mortgage rates rise enough over the coming months. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said that a recent decline in mortgage approvals ""bodes well for the housing market avoiding a significant correction now that stamp duty has returned to its normal level"". He also pointed out a shift in working patterns during the pandemic meant home-buyers were looking for bigger properties, prompting a ""race for space"". That demand has been boosted by savings that some households have managed to accumulate during the pandemic, as well as a ""little-damaged"" jobs market emerging from the pandemic, he said. 40-year mortgages pose questions for homeowners Petition calls for end to property gazumping Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Another energy supplier has collapsed amid an ongoing surge in gas prices, UK regulator Ofgem has said. Zog Energy, which has about 11,700 domestic energy customers, ceased trading on Wednesday. It marks the latest company to go bust under higher wholesale gas prices, which have made it difficult for companies to keep price promises. Ofgem will appoint a new supplier for the firm's customers. In the meantime, customers should wait until their new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch elsewhere, it said. The energy watchdog added that taking a meter reading will also help smooth the process when Zog Energy's customers are contacted by their new supplier. Entice and Orbit are latest energy firms to go bust What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? They join nearly four million other households, which have seen their supplier fail since the start of the pandemic. Neil Lawrence, director of Retail at Ofgem, said customers did not need to worry. ""Under our safety net we'll make sure your energy supplies continue... You can rely on your energy supply as normal."" In a statementon its website,external, Zog Energy emphasised that customers' supplies are ""secure"" and funds that consumers have paid into their accounts will be protected if they are in credit. Customers will still continue to receive gas or electricity even if the energy supplier goes bust. Ofgem will move your account to a new supplier, but it may take a few weeks. Your new supplier should then contact you to explain what is happening with your account While you wait to hear from your new supplier: check your current balance and - if possible - download any bills; take a photo of your meter reading If you pay by direct debit, there is no need to cancel it straight away, Citizens Advice says. Wait until your new account is set up before you cancel it If you are in credit, your money is protected and you'll be paid back. If you were in debt to the old supplier, you'll still have to pay the money back to your new supplier instead Read more about the next best steps to take here. The collapse of Zog comes after several other smaller suppliers, such asOrbit and Entice, announced they would cease tradinglast week. The biggest casualty of the gas price spike so far is Bulb Energy. The UK's seventh largest supplierwas handed about Â£1,000 per customer from the UK governmentlast month to make sure it could continue supplying energy. The firm, which has about 1.7 million customers, was put into special administration because its size meant the regulator was unable to find another company to take over Bulb's customers. This means Bulb is being run by the government through the regulator Ofgem. That will allow it to keep trading with a Â£1.7bn loan. More than 20 energy suppliers have now failed following a spike in wholesale gas prices. As a result of the energy price cap, which limits what firms can charge their customers, some businesses have been forced to sell energy for less than they bought it for. Bigger companies tend to buy gas further in advance, which protects them from the impact of a price spike. But smaller firms are less able to do and have come under more pressure. On Wednesday, energy regulator Ofgem described the rise in prices as ""unprecedented"". It said in October that it would review how the price cap on gas and electricity bills is calculated following company failures. Ofgem can review the price cap - which is the maximum amount per unit that a supplier can charge households on a standard tariff - twice a year. The most recent review lifted the price cap by 12% to a record Â£1,277. Are you struggling to pay your energy bills? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Rapper Travis Scott says he is devastated by what happened at the Astroworld festival Travis Scott's offer to pay the funeral costs of Astroworld victims has been rejected by half of the bereaved families. This includesthe family of nine-year-old Ezra Blount- the youngest of 10 concertgoers killed during a crush at the rapper's festival in Texas. Scott made the offer last week, amidmultiple lawsuits over the tragedy. A lawyer for the family of 14-year-old John Hilgert called the gesture ""demeaning and inappropriate"". ""Of all the things this case is about, that's the least of any concern,""he told Rolling Stone,external. ""This family is set on making change, and ensuring this never happens at a concert again."" The crowd surge occurred during Scott's headline set on Friday, 5 November. At the time, there were about 50,000 people attending the festival at Houston's NRG Park complex. Ten of the victims have now died. The eldest was 27. Blount, who lived in Dallas, died nine days after the concert. He had previously been placed in medically induced coma due to the severity of his injuries. Scott's lawyer, Daniel Petrocelli, wrote to the nine-year-old's family the day after his funeral, on 23 November, offering to pay for the service. ""Travis is devastated by the tragedy that occurred at the Astroworld Festival and grieves for the families whose loved ones died or were injured,"" the letter read. ""Travis is committed to doing his part to help the families who have suffered and begin the long process of healing in the Houston community. Toward that end, Travis would like to pay for the funeral expenses for Mr Blount's son."" The family immediately declined the offer, said their lawyer Bob Hilliard. Astroworld tragedy: Were warning signs missed? Festival survivors recall panic: 'I had to get out of there' Who were the victims? ""I have no doubt Mr Scott feels remorse,"" he wrote in a letter to the musician's representative. ""His journey ahead will be painful. He must face and hopefully see that he bears some of the responsibility for this tragedy."" Other families have portrayed the rapper's offer as an attempt to repair his public image. Philip Corboy, the lawyer for the families of 21-year-old friends Jacob Jurinek and Franco Patino, said the rapper's approach through legal teams had left the impression ""that all he was trying to do was... lessen the public outcry"". ""If he's trying to impress upon the families that he's sincere and has concern for them and realise that funerals can be expensive, what Scott's team did is not the way to do it,"" Corboy added. ""You don't get a piece of paper in the mail from a lawyer in Beverly Hills who says he represents Travis Scott. These families are raw right now; that lacks any personal touch."" Tony Buzbee, representing the family of Axel Acosta, 21, also questioned Scott's motives in choosing to make the announcement through ""a press release for everyone to see"". ""He says he feels sorry for them but he's quick to say it wasn't his fault. He's no different than any defendant pointing fingers to someone else. They don't want funeral expenses from him. Whatever we get from him we're going to get through the court system."" Scott, one of the biggest names in rap music, launched Astroworld with concert promoters Live Nation in 2018. This video can not be played ""I'm honestly just devastated"" â Travis Scott posted this video on Instagram The 30-year-old has asked victims to reach out to him, saying he ""desperately wishes to share his condolences and provide aid"", according to a statement. He also stated in an Instagram video that he was not aware how bad the situation had become during his set. ""Any time I could make out anything that's going on, I just stopped the show and helped them get the help they need,"" he said. ""I could just never imagine the severity of the situation."" Separately, rapper Megan Thee Stallion has cancelled a Houston tour date this Friday, as a sign of respect to the Astroworld victims. The Houston native performed at a previous edition of Scott's festival in 2019. ""Houston is still healing and it's important that our community be given the appropriate time to grieve,"" she said in a statement on Wednesday. ""My heart goes out to all the families that are suffering during this difficult time,"" she added. Meanwhile, event safety organisers in 15 countries, including the UK and US, have created a new body to develop and promote unified safety standards around the world. The Global Crowd Management Alliance, which was launched on Tuesday, was initially created in response to the pandemic. In a statement, its deputy chair Steve Adelman said recent incidents have shown that ""crowd management remains an essential issue for everyone"".

"There is no need to call off Christmas parties despite the emergence of the Omicron variant, the health secretary has said, as he urged people to get a booster jab to fight Covid. Sajid Javid said people should consider measures such as taking Covid tests or wearing face masks when socialising. But NHS Providers said some NHS trusts had asked staff ""not to mix in big groups"" in the run-up to Christmas. It comes amid an expansion of the booster vaccination rollout. Is an office Christmas party too risky? When can I get my booster jab? What Covid rules are being toughened? Can the NHS boost the booster programme? Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News some trusts were setting an example by making that request to staff because of the ""potential threat to their health and what they will be available to do"". The booster jab programme was expanded amid concern that the Omicron variant of coronavirus may spread more quickly and make vaccines less effective. In light of the variant, the government has accelerated new contracts with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to buy 114m additional Covid vaccine doses for 2022 and 2023. The deals - which are made up of 60m Moderna and 54m more Pfizer doses - include access to modified vaccines if they are needed to protect against Omicron and future variants of concern. The government said it already has enough Moderna and Pfizer doses for the expanded booster programme, with Mr Javid adding the agreements would ""future proof"" the vaccine rollout. The latest agreements come on top of the 35m extra Pfizer doses ordered in August for delivery in the second half of 2022, and 60m Novavax and 7.5m GSK/Sanofi doses which are also expected next year. The Novavax and GSK/Sanofi vaccines have yet to receive regulatory approval for use in the UK. Government scientists have said the impact of the variant on the UK is ""highly uncertain""but it may require a ""very stringent response""to avoid unsustainable pressure on the NHS. A total of 32 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK so far - 22 in England and 10 in Scotland. On Wednesday, the UK recorded a further 48,374 coronavirus cases and another 171 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. More than 18 million people in the UK have already had a booster jab, with a further 392,589 recorded on Tuesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to book in for their booster as soon as it is offered to them and suggested there was no reason that companies should be considering cancelling their annual staff Christmas parties. At Prime Minister's Questions - where he insisted thatall Covid rules were followed at Downing Street last Christmasafter media claims of parties during lockdown - he said the government had taken ""balanced and proportionate"" measures to protect people from the new variant. This video can not be played Watch: Health Secretary Sajid Javid says there's no need to change Christmas plans On Tuesday UK Health Security Agency head Dr Jenny Harries said people should not socialise ""when we don't particularly need to"". Mr Javid said the right thing to do was to follow the existing guidance, including the changes made in England in the last few days. Covid restrictions have been strengthenedin response to the Omicron variant. New measures include: Face masks are once again mandatory on public transport and in shops in England. Recent contacts of people identified as having contracted the Omicron variant are now required to self-isolate for 10 days even if they are fully vaccinated. All arrivals to the UK must now take a PCR test within two days - but Labour has called forthe reintroduction of pre-departure testing for travellers to the UK, after scientists advising the government said they would be ""valuable"" to limit further cases of the Omicron variant. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch told Times Radio people should do a ""version of Covid certification"" without the law telling them to, by ensuring they are vaccinated but also taking a lateral flow test each time before they attend a social event. Some hospitality businesses havealready reported cancellationssince the confirmation of the first cases of the new variant being found in the UK. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UK Hospitality, told BBC Breakfast the industry hoped the prime minister's words would give people the confidence to continue to make Christmas plans and would ""stem the flow of cancellations which we are starting to see"". This video can not be played Yvette Cooper says it is ""really irresponsible"" for the government not to make Covid testing before travelling a requirement NHS England is to issue detailed guidance to hospitals, pharmacists and GPs about the major expansion of the Covid booster vaccine programme. The government aims to offer all adults in England a top-up shot by 31 January. People become eligible to book a booster jab three months after their second. Hospital hubs will be asked to offer vaccines to the public as well as NHS staff and more pharmacies will be used in a bid to meet the January target. 'We could miss our son's wedding over travel rules' What does Omicron mean for Christmas parties? Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast the vaccination programme needed to deliver one million more jabs a week to reach that target and said more volunteers were needed to help with tasks at vaccination centres. He said there was ""nothing more important"" than the two-month booster push, but acknowledged it was a ""tough ask"". The health secretary said the NHS was working with GP representatives to suspend some of the workload of GPs so they can ""concentrate on vaccine delivery"". Northern Ireland has also announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Scotland and Wales have said their booster programmes will be ramped up, but are yet to lay out the full details. There's been much talk of the ability of Omicron to get around some of the defences built up by vaccination. So why bother with boosters? Why not tweak the vaccines like manufacturers say they can? When it comes to immunity vaccines do two things - protect us from infection and from serious illness. Some of the variants that have emerged, including Delta which is dominant in the UK, have reduced the ability of the vaccines to protect against infection. On paper it looks like Omicron may do the same, although it's still too early to tell. But the vaccines have held up very well in protecting against serious illness for all variants so far. The booster dose has been shown to significantly increase the immune response, so will be clearly beneficial even if the worst fears are realised about Omicron. What's more, new vaccines would take 100 days to produce and then you've got to get them into arms. Whereas the current vaccines are available right now. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said accelerating the booster rollout would have ""consequences"" for a health service that was already stretched. Meanwhile, the doctors' union, the BMA,warned GPs were already working extra hoursand would struggle to maintain their existing workload if they were required to help roll out boosters.

It has been a busy few hours in the House of Commons, so here is a run down of what's happened: Alison HoltSocial affairs editor There was a lot of hope riding on todayâs announcement of
government plans for adult social care. In a care system that has been in
crisis for a long time, people wanted a clear vision for the future. The care
minister said she was setting out an ""ambitious"" 10-year plan on an issue that
other governments had ducked for too long. The aim to provide outstanding
personalised care which is fair and accessible will be welcomed, but for many
in the care sector, the actual details of what is proposed are disappointing. They argue they do nothing to fix the acute problems they face now. They had
hoped much more would be done to attract care workers, as care providers are
struggling to recruit enough staff. Council officials had asked for extra
funding over winter because an estimated 400,000 people in England are

The MP and former justice secretary asks how the government is going to make sure the money is used to ""enrich the lives"" of adults living with disabilities, adding currently they ""just don't have the choice that they deserve"". Gillian Keegan praises him for all his ""excellent work"" on the issue of support for disabled people, adding the money is specifically to provide better support them She adds they have also included detail in the proposal to help young adults with disabilities get into work, arguing ""not enough of them are getting that support today"". Conservative Paul Bristow tells MPs he spoke to a social care user who told him that living in supported housing ""made him feel like a king"" because he had access to his own private shower. ""The small differences between hospital care and being supported to live independently are striking,"" Bristow says. He asks the minister to confirm that one of the aims of the government's strategy is to ensure that ""people can live as independently as possible for as long as possible"". The minister agrees and says the government wants to ensure people get the right care. The government's white paper on social care ""sets out some important, long overdue policy advances"", says Caroline Abrahams, director of the charity Age UK. But, she argues, ""lack of investment means any changes will be modest and slow to arrive, whereas the scale of the challenge is huge and demands urgent action now"". Abrahams demands a rise in care sector pay to tackle ""chronic workforce shortages"", saying pressures on staff are likely to increase if Covid surges this winter. ""There are similar concerns about unpaid carers collapsing after an unbelievably challenging 20 months too,"" she adds. Earlier, Gillian Keegan told MPs the government would be producing a separate white paper on plans to integrate the NHS and social care. Conservative Andrew Murrison says there is ""a certain irony"" in having two white papers to deal with something around integration. He asks the minister how she will solve the ""crying shame of elderly and vulnerable people languishing in acute hospital beds"" instead of receiving care at home or in a care home. Gillian Keegan says this is a problem which is putting pressure on the system and that integration will help. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tory MP Andrew Mitchell praises the plans, arguing they represent ""good and steady progress"" on reforming the social care system. He adds that his constituency of Sutton Coldfield, given its elderly demographics, is particularly invested in the changes. Mitchell says the UK government has come up with ""coherent policies"" that allow older people to live at home for as long as possible"". Gillian Keegan adds that expensive areas with older populations must enabled to live at home, using technology, adaptive housing and working with local groups and health services to achieve this. Lib Dem Daisy Cooper says the minister's statement is ""incredibly thin"" and compares it to ""fiddling with the light bulbs on the Titanic"". She says hospitals are struggling to discharge patients because the care isn't available. And she accuses the minister of failing to ""address the problem"" of integration between the NHS and social care. Gillian Keegan says the integration of health and social care is key to the government's reforms and promises MPs that a separate white paper on the issue will be coming early next year. While the government outlined its reforms in September, today it published its white paper on social care. The white paper sets out more details of how Â£1bn of spending will be allocated over the next three years. It says: Conservative MP Damian Green calls for more detail on how housing and technology can be adapted to help elderly people live at home for longer. Those who are ""frail"" can have a ""better quality of life"" if there is detailed reform in this area, he adds. Gillian Keegan says there will be more help for supported housing and, with councils, ministers will be work on how the money can be raised for this. If you cast your minds back to last week, the government narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back its social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs, However, 19 Conservative MPs voted against the proposal and it is believed 28 more refused to vote for it and abstained instead. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. But Boris Johnson has insisted it is more generous than the current system, and still managed to pass the plan thanks to his large majority. If you'd like to read more about the controversy in the commons over the social care plans, clickhere. Conservative MP - and former health secretary - Jeremy Hunt praises the social care cap, which he says will make a big difference to many people. However, he says the government's plan ""doesn't really give confidence in two crucial areas"". Firstly, he says local authorities ""barely"" have enough money to provide social care. Secondly, he says it is ""hard to seen an end to the workforce crisis"" in the social care sector. Minister Gillian Keegan acknowledges the government's plan is ""only a start"", but says the government will offer more information about money for local councils in the local government finance settlement. On staffing problems, she says: ""We do need to invest in training and learning and provide career routes."" ""Is that it?"" asks Labour's Liz Kendall as she responds to the government statement. She says the plan ""utterly fails to deal with the immediate pressures facing social care"". ""Where was the plan to end waiting lists for care... where was the long-term strategy to transform the pay and conditions of care workers,"" she asks. ""No wonder staff are leaving the sector in droves."" She says the government's white paper ""falls woefully short of the mark"". In the Commons, the minister, Gillian Keegan, says the government's plans to introduce a Health and Social Care Levy were a ""vital first step"" in fixing the social care system. She then sets out a further plan of action for the government, including Â£300m in housing investment to help people with minor repairs and changes to help independent living, increasing the upper limit. She also sets out Â£150m for adoption of digital technology in the social care system. Keegan adds that at least Â£500m will be spent on the social care workforce over the next few years, focusing on training for staff and mental health and wellbeing support. Amid deep concerns over a growing funding shortfall for social care in England, the government announced a new tax in September, which it said would raise Â£12bn a year. The Health and Social Care Levy will begin in April 2022 as a 1.25% rise in National Insurance. From 2023, it will then become a separate tax on earned income. As the name suggests, it won't just apply to social care, but will also go towards fixing the funding gap in the NHS, caused by dealing with the treatment backlogs created by Covid. In fact, most of the money will go on this in the early stages, with more switching to social care over time. The tax will apply UK-wide, and an extra 1.25% will also be charged on share dividends.

It has been a busy few hours in the House of Commons, so here is a run down of what's happened: Alison HoltSocial affairs editor There was a lot of hope riding on todayâs announcement of
government plans for adult social care. In a care system that has been in
crisis for a long time, people wanted a clear vision for the future. The care
minister said she was setting out an ""ambitious"" 10-year plan on an issue that
other governments had ducked for too long. The aim to provide outstanding
personalised care which is fair and accessible will be welcomed, but for many
in the care sector, the actual details of what is proposed are disappointing. They argue they do nothing to fix the acute problems they face now. They had
hoped much more would be done to attract care workers, as care providers are
struggling to recruit enough staff. Council officials had asked for extra
funding over winter because an estimated 400,000 people in England are
either waiting for services or waiting to be assessed. The white paper provides
a future vision, but it doesnât deal with the immediate bumps in the road

"House prices in the UK have returned to double-digit growth following a slowdown in the market after the stamp duty holiday came to an end. Annual house price growth hit 10% in November, according to the Nationwide Building Society. That was an increase from the 9.9% growth seen the month before. But Nationwide's chief economist Robert Gardner said it was still unclear what impact the new Omicron variant would have on a ""buoyant"" housing market. The average price of a UK house was Â£252,687 in November - nearly 15% higher than March 2020, when the coronavirus crisis started. Mr Gardner said: ""There have been some signs of cooling in housing market activity in recent months; for example, the number of housing transactions were down almost 30% year on year in October."" ""But this was almost inevitable, given the expiry of the stamp duty holiday [in England and Northern Ireland] at the end of September, which gave buyers a strong incentive to bring forward their purchase to avoid additional tax."" He added that fewer people being made redundant than expected after the end of the furlough scheme could provide a further boost to the market. Consumer confidence, however, has been dented by a sharp increase in everyday prices since the economy reopened, Nationwide suggested. The increase in the cost of living surged at its fastest pace in almost 10 years, hitting 4.2% in the year to October,according to the Office for National Statistics. The Bank of England has said it may have to raise interest rates in the ""coming months"" to tackle soaring costs. 40-year mortgages pose questions for homeowners Slow rise from ultra-low mortgage rates predicted Why is the cost of living going up? Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, suggested linked mortgage rates could also head upwards as a result. ""Households can lengthen mortgage terms to offset the hit to monthly repayments from higher rates,"" he said. ""In addition, the proportion of incomes that households are prepared to devote to housing might have risen permanently due to the pandemic and the long-term shift to working from home."" But he still expects that house prices will stagnate in the first half of 2022, and only rise slowly in the second half if mortgage rates rise enough over the coming months. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said that a recent decline in mortgage approvals ""bodes well for the housing market avoiding a significant correction now that stamp duty has returned to its normal level"". He also pointed out a shift in working patterns during the pandemic meant home-buyers were looking for bigger properties, prompting a ""race for space"". That demand has been boosted by savings that some households have managed to accumulate during the pandemic, as well as a ""little-damaged"" jobs market emerging from the pandemic, he said. 40-year mortgages pose questions for homeowners Petition calls for end to property gazumping Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Twenty three senior clinicians have written a letter calling the criticism of Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board ""unfounded"". It comes as Scottish Labour are to call for the sacking of the board's leaders in a Holyrood debate on Wednesday. Labour's Anas Sarwar alleges there is a culture of ""cover up and secrecy"" at the health board. Infections linked to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital is the subject of an ongoing public inquiry. The hospital campus opened in 2015 but has been repeatedly hit by concerns over safety and the spread of infections. More child deaths 'linked to hospital infections' Widow demands answers over Covid official's death Hospital building 'almost killed our son' 'Serious failings' over hospital infections The inquiry was called after it emerged that patients had died from infections linked to pigeon droppings and contaminated water supplies. Anearlier review,externalfound the hospital environment was at least partly to blame for the deaths of two children, including 10-year-old Milly Main. She was a leukaemia patient whose deathwas linked to a hospital-acquired infectionwhile being treated at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in the QEUH campus. The wife of Andrew Slorance believes the full details of his illness were concealed to protect the reputation of the hospital And the widow of Scottish government official Andrew Slorance believes her husband caught Covid and another infection while receiving cancer treatment. Mrs Slorance thinks the full details of his illness were concealed to protect the reputation of the flagship hospital. Last Thursday, Labour's leader Anas Sarwar said he had been contacted by two ""senior clinicians"" from the hospital abouttwo further deaths of children at the hospital. He said they were afraid to speak out publicly because of a culture of ""bullying and intimidation"". The party will call for MSPs to vote that they have no confidence in health board bosses, and that it should be taken under government control. However, in a letter to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Health Secretary Humza Yousaf, the 23 senior clinicians said they were writing to express their ""immense disappointment and frustration"" about the way their hospitals, colleagues and the treatment of their patients was being portrayed in the press and in the Scottish Parliament. ""We have been, and remain, fully committed to being completely open and transparent in all that we do and we are dismayed that the integrity of our staff has been repeatedly called into question,"" the letter says. ""Do we always get everything right when we discuss issues with families? Perhaps not. Do we ever wilfully withhold information from them? Absolutely not. ""We have grave concerns that the continued undermining nature of the current negative headlines will result in an erosion of trust between clinical staff and patients and their families."" Ten-year-old Milly Main died after contracting an infection at the Royal Hospital for Children The clinicians said staff had reported that families were ""very anxious about the safety of their relatives while in our care"". The letter adds: ""We are particularly disappointed that individual patients are being discussed in parliament without the knowledge of the families concerned, causing untold distress to families already grieving the loss of their loved one."" ""This unfounded criticism of our clinical teams and staff as well as the safety of our hospitals, is also hugely detrimental to staff morale at a time when so much is being asked of them."" The clinicians said they accepted there would always be improvements that could be made but said there was a commitment from every clinician working within NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to provide the best quality of care and to be open and honest with patients and families about their diagnosis and treatment. These photographs were taken at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow Scottish Labour have shared photographs revealing examples of mould growth inside the hospital. The photographs come from an academic paper published earlier this year exposing the risks of water in seeding infection inside hospitals. Mr Sarwar said: ""It has been two years since the culture of cover-up and secrecy at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde was brought to light. People are still dying from preventable hospital-acquired infections. ""Today's vote is a line in the sand... MSPs have a choice, they can side with families, clinicians and those campaigning for patient safety or they can back a culture of secrecy, cover-up and incompetence which has had fatal consequences."" A statement from the health board said: ""For continued claims to be made that we are less than fully open and transparent across all areas of patient care and building safety is of serious concern, and we are deeply saddened by the way in which the commitment and working practices of our staff at the QEUH and RHC are being portrayed. ""Previous investigations into such claims, including by the independent review, concluded that there is no culture of organisational bullying within NHS GGC. We are very concerned that these allegations persist as we have seen no additional evidence to substantiate any such claims."" The statement added that the health board remained ""fully committed"" to addressing any concerns raised by patients, families and staff. Speaking about the photographs of mould, a Scottish government spokesman said: ""Where there is any evidence of mould, steps are taken to remove it with full infection prevention and control oversight."" He said the academic paper made it clear that there was no harm to patients caused by the mould and that mould grows in UK hospitals on a regular basis. ""NHS staff in the QEUH and across Scotland continue to provide exceptional care to their patients and are currently doing so in the face of unprecedented pressures brought by the pandemic,"" the spokesman said. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he would enact any public inquiry recommendations.

Your writers today were Kate Whannel, Adam Durbin and Justin Parkinson, while your editor was Jennifer Scott. Thanks for following the big events of the day with us, and don't forget, you can get all the news and updates on ourwebsiteandTwitter,external. See you next week! It has been a busy few hours in the House of Commons, so here is a run down of what's happened: Alison HoltSocial affairs editor There was a lot of hope riding on todayâs announcement of
government plans for adult social care. In a care system that has been in
crisis for a long time, people wanted a clear vision for the future. The care
minister said she was setting out an ""ambitious"" 10-year plan on an issue that
other governments had ducked for too long. The aim to provide outstanding
personalised care which is fair and accessible will be welcomed, but for many
in the care sector, the actual details of what is proposed are disappointing. They argue they do nothing to fix the acute problems they face now. They had
hoped much more would be done to attract care workers, as care providers are
struggling to recruit enough staff. Council officials had asked for extra
funding over winter because an estimated 400,000 people in England are
either waiting for services or waiting to be assessed. The white paper provides
a future vision, but it doesnât deal with the immediate bumps in the road
ahead. Conservative Robert Buckland makes the last contribution to the statement, saying the proposed Â£300m to help local authorities for supported housing is an ""excellent initiative"". The MP and former justice secretary asks how the government is going to make sure the money is used to ""enrich the lives"" of adults living with disabilities, adding currently they ""just don't have the choice that they deserve"". Gillian Keegan praises him for all his ""excellent work"" on the issue of support for disabled people, adding the money is specifically to provide better support them She adds they have also included detail in the proposal to help young adults with disabilities get into work, arguing ""not enough of them are getting that support today"". Conservative Paul Bristow tells MPs he spoke to a social care user who told him that living in supported housing ""made him feel like a king"" because he had access to his own private shower. ""The small differences between hospital care and being supported to live independently are striking,"" Bristow says. He asks the minister to confirm that one of the aims of the government's strategy is to ensure that ""people can live as independently as possible for as long as possible"". The minister agrees and says the government wants to ensure people get the right care. The government's white paper on social care ""sets out some important, long overdue policy advances"", says Caroline Abrahams, director of the charity Age UK. But, she argues, ""lack of investment means any changes will be modest and slow to arrive, whereas the scale of the challenge is huge and demands urgent action now"". Abrahams demands a rise in care sector pay to tackle ""chronic workforce shortages"", saying pressures on staff are likely to increase if Covid surges this winter. ""There are similar concerns about unpaid carers collapsing after an unbelievably challenging 20 months too,"" she adds. Earlier, Gillian Keegan told MPs the government would be producing a separate white paper on plans to integrate the NHS and social care. Conservative Andrew Murrison says there is ""a certain irony"" in having two white papers to deal with something around integration. He asks the minister how she will solve the ""crying shame of elderly and vulnerable people languishing in acute hospital beds"" instead of receiving care at home or in a care home. Gillian Keegan says this is a problem which is putting pressure on the system and that integration will help. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The GMB union is unimpressed by the government's announcement today on social care spending. National officer Rachel Harrison says: âThis is like groundhog day. Care workers have been waiting for the governmentâs plan for years - since before the last election. âNow theyâre being told they have to wait even longer for any substantial reforms."" She adds that the ""catastrophic understaffing crisis"" will ""only get worse"" unless a Â£15-an-hour minimum wage is introduced for care workers.  Labour's John McDonnell (also his party's former shadow chancellor) says most unpaid carers ""are just trying to see how they can get through the next week"" - not the next 10 years. He asks what there is in the government's strategy that will ""assist unpaid carers and lift them out of poverty"". Gillian Keegan says unpaid carers are ""an essential part"" of the system, adding that the government is urging local authorities to ensure respite services are ""fully open"". She adds that the carers' allowance will go up in April 2022. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tory MP Andrew Mitchell praises the plans, arguing they represent ""good and steady progress"" on reforming the social care system. He adds that his constituency of Sutton Coldfield, given its elderly demographics, is particularly invested in the changes. Mitchell says the UK government has come up with ""coherent policies"" that allow older people to live at home for as long as possible"". Gillian Keegan adds that expensive areas with older populations must enabled to live at home, using technology, adaptive housing and working with local groups and health services to achieve this. Lib Dem Daisy Cooper says the minister's statement is ""incredibly thin"" and compares it to ""fiddling with the light bulbs on the Titanic"". She says hospitals are struggling to discharge patients because the care isn't available. And she accuses the minister of failing to ""address the problem"" of integration between the NHS and social care. Gillian Keegan says the integration of health and social care is key to the government's reforms and promises MPs that a separate white paper on the issue will be coming early next year. While the government outlined its reforms in September, today it published its white paper on social care. The white paper sets out more details of how Â£1bn of spending will be allocated over the next three years. It says: Conservative MP Damian Green calls for more detail on how housing and technology can be adapted to help elderly people live at home for longer. Those who are ""frail"" can have a ""better quality of life"" if there is detailed reform in this area, he adds. Gillian Keegan says there will be more help for supported housing and, with councils, ministers will be work on how the money can be raised for this. If you cast your minds back to last week, the government narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back its social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs, However, 19 Conservative MPs voted against the proposal and it is believed 28 more refused to vote for it and abstained instead. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. But Boris Johnson has insisted it is more generous than the current system, and still managed to pass the plan thanks to his large majority. If you'd like to read more about the controversy in the commons over the social care plans, clickhere. Conservative MP - and former health secretary - Jeremy Hunt praises the social care cap, which he says will make a big difference to many people. However, he says the government's plan ""doesn't really give confidence in two crucial areas"". Firstly, he says local authorities ""barely"" have enough money to provide social care. Secondly, he says it is ""hard to seen an end to the workforce crisis"" in the social care sector. Minister Gillian Keegan acknowledges the government's plan is ""only a start"", but says the government will offer more information about money for local councils in the local government finance settlement. On staffing problems, she says: ""We do need to invest in training and learning and provide career routes."" ""Is that it?"" asks Labour's Liz Kendall as she responds to the government statement. She says the plan ""utterly fails to deal with the immediate pressures facing social care"". ""Where was the plan to end waiting lists for care... where was the long-term strategy to transform the pay and conditions of care workers,"" she asks. ""No wonder staff are leaving the sector in droves."" She says the government's white paper ""falls woefully short of the mark"". In the Commons, the minister, Gillian Keegan, says the government's plans to introduce a Health and Social Care Levy were a ""vital first step"" in fixing the social care system. She then sets out a further plan of action for the government, including Â£300m in housing investment to help people with minor repairs and changes to help independent living, increasing the upper limit. She also sets out Â£150m for adoption of digital technology in the social care system. Keegan adds that at least Â£500m will be spent on the social care workforce over the next few years, focusing on training for staff and mental health and wellbeing support. Amid deep concerns over a growing funding shortfall for social care in England, the government announced a new tax in September, which it said would raise Â£12bn a year. The Health and Social Care Levy will begin in April 2022 as a 1.25% rise in National Insurance. From 2023, it will then become a separate tax on earned income. As the name suggests, it won't just apply to social care, but will also go towards fixing the funding gap in the NHS, caused by dealing with the treatment backlogs created by Covid. In fact, most of the money will go on this in the early stages, with more switching to social care over time. The tax will apply UK-wide, and an extra 1.25% will also be charged on share dividends. The administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who oversee their own health and care policy, will receive an extra Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. Here are more details Â© 2025 BBC.

"The University of Leeds is one of 58 institutions affected by the strikes Students backing a three-day strike by university staff have said their lecturers deserve better pay, working conditions and pensions. The union organising walkouts at 58 universities has warned of further strikes next year. Employers have called the strikes ""frustrating"" and said most staff do not support them. But some students are concerned about further disruption to their education after 18 months of Covid restrictions. Rebecca Gaida said only one of her lecturers was still at work Outside University College London, first-year student Rebecca Gaida said she supported the strikes - but was concerned there would be more to come. ""How much is three days going to disrupt my education? If they're at this point where things are so bad they feel they need to do this, then fair enough,"" she said. ""The more I hear about it, the more I hear that it's potentially a long-term thing. ""It worries me a little bit, but... they need pensions, they need stable income."" Some of the walkouts are over pensions - a dispute that, having rumbled on for nearly a decade, has been reignited by what the University and College Union (UCU) called a ""flawed valuation"" of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS), a pension fund used by university staff. It was ""carried out at the start of the pandemic when global markets were crashing"", and would lower members' guaranteed retirement income by 35%, the UCU said - although Universities UK (UUK) said that figure was not representative. Others are striking over pay and working conditions. University strikes: Will classes be cancelled? The UCU has demanded a Â£2,500 pay increase for members, an end to ""pay injustice"" and zero-hours contracts, and action to tackle ""unmanageable workloads"" - some of which relate to the pandemic. Staff at 33 institutions are taking action over pay, working conditions and pensions. Arj Bhalla said it was ""understandable"" that staff were striking University College London student Arj Bhalla said he understood ""students' frustrations with Covid and everything that's happened - all our of studies have been disrupted"". ""At the same time, it's about the livelihoods of people... I stand in solidarity with it."" However, about 200 miles away in Leeds, 19-year-old history student Tom Horn told BBC News that many students were ""very angry"". ""They just don't think it's fair that after having a year of strikes followed by a year-and-a-half of online learning... things are just about starting to get back into the swing and then we're facing the possibility of months of strikes again,"" he said. Vicky Blake was preparing for the strikes on Tuesday Joining those on strike outside the university, UCU president Vicky Blake told the BBC that staff were ""exhausted"". ""We want to be teaching, we want to be supporting students. But we're here because we need to make progress on all of these issues, so that our working conditions are healthy learning conditions for students,"" she said. Declan Kenny, a PhD student who also teaches there, said low research funding and being paid hourly meant he was always ""treading water"" financially. ""I know most people are completely distracted from their research and find they don't have time to do their PhD, because they're always trying to find the work and income to actually pay their rent,"" he said. Students pay Â£9,250 a year in fees and have faced two years of disruption because of previous strikes and Covid. Larissa Kennedy joined staff and students outside King's College London But according to Larissa Kennedy, president of the National Union of Students, 73% of students back the strikes. Speaking to BBC News outside King's College London, she said: ""We know that we don't win a better education system - we don't win a fairer education system - divided. We have to collectively fight for fully funded education."" She said students were ""frustrated"" with management, adding: ""If senior managers came back to the negotiating table fairly, if they complied with the demands of the UCU, we wouldn't be facing this disruption."" Oxford Brookes University vice-chancellor Prof Alistair Fitt said he was ""really disappointed"" about the strikes. ""I think our poor students have had enough over the past 18 months,"" he said. Prof Fitt said the USS pension scheme was ""very generous"", although ""too expensive"" for many academics. ""One of the things we're committed to doing is to try and make USS a little bit more flexible, and to try to give particularly young academics and young university staff a range of options,"" he said. Prof Fitt spoke to BBC News via a video call It is the job of pension schemes to crystal-gaze into the future. They have to predict what inflation, interest rates and investment returns will be decades in advance, and decide if they can deliver on the financial promises they have made to their members. But the body in charge of this pension, the USS, has been much more cautious about its predictions than other pension schemes. Predicting a very big difference between the money staff and institutions have paid in and what members are expecting to be paid, it has opted to change the scheme and make members pay more. Unions say this extra burden on members is unnecessary - the USS is being too pessimistic. But the USS says it is better to be overly cautious now, than for members to have a nasty shock in years ahead if their pensions cannot be paid out. Pension rows with private companies normally focus on the company making big profits while not contributing enough to the pension scheme - but university finances are different, making this row unique. Both sides claim to have the interests of university staff at heart, which has resulted in this long-running row now reaching the picket lines. Striking staff are not required to warn universities in advance, but some students were advised this week to ask their lecturers whether they would be walking out. The UCU said ""thousands"" of staff and students participated on Wednesday - and warned of ""escalating industrial action"" next year if demands were not met. However, Raj Jethwa, chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association, which has 174 member organisations, said early reports indicated ""low levels of disruption to teaching"". But he said it would ""take time"" to establish the full picture. Mr Jethwa called the strikes over pay an ""unrealistic attempt to try to force"" 146 employers to reopen a concluded national pay round. A spokesman for Universities UK, which represents 140 institutions, said fewer than 10% of pension-scheme members had voted for strike action inUCU ballots last month.Not all staff are UCU members, and not all members supported the strikes. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan called the strikes ""very disappointing"" and further disruption to students' learning ""wholly unfair"". ""Students deserve good quality face-to-face teaching from their universities, and we need a resolution that delivers this for them as soon as possible,"" she said. ""It's what the vast majority of teaching staff want - and what students rightly expect."" Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said universities could consider ""whether partial refunds of tuition fees are appropriate"" to make up for disruption. Rescheduling teaching or finding alternative teaching methods were other options, she said. Staff at 74 universities held a 14-day strike over pensions, pay, and conditions last year. The UCU has said members would ""be forced to take further industrial action in the new year"" if vice-chancellors ""continue to ignore the modest demands of staff"". A full list of affected universitiescan be found here. In addition to the 58 where staff are striking, a further six institutions will not have strikes but staff voted for action short of a strike, over pay, which, the UCU said, would ""include strictly working to contract and refusing any additional duties"".

Conservative MP - and former health secretary - Jeremy Hunt praises the social care cap, which he says will make a big difference to many people. However, he says the government's plan ""doesn't really give confidence in two crucial areas"". Firstly, he says local authorities ""barely"" have enough money to provide social care. Secondly, he says it is ""hard to seen an end to the workforce crisis"" in the social care sector. Minister Gillian Keegan acknowledges the government's plan is ""only a start"", but says the government will offer more information about money for local councils in the local government finance settlement. On staffing problems, she says: ""We do need to invest in training and learning and provide career routes."" ""Is that it?"" asks Labour's Liz Kendall as she responds to the government statement. She says the plan ""utterly fails to deal with the immediate pressures facing social care"". ""Where was the plan to end waiting lists for care... where was the long-term strategy to transform the pay and conditions of care workers,"" she asks. ""No wonder staff are leaving the sector in droves."" She says the government's white paper ""falls woefully short of the mark"". In the Commons, the minister, Gillian Keegan, says the government's plans to introduce a Health and Social Care Levy were a ""vital first step"" in fixing the social care system. She then sets out a further plan of action for the government, including Â£300m in housing investment to help people with minor repairs and changes to help independent living, increasing the upper limit. She also sets out Â£150m for adoption of digital technology in the social care system. Keegan adds that at least Â£500m will be spent on the social care workforce over the next few years, focusing on training for staff and mental health and wellbeing support. Amid deep concerns over a growing funding shortfall for social care in England, the government announced a new tax in September, which it said would raise Â£12bn a year. The Health and Social Care Levy will begin in April 2022 as a 1.25% rise in National Insurance. From 2023, it will then become a separate tax on earned income. As the name suggests, it won't just apply to social care, but will also go towards fixing the funding gap in the NHS, caused by dealing with the treatment backlogs created by Covid. In fact, most of the money will go on this in the early stages, with more switching to social care over time. The tax will apply UK-wide, and an extra 1.25% will also be charged on share dividends. The administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who oversee their own health and care policy, will receive an extra Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. Here are more details Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mohamed Isa Omar was one of just two people to survive last week's tragedy It has been almost a week since Mohamed Isa Omar was pulled from the cold waters of the Channel, one of only two people to survive the deadliest crossing on record. But as he sits in a wheelchair in a French car park, the 28-year-old is clearly still traumatised. He speaks softly, telling the BBC he is haunted by what he saw that night. ""I saw people dying in front of me,"" Mohamed says. ""Those of us who could not swim, drowned and died within minutes. ""It was so cold the water, so cold."" Mohamed was among at least 29 people who set off from the coast of France at about 22:00 local time (21:00 GMT) a week ago. The other occupants were strangers to him - simply more people willing to risk the dangerous crossing over the Channel to reach the UK, a journey made by more than 25,000 migrants this year. They had been travelling for about three-and-a-half hours when the boat started to sink, Mohamed said. At this point, the occupants who still had phones began to make desperate calls for help. A fellow survivor told Kurdish media they had called both French and English sides of the Channel. Calais activists: Migrants call us from boats asking for help Why do migrants leave France for the UK? ""Our mobiles were already in the water,"" Mohamed recalls. ""But one of us had his mobile still working, he called, and the [British] authorities told him to send the location. ""But before he does that, the mobile went into the water too and we could not send anything."" Mohamed heard a second man make a call via speakerphone, saying the person at the other end spoke English. ""But he also didn't have any chance,"" Mohamed told BBC Persian. ""The water got his mobile too before he sends anything. ""That's why people started to drown and die. I saw people dying in front of me, but I started to swim. I saw a big ship far away and started to swim towards it."" It would be hours, though, until Mohamed was rescued. According to the only other survivor, an Iraqi Kurd named as Mohammed Shekha Ahmed, a number of people tried to cling onto the deflated boat until the sun rose. ""Then when the light shone, no one could take it any more,"" he told Iraq's Rudaw network. Their bodies were spotted by a French fisherman at almost 13:00 on Wednesday. A rescue operation was launched, but the two men were the only ones left alive. ""That's why they found their way to us, took us to the hospital, and we were saved, thanks be to Allah,"" Mohamed said. His legs are bandaged, recovering from injuries sustained during hours at sea. All of the names of those who died are not yet known. Only one person has been officially named:a young woman hoping to reach her fiancÃ©. Among the missing are amother and her three children-  including a little girl who was just seven years old. Both the men who made the calls died, Mohamed said. It is unclear who they reached when calling for help, or where they actually were. This video can not be played Channel disaster: A father's anguish, a missing family The remains of the boat and its occupants were in French territorial waters when the Coastguard was asked for assistance. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The French led a search and rescue operation for an incident that occurred in French territorial waters on Wednesday 24 November, where 27 people tragically died. ""As part of this operation, the French requested support from the UK, which was provided by HMG Coastguard as soon as it was requested."" A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesperson said that on that date, they received ""more than 90 alerts, including 999 emergency calls, from the English Channel, and we responded to all of them"". ""HM Coastguard does not routinely enter French waters unless asked to assist with a response by our search and rescue partners in France, as we were last week,"" the spokesperson told the BBC. ""On that occasion, we sent HM Coastguard's helicopter from Lydd to support the search and rescue effort and the RNLI lifeboat from Ramsgate also participated in the search.""

Thanks for following the big events of the day with us, and don't forget, you can get all the news and updates on ourwebsiteandTwitter,external. See you next week! It has been a busy few hours in the House of Commons, so here is a run down of what's happened: Alison HoltSocial affairs editor There was a lot of hope riding on todayâs announcement of
government plans for adult social care. In a care system that has been in
crisis for a long time, people wanted a clear vision for the future. The care
minister said she was setting out an ""ambitious"" 10-year plan on an issue that
other governments had ducked for too long. The aim to provide outstanding
personalised care which is fair and accessible will be welcomed, but for many
in the care sector, the actual details of what is proposed are disappointing. They argue they do nothing to fix the acute problems they face now. They had
hoped much more would be done to attract care workers, as care providers are
struggling to recruit enough staff. Council officials had asked for extra
funding over winter because an estimated 400,000 people in England are
either waiting for services or waiting to be assessed. The white paper provides
a future vision, but it doesnât deal with the immediate bumps in the road
ahead. Conservative Robert Buckland makes the last contribution to the statement, saying the proposed Â£300m to help local authorities for supported housing is an ""excellent initiative"". The MP and former justice secretary asks how the government is going to make sure the money is used to ""enrich the lives"" of adults living with disabilities, adding currently they ""just don't have the choice that they deserve"". Gillian Keegan praises him for all his ""excellent work"" on the issue of support for disabled people, adding the money is specifically to provide better support them She adds they have also included detail in the proposal to help young adults with disabilities get into work, arguing ""not enough of them are getting that support today"". Conservative Paul Bristow tells MPs he spoke to a social care user who told him that living in supported housing ""made him feel like a king"" because he had access to his own private shower. ""The small differences between hospital care and being supported to live independently are striking,"" Bristow says. He asks the minister to confirm that one of the aims of the government's strategy is to ensure that ""people can live as independently as possible for as long as possible"". The minister agrees and says the government wants to ensure people get the right care. The government's white paper on social care ""sets out some important, long overdue policy advances"", says Caroline Abrahams, director of the charity Age UK. But, she argues, ""lack of investment means any changes will be modest and slow to arrive, whereas the scale of the challenge is huge and demands urgent action now"". Abrahams demands a rise in care sector pay to tackle ""chronic workforce shortages"", saying pressures on staff are likely to increase if Covid surges this winter. ""There are similar concerns about unpaid carers collapsing after an unbelievably challenging 20 months too,"" she adds. Earlier, Gillian Keegan told MPs the government would be producing a separate white paper on plans to integrate the NHS and social care. Conservative Andrew Murrison says there is ""a certain irony"" in having two white papers to deal with something around integration. He asks the minister how she will solve the ""crying shame of elderly and vulnerable people languishing in acute hospital beds"" instead of receiving care at home or in a care home. Gillian Keegan says this is a problem which is putting pressure on the system and that integration will help. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Health and Social Care Levy will begin in April 2022 as a 1.25% rise in National Insurance. From 2023, it will then become a separate tax on earned income. As the name suggests, it won't just apply to social care, but will also go towards fixing the funding gap in the NHS, caused by dealing with the treatment backlogs created by Covid. In fact, most of the money will go on this in the early stages, with more switching to social care over time. The tax will apply UK-wide, and an extra 1.25% will also be charged on share dividends. The administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, who oversee their own health and care policy, will receive an extra Â£2.2bn to spend on their services. Here are more details Â© 2025 BBC.

"Mohamed Isa Omar was one of just two people to survive last week's tragedy It has been almost a week since Mohamed Isa Omar was pulled from the cold waters of the Channel, one of only two people to survive the deadliest crossing on record. But as he sits in a wheelchair in a French car park, the 28-year-old is clearly still traumatised. He speaks softly, telling the BBC he is haunted by what he saw that night. ""I saw people dying in front of me,"" Mohamed says. ""Those of us who could not swim, drowned and died within minutes. ""It was so cold the water, so cold."" Mohamed was among at least 29 people who set off from the coast of France at about 22:00 local time (21:00 GMT) a week ago. The other occupants were strangers to him - simply more people willing to risk the dangerous crossing over the Channel to reach the UK, a journey made by more than 25,000 migrants this year. They had been travelling for about three-and-a-half hours when the boat started to sink, Mohamed said. At this point, the occupants who still had phones began to make desperate calls for help. A fellow survivor told Kurdish media they had called both French and English sides of the Channel. Calais activists: Migrants call us from boats asking for help Why do migrants leave France for the UK? ""Our mobiles were already in the water,"" Mohamed recalls. ""But one of us had his mobile still working, he called, and the [British] authorities told him to send the location. ""But before he does that, the mobile went into the water too and we could not send anything."" Mohamed heard a second man make a call via speakerphone, saying the person at the other end spoke English. ""But he also didn't have any chance,"" Mohamed told BBC Persian. ""The water got his mobile too before he sends anything. ""That's why people started to drown and die. I saw people dying in front of me, but I started to swim. I saw a big ship far away and started to swim towards it."" It would be hours, though, until Mohamed was rescued. According to the only other survivor, an Iraqi Kurd named as Mohammed Shekha Ahmed, a number of people tried to cling onto the deflated boat until the sun rose. ""Then when the light shone, no one could take it any more,"" he told Iraq's Rudaw network. Their bodies were spotted by a French fisherman at almost 13:00 on Wednesday. A rescue operation was launched, but the two men were the only ones left alive. ""That's why they found their way to us, took us to the hospital, and we were saved, thanks be to Allah,"" Mohamed said. His legs are bandaged, recovering from injuries sustained during hours at sea. All of the names of those who died are not yet known. Only one person has been officially named:a young woman hoping to reach her fiancÃ©. Among the missing are amother and her three children-  including a little girl who was just seven years old. Both the men who made the calls died, Mohamed said. It is unclear who they reached when calling for help, or where they actually were. This video can not be played Channel disaster: A father's anguish, a missing family The remains of the boat and its occupants were in French territorial waters when the Coastguard was asked for assistance. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""The French led a search and rescue operation for an incident that occurred in French territorial waters on Wednesday 24 November, where 27 people tragically died. ""As part of this operation, the French requested support from the UK, which was provided by HMG Coastguard as soon as it was requested."" A Maritime and Coastguard Agency spokesperson said that on that date, they received ""more than 90 alerts, including 999 emergency calls, from the English Channel, and we responded to all of them"". ""HM Coastguard does not routinely enter French waters unless asked to assist with a response by our search and rescue partners in France, as we were last week,"" the spokesperson told the BBC. ""On that occasion, we sent HM Coastguard's helicopter from Lydd to support the search and rescue effort and the RNLI lifeboat from Ramsgate also participated in the search.""

"Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg is being investigated over a possible breach of rules on declaring outside earnings. Commons standards commissioner Kathryn Stone did not reveal details of the allegations. But they are understood to relate to Â£6m in loans Mr Rees-Mogg received from one of his own companies to help buy and renovate his Westminster home. The watchdog is also investigating Scottish Tory leader Douglas Ross for possible standards breaches. Scottish Tory leader in second job 'sleaze' row Mr Rees-Mogg borrowed up to Â£2.94m a year in director's loans from Saliston Ltd, a UK-based property company owned by him, between 2018 and 2020. Labour's shadow Commons leader Thangam Debbonaire said: ""It is right that the standards commissioner is investigating what appears to be yet another egregious breach of the rules, with Jacob Rees-Mogg failing to declare millions of pounds of director's loans. ""The prime minister also needs to investigate whether the ministerial code has been breached."" Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner separately wrote to the independent adviser on ministers' interests, Lord Geidt, over the loans. In her letter, Mrs Rayner said that failing to declare directors' loans worth Â£2.94m a year ""allowed Mr Rees-Mogg to borrow a large sum of money at a very low interest rate"" and argued that it ""should have been declared"". Douglas Ross admits not fully declaring his income as a football referee Mr Rees-Mogg said said the loans had been properly declared, after the story wasfirst reported in the Mail on Sunday,external. In a statement, he told BBC News: ""Saliston is 100% owned by me and this is declared clearly in the Commons register and to the Cabinet Office. It has no activities that interact with government policy."" He said the loans were primarily taken out for the purchase and refurbishment of his Westminster home ""as temporary cash flow measures"". ""All loans have either been repaid with interest in accordance with HMRC rules or paid as dividends and taxed accordingly,"" he added. ""The register asks for earnings, not loans, which is why I was declared an as a non-remunerated director until I resigned on entering government. Loans are not earnings and are not declarable in the register of interests."" Mr Rees-Mogg resigned as a director of Saliston in 2019, but his wife Helena remains on the board. A spokesman for the North East Somerset MP said he would comply with commissioner's investigation fully and answer all questions. Conservative MP Douglas Ross is also among the MPs being investigated for possible breaches of the MPs' code of conduct. He referred himself to the watchdog last month for failing to declare about Â£17,000 of earnings while serving as an MP. Mr Ross, who is leader of the Scottish Tories, apologised for failing to fully record his MSP salary and earnings as a football referee in his register of interests at Westminster. At the time, he said it was a ""bad errorâ¦of my own making"".

Your writers today were Kate Whannel, Adam Durbin and Justin Parkinson, while your editor was Jennifer Scott. Thanks for following the big events of the day with us, and don't forget, you can get all the news and updates on ourwebsiteandTwitter,external. See you next week! It has been a busy few hours in the House of Commons, so here is a run down of what's happened: Alison HoltSocial affairs editor There was a lot of hope riding on todayâs announcement of
government plans for adult social care. In a care system that has been in
crisis for a long time, people wanted a clear vision for the future. The care
minister said she was setting out an ""ambitious"" 10-year plan on an issue that
other governments had ducked for too long. The aim to provide outstanding
personalised care which is fair and accessible will be welcomed, but for many
in the care sector, the actual details of what is proposed are disappointing. They argue they do nothing to fix the acute problems they face now. They had
hoped much more would be done to attract care workers, as care providers are
struggling to recruit enough staff. Council officials had asked for extra
funding over winter because an estimated 400,000 people in England are
either waiting for services or waiting to be assessed. The white paper provides
a future vision, but it doesnât deal with the immediate bumps in the road
ahead. Conservative Robert Buckland makes the last contribution to the statement, saying the proposed Â£300m to help local authorities for supported housing is an ""excellent initiative"". The MP and former justice secretary asks how the government is going to make sure the money is used to ""enrich the lives"" of adults living with disabilities, adding currently they ""just don't have the choice that they deserve"". Gillian Keegan praises him for all his ""excellent work"" on the issue of support for disabled people, adding the money is specifically to provide better support them She adds they have also included detail in the proposal to help young adults with disabilities get into work, arguing ""not enough of them are getting that support today"". Conservative Paul Bristow tells MPs he spoke to a social care user who told him that living in supported housing ""made him feel like a king"" because he had access to his own private shower. ""The small differences between hospital care and being supported to live independently are striking,"" Bristow says. He asks the minister to confirm that one of the aims of the government's strategy is to ensure that ""people can live as independently as possible for as long as possible"". The minister agrees and says the government wants to ensure people get the right care. The government's white paper on social care ""sets out some important, long overdue policy advances"", says Caroline Abrahams, director of the charity Age UK. But, she argues, ""lack of investment means any changes will be modest and slow to arrive, whereas the scale of the challenge is huge and demands urgent action now"". Abrahams demands a rise in care sector pay to tackle ""chronic workforce shortages"", saying pressures on staff are likely to increase if Covid surges this winter. ""There are similar concerns about unpaid carers collapsing after an unbelievably challenging 20 months too,"" she adds. Earlier, Gillian Keegan told MPs the government would be producing a separate white paper on plans to integrate the NHS and social care. Conservative Andrew Murrison says there is ""a certain irony"" in having two white papers to deal with something around integration. He asks the minister how she will solve the ""crying shame of elderly and vulnerable people languishing in acute hospital beds"" instead of receiving care at home or in a care home. Gillian Keegan says this is a problem which is putting pressure on the system and that integration will help. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The GMB union is unimpressed by the government's announcement today on social care spending. National officer Rachel Harrison says: âThis is like groundhog day. Care workers have been waiting for the governmentâs plan for years - since before the last election. âNow theyâre being told they have to wait even longer for any substantial reforms."" She adds that the ""catastrophic understaffing crisis"" will ""only get worse"" unless a Â£15-an-hour minimum wage is introduced for care workers.  Labour's John McDonnell (also his party's former shadow chancellor) says most unpaid carers ""are just trying to see how they can get through the next week"" - not the next 10 years. He asks what there is in the government's strategy that will ""assist unpaid carers and lift them out of poverty"". Gillian Keegan says unpaid carers are ""an essential part"" of the system, adding that the government is urging local authorities to ensure respite services are ""fully open"". She adds that the carers' allowance will go up in April 2022. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tory MP Andrew Mitchell praises the plans, arguing they represent ""good and steady progress"" on reforming the social care system. He adds that his constituency of Sutton Coldfield, given its elderly demographics, is particularly invested in the changes. Mitchell says the UK government has come up with ""coherent policies"" that allow older people to live at home for as long as possible"". Gillian Keegan adds that expensive areas with older populations must enabled to live at home, using technology, adaptive housing and working with local groups and health services to achieve this. Lib Dem Daisy Cooper says the minister's statement is ""incredibly thin"" and compares it to ""fiddling with the light bulbs on the Titanic"". She says hospitals are struggling to discharge patients because the care isn't available. And she accuses the minister of failing to ""address the problem"" of integration between the NHS and social care. Gillian Keegan says the integration of health and social care is key to the government's reforms and promises MPs that a separate white paper on the issue will be coming early next year. While the government outlined its reforms in September, today it published its white paper on social care. The white paper sets out more details of how Â£1bn of spending will be allocated over the next three years. It says: Conservative MP Damian Green calls for more detail on how housing and technology can be adapted to help elderly people live at home for longer. Those who are ""frail"" can have a ""better quality of life"" if there is detailed reform in this area, he adds. Gillian Keegan says there will be more help for supported housing and, with councils, ministers will be work on how the money can be raised for this. If you cast your minds back to last week, the government narrowly succeeded in getting MPs to back its social care cap for England, despite a significant Tory rebellion. The Commons endorsed plans announced to exclude means-tested council support payments from a new Â£86,000 lifetime limit on costs, However, 19 Conservative MPs voted against the proposal and it is believed 28 more refused to vote for it and abstained instead. Labour and other opposition parties rejected the plan, arguing that poorer people would lose out from the change. But Boris Johnson has insisted it is more generous than the current system, and still managed to pass the plan thanks to his large majority. If you'd like to read more about the controversy in the commons over the social care plans, clickhere. Conservative MP - and former health secretary - Jeremy Hunt praises the social care cap, which he says will make a big difference to many people. However, he says the government's plan ""doesn't really give confidence in two crucial areas"". Firstly, he says local authorities ""barely"" have enough money to provide social care. Secondly, he says it is ""hard to seen an end to the workforce crisis"" in the social care sector. Minister Gillian Keegan acknowledges the government's plan is ""only a start"", but says the government will offer more information about money for local councils in the local government finance settlement. On staffing problems, she says: ""We do need to invest in training and learning and provide career routes."" ""Is that it?"" asks Labour's Liz Kendall as she responds to the government statement. She says the plan ""utterly fails to deal with the immediate pressures facing social care"". ""Where was the plan to end waiting lists for care... where was the long-term strategy to transform the pay and conditions of care workers,"" she asks. ""No wonder staff are leaving the sector in droves."" She says the government's white paper ""falls woefully short of the mark"". In the Commons, the minister, Gillian Keegan, says the government's plans to introduce a Health and Social Care Levy were a ""vital first step"" in fixing the social care system. She then sets out a further plan of action for the government, including Â£300m in housing investment to help people with minor repairs and changes to help independent living, increasing the upper limit. She also sets out Â£150m for adoption of digital technology in the social care system. Keegan adds that at least Â£500m will be spent on the social care workforce over the next few years, focusing on training for staff and mental health and wellbeing support. Amid deep concerns over a growing funding shortfall for social care in England, the government announced a new tax in September, which it said would raise Â£12bn a year. The Health and Social Care Levy will begin in April 2022 as a 1.25% rise in National Insurance. From 2023, it will then become a separate tax on earned income. As the name suggests, it won't just apply to social care, but will also go towards fixing the funding gap in the NHS, caused by dealing with the treatment backlogs created by Covid.

"The figures are based on a family of two adults and two children A typical UK family will spend Â£1,700 more per year on household costs in 2022, according to a forecast for BBC Panorama. The analysis, conducted by the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), projected the inflation rate would rise to 4.6% by Christmas. This rise is mainly due to higher fuel and energy prices. Analysts say the full extent of rising costs is not yet being passed on to customers by supermarkets. They say supermarkets are trying to keep prices constant over the festive period, even if this means absorbing some of the costs, because they don't want to risk losing customers at their busiest time of the year. Compared with December 2020, the typical UK family of two adults and two children is predicted to spend Â£33.60 more per week, due to inflation, adding up to Â£1,700 per year. Why is the cost of living going up? The forecast is based on the prices of commonly bought items, including food and drink, clothing and household goods. It also includes spending on utility bills, such as fuel and power; transport costs; and money spent on recreation and days out. It assumes that spending patterns will remain the same as in previous years and that inflation will remain at the projected 4.6% (up from the current 4.2%). However, experts expect it could rise higher in spring 2022, putting further pressure on household spending. Panorama and CEBR, an independent economic consultancy, also compiled data for common food products to look at the price difference between this year and last. It showed the average cost of margarine leaping by more than 15%. Costs for dairy farms have been rising particularly strongly in recent months, according to the CEBR. However, many common Christmas items have so far stayed at a similar price. There are a number of reasons: â¢ Demand for oil and gas is pushing up energy prices worldwide â¢ Shortages of many goods are causing supply problems and pushing up prices â¢ Government support to businesses during the pandemic has largely ended â¢ Businesses are struggling to recruit workers. This is partly due to the pandemic, but is also compounded by Brexit,according to international policy forum the OECD ""I've never known things to be as challenging as they are currently,"" said Andrew Selley, chief executive of Bidfoods, one of the UK's biggest food distributors. ""Whether you're looking at people resources, product availability, everything seems to be coming together at the moment and presents us with a very challenging set of circumstances."" The knock-on effect of the price rises is already being felt by shoppers. Nikki Rushin, a nurse from Nottinghamshire, told BBC Panorama that inflation was making her feel anxious. ""We're certainly having to be a lot more careful,"" she said. ""We try and budget very carefully around food, whereas going back a couple of years, we could buy whatever we wanted to."" She also said she and her husband, who works at a builders' merchants, had not been able to save for Christmas for their two daughters. ""Christmas presents, Christmas dinner, everything for Christmas has to come out of the next wage packet,"" said Mrs Rushin. This video can not be played Jane Corbin hears from HGV drivers about why there's a shortage of them in the UK Like many UK shoppers, the Rushins have also noted more empty shelves in supermarkets, especially vegetables. Richard Mowbray, the commercial director of TH Clements, one of the biggest vegetable growers, said his business had been hit by a shortage of seasonal workers from Europe. To try to encourage more British workers to apply, TH Clements has increased wages and it expects these costs will eventually trickle down to consumers. However, Mr Mowbray insisted it was not just labour that was pushing up costs. ""It's fertiliser, energy, oil packaging. Everything that we look at at the moment has got inflation,"" he said. The government has offered 30,000 visas for seasonal workers, but growers say that is not enough. The government has also offered temporary visas to European lorry drivers. A global HGV driver shortage is also forcing wages up, with some UK supermarkets now offering more than Â£50,000 a year. ""That's higher wages for those people driving those trucks. That's obviously good news for them,"" said economist Torsten Bell from the independent Resolution Foundation think-tank. ""But it will, in time, feed through to higher prices for everybody else."" In October, the government said 300 EU drivers had applied for the 5,000 temporary visas. The government has declined to provide updated figures, as requested by Panorama. The pandemic caused long delays in processing licences at the DVLA. Panorama reporter Jane Corbin applied for a provisional HGV licence seven weeks ago. She still has not received it. The government says provisional licences are now being issued within five working days.

"These gene-edited piglets have been made resistant to a lethal lung disease Regulations to allow the production of gene-edited farm animals must put welfare first, according to an independent review. The technology allows scientists to alter DNA so as to introduce specific traits, such as resistance to disease. The UK government ismulling proposals to allow the commercial development of gene-edited livestockin England. An independent analysis has called for a review of the government's proposals for regulating the technology. A report by the Nuffield Council for Bioethics warns that scrapping the current ban on the commercial development of gene-edited animals could increase livestock suffering. The council's assistant director, Peter Mills, who was the driving force behind the report, says the government's plan to scrap the current restrictions ""effectively takes the brakes off the capacity for breeders to advance their breeding programmes"". He said: ""Farming is a business, and it is a requirement of breeders of farm animals to tread a line between what they can get out of it and (animal welfare). What we are calling for is for that line to be drawn more clearly."" A heat-resistant US dairy calf Gene-editing involves inserting new DNA sequences, deleting existing ones or modifying them in the genome of a living organism. It's a more precise and targeted technology than previous forms of genetic engineering and the changes are virtually indistinguishable from natural mutations. Those earlier forms of genetic engineering sometimes involved the insertion of a gene from a different organism at random into another living thing. The UK is among the world leaders in the technology. Researchers at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh have developedpigs that are immune to one of the world's costliest animal diseases, a respiratory condition known as PRRS. They are also attempting to produceAfrican varieties of cattle that produce more milk, while a US firm has created cows that thrive in hotter conditions. The Nuffield report acknowledges that the technology has the capacity to bring ""real benefits"". But Elizabeth Cripps from Edinburgh University, a member of the working group that produced the report, said that that it could also make things worse. ""Genome editing could be used to perpetuate or possibly increase the dense stocking of animals in industrialised (production),"" she said. ""We would be concerned about breeding of animals that could tolerate poor conditions better without apparently having adverse health impacts."" An experiment carried out in 1989 by researchers working for the US Department of Agriculture in Beltsville, Maryland, is held up by critics as an example of how genetic science could be misused. The American scientists added a gene into the DNA of a pig that would produce a human growth hormone. The expectation was that the animal would grow faster and be leaner than normal pigs. Old-style genetic engineering gone wrong. A gene was inserted into this pig to make it grow more than it normally would. It worked but at the cost of the animal developing serious health problems The researchers were successful: weight gain increased by 15%, feed efficiency by 18%, and carcass fat was reduced by 80%. But the animals suffered from several unanticipated health issues, including kidney and liver problems, uncoordinated walking, bulging eyes, gastric ulcers, heart disease and pneumonia. Supporters of gene editing say that current technology is much more targeted, and so less likely to have such disastrous consequences EU regulations currently forbid the commercial development of gene-edited animals. But Brexit gave the UK government an opportunity to change its rules. In September, it announced a relaxation of rules governing research on gene-edited crops and an intention to bring in new regulations next year to allow food made from gene-edited plants and possibly animals to be sold in England. The Chair of the Nuffield working group, Prof John Dupre, from Exeter University, is concerned that the approach to setting new rules by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), is ""too narrow"". ""Those involved in policing must look beyond solely questions of food safety and keep in mind an overall vision of a food and farming system that supports sustainable farming and improves standards of animal welfare."" Among the Nuffield Council's recommendations are a government review of its proposals and a public consultation process that feeds into the review. Other recommendations include the setting and enforcement of breeding standards which have been informed by the latest science, an independent body to monitor the long-term impact of genetic changes on animals and a food labelling system that contains information of breeding. When announcing its proposal to ease restrictions on GM technologies, the Environment Secretary said he recognised that there is a strong public interest and Defra would continue to engage with experts, businesses and campaign groups as well as the public throughout the process. A spokesman said the department was taking a ""step by step approach"" to enable gene editing to be used commercially. ""We are starting with plants only and then reviewing the application to animals and microorganisms later. ""We are committed to proportionate, science-based regulation and we will not reduce safety or animal welfare standards."" Prof Bruce Whitelaw, who is the interim director of the Roslin Institute, is an advocate of the safe and responsible development of gene-edited animals. As a member of the working group, he signed off on the report's concerns and recommendations. And he told BBC News that proper regulation would ensure that the technology would benefit animal welfare - as well as help to feed a hungry world. ""Genome editing is a genetic technology that has much to offer agriculture. At Roslin, we have already shown that this technology can reduce the burden of disease in livestock by producing pigs resistant to the PRRS virus.

"There is no need to call off Christmas parties despite the emergence of the Omicron variant, the health secretary has said, as he urged people to get a booster jab to fight Covid. Sajid Javid said people should consider measures such as taking Covid tests or wearing face masks when socialising. But NHS Providers said some NHS trusts had asked staff ""not to mix in big groups"" in the run-up to Christmas. It comes amid an expansion of the booster vaccination rollout. Is an office Christmas party too risky? When can I get my booster jab? What Covid rules are being toughened? Can the NHS boost the booster programme? Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, told Sky News some trusts were setting an example by making that request to staff because of the ""potential threat to their health and what they will be available to do"". The booster jab programme was expanded amid concern that the Omicron variant of coronavirus may spread more quickly and make vaccines less effective. In light of the variant, the government has accelerated new contracts with Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna to buy 114m additional Covid vaccine doses for 2022 and 2023. The deals - which are made up of 60m Moderna and 54m more Pfizer doses - include access to modified vaccines if they are needed to protect against Omicron and future variants of concern. The government said it already has enough Moderna and Pfizer doses for the expanded booster programme, with Mr Javid adding the agreements would ""future proof"" the vaccine rollout. The latest agreements come on top of the 35m extra Pfizer doses ordered in August for delivery in the second half of 2022, and 60m Novavax and 7.5m GSK/Sanofi doses which are also expected next year. The Novavax and GSK/Sanofi vaccines have yet to receive regulatory approval for use in the UK. Government scientists have said the impact of the variant on the UK is ""highly uncertain""but it may require a ""very stringent response""to avoid unsustainable pressure on the NHS. A total of 32 cases of Omicron have been confirmed in the UK so far - 22 in England and 10 in Scotland. On Wednesday, the UK recorded a further 48,374 coronavirus cases and another 171 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test. More than 18 million people in the UK have already had a booster jab, with a further 392,589 recorded on Tuesday. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged people to book in for their booster as soon as it is offered to them and suggested there was no reason that companies should be considering cancelling their annual staff Christmas parties. At Prime Minister's Questions - where he insisted thatall Covid rules were followed at Downing Street last Christmasafter media claims of parties during lockdown - he said the government had taken ""balanced and proportionate"" measures to protect people from the new variant. This video can not be played Watch: Health Secretary Sajid Javid says there's no need to change Christmas plans On Tuesday UK Health Security Agency head Dr Jenny Harries said people should not socialise ""when we don't particularly need to"". Mr Javid said the right thing to do was to follow the existing guidance, including the changes made in England in the last few days. Covid restrictions have been strengthenedin response to the Omicron variant. New measures include: Face masks are once again mandatory on public transport and in shops in England. Recent contacts of people identified as having contracted the Omicron variant are now required to self-isolate for 10 days even if they are fully vaccinated. All arrivals to the UK must now take a PCR test within two days - but Labour has called forthe reintroduction of pre-departure testing for travellers to the UK, after scientists advising the government said they would be ""valuable"" to limit further cases of the Omicron variant. Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch told Times Radio people should do a ""version of Covid certification"" without the law telling them to, by ensuring they are vaccinated but also taking a lateral flow test each time before they attend a social event. Some hospitality businesses havealready reported cancellationssince the confirmation of the first cases of the new variant being found in the UK. Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade body UK Hospitality, told BBC Breakfast the industry hoped the prime minister's words would give people the confidence to continue to make Christmas plans and would ""stem the flow of cancellations which we are starting to see"". This video can not be played Yvette Cooper says it is ""really irresponsible"" for the government not to make Covid testing before travelling a requirement NHS England is to issue detailed guidance to hospitals, pharmacists and GPs about the major expansion of the Covid booster vaccine programme. The government aims to offer all adults in England a top-up shot by 31 January. People become eligible to book a booster jab three months after their second. Hospital hubs will be asked to offer vaccines to the public as well as NHS staff and more pharmacies will be used in a bid to meet the January target. 'We could miss our son's wedding over travel rules' What does Omicron mean for Christmas parties? Mr Javid told BBC Breakfast the vaccination programme needed to deliver one million more jabs a week to reach that target and said more volunteers were needed to help with tasks at vaccination centres. He said there was ""nothing more important"" than the two-month booster push, but acknowledged it was a ""tough ask"". The health secretary said the NHS was working with GP representatives to suspend some of the workload of GPs so they can ""concentrate on vaccine delivery"". Northern Ireland has also announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Scotland and Wales have said their booster programmes will be ramped up, but are yet to lay out the full details. There's been much talk of the ability of Omicron to get around some of the defences built up by vaccination. So why bother with boosters? Why not tweak the vaccines like manufacturers say they can? When it comes to immunity vaccines do two things - protect us from infection and from serious illness. Some of the variants that have emerged, including Delta which is dominant in the UK, have reduced the ability of the vaccines to protect against infection. On paper it looks like Omicron may do the same, although it's still too early to tell. But the vaccines have held up very well in protecting against serious illness for all variants so far. The booster dose has been shown to significantly increase the immune response, so will be clearly beneficial even if the worst fears are realised about Omicron. What's more, new vaccines would take 100 days to produce and then you've got to get them into arms. Whereas the current vaccines are available right now. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said accelerating the booster rollout would have ""consequences"" for a health service that was already stretched. Meanwhile, the doctors' union, the BMA,warned GPs were already working extra hoursand would struggle to maintain their existing workload if they were required to help roll out boosters.

"Mr Visoski flew for Epstein for over 25 years Paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein's long-time pilot has testified at the trial of Ghislaine Maxwell that he flew VIPs to luxury locations worldwide. Larry Visoski, the first witness in Ms Maxwell's sex-trafficking trial, recalled flying Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Kevin Spacey. Ms Maxwell denies the charges and says she is being used as a scapegoat for Epstein, who died in prison in 2019. But prosecutors argue the pair were ""partners in crime"" in sex abuse. Testimony given in court on Tuesday included harrowing details of the alleged abuse. Ms Maxwell has been in a US jail since her arrest last year, and faces up to 80 years in prison if convicted. Prosecutors say the British socialite, who also has US and French citizenship, recruited and groomed underage girls for her long-term companion Epstein to abuse. Asked to describe Ms Maxwell's standing in Epstein's operations, Mr Visoski described her as ""the number two"". ""Epstein was the big number one,"" he told the New York court on Tuesday. Mr Visoski served as Epstein's pilot for over 25 years. During his testimony, prosecutors showed the jurors photographs of Epstein's properties. He testified that he had never seen any sexual activity during trips, although the cockpit door was always kept closed during flights on the plane nicknamed the ""Lolita Express"". He also recalled flying Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who says she was sexually assaulted by Prince Andrew. The Queen's 61-year-old second son has consistently denied the allegation. Asked if he remembered Ms Giuffre, Mr Visoski said: ""Yes. A shorter woman with dirty blonde hair. She didn't look young. I mean, whatever you decipher is the definition of young. But she was a woman in my category."" What are the accusations against Prince Andrew? Asked to describe Ms Maxwell's relationship to Epstein he said it was ""more personal than business"". ""I wouldn't characterise it as romantic,"" he added. Another woman testifying under the pseudonym ""Jane"" told the court that Ms Maxwell had frequently been in the room with her when she had sexual relations with Epstein while just 14 years old. Jane told the court she had met Epstein and Ms Maxwell while attending summer camp in Michigan 1994. He was introduced to her as a wealthy donor who offered scholarships to pupils. Epstein had promised to fund her education but instead abused her, prosecutors said. She testified that her father had died one year earlier from cancer and her family was struggling financially at the time. In graphic detail, she described her alleged abuse and said that Ms Maxwell, who she said was present for much of it, was ""very casual"" about the encounters. Jane said that Ms Maxwell would talk to her about sex, and that she soon began visiting Epstein's home every week or two. She said she was first sexually abused when they were having a discussion about her future. She said that Epstein led her from his office to his pool house, then pulled down his pants and started masturbating. ""I was frozen in fear, I had never seen a penis before,"" the witness said. ""I was terrified and felt gross and like I felt ashamed."" It was not long after that she was first sexually abused by Ms Maxwell, she testified, saying it took place at Epstein's home in Palm Beach, Florida. Jane said that the defendant and Epstein had her follow them to his bedroom. They took their clothes off and ""started sort of fondling each other and kind of casually giggling"", she said. ""I was just standing there and he asked me to take my top off and then their hands [were] everywhere and Jeffrey proceeded to masturbate and Ghislaine was rubbing him and kissing him and fondling,"" she continued. She added that she travelled with Epstein and Ms Maxwell about 10 times, mainly between his homes in New York and New Mexico while she was between the ages of 14 and 16. Who is Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's ex-girlfriend? Panorama: The Prince and the Epstein Scandal Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Jane also described ""orgies"" with other participants, and described feeling pain during the alleged encounters. Both Epstein and Ms Maxwell would brag about their connections, including the famous people that they knew, she said. Jane is the first of four accusers expected to testify at trial. Ms Maxwell has pleaded not guilty to eight charges of sex trafficking and other crimes. The allegations at trial cover the period 1994 to 2004. Prosecutors allege Ms Maxwell was a ""right-hand"" partner for Epstein, helping to groom vulnerable teenage girls as young as 14 for abuse at his luxurious residences. They described her as ""the lady of the house"" who ""helped normalise abusive sexual conduct"".

"China's Belt and Road strategy has extended into the Western Balkans, including here in Montenegro The EU has revealed details of a â¬300bn (Â£255bn; $340bn) global investment plan, described as a ""true alternative"" to China's Belt and Road strategy. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the Global Gateway scheme should become a trusted brand. China has funded rail, roads and ports but has been accused of leaving some countries saddled with debt. The Commission chief said countries need ""trusted partners"" to design projects that were sustainable. The EU is looking at how it can leverage billions of euros, drawn from member states, financial institutions and the private sector. This will largely take the form of guarantees or loans, rather than grants. Mrs von der Leyen saidthe EU wanted to show that a different, democratic approach could deliver,externalon projects that focused on tackling climate change as well as global health security and sustainable development for developing countries. Projects had to be of high quality, with a high level of transparency and good governance, and had to deliver tangible results for the countries involved, she explained. One EU official told the BBC that Africa would be a major focus of the scheme. China's strategy has reached into Africa, Asia, the Indo-Pacific and also the EU. China's Cosco company owns two-thirds of the huge Greek container port at Piraeus and the China Road and Bridge Corporation has built a key bridge in Croatia. The Peljesac bridge in Croatia was paid for by EU taxpayers but built by the China Road and Bridge Corporation ""When it comes to investment choices,"" said the Commission president, ""the few options that exist too often come with a lot of small print which includes big consequences, be it financially, politically but also socially."" Andrew Small, a Senior Transatlantic Fellow at the German Marshall Fund, told the BBC it marked ""the first serious effort from the European side to put packages together and figure out financing mechanisms, so countries considering taking loans from China have an alternative option"". China: Big spender or loan shark? MI6 boss warns of China 'debt traps and data traps' 'We don't like our land being given away to China' At a briefing last month, China's ambassador to the EU, Zhang Ming, said Beijing welcomed the EU's Global Gateway strategy if it was open and could ""help developing countries"". But he also warned ""any attempt to turn infrastructure projects into a geopolitical tool would fail the expectation of the international community and harm one's own interests"". Belt and Road has been a centre-piece of Chinese foreign policy. While it has developed trade links by ploughing money into new roads, ports, railways and bridges, it has also been criticised as a means of providing ""predatory loans"" in what is labelled ""debt-trap diplomacy"". But there are also those who argue the picture is more complicated, and that borrowing large sums of money is hardly risk-free. Moreover, China met a need others did not. Either way, China's economic and geopolitical footprint has grown as tensions rise with the West. The question is whether the EU can really act in this geopolitical space, says Andrew Small. ""Or is it too rigid, too bogged down by internal bureaucratic fighting? If they fail at this, it's a big miss,"" he argues. One diplomat told me: ""It's a good sign that finally Europe is asserting its influence in this area. ""That's a common interest we share with our transatlantic friends in the US and UK."" But a common interest could also create more competition, according to Scott Morris, a Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development. After all, the US has its own ""Build Back Better World"" initiative launched at the G7 last June. ""This is a noisy space with a lot of brands bumping into each other,"" says Mr Morris. However he's ""hopeful"" of success for the Global Gateway initiative. He says, ""more importantly"" than rivalling China, it's a chance for Europe to ""achieve a scale of financing that can do some good in developing countries that need some capital"". The EU has pointedly emphasised its ""values-based"" and ""transparent"" approach, arguing it wants to create links not dependencies. But this is also about influence, as the Commission continues to look for ways to flex its muscles on the geopolitical stage and, in turn, find out how strong those muscles are.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson said he wanted to increase vaccination capacity across the UK Covid booster jabs will be offered to everyone in England who is eligible by the end of January, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. Mr Johnson said the government would be ""throwing everything"" at the campaign so everyone can get a third jab. People will be invited to book a booster three months after their second vaccine dose. The rollout was expanded in response to the emerging Omicron variant, which could be more infectious than Delta. A total of 22 cases of the new variant have so far been confirmed in the UK - 13 in England and nine cases inScotland linked to a single event. The prime minister said booster doses will be given at 1,500 community pharmacy sites and extra hospital hubs in England. He added 400 military personnel will be on hand to help the NHS alongside ""the fantastic jabs army of volunteers"". ""There'll be temporary vaccination centres popping up like Christmas trees,"" he told a Downing Street press conference. When can I get my booster jab? What Covid rules are being toughened? Where do I have to wear a mask now? Earlier, Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the UK Health Security Agency - the body which replaced Public Health England - suggested people should limit unnecessary socialising in the run-up to Christmas, saying: ""If we all decrease our social contacts a little bit, actually that helps to keep the variant at bay"". But the prime minister disagreed, saying government guidance remains the same - but that people should ""take sensible precautions"" like washing hands and wearing masks. Asked whether people should cancel Christmas parties and nativity plays, Mr Johnson said: ""We don't want people to cancel such events, and we think that overwhelmingly the best thing for kids is to be in schools."" He said instead, they were taking a ""balanced and proportionate"" approach, and while he thought it extremely unlikely that another lockdown would be required, he was ruling nothing out. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said getting vaccinated would ""give ourselves the best chance of a Christmas with our loved ones"". Boris Johnson later made a speech at a festive food and drink market being held in Downing Street Almost 18 million people in the UK have already had a booster jab. A further 14 million more adults have now become eligible for one in England alone, Mr Johnson said. On Monday, the government's vaccines advisers saidboosters would be offered to all over-18sin the UK with the minimum gap between the second dose and booster reduced from six to three months. Mr Johnson urged people to wait to be contacted by the health service before booking their booster, saying: ""Even if you have had your second jab over three months ago and you are now eligible, please don't try and book until the NHS says it is your turn."" Jabs will be prioritised according to age, with the NHS working down the list in five-year bands as before, he said. As well as expanding the booster jabs programme, the government has strengthened other Covid rules in response to concern over the new variant. Face coverings are once again compulsory in places like shops and on public transport in England, and contacts of suspected Omicron cases are now required to self-isolate for 10 days, regardless of their vaccination status. And as of Tuesday morning, anyone coming to the UK must self-isolate until they get a negative result from a PCR test, taken within 48 hours of arrival. Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the measures, but said he had written to the prime minister urging him to ""go further"" by introducing ""vital"" testing for everyone before they travel. He said: ""They need urgently to put that additional measure in place... a PCR test is not a substitute for a pre-departure test."" The end of January target is ambitious, but certainly achievable. Crucially there is plentiful supply of vaccines - the challenge is increasing the rate at which the NHS can give jabs. Currently just over two million booster doses a week are being given in England. At that rate it would take until the start of spring to vaccinate all eligible adults. The PM can only set these targets for England but ministers in devolved nations have also committed to ramping up boosters The challenge therefore is to get up to the levels of vaccination seen in the spring when around four million doses a week were being administered. Some of the infrastructure that was in place in those early days has been dismantled. Many GPs and their teams have returned to their day jobs. A third of the mass vaccination centres have closed. Pharmacies have stepped in to offer more jabs, but they are constrained in how many they can do by lack of staff. Extra support for them will be vital. So will the hospital vaccination sites - there's more than 200 of them but only 30 currently vaccinate members of the public. NHS England chief executive Amanda Pritchard said she was aiming to free up capacity to allow hospitals, GP surgeries and pharmacies to give more booster jabs. She said NHS staff were working at ""breakneck speed"" to expand the vaccine programme, which was already at its ""most complex phase"" and now faced the biggest change to eligibility so far. Northern Ireland has announcedextra vaccination clinics to meet demand. Scotland and Wales have said their booster programmes will be ramped up, but are yet to lay out the full details. A further 39,716 confirmed Covid cases were announced in the UK on Tuesday, while another 159 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also reported.

"Greece will be the first country in the EU to target a specific age group Greece is to make Covid vaccinations mandatory for people aged 60 and over. Fines of â¬100 (Â£85) will be imposed at monthly intervals from mid-January on those who refuse, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said. The money will go towards the Greek health system, which is struggling with a surge in hospital admissions. About 63% of Greece's 11-million population is fully vaccinated, but data show more than 520,000 people over 60 are yet to get the jab. ""Greeks over the age of 60... must book their appointment for a first jab by January 16,"" the premier said in a statement to the cabinet. ""Their vaccination is henceforth compulsory."" The measure is still to be put to a parliamentary vote, he said, but lawmakers are widely expected to approve it. While countries have made vaccines mandatory for health workers and other high-risk workers, Greece will become the first in the EU to target a specific age group. Austria has announced that compulsory Covid vaccinations will start in February. Syriza, Greece's main opposition party, called the new measures punitive and financially excessive. Mr Mitsotakis said the decision had ""tortured"" him but he felt a ""heavy responsibility in standing next to those most vulnerable, even if it might fleetingly displease them"".

"Passengers arriving in England from China will have to provide a negative Covid test before they board a flight. From 5 January,airlines will be required to check,externalthat they have a negative PCR or lateral flow test before allowing them to fly. Several countries - including the US, Japan, Italy and Malaysia - are now enforcing testing on visitors from China following the effective ending of Beijing's zero-Covid policy, But do such restrictions work? Australia imposed some of the strictest travel restrictions. From 2020, it closed its borders to non-residents and banned Australians from travelling abroad (with a few exceptions). Countries such as the UK were more lenient. They required international arrivals to use quarantine hotels and take Covid tests. After the pandemic began in 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated it didn't generally support travel bans, as they were ""usually not effective"". It said: ""Travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic may only be justified at the beginning of an outbreak, as they may allow countries to gain time."" After the emergence of the Omicron variant it again warned against blanket travel bans,saying they would not stop the global spread.,external ""They can adversely impact global health efforts... by dis-incentivising countries to report and share epidemiological and sequencing data,"" it said. The WHO'sdirector general said,externalhe was ""very concerned over the evolving situation in China, with increasing reports of severe disease"". He said that the WHO needed more detailed information to understand the risks created by the situation on the ground in China. And on Twitterhe added,external: ""In the absence of comprehensive information from China, it is understandable that countries around the world are acting in ways that they believe may protect their populations."" Professor Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group told BBC News: ""Trying to ban a virus by adjusting what we do with travel has already been shown not to work very well. ""We've seen that with the bans on travel from various countries during the pandemic, that hasn't stopped those viruses travelling around the world eventually."" The word ""eventually"" is important here, because studies suggest that travel restrictions tend only to delay the spread of the virus spreading in a country, but cannot keep it out completely. A report in the British Medical Journal,externalfound that international border restrictions could delay the spread by two months. One of its authors, Dr Karen Grepin from Hong Kong University, told Reality Check: ""We have learned during the pandemic that universal measures, applying to all travellers not just those from certain countries, are more effective than targeted measures, for example against Chinese travellers. ""The only type of travel restrictions that have been shown to be effective during the pandemic are those that involve lengthy quarantine periods and I don't think there is a lot of appetite for such measures at this point."" Research published in the journal Nature, in December 2020, said restrictions worked well as Covid first began to spread around the world,but became less effective the later they were introduced.,external A study by the WZB Berlin Social Science Center in Germany looking at travel restrictions and death rates in more than 180 countries reached similar conclusions and added: the biggest impact was when countries banned travel before recording 10 or more deaths quarantine for all travellers was more effective than entry bans (which in some cases exempted returning nationals). Another scientist advising the UK government, Prof Mark Woolhouse, told Reality Check that restricting arrivals from China to the UK would not do much to limit the number of Covid cases in this country. ""We have far too many Covid-19 cases here in the UK at present for imported cases to make a significant contribution,"" he said. It has also been suggested that restrictions would prevent potential new variants of Covid reaching the UK. However, if there is such a variant, said Prof Woolhouse, travel restrictions would be too late. ""It will almost certainly have got here already,"" he said, ""Measures could only work if the variant happens to emerge during the period the measures are in place and even then they will only delay, not prevent, the arrival of the variant."" What is known about new Covid variant XBB.1.5? Besides, a new variant is not more likely to come in from China than from anywhere else in the world. ""Though China is clearly experiencing a substantial wave there is no reason to suspect that wave will be a crucible for the emergence of new variants,"" said Prof Woolhouse. ""The next variant is at least as likely to emerge from somewhere entirely different - there are currently around four million reported cases per week worldwide (and surely far larger numbers are unreported). So why concentrate only on China?"" However, the WHO has said it is concerned that China is not sharing information about its latest Covid surge, possibly including the emergence of any new variants. ""Targeted border measures against China may be more of a political statement in response to lack of information-sharing than a sincere attempt to promote public health,"" said Catherine Worsnop from the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy.
