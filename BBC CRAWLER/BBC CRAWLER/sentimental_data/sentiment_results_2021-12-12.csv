"This video can not be played It is feared photos on social media are increasing demand for people to cut off dogs' ears Networks of breeders are offering to mutilate puppies to follow a social media trend, a BBC investigation has found. Cutting or ""cropping"" ears involves removing part of the ear flap for cosmetic reasons. One breeder told an undercover journalist it created a ""striking"" look for the American bully breed. The procedure is illegal in the UK, but breeders are offering fraudulent pet passports to imply it was done abroad. Dog ear cropping warning after breeder found guilty Man jailed after cruelly cropping puppiesâ ears During the investigation, one breeder offered to sell a BBC Wales undercover journalist a puppy for Â£13,000, and spoke of clipping the dogs' ears, a practice which is banned in the UK under the Animal Welfare Act. Paula Boyden, from Dogs Trust, said there was ""no justification at all"" for the practice, and it could leave the dogs with health and behavioural issues. ""Some animals then go on to develop infections or don't like people touching their ears,"" she said. ""We've also seen behaviour issues because dogs communicate with their ears, and without them they may have difficulty in doing that with their owners or other dogs."" Warning: Upsetting content Moheiz Adam offered to sell an undercover journalist a puppy for Â£13,000 BBC Wales Investigates traced a number of breeders who post images of cropped-eared dogs online. One breeder, Moheiz Adam, said it was ""a shame"" cropping was illegal as it gave dogs a ""striking look"". He offered to sell an undercover journalist a puppy for Â£13,000, and said it would come with a pet passport and a microchip. ""[Another man] just takes care of it, brings back the paperwork... if questions are asked you basically [say] that's how you bought it, from an Irishman. It came from Europe and that's all you know. ""All of my dogs have been done by him and let's just say as long as you get it done at the right age, it looks 10 out of 10,"" he said. ""Cropping"" dogs' ears is an illegal practice in the UK During a video call, Mr Adam held up the puppy and, referring to its ear, said: ""That will all come off."" Commenting on the BBC's evidence, Daniella Dos Santos, former president of the British Veterinary Association (BVA), said she was ""devastated"" by what it exposed. ""Cropping of ears is an illegal mutilation is done for no other reason than... cosmetic reasons and the whole conversation throughout has been about how these dogs look. ""It's all for status. There are no health benefits to these dogs at all."" Mr Adam later said that while he would ""like to have dogs' ears removed"" it was illegal and he had ""never arranged for it to be done"". Joshua Harty told an undercover journalist he could arrange to get ears clipped Another breeder, Joshua Harty, from Cardiff, told an undercover journalist that he, too, could arrange cropping and supply a foreign pet passport and microchip. ""To get the ears and the passport and the chip is normally around Â£500... my vet gets them from Turkey. ""I've taken dogs to shows in Ireland, Spain, and obviously I've had to cross borders, and I've taken these passports and I've got through every time. Never had a problem,"" he said. Daniella Dos Santos said what Mr Harty was suggesting was ""facilitating a crime"". ""It's all completely illegal, the cropping of ears, the false passports, everything about this is a dodgy system,"" she said. ""Yet again, looking at these animals as commodities and money making machines rather than living sentient beings."" She added: ""The reason this is happening is because there is a loophole that allows the importation of dogs with cropped ears, and that's just acting as a smokescreen clearly for it happening in the UK."" BBC Wales approached Mr Harty for comment, but he did not respond. The puppies, put up for sale on Facebook with cropped ears, were seized by Cardiff Council Vanessa Waddon, from dog rescue charity Hope, has been caring for pups which have been mutilated,after they were seized from an illegal breeder by Cardiff council. The puppies were said to be worth Â£1,500 more after their ears were cut. Ms Waddon said she feared demand was being driven by social media influencers posting images of cropped-eared dogs, citing footballer Marcus Rashford, Little Mix singer Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Love Island's Jack Fincham. ""Whenever celebrities post things online, people inevitably think 'oh that dog looks nice maybe I'll get one like that,"" she said. ""While [the celebrities] may have imported the dogs legally, there are people cropping illegally in the UK to meet demand."" BBC Wales contacted representatives for Mr Rashford, Ms Pinnock and Mr Fincham, but did not receive a response. Griff, one of the dogs seized, has been rehomed in time for Christmas The UK government has said the proposed Kept Animals Bill would restrict the importation of dogs with cropped ears and puppies under six months old. A Welsh government spokesman said it had a five year Animal Welfare Plan for Wales to tackle illegal dog breeding, including new regulation and was monitoring developments closely. But Ms Boyden said unless border staff check imported dogs, the law would not work. ""A ban on importation is to be welcomed, but a law is only as good as its enforcement and at the moment there is no detail on what resources will be available to check for cropped ears or if they look underage,"" she said. Ms Waddon added: ""We work with excellent enforcement officers, they just don't have the resources to investigate all of the cases that have been reported to them. ""You can have the best legislation in place, but unless it's being enforced, is never going to be fully effective.""

"Putin trying out a Lada in the city of Khabarovsk (file photo from 2010) Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken of his regret at the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, revealing that he had to work as a taxi driver to supplement his income. Economic troubles triggered by the collapse forced many Russians to seek new ways to earn money. Mr Putin described the break-up as the collapse of historical Russia. The remarks could fuel speculation about his intentions towards Ukraine, a former Soviet republic. Russia has amassed more than 90,000 troops on its border with Ukraine and there are fears it is planning to invade. Russia denies this, accusing Ukraine of provocation and seeking guarantees against eastward Nato expansion. Mr Putin's remarks come from a documentary film called Russia, Latest History, aired on Sunday. ""It was a disintegration of historical Russia under the name of the Soviet Union,"" he said, adding that in the West it was believed that the further disintegration of Russia was only a matter of time. It is well known that Mr Putin views the collapse as a tragedy but his remarks about his personal difficulties at the time are new. ""Sometimes I had to earn extra money,"" he said. ""I mean, earn extra money by car, as a private driver. It's unpleasant to talk about to be honest, but unfortunately that was the case."" At the time, taxis were a rarity in Russia, and many private individuals would give rides to strangers to help make ends meet. Some would even use work vehicles such as ambulances as taxis. Mr Putin is known to be a former agent of the Soviet security service, the KGB. However, in the early 1990s he worked in the office of St Petersburg Mayor Anatoly Sobchak. He maintains that he resigned from the KGB after the August 1991 coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev which led to the break-up of the USSR. By Patrick Jackson, BBC News I did take a bus on its way back to its depot one night but I drew the line at that ambulance... These were just some of the vehicles I found doubling as taxis in 1990s Russia. Every young Russian I knew in Moscow back then seemed to use them and, eventually, every Russian family man with a motor seemed to be moonlighting as abombila(bomber), the nickname for informal cabbies. When I first arrived as a student in 1989 there were only two unwritten rules: don't get in a car with more than one person in it and agree the fare before you set off. There just weren't enough official taxis. Usually the biggest risk you ran was causing offense to a macho driver by trying to put on a seat belt. When the USSR collapsed in 1991 and the rouble lost its value, the informal market mushroomed and you could find yourself being driven by people from all walks of life. Occasionally I had enlightening conversations with the drivers but often embarrassed silences would descend, maybe because a driver realised he could have charged more after clicking too late that I was a Westerner, but maybe too because they may have been ashamed at having to spend the best years of their lives ""bombing"" instead of pursuing the careers and lives they had planned for.

"Emmerdale actor Danny Miller has been crowned the winner of ITV's I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! He beat fellow finalists actor Simon Gregson and singer Frankie Bridge to be crowned the king of the castle. Miller described winning as ""the best thing that's ever happened to me"" - other than the birth of his son Albert three weeks before the show began. His victory follows a turbulent series which sawseveral episodescancelled due to Storm Arwen. There were also two instances ofintruders being removed from the setafter breaches of security. The finale was delayed by 10 minutes due toa public address by the prime minister on the Omicron variantand during the show Ant and Dec joked that Boris Johnson was going to sign up for the next series of the show. The pair have made quips about the prime minister throughout the series - on Tuesdaythey went viral after joking about the row over a Downing Street Christmas party,externalheld while London was under tough Covid restrictions last year and referring to Mr Johnson as the ""prime minister... for now"". After winning, the 30-year-old soap star said: ""I never thought I'd be in this position, I barely thought I'd make it through the first two or three votes or so."" He said he had gone on the show to secure his son's future financially. ""I have made no secret about the fact that I wanted to be able to give him and set him up for a good future. I wasn't financially set for that and this is an opportunity to do that,"" he said. ""It would set me and my family up. I feel like I have done it. I feel proud of myself and I hope my family are as well."" The finale was watched by an average audience of 6.5 million viewers, according to overnight figures. Madeley alongside campmates David Ginola, Louise Minchin, Snoochie Shy and Frankie Bridge, as well as Kadeena Cox, Matty Lee, Naughty Boy, Danny Miller and Dame Arlene Phillips Singer Bridge, a former member of pop band The Saturdays, said she was ""so happy"" after finishing third. ""Being quite a naturally anxious person, I kind of wanted to prove myself wrong on things that I'm really scared of and show other people, if you're scared you can do them and end up smiling at the end,"" she told Ant and Dec. Bridge also joked that she can now have a ""long and happy marriage"" after placing higher on the show than her husband, footballer Wayne Bridge, who came fifth in 2016. Coronation Street's Gregson, who came second, told Ant and Dec he had finished the series with greater self-confidence. ""I knew before I came in that I needed to be in a certain state of mind not to be 'blah blah blah' and I think I achieved that,"" he said. One of the biggest names to take part in this year's series, Richard Madeley,left the show after just a few days. The TV presenter was taken to hospital after falling ill, and was not able to return because his departure from the castle had broken the show's Covid bubble. But the show continued to attract viewers despite the setbacks. A consolidated audience of more than 10 million watched the series launch. Since then, it has generally attracted a live audience of around five million, with most episodes rising to more than seven million when catch-up viewing is included. For the second consecutive year, I'm A Celebrity took place at Gwrych Castle in north Wales after moving from the Australian jungle because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Last year's winner, author and podcaster Giovanna Fletcher, was not present to crown the new champion in Sunday's finale,reportedly due to Covid-19 fears.,external The pandemic has posed logistical problems for many TV shows in the last 18 months. However, it was bad weather that caused the most disruption to this series of I'm A Celebrity. Live elements of one episode were abandoned andAnt and Dec pre-recorded their linksfollowing an amber weather warning. Three more episodes were cancelled altogether and the celebrities were removed from the castle after it was damaged during Storm Arwen. I'm A Celebrity...

"Jess Davies said the graphic images she was sent left her ""feeling dirty"" and questioning herself A social media influencer said she had been the victim of cyber-flashing for the past 10 years. Podcaster Jess Davies, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said she had received hundreds of unsolicited obscene images. Calls are growing for cyber-flashing to become a crime as part of measures to toughen laws on online safety. The UK government said its plans would ""force social media companies to stamp out online abuse"". Jess, who has 151,000 followers on Instagram, said she has become almost ""numb"" to the images she is sent, adding: ""What's illegal offline should be illegal online."" Cyber-flashing 'likely' to be made illegal Sending unwanted nudes 'must be standalone crime' Online safety plans need more clarity, says Twitter ""I am probably cyber-flashed every month, maybe more, depends really on what I share. ""This has been going on for 10 years. I've probably received literally hundreds of these images. The kind of stuff I get is close-up shots, or of them performing a sex act. ""When I receive the images it makes you feel a bit dirty and you start thinking, 'why me? Why have they sent them to me, is it something I've done'?"" Jess Davies has joined the calls for cyber-flashing to be added to the UK government's draft Online Safety Bill She fears it has become ""normalised"" online, compared to what is tolerated in public. ""If you had thousands of men flashing you in the street, that's illegal, and that would be a huge problem and a huge conversation, so why are we accepting it online?"" Cyber-flashing has become increasingly common during the pandemic as people spend more time online, campaigners have said. On Tuesday, a joint committee of MPs will publish its report on the UK government's draftOnline Safety Bill,external, aimed at introducing tougher regulations for social media firms. Cyber-flashing is not included in the bill, but campaigners and MPs backing the change hope it will be added and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it should be illegal. Fay Jones was flashed on the streets of Cardiff as a teenager and said the incident had stuck with her The campaign to criminalise the act of cyber-flashing is a personal one for Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnor Fay Jones. At 17, she was flashed by a man in Cardiff. ""I picked my dad up late at night from in town and as I was walking towards the restaurant where my dad was, this guy walked towards me and exposed himself to me. ""I have never forgotten it. It stayed with me for such a long time. But, every time I tell that story somebody goes 'Oh, yeah, when I was 19 or when I was on a bus this happened. It's all too common."" But there are concerns about the bill making its way through Parliament. Labour's shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens argues that it ""isn't good enough"" and needs ""a lot of changes"". But the Cardiff Central MP does believe that cyber-flashing will eventually be included in the bill. ""It's a promise from the prime minister,"" she said. ""We will be holding them to account on this because they've made it clear that it should be accepted."" The Online Safety Bill aims to regulate social media firms The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""Our comprehensive online safety laws will force social media companies to stamp out online abuse alongside other abhorrent behaviour on their platforms. ""Failure to act could mean multi-billion pound fines up to 10% of their global turnover and having their sites blocked."" The UK government hopes the bill will prevent the spread of illegal content and activity such as images of child abuse, terrorist material and hate crimes. Ministers hope it will protect children from harmful material and protect adults from legal, but harmful, content. Some critics say the bill harms free speech, while others say it fails to recognise the high levels of online violence toward women - the NSPCC said it must be strengthened and have children at its heart.

"This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line The G7 group of rich democracies has warned Russia of ""massive consequences"" if it invades Ukraine. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, speaking after a summit in Liverpool, said the group wanted Russia to stop its aggression towards Ukraine However President Putin told President Biden during their video call last week that Russian troops did not pose a threat to anyone, Russian media report. Tensions are growing as Moscow amasses troops on Ukraine's border. Mr Putin added that he had no particular grounds for optimism after speaking to Mr Biden, but would like to meet him in person, local media quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. Russia and the US continue to have serious conceptual differences, Mr Peskov added. Ukrainian authorities have said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January, although US officials say it is not yet clear whether Mr Putin has made a decision. On Tuesday Mr Biden and Mr Putin held avirtual summit aimed at reducing tensionsin the region. Mr Biden said he had made it clear to Mr Putin that there would be ""economic consequences like none he's ever seen"" if he invaded Ukraine. On Sunday the G7 echoed that, saying: ""Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost in response."" The G7called on Russia,externalto ""de-escalate, pursue diplomatic channels and abide by its international commitments on transparency of military activities."" Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? What would be the fallout if Russia invaded Ukraine? What next for Ukraine after Putin-Biden talks? Ukraine shares borders with both the EU and Russia, but as a former Soviet republic it has deep social and cultural ties with Russia. However, Russia has accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to its border. On Thursday Mr Putin hardened his rhetoric over the situation in Ukraine, saying the war in the country's eastlooked like genocide.

"Ministers have repeated their calls for people to get the booster jab New restrictions are likely ""in the next few weeks"" in Wales to deal with the new Omicron variant, the health minister has said. Eluned Morgan said the Welsh government wanted ""to act proportionately"", but a spike in cases of the variant was expected ""quickly."" It comes as First Minister Mark Drakeford warned Omicron could lead to ""large numbers"" of people in hospital. The Welsh Tories want vaccine boosters ramped up ""to a war-like footing"". Mr Drakeford said: ""This is a fast-moving form of coronavirus, which has the potential to cause a large wave of infections in Wales. ""This could lead to large numbers of people needing hospital treatment at a time when our NHS is under significant pressure."" Loneliness fears over Christmas rule uncertainty First people in UK hospitals with Omicron variant People urged to use Covid tests before going out He said people's ""best defence"" continued to be vaccination, adding: ""Emerging evidence shows the booster dose is vital."" Mr Drakeford said older people and those at greatest risk were being prioritised for booster vaccines, with more clinics opening and with longer opening hours. ""Please make having your booster a priority, he added. ""It will be one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself against coronavirus and this new variant."" The first minister said the cabinet was monitoring the ""rapidly-changing public health situation"", adding he may ""need to take further steps to keep Wales safe"". It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced an ""Omicron emergency""and said booster jabs would be offered to everyone over 18 in England from this week. In Scotland,boosters will be offered to over-30sfrom Monday and then over-18s later in the week. Booster jabs arebeing made available at walk-in centresfor those aged 30 and above and those who had their last dose more than three months ago in Northern Ireland. Mr Drakeford haspledged to offer boosters to every adult by the end of January, with older people and those most at risk being prioritised. Eluned Morgan: ""The last thing we want to do is to impose the kind of restrictions that we saw last Christmas"" On Sunday evening, the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said they were recommending the coronavirus alert levelis raised from level three to level four, which signifies Covid is spreading fast. Risk levels are measured by a five-level, colour-coded alert system. Level four means a high or rising level of transmission. Speaking onBBC Politics Wales, Ms Morgan said, with 15 Omicron cases currently identified in Wales, she expected the number to ""change very quickly in a very short space of time"". ""We are still learning about this new variant,"" she added. Wales' coronavirus rules are now beingreviewed weeklyinstead of every three weeks in response to the new variant. On Saturday, officials at Cardiff and Vale health board""strongly discouraged"" going to Christmas partiesin light of the variant and ""increasing pressures"". Meanwhile, the Welsh government has urged people to take a lateral flow test before going out. People ""need to turn up when they are asked"" to have their booster jab, said Eluned Morgan Asked whether that advice might change in light of the call from NHS bosses, Ms Morgan said: ""I think there will come a point where that may be likely to happen. ""The last thing we want to do is to impose the kind ofrestrictions that we saw last Christmasunless we absolutely have to. ""We know that last Christmas was really disappointing for so many people. That's not where we want to be. ""But we will always act in the best interests of the people of Wales."" Earlier in the week, she warned that the current modelling suggest awave of Omicron cases""will reach its peak by around the end of January"". Asked if stricter restrictions like closing businesses would be possible without UK government financial support, Ms Morgan said: ""It will be much more difficult unless we're given the kind of cover that we were given economically by the UK government last time in terms of furlough."" Meanwhile,analysisby the UK Health Security Agency has showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer against Omicron. But a third booster vaccine dose was analysed to prevent about 75% of people from getting any Covid symptoms. Booster jabs were offered to people in Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, over the weekend The Welsh government has previously said alladults in Wales will be offered a booster vaccineby the end of January. ""We are slightly concerned about people actually not prioritising the booster vaccination,"" said Ms Morgan. ""They need to turn up when they are asked."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""I don't think anybody wants to bring in more regulation but we have learnt, haven't we, that the earlier you act the better it is. ""But, certainly, there are things that we need to see being done with even more determination. ""Getting that booster programme out even quicker, acting on things like air filtration, fresh air, in schools, in particular, and other public places."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the party has been ""demanding walk-in centres for months to improve take-up rates"". ""We know vaccinations are the key to a society living with coronavirus and free from restrictions,"" he added. ""These are beginning to materialise but, again, we need to see more urgency. ""It's important that ministers get evidence to justify any restrictions rather than use the absence of evidence, such as on vaccine passports, to make decisions."" Five more people have died with Covid, bringing the number to 6,481 since the start of the pandemic, according to Public Health Wales. An additional 2,591 positive cases were reported on Sunday, bringing the total to 534,893. The latest data covers the 24-hour period to 09:00 GMT on Friday.

"This video can not be played John Swinney: Scottish government assessing whether further Covid measures are needed New Covid restrictions could be introduced in Scotland next week, the deputy first minister has warned. John Swinney says the Scottish government is ""wrestling with the challenge"" of the surge of the Omicron variant. New self-isolation rules have come into force as Scotland recorded 4,087 new Covid cases on Saturday. All household contacts of someone with the virus should now isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccination status. The new isolation rules also apply to household contacts even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Covid: Scotland facing 'tsunami' of Omicron cases What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Non-household contacts of someone with Covid are permitted to leave isolation if they have had a negative PCR test and two vaccine doses. Scientists are warning that the UK isfacing a substantial wave of Omicron infections in Januarywithout further restrictions. In an interview withBBC Breakfast, the deputy first minister said the Scottish government would spend the weekend deciding what to do next. All household contacts of someone with the virus should now isolate for 10 days Mr Swinney said: ""We are looking at whether we need to take further measures to try to arrest the circulation of the virus. We had a huge rise in cases yesterday and that suggests we have an escalating problem. ""The government is wrestling with the challenge of what are the right rules to have in place over this weekend. We will share details of any changes with parliament over the next few days."" Mr Swinney said there was a danger of the virus overwhelming public and private services, but said he hoped a restricted Christmas would not happen. He said the Scottish government was ""working very hard"" to avoid this by asking the public to reduce social interaction and take lateral flow tests. ""We are encouraging people to take these steps so that we can protect the precious time that is Christmas time for families,"" he added. ""We know how hard that was last year and we want to avoid a repeat of that."" On Saturday the total number of Omicron cases across nine of the Scotland's 14 health boards reached 121. There were 4,087 new cases of the virus, a rise on the recent daily average of about 2,800 cases. Public Health Scotland (PHS) said there was a delay in test results being reported, so the actual figures will be higher. A further 12 deaths were also confirmed following a positive test. The number of people in hospital fell slightly to 552, with 53 patients in intensive care. Omicron study suggests major wave in January People urged to cancel Christmas parties in Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the current numbers were only the ""tip of the iceberg"" with cases doubling every two to three days - the fastest growth seen during the whole pandemic. She warned a media briefing this week that there wasan oncoming ""tsunami"" of Omicron cases. PHS has urged people to cancel Christmas parties, in a move that hospitality venues said triggered ""non-stop cancellations"". Ms Sturgeon said there was a focus on these events, as the new variant posed a big risk to workplaces. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said financial compensation should be made available to affected businesses. This video can not be played Professor Linda Bauld said festive restrictions are ""a possibility"" University of Edinburgh public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said she hoped this Christmas would not be a repeat of last year. Speaking to the BBC Radio Scotland'sGood Morning Scotland, she also said more restrictions could come next week. Prof Bauld said: ""Everybody wants to avoid shutting businesses again and that would be the last resort, but clearly across the country, decision-makers have to look at the menu of options and decide what is proportionate."" She said lockdown was a last resort, but people may be asked to cut back on socialising plans. But she added: ""Isolation, loneliness and separation from loved ones is something we also want to avoid."" Meanwhile, ward 7a at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness has been closed to new admissions after a Covid outbreak. Visiting has also been stopped. NHS bosses said it was not connected to an outbreak on ward 5a of the same hospital last week. Testing will establish if it is the Omicron variant that has closed the wards. Rising case numbers are also putting pressure on other areas. ScotRail has already cancelled 60 train services due to staff shortages as a result of Covid. The operator also dropped their festive Santa Express trips on the Fife Circle line this weekend. Scientists warned on Friday thattwo doses of a Covid vaccineare not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant - although a third booster dose significantly increases protection to around 75%. Vaccines are still likely to offer good protection against severe Covid that would need hospital treatment.

"Ministers have repeated their calls for people to get the booster jab New restrictions are likely ""in the next few weeks"" in Wales to deal with the new Omicron variant, the health minister has said. Eluned Morgan said the Welsh government wanted ""to act proportionately"", but a spike in cases of the variant was expected ""quickly."" It comes as First Minister Mark Drakeford warned Omicron could lead to ""large numbers"" of people in hospital. The Welsh Tories want vaccine boosters ramped up ""to a war-like footing"". Mr Drakeford said: ""This is a fast-moving form of coronavirus, which has the potential to cause a large wave of infections in Wales. ""This could lead to large numbers of people needing hospital treatment at a time when our NHS is under significant pressure."" Loneliness fears over Christmas rule uncertainty First people in UK hospitals with Omicron variant People urged to use Covid tests before going out He said people's ""best defence"" continued to be vaccination, adding: ""Emerging evidence shows the booster dose is vital."" Mr Drakeford said older people and those at greatest risk were being prioritised for booster vaccines, with more clinics opening and with longer opening hours. ""Please make having your booster a priority, he added. ""It will be one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself against coronavirus and this new variant."" The first minister said the cabinet was monitoring the ""rapidly-changing public health situation"", adding he may ""need to take further steps to keep Wales safe"". It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced an ""Omicron emergency""and said booster jabs would be offered to everyone over 18 in England from this week. In Scotland,boosters will be offered to over-30sfrom Monday and then over-18s later in the week. Booster jabs arebeing made available at walk-in centresfor those aged 30 and above and those who had their last dose more than three months ago in Northern Ireland. Mr Drakeford haspledged to offer boosters to every adult by the end of January, with older people and those most at risk being prioritised. Eluned Morgan: ""The last thing we want to do is to impose the kind of restrictions that we saw last Christmas"" On Sunday evening, the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said they were recommending the coronavirus alert levelis raised from level three to level four, which signifies Covid is spreading fast. Risk levels are measured by a five-level, colour-coded alert system. Level four means a high or rising level of transmission. Speaking onBBC Politics Wales, Ms Morgan said, with 15 Omicron cases currently identified in Wales, she expected the number to ""change very quickly in a very short space of time"". ""We are still learning about this new variant,"" she added. Wales' coronavirus rules are now beingreviewed weeklyinstead of every three weeks in response to the new variant. On Saturday, officials at Cardiff and Vale health board""strongly discouraged"" going to Christmas partiesin light of the variant and ""increasing pressures"". Meanwhile, the Welsh government has urged people to take a lateral flow test before going out. People ""need to turn up when they are asked"" to have their booster jab, said Eluned Morgan Asked whether that advice might change in light of the call from NHS bosses, Ms Morgan said: ""I think there will come a point where that may be likely to happen. ""The last thing we want to do is to impose the kind ofrestrictions that we saw last Christmasunless we absolutely have to. ""We know that last Christmas was really disappointing for so many people. That's not where we want to be. ""But we will always act in the best interests of the people of Wales."" Earlier in the week, she warned that the current modelling suggest awave of Omicron cases""will reach its peak by around the end of January"". Asked if stricter restrictions like closing businesses would be possible without UK government financial support, Ms Morgan said: ""It will be much more difficult unless we're given the kind of cover that we were given economically by the UK government last time in terms of furlough."" Meanwhile,analysisby the UK Health Security Agency has showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer against Omicron. But a third booster vaccine dose was analysed to prevent about 75% of people from getting any Covid symptoms. Booster jabs were offered to people in Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, over the weekend The Welsh government has previously said alladults in Wales will be offered a booster vaccineby the end of January. ""We are slightly concerned about people actually not prioritising the booster vaccination,"" said Ms Morgan. ""They need to turn up when they are asked."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""I don't think anybody wants to bring in more regulation but we have learnt, haven't we, that the earlier you act the better it is. ""But, certainly, there are things that we need to see being done with even more determination. ""Getting that booster programme out even quicker, acting on things like air filtration, fresh air, in schools, in particular, and other public places."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the party has been ""demanding walk-in centres for months to improve take-up rates"". ""We know vaccinations are the key to a society living with coronavirus and free from restrictions,"" he added. ""These are beginning to materialise but, again, we need to see more urgency. ""It's important that ministers get evidence to justify any restrictions rather than use the absence of evidence, such as on vaccine passports, to make decisions."" Five more people have died with Covid, bringing the number to 6,481 since the start of the pandemic, according to Public Health Wales.

"A 22,000-strong flock of ducks in Coagh will be culled, as will 14,000 poultry in Markethill Another two suspected cases of bird flu have been identified in commercial flocks in counties Armagh and Tyrone. Across both flocks, more than 30,000 poultry and ducks will be culled. A temporary control zone has been established around the sites at Markethill and Coagh. Chief veterinary officer Dr Robert Huey said this was the biggest ever outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Northern Ireland. The commercial duck flock of approximately 22,000 in Coagh and about 14,000 commercial poultry in Markethill will be humanely killed as part of precautions to try to prevent spread. Since cases werefirst detected in a commercial flock in County Tyrone this month, more than 22,000 birds have already been culled. That has included 22,100 ducks at a farm owned by Silverhill Duck in Aughnacloy, County Tyrone, and about 30 birds in a backyard hobby flock in Broughshane, County Antrim. Edwin Poots says the bird flu outbreak is at a ""critical point"" The strain identified in both flocks was officially confirmed this week as highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1, one which spreads rapidly and kills birds. It is regarded as posing a serious threat to the poultry industry, which is of major economic importance in Northern Ireland. Belfast park closed due to avian flu outbreak Bird flu outbreak 'largest ever in these islands' Cull of 27,000 ducks amid suspected bird flu case Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said the outbreak was now at a ""critical point"". ""This strain of H5N1 spreads quickly and could wipe out an entire flock in a matter of days,"" said Mr Poots. ""I am urging all bird keepers to proactively assess your current biosecurity measures and re-double your efforts to keep this disease out of your flocks."" Bird owners have been advised to keep flocks housed, wash hands after dealing with the birds, wear disposable boiler suits, keep surrounding areas clean and only have essential vehicles coming onto sites. Mr Poots added: ""We cannot afford to be complacent and must act now to protect our flocks.""

"Jess Davies said the graphic images she was sent left her ""feeling dirty"" and questioning herself A social media influencer said she had been the victim of cyber-flashing for the past 10 years. Podcaster Jess Davies, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said she had received hundreds of unsolicited obscene images. Calls are growing for cyber-flashing to become a crime as part of measures to toughen laws on online safety. The UK government said its plans would ""force social media companies to stamp out online abuse"". Jess, who has 151,000 followers on Instagram, said she has become almost ""numb"" to the images she is sent, adding: ""What's illegal offline should be illegal online."" Cyber-flashing 'likely' to be made illegal Sending unwanted nudes 'must be standalone crime' Online safety plans need more clarity, says Twitter ""I am probably cyber-flashed every month, maybe more, depends really on what I share. ""This has been going on for 10 years. I've probably received literally hundreds of these images. The kind of stuff I get is close-up shots, or of them performing a sex act. ""When I receive the images it makes you feel a bit dirty and you start thinking, 'why me? Why have they sent them to me, is it something I've done'?"" Jess Davies has joined the calls for cyber-flashing to be added to the UK government's draft Online Safety Bill She fears it has become ""normalised"" online, compared to what is tolerated in public. ""If you had thousands of men flashing you in the street, that's illegal, and that would be a huge problem and a huge conversation, so why are we accepting it online?"" Cyber-flashing has become increasingly common during the pandemic as people spend more time online, campaigners have said. On Tuesday, a joint committee of MPs will publish its report on the UK government's draftOnline Safety Bill,external, aimed at introducing tougher regulations for social media firms. Cyber-flashing is not included in the bill, but campaigners and MPs backing the change hope it will be added and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it should be illegal. Fay Jones was flashed on the streets of Cardiff as a teenager and said the incident had stuck with her The campaign to criminalise the act of cyber-flashing is a personal one for Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnor Fay Jones. At 17, she was flashed by a man in Cardiff. ""I picked my dad up late at night from in town and as I was walking towards the restaurant where my dad was, this guy walked towards me and exposed himself to me. ""I have never forgotten it. It stayed with me for such a long time. But, every time I tell that story somebody goes 'Oh, yeah, when I was 19 or when I was on a bus this happened. It's all too common."" But there are concerns about the bill making its way through Parliament. Labour's shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens argues that it ""isn't good enough"" and needs ""a lot of changes"". But the Cardiff Central MP does believe that cyber-flashing will eventually be included in the bill. ""It's a promise from the prime minister,"" she said. ""We will be holding them to account on this because they've made it clear that it should be accepted."" The Online Safety Bill aims to regulate social media firms The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""Our comprehensive online safety laws will force social media companies to stamp out online abuse alongside other abhorrent behaviour on their platforms. ""Failure to act could mean multi-billion pound fines up to 10% of their global turnover and having their sites blocked."" The UK government hopes the bill will prevent the spread of illegal content and activity such as images of child abuse, terrorist material and hate crimes. Ministers hope it will protect children from harmful material and protect adults from legal, but harmful, content. Some critics say the bill harms free speech, while others say it fails to recognise the high levels of online violence toward women - the NSPCC said it must be strengthened and have children at its heart.

"Soft plastics present complex problems to those trying to recycle them Plastic. It's everywhere these days, even in our bodies. We all know we have to use less and recycle more. Although we are all used to putting plastic containers into our recycling, what about all those tear-off film lids, bread bags and shopping bags which go into the rubbish bin? Soft, or flexible, plastic - the kind you can scrunch up in your hand - includes everything from shopping bags to clingfilm. It makes up about 15% of all material which is unable to be recycled at council facilities. In Wales, just 16% of local authorities collect some plastic film made of polyethylene (PE, commonly called polythene), the material which represents the largest volume of household flexible plastic waste at nearly 40%,according to figures from waste and recycling charity Wrap,external. Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire are two of those offering kerbside collection of some soft plastics, including shopping or bread bags and toilet paper wrapping, but not items made from multiple materials, such as crisp packets or pet food pouches. Recycling plastics does not work, says PM New meat tray 'could save tonnes of plastic waste' Others, such as Wrexham and Cardiff, offer disposal points at household waste centres, although some will handle soft plastics if it ends up in the recycling by accident. In some areas, soft plastics can only be disposed of at supermarkets. Tesco, for example,announced in August,externalshoppers could take all their soft plastic waste to its large stores - or through community recycling schemes. Zero-waste store owner Amy Greenfield wants to see plastics recycling ""simplified and standardised"" One example of this isTerracycle,external, the industry-funded scheme allowing members of the public to return plastic packaging or other items not currently included in domestic recycling to manufacturers for them to process. People earn points for recycling which can be given as cash to charities, schools or other non-profit organisations. Amy Greenfield is a director of Awesome Wales which runs zero waste shops in Cowbridge and Barry in Vale of Glamorgan and hosts Terracycle collection points. The Barry store has monthly drop-off sessions for people to bring recycling which is collected the same day by a dedicated volunteer, while the Cowbridge site has permanent bins available. Amy said: ""I think a lot of people are really confused about what they can and can't recycle."" Different brands sponsor aspects of the scheme - Walkers runs crisp packet collections and Hovis runs bread bags - other brands can be collected as well, but they have to be very similar products. Awesome Wales has lots of different containers for its Terracycle recycling efforts (l), including a crisp packet return scheme (r) ""That's why we've got so many different bins and different sections because each item has to be put in separately,"" she said. ""The main struggle for us is getting people to understand that that's important and basically our waste won't be accepted and our account will be suspended if we just send in whatever people wanted to shove in the bins. ""I think potentially it's a bit too heavily weighted to the consumer and the brands to need to make things simpler."" It would be much easier if there was more standardisation of packaging, according to Amy, with fewer types of plastic used for food packaging and a cut in multi-material products, which are harder to recycle. ""It needs to be simpler, it needs to be kerbside, it needs to be standardised and I think the industry isn't going to do that voluntarily so that's going to require legislation and coordination with local and national government to make sure that happens."" Climate change minister Julie James wants producers to take on responsibility for plastic waste Wales' first Climate Change Minister Julie James is in agreement that the burden of responsibility for managing soft plastics needs to lie with the manufacturers rather than the taxpayer. She said: ""It's a two-pronged approach. We do want to see facilities to recycle soft plastics but our primary push is on trying to stop them. ""We're going to be introducing a 'polluter pays' principle tax on the producers of it,"" with April as a target, depending on legislative programme issues. She gave the example of soft film coverings for food products being swapped for a hard plastic lid that can be put back on, as these are easier to recycle, or a switch to something made from cellulose, which is compostable. ""We will be encouraging councils to start collecting [soft plastics]. ""There is an issue with kerbside collections about the [refuse] vehicles and how much separate stuff they can actually pick up and, frankly, in many people's houses how many bins you can have exactly?"" Bins like this one in the Co-op accept soft plastic from customers for recycling Her department has been having ""long conversations"" with the supermarkets - which the minister calls the biggest procurers of plastic-using products - about giving people more choice. This includes letting people bring their own containers and filling up themselves, in a much larger version of the zero-waste stores run by people like Amy. ""So it's a combination again. A variable fee, a fine on some products in order to try and get rid of them, and a behaviour change campaign [among the public] at the same time,"" she said. There have been discussions looking at opening regional material recycling facilities (known as murfs) which fall into two types: Clean - recycled materials which are then sorted - and dirty- where general black bag waste is taken and separated. This video can not be played Ever wondered where your recycling goes after it's collected, or why you have to clean it or separate it first? Ms James said: ""There is some possibility that if we had reprocessing purpose for them, we could just let people put all their plastics into one bag and just separate them out at the regional facility. ""If we could centre that at a circular economy point, so somewhere that's generating electricity, near one of our anaerobic digesters because all our food waste goes there and is turned into electricity, if the fleet was electric and being fuelled by the recycling facility, it's a lot more viable."" She also said Wales would move to a system of mandatory labelling on what can and cannot be recycled as "" lot of consumers are really annoyed"". ""At the moment [with the numbered triangles on packaging] most people think 'that must be recyclable' and put it in, but some of the numbers mean not in the UK, or only in one place in the world."" One of the unintended consequences of a push to reduce plastic use by suppliers could mean making it harder to recycle those that are left, by not having enough to make reprocessing plants commercially viable. Ms James explained that when food waste recycling was introduced in Wales, ministers had to guess how much processing capacity to allow for in order to guaranteedigestor plants,externala certain income. It turned out people's behaviour altered much more quickly than expected and they stopped producing so much food waste once they could see the volume with their own eyes, meaning the government now pays slightly more in fees because there is less volume than anticipated going through the plants. How recycling is collected can affect what can be accepted and what is thrown away Waste and recycling charity Wrap recently ran a 12-week pilot scheme to trial soft plastic kerbside collection in a number of south Wales council areas. Emma Hallett, from Wrap Cymru's collaborative change programme, said: ""In order to collect them effectively we need to ensure they're kept separate from other types of materials so they can be recycled, and also that they don't contaminate the other materials being collected."" The trial helped them understand the type and amount of materials people would put out and how to ensure that, if collection services were offered, materials could be properly collected and recycled. ""It's vital that people put out materials that the council's looking for because the processes that will be followed for recycling will only work with certain types of material,"" said Emma. ""Although to most people plastic film and wrapping bags might appear to be similar, there are actually a lot of different types of polymers that are used in the manufacture of materials and so each one may need a different treatment according to what it's made of and how it can be recycled."" One of the issues, as Ms James touched on, is that existing collection lorries in council areas that collect recycling in separated containers do not have a section for soft plastics to go in. Meanwhile, in places where recycling is all collected in one bag or bin - adding soft plastics which cannot be easily separated into the mix risks either contaminating other recycled goods or causing snarl-ups in automated sorting centres' machinery. The pizza box dilemma: How to avoid wishcycling Where the UK's recycling really goes Wales 'could lead' in plastics recycling However, this has not deterred other places from doing just that - in September the Republic of Irelandintroduced soft plastics into its domestic collections,external. People there are able to add bags and other plastic wrappings to their existing dry recyclables bin, providing all material is clean and dry. The Irish government's Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications said less than a third of plastic waste packaging was recycled in the country, but it had committed to meeting European Union targets of 50% by 2025 and 55% by 2030. It added: ""There have been advancements in packaging design and investment in recycling technology. This allows segregation of different material types in recycling facilities in Ireland."" Plastics are now brought to recovery facilities and separated out before being sent to specialised, polymer-specific recycling plants. Any that cannot be recycled are sent as solid fuel to replace fossil fuels at cement kilns. ""Plastic in many cases is better than other alternatives"" says waste expert Rebecca Colley-Jones Rebecca Colley-Jones is the circular economy manager for the Polyolefins Circular Economy Platform (PCEP), a network for all parts of the plastic production and user chain, and a Welsh council member for the Chartered Institute of Waste Management. ""The industry has identified that there is work that needs to be done, that they need to invest not just money but time in developing solutions for these problems,"" she said. ""For example, there's a number of projects looking at digital water marking for plastics that have been printed, and things like AI [artificial intelligence] is being trialled at plants. ""So that means when the material is captured, more of it can be sorted and go to recycling avenues."" She said there was already a big shift towards using single-material products to enable easier recycling, but added that packaging was ""there for a reason"", such as providing a seal to make food last longer. ""When you look at the carbon savings improved by having the packaging... it's quite a lot."" She said industry members were ""desperate"" to be able to recover soft plastics, adding: ""They don't want it to go for incineration. They want it to be captured separately, be able to be identified and go back into the system."" Although plastic has definitely had a lot of bad press, rightly at times, it does have a place, Rebecca stressed. ""It's a durable, flexible material and as long as it's captured and put back into use it's not a worse material and in many cases is a better material than other alternatives.""

"This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line The G7 group of rich democracies has warned Russia of ""massive consequences"" if it invades Ukraine. UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, speaking after a summit in Liverpool, said the group wanted Russia to stop its aggression towards Ukraine However President Putin told President Biden during their video call last week that Russian troops did not pose a threat to anyone, Russian media report. Tensions are growing as Moscow amasses troops on Ukraine's border. Mr Putin added that he had no particular grounds for optimism after speaking to Mr Biden, but would like to meet him in person, local media quoted Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying. Russia and the US continue to have serious conceptual differences, Mr Peskov added. Ukrainian authorities have said Moscow could be planning a military offensive at the end of January, although US officials say it is not yet clear whether Mr Putin has made a decision. On Tuesday Mr Biden and Mr Putin held avirtual summit aimed at reducing tensionsin the region. Mr Biden said he had made it clear to Mr Putin that there would be ""economic consequences like none he's ever seen"" if he invaded Ukraine. On Sunday the G7 echoed that, saying: ""Russia should be in no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine would have massive consequences and severe cost in response."" The G7called on Russia,externalto ""de-escalate, pursue diplomatic channels and abide by its international commitments on transparency of military activities."" Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? What would be the fallout if Russia invaded Ukraine? What next for Ukraine after Putin-Biden talks? Ukraine shares borders with both the EU and Russia, but as a former Soviet republic it has deep social and cultural ties with Russia. However, Russia has accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to its border. On Thursday Mr Putin hardened his rhetoric over the situation in Ukraine, saying the war in the country's eastlooked like genocide.

"Ministers have repeated their calls for people to get the booster jab New restrictions are likely ""in the next few weeks"" in Wales to deal with the new Omicron variant, the health minister has said. Eluned Morgan said the Welsh government wanted ""to act proportionately"", but a spike in cases of the variant was expected ""quickly."" It comes as First Minister Mark Drakeford warned Omicron could lead to ""large numbers"" of people in hospital. The Welsh Tories want vaccine boosters ramped up ""to a war-like footing"". Mr Drakeford said: ""This is a fast-moving form of coronavirus, which has the potential to cause a large wave of infections in Wales. ""This could lead to large numbers of people needing hospital treatment at a time when our NHS is under significant pressure."" Loneliness fears over Christmas rule uncertainty First people in UK hospitals with Omicron variant People urged to use Covid tests before going out He said people's ""best defence"" continued to be vaccination, adding: ""Emerging evidence shows the booster dose is vital."" Mr Drakeford said older people and those at greatest risk were being prioritised for booster vaccines, with more clinics opening and with longer opening hours. ""Please make having your booster a priority, he added. ""It will be one of the most important things you can do to protect yourself against coronavirus and this new variant."" The first minister said the cabinet was monitoring the ""rapidly-changing public health situation"", adding he may ""need to take further steps to keep Wales safe"". It comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnsonannounced an ""Omicron emergency""and said booster jabs would be offered to everyone over 18 in England from this week. In Scotland,boosters will be offered to over-30sfrom Monday and then over-18s later in the week. Booster jabs arebeing made available at walk-in centresfor those aged 30 and above and those who had their last dose more than three months ago in Northern Ireland. Mr Drakeford haspledged to offer boosters to every adult by the end of January, with older people and those most at risk being prioritised. Eluned Morgan: ""The last thing we want to do is to impose the kind of restrictions that we saw last Christmas"" On Sunday evening, the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland said they were recommending the coronavirus alert levelis raised from level three to level four, which signifies Covid is spreading fast. Risk levels are measured by a five-level, colour-coded alert system. Level four means a high or rising level of transmission. Speaking onBBC Politics Wales, Ms Morgan said, with 15 Omicron cases currently identified in Wales, she expected the number to ""change very quickly in a very short space of time"". ""We are still learning about this new variant,"" she added. Wales' coronavirus rules are now beingreviewed weeklyinstead of every three weeks in response to the new variant. On Saturday, officials at Cardiff and Vale health board""strongly discouraged"" going to Christmas partiesin light of the variant and ""increasing pressures"". Meanwhile, the Welsh government has urged people to take a lateral flow test before going out. People ""need to turn up when they are asked"" to have their booster jab, said Eluned Morgan Asked whether that advice might change in light of the call from NHS bosses, Ms Morgan said: ""I think there will come a point where that may be likely to happen. ""The last thing we want to do is to impose the kind ofrestrictions that we saw last Christmasunless we absolutely have to. ""We know that last Christmas was really disappointing for so many people. That's not where we want to be. ""But we will always act in the best interests of the people of Wales."" Earlier in the week, she warned that the current modelling suggest awave of Omicron cases""will reach its peak by around the end of January"". Asked if stricter restrictions like closing businesses would be possible without UK government financial support, Ms Morgan said: ""It will be much more difficult unless we're given the kind of cover that we were given economically by the UK government last time in terms of furlough."" Meanwhile,analysisby the UK Health Security Agency has showed a dramatic drop in effectiveness for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and a significant drop-off for two doses of Pfizer against Omicron. But a third booster vaccine dose was analysed to prevent about 75% of people from getting any Covid symptoms. Booster jabs were offered to people in Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, over the weekend The Welsh government has previously said alladults in Wales will be offered a booster vaccineby the end of January. ""We are slightly concerned about people actually not prioritising the booster vaccination,"" said Ms Morgan. ""They need to turn up when they are asked."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""I don't think anybody wants to bring in more regulation but we have learnt, haven't we, that the earlier you act the better it is. ""But, certainly, there are things that we need to see being done with even more determination. ""Getting that booster programme out even quicker, acting on things like air filtration, fresh air, in schools, in particular, and other public places."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said the party has been ""demanding walk-in centres for months to improve take-up rates"". ""We know vaccinations are the key to a society living with coronavirus and free from restrictions,"" he added. ""These are beginning to materialise but, again, we need to see more urgency. ""It's important that ministers get evidence to justify any restrictions rather than use the absence of evidence, such as on vaccine passports, to make decisions."" Five more people have died with Covid, bringing the number to 6,481 since the start of the pandemic, according to Public Health Wales. An additional 2,591 positive cases were reported on Sunday, bringing the total to 534,893. The latest data covers the 24-hour period to 09:00 GMT on Friday.

"Jess Davies said the graphic images she was sent left her ""feeling dirty"" and questioning herself A social media influencer said she had been the victim of cyber-flashing for the past 10 years. Podcaster Jess Davies, from Penarth, Vale of Glamorgan, said she had received hundreds of unsolicited obscene images. Calls are growing for cyber-flashing to become a crime as part of measures to toughen laws on online safety. The UK government said its plans would ""force social media companies to stamp out online abuse"". Jess, who has 151,000 followers on Instagram, said she has become almost ""numb"" to the images she is sent, adding: ""What's illegal offline should be illegal online."" Cyber-flashing 'likely' to be made illegal Sending unwanted nudes 'must be standalone crime' Online safety plans need more clarity, says Twitter ""I am probably cyber-flashed every month, maybe more, depends really on what I share. ""This has been going on for 10 years. I've probably received literally hundreds of these images. The kind of stuff I get is close-up shots, or of them performing a sex act. ""When I receive the images it makes you feel a bit dirty and you start thinking, 'why me? Why have they sent them to me, is it something I've done'?"" Jess Davies has joined the calls for cyber-flashing to be added to the UK government's draft Online Safety Bill She fears it has become ""normalised"" online, compared to what is tolerated in public. ""If you had thousands of men flashing you in the street, that's illegal, and that would be a huge problem and a huge conversation, so why are we accepting it online?"" Cyber-flashing has become increasingly common during the pandemic as people spend more time online, campaigners have said. On Tuesday, a joint committee of MPs will publish its report on the UK government's draftOnline Safety Bill,external, aimed at introducing tougher regulations for social media firms. Cyber-flashing is not included in the bill, but campaigners and MPs backing the change hope it will be added and Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it should be illegal. Fay Jones was flashed on the streets of Cardiff as a teenager and said the incident had stuck with her The campaign to criminalise the act of cyber-flashing is a personal one for Conservative MP for Brecon and Radnor Fay Jones. At 17, she was flashed by a man in Cardiff. ""I picked my dad up late at night from in town and as I was walking towards the restaurant where my dad was, this guy walked towards me and exposed himself to me. ""I have never forgotten it. It stayed with me for such a long time. But, every time I tell that story somebody goes 'Oh, yeah, when I was 19 or when I was on a bus this happened. It's all too common."" But there are concerns about the bill making its way through Parliament. Labour's shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens argues that it ""isn't good enough"" and needs ""a lot of changes"". But the Cardiff Central MP does believe that cyber-flashing will eventually be included in the bill. ""It's a promise from the prime minister,"" she said. ""We will be holding them to account on this because they've made it clear that it should be accepted."" The Online Safety Bill aims to regulate social media firms The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""Our comprehensive online safety laws will force social media companies to stamp out online abuse alongside other abhorrent behaviour on their platforms. ""Failure to act could mean multi-billion pound fines up to 10% of their global turnover and having their sites blocked."" The UK government hopes the bill will prevent the spread of illegal content and activity such as images of child abuse, terrorist material and hate crimes. Ministers hope it will protect children from harmful material and protect adults from legal, but harmful, content. Some critics say the bill harms free speech, while others say it fails to recognise the high levels of online violence toward women - the NSPCC said it must be strengthened and have children at its heart.

"People aged 30 and over in England will be able to book a Covid-19 booster jab from Monday. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said data shows boosters are the ""essential defence against Omicron"". Booster vaccinations are now being given three months on from a second dose - rather than after six months. Omicron - a coronavirus variant -could cause between,external25,000 to 75,000 deaths by the end of April, according to new research. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told the Andrew Marr programme on Sunday that ""we are still learning about this variant, [but] we know boosters work, get [a] booster."" Some people under 40 reported being able to book their booster jab appointment online over the weekend, as the programme extends. Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) say theUK will face a substantial waveof Omicron infections without further restrictions beyond Plan B. These numbers are only a projection, rather than a prediction, and scientists say there is still uncertainty around the modelling. The UK announced a further 54,073 new cases on Saturday, including 633 of Omicron - although the real number of Omicron cases is estimated to be much higher. Omicron study suggests major wave in January How can I tell if I have Omicron? More Covid rules could come next week in Scotland Care home visitors cut to three to slow Omicron Dr Nick Davies from LSHTM said Omicron was likely to be the dominant form of the virus in England by the end of the year. Prof Sian Griffiths, professor of public health at the University of Hong Kong and visiting professor at Imperial College London, said booster jabs could become a regular occurrence, depending on how coronavirus continued to evolve. ""It may well be that we need to keep this as a rolling programmed,"" she said. This week, so-calledPlan B measureshave been introduced in England including mandatory face coverings in most indoor public venues and on public transport. People have been asked to work from home where possible from Monday, and care home residentswill be allowedonly three visitors and an essential care giver. NHS Covid Passes - which show you are fully vaccinated, have had a recent negative lateral flow or PCR test, or have an exemption - will be needed to enter some large-capacity venues in England from 15 December. On Tuesday, parliament willtake three votes on the new measures- with a rebellion from about 60 Tory MPs expected on the introduction of Covid passes. There is also expected to be a vote on mandatory vaccination for frontline NHS staff in England. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would ""not be tempted to play party politics"" and would back the government in voting for the measures ""in the public interest"". Conservative MP Steve Baker, a lockdown sceptic, told BBC Breakfast he would vote against mandatory vaccinations, Covid passes and extending face covering rules. He said scientific modelling was ""pessimistic"", such measures were ""disproportionate"" and said people needed to learn to live with coronavirus ""like we live with flu"". In Scotland, household contacts of people who have tested positive for Covid are now being asked to isolate for 10 days - regardless of their vaccination status or if they have had a negative PCR result. The Scottish government has also said adult care home staff and those working in social care who get vaccinated during work time will not lose out financially or have to take annual leave to do so. The Welsh government isurging members of the public to take a lateral flow test before going shopping or to Christmas parties. It has also said rules will be reviewed weekly rather than every three weeks. Officials in Northern Ireland are not planning to extend restrictions over the festive period but further curbs may be reintroduced in the new year. More than 22 million people in the UK have now had a third vaccination or booster. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)recommendedin November the window between second jabs and boosters be reduced from six months.

"People aged 30 and over in England will be able to book a Covid-19 booster jab from Monday. Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said data shows boosters are the ""essential defence against Omicron"". Booster vaccinations are now being given three months on from a second dose - rather than after six months. Omicron - a coronavirus variant -could cause between,external25,000 to 75,000 deaths by the end of April, according to new research. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi told the Andrew Marr programme on Sunday that ""we are still learning about this variant, [but] we know boosters work, get [a] booster."" Some people under 40 reported being able to book their booster jab appointment online over the weekend, as the programme extends. Scientists from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) say theUK will face a substantial waveof Omicron infections without further restrictions beyond Plan B. These numbers are only a projection, rather than a prediction, and scientists say there is still uncertainty around the modelling. The UK announced a further 54,073 new cases on Saturday, including 633 of Omicron - although the real number of Omicron cases is estimated to be much higher. Omicron study suggests major wave in January How can I tell if I have Omicron? More Covid rules could come next week in Scotland Care home visitors cut to three to slow Omicron Dr Nick Davies from LSHTM said Omicron was likely to be the dominant form of the virus in England by the end of the year. Prof Sian Griffiths, professor of public health at the University of Hong Kong and visiting professor at Imperial College London, said booster jabs could become a regular occurrence, depending on how coronavirus continued to evolve. ""It may well be that we need to keep this as a rolling programmed,"" she said. This week, so-calledPlan B measureshave been introduced in England including mandatory face coverings in most indoor public venues and on public transport. People have been asked to work from home where possible from Monday, and care home residentswill be allowedonly three visitors and an essential care giver. NHS Covid Passes - which show you are fully vaccinated, have had a recent negative lateral flow or PCR test, or have an exemption - will be needed to enter some large-capacity venues in England from 15 December. On Tuesday, parliament willtake three votes on the new measures- with a rebellion from about 60 Tory MPs expected on the introduction of Covid passes. There is also expected to be a vote on mandatory vaccination for frontline NHS staff in England. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party would ""not be tempted to play party politics"" and would back the government in voting for the measures ""in the public interest"". Conservative MP Steve Baker, a lockdown sceptic, told BBC Breakfast he would vote against mandatory vaccinations, Covid passes and extending face covering rules. He said scientific modelling was ""pessimistic"", such measures were ""disproportionate"" and said people needed to learn to live with coronavirus ""like we live with flu"". In Scotland, household contacts of people who have tested positive for Covid are now being asked to isolate for 10 days - regardless of their vaccination status or if they have had a negative PCR result. The Scottish government has also said adult care home staff and those working in social care who get vaccinated during work time will not lose out financially or have to take annual leave to do so. The Welsh government isurging members of the public to take a lateral flow test before going shopping or to Christmas parties. It has also said rules will be reviewed weekly rather than every three weeks. Officials in Northern Ireland are not planning to extend restrictions over the festive period but further curbs may be reintroduced in the new year. More than 22 million people in the UK have now had a third vaccination or booster. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)recommendedin November the window between second jabs and boosters be reduced from six months. It also said all over-18s would be offered the booster. Dr Emily Lawson, head of the NHS Covid vaccine programme, said the NHS was continuing to look for volunteers to help with vaccine delivery.

"This video can not be played John Swinney: Scottish government assessing whether further Covid measures are needed New Covid restrictions could be introduced in Scotland next week, the deputy first minister has warned. John Swinney says the Scottish government is ""wrestling with the challenge"" of the surge of the Omicron variant. New self-isolation rules have come into force as Scotland recorded 4,087 new Covid cases on Saturday. All household contacts of someone with the virus should now isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccination status. The new isolation rules also apply to household contacts even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Covid: Scotland facing 'tsunami' of Omicron cases What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Non-household contacts of someone with Covid are permitted to leave isolation if they have had a negative PCR test and two vaccine doses. Scientists are warning that the UK isfacing a substantial wave of Omicron infections in Januarywithout further restrictions. In an interview withBBC Breakfast, the deputy first minister said the Scottish government would spend the weekend deciding what to do next. All household contacts of someone with the virus should now isolate for 10 days Mr Swinney said: ""We are looking at whether we need to take further measures to try to arrest the circulation of the virus. We had a huge rise in cases yesterday and that suggests we have an escalating problem. ""The government is wrestling with the challenge of what are the right rules to have in place over this weekend. We will share details of any changes with parliament over the next few days."" Mr Swinney said there was a danger of the virus overwhelming public and private services, but said he hoped a restricted Christmas would not happen. He said the Scottish government was ""working very hard"" to avoid this by asking the public to reduce social interaction and take lateral flow tests. ""We are encouraging people to take these steps so that we can protect the precious time that is Christmas time for families,"" he added. ""We know how hard that was last year and we want to avoid a repeat of that."" On Saturday the total number of Omicron cases across nine of the Scotland's 14 health boards reached 121. There were 4,087 new cases of the virus, a rise on the recent daily average of about 2,800 cases. Public Health Scotland (PHS) said there was a delay in test results being reported, so the actual figures will be higher. A further 12 deaths were also confirmed following a positive test. The number of people in hospital fell slightly to 552, with 53 patients in intensive care. Omicron study suggests major wave in January People urged to cancel Christmas parties in Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the current numbers were only the ""tip of the iceberg"" with cases doubling every two to three days - the fastest growth seen during the whole pandemic. She warned a media briefing this week that there wasan oncoming ""tsunami"" of Omicron cases. PHS has urged people to cancel Christmas parties, in a move that hospitality venues said triggered ""non-stop cancellations"". Ms Sturgeon said there was a focus on these events, as the new variant posed a big risk to workplaces. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said financial compensation should be made available to affected businesses. This video can not be played Professor Linda Bauld said festive restrictions are ""a possibility"" University of Edinburgh public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said she hoped this Christmas would not be a repeat of last year. Speaking to the BBC Radio Scotland'sGood Morning Scotland, she also said more restrictions could come next week. Prof Bauld said: ""Everybody wants to avoid shutting businesses again and that would be the last resort, but clearly across the country, decision-makers have to look at the menu of options and decide what is proportionate."" She said lockdown was a last resort, but people may be asked to cut back on socialising plans. But she added: ""Isolation, loneliness and separation from loved ones is something we also want to avoid."" Meanwhile, ward 7a at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness has been closed to new admissions after a Covid outbreak. Visiting has also been stopped. NHS bosses said it was not connected to an outbreak on ward 5a of the same hospital last week. Testing will establish if it is the Omicron variant that has closed the wards. Rising case numbers are also putting pressure on other areas. ScotRail has already cancelled 60 train services due to staff shortages as a result of Covid. The operator also dropped their festive Santa Express trips on the Fife Circle line this weekend. Scientists warned on Friday thattwo doses of a Covid vaccineare not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant - although a third booster dose significantly increases protection to around 75%. Vaccines are still likely to offer good protection against severe Covid that would need hospital treatment.

"Soft plastics present complex problems to those trying to recycle them Plastic. It's everywhere these days, even in our bodies. We all know we have to use less and recycle more. Although we are all used to putting plastic containers into our recycling, what about all those tear-off film lids, bread bags and shopping bags which go into the rubbish bin? Soft, or flexible, plastic - the kind you can scrunch up in your hand - includes everything from shopping bags to clingfilm. It makes up about 15% of all material which is unable to be recycled at council facilities. In Wales, just 16% of local authorities collect some plastic film made of polyethylene (PE, commonly called polythene), the material which represents the largest volume of household flexible plastic waste at nearly 40%,according to figures from waste and recycling charity Wrap,external. Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire are two of those offering kerbside collection of some soft plastics, including shopping or bread bags and toilet paper wrapping, but not items made from multiple materials, such as crisp packets or pet food pouches. Recycling plastics does not work, says PM New meat tray 'could save tonnes of plastic waste' Others, such as Wrexham and Cardiff, offer disposal points at household waste centres, although some will handle soft plastics if it ends up in the recycling by accident. In some areas, soft plastics can only be disposed of at supermarkets. Tesco, for example,announced in August,externalshoppers could take all their soft plastic waste to its large stores - or through community recycling schemes. Zero-waste store owner Amy Greenfield wants to see plastics recycling ""simplified and standardised"" One example of this isTerracycle,external, the industry-funded scheme allowing members of the public to return plastic packaging or other items not currently included in domestic recycling to manufacturers for them to process. People earn points for recycling which can be given as cash to charities, schools or other non-profit organisations. Amy Greenfield is a director of Awesome Wales which runs zero waste shops in Cowbridge and Barry in Vale of Glamorgan and hosts Terracycle collection points. The Barry store has monthly drop-off sessions for people to bring recycling which is collected the same day by a dedicated volunteer, while the Cowbridge site has permanent bins available. Amy said: ""I think a lot of people are really confused about what they can and can't recycle."" Different brands sponsor aspects of the scheme - Walkers runs crisp packet collections and Hovis runs bread bags - other brands can be collected as well, but they have to be very similar products. Awesome Wales has lots of different containers for its Terracycle recycling efforts (l), including a crisp packet return scheme (r) ""That's why we've got so many different bins and different sections because each item has to be put in separately,"" she said. ""The main struggle for us is getting people to understand that that's important and basically our waste won't be accepted and our account will be suspended if we just send in whatever people wanted to shove in the bins. ""I think potentially it's a bit too heavily weighted to the consumer and the brands to need to make things simpler."" It would be much easier if there was more standardisation of packaging, according to Amy, with fewer types of plastic used for food packaging and a cut in multi-material products, which are harder to recycle. ""It needs to be simpler, it needs to be kerbside, it needs to be standardised and I think the industry isn't going to do that voluntarily so that's going to require legislation and coordination with local and national government to make sure that happens."" Climate change minister Julie James wants producers to take on responsibility for plastic waste Wales' first Climate Change Minister Julie James is in agreement that the burden of responsibility for managing soft plastics needs to lie with the manufacturers rather than the taxpayer. She said: ""It's a two-pronged approach. We do want to see facilities to recycle soft plastics but our primary push is on trying to stop them. ""We're going to be introducing a 'polluter pays' principle tax on the producers of it,"" with April as a target, depending on legislative programme issues. She gave the example of soft film coverings for food products being swapped for a hard plastic lid that can be put back on, as these are easier to recycle, or a switch to something made from cellulose, which is compostable. ""We will be encouraging councils to start collecting [soft plastics]. ""There is an issue with kerbside collections about the [refuse] vehicles and how much separate stuff they can actually pick up and, frankly, in many people's houses how many bins you can have exactly?"" Bins like this one in the Co-op accept soft plastic from customers for recycling Her department has been having ""long conversations"" with the supermarkets - which the minister calls the biggest procurers of plastic-using products - about giving people more choice. This includes letting people bring their own containers and filling up themselves, in a much larger version of the zero-waste stores run by people like Amy. ""So it's a combination again. A variable fee, a fine on some products in order to try and get rid of them, and a behaviour change campaign [among the public] at the same time,"" she said. There have been discussions looking at opening regional material recycling facilities (known as murfs) which fall into two types: Clean - recycled materials which are then sorted - and dirty- where general black bag waste is taken and separated. This video can not be played Ever wondered where your recycling goes after it's collected, or why you have to clean it or separate it first? Ms James said: ""There is some possibility that if we had reprocessing purpose for them, we could just let people put all their plastics into one bag and just separate them out at the regional facility. ""If we could centre that at a circular economy point, so somewhere that's generating electricity, near one of our anaerobic digesters because all our food waste goes there and is turned into electricity, if the fleet was electric and being fuelled by the recycling facility, it's a lot more viable."" She also said Wales would move to a system of mandatory labelling on what can and cannot be recycled as "" lot of consumers are really annoyed"". ""At the moment [with the numbered triangles on packaging] most people think 'that must be recyclable' and put it in, but some of the numbers mean not in the UK, or only in one place in the world."" One of the unintended consequences of a push to reduce plastic use by suppliers could mean making it harder to recycle those that are left, by not having enough to make reprocessing plants commercially viable. Ms James explained that when food waste recycling was introduced in Wales, ministers had to guess how much processing capacity to allow for in order to guaranteedigestor plants,externala certain income. It turned out people's behaviour altered much more quickly than expected and they stopped producing so much food waste once they could see the volume with their own eyes, meaning the government now pays slightly more in fees because there is less volume than anticipated going through the plants. How recycling is collected can affect what can be accepted and what is thrown away Waste and recycling charity Wrap recently ran a 12-week pilot scheme to trial soft plastic kerbside collection in a number of south Wales council areas. Emma Hallett, from Wrap Cymru's collaborative change programme, said: ""In order to collect them effectively we need to ensure they're kept separate from other types of materials so they can be recycled, and also that they don't contaminate the other materials being collected."" The trial helped them understand the type and amount of materials people would put out and how to ensure that, if collection services were offered, materials could be properly collected and recycled. ""It's vital that people put out materials that the council's looking for because the processes that will be followed for recycling will only work with certain types of material,"" said Emma. ""Although to most people plastic film and wrapping bags might appear to be similar, there are actually a lot of different types of polymers that are used in the manufacture of materials and so each one may need a different treatment according to what it's made of and how it can be recycled."" One of the issues, as Ms James touched on, is that existing collection lorries in council areas that collect recycling in separated containers do not have a section for soft plastics to go in. Meanwhile, in places where recycling is all collected in one bag or bin - adding soft plastics which cannot be easily separated into the mix risks either contaminating other recycled goods or causing snarl-ups in automated sorting centres' machinery. The pizza box dilemma: How to avoid wishcycling Where the UK's recycling really goes Wales 'could lead' in plastics recycling However, this has not deterred other places from doing just that - in September the Republic of Irelandintroduced soft plastics into its domestic collections,external. People there are able to add bags and other plastic wrappings to their existing dry recyclables bin, providing all material is clean and dry. The Irish government's Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications said less than a third of plastic waste packaging was recycled in the country, but it had committed to meeting European Union targets of 50% by 2025 and 55% by 2030. It added: ""There have been advancements in packaging design and investment in recycling technology. This allows segregation of different material types in recycling facilities in Ireland."" Plastics are now brought to recovery facilities and separated out before being sent to specialised, polymer-specific recycling plants. Any that cannot be recycled are sent as solid fuel to replace fossil fuels at cement kilns. ""Plastic in many cases is better than other alternatives"" says waste expert Rebecca Colley-Jones Rebecca Colley-Jones is the circular economy manager for the Polyolefins Circular Economy Platform (PCEP), a network for all parts of the plastic production and user chain, and a Welsh council member for the Chartered Institute of Waste Management. ""The industry has identified that there is work that needs to be done, that they need to invest not just money but time in developing solutions for these problems,"" she said. ""For example, there's a number of projects looking at digital water marking for plastics that have been printed, and things like AI [artificial intelligence] is being trialled at plants. ""So that means when the material is captured, more of it can be sorted and go to recycling avenues."" She said there was already a big shift towards using single-material products to enable easier recycling, but added that packaging was ""there for a reason"", such as providing a seal to make food last longer. ""When you look at the carbon savings improved by having the packaging... it's quite a lot."" She said industry members were ""desperate"" to be able to recover soft plastics, adding: ""They don't want it to go for incineration. They want it to be captured separately, be able to be identified and go back into the system."" Although plastic has definitely had a lot of bad press, rightly at times, it does have a place, Rebecca stressed. ""It's a durable, flexible material and as long as it's captured and put back into use it's not a worse material and in many cases is a better material than other alternatives.""

"Laura Shepard Churchley's (left) father became the first US astronaut in space in 1961 The daughter of the first US astronaut, Alan Shepard, has blasted into space - 60 years after her father's flight. Laura Shepard Churchley, 74, was one of six people to make the trip onboard a commercial spacecraft launched by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space company. The passengers were briefly able to experience zero gravity on the sub-orbital flight. The flight was the third launched by Blue Origin in 2021 as it seeks to capture the space tourism market. Ms Shepard Churchley's father, who died in 1998, became the first American in space after his Mercury flight took off from Florida's Cape Canaveral on 5 May 1961. Former NFL star and Good Morning America anchor Michael Strahan was also on Saturday's flight as well as four other paying customers. It marked the first time that Blue Origin had filled all six seats on its New Shepard rocket, which is named after the astronaut. Having been delayed for two days by fierce winds, the flight finally blasted off from the company's launch facility near the rural town of Van Horn, Texas. The flight followed a similar path to previous rockets launched by the company, before landing in the Texas desert where the tourists were greeted by Mr Bezos. Lasting for just over 10 minutes and reaching an altitude of around 62 miles (100km), it was five minutes and 116 miles shorter than Alan Shepard's inaugural flight. His daughter brought along a small piece of his capsule, as well as some mementosfrom his later trip to the lunar surfaceaboard Apollo 14 in 1971. ""I thought about Daddy coming down and thought, gosh he didn't even get to enjoy any of what I'm getting to enjoy,"" Ms Shepard Churchley said. ""He was working. He had to do it himself.

"A man in a Santa Claus suit (file image) A Roman Catholic diocese in Sicily has apologised to parents after its bishop reportedly told a group of children that Santa Claus did not exist. At a religious event last week, Bishop Antonio StaglianÃ² also said Santa's red costume had been chosen by Coca-Cola for publicity, Italian media report. The comments infuriated parents. In an apology, Rev Alessandro Paolino, from the diocese of Noto, said the bishop had tried to underline the true meaning of Christmas. He also said the comments had been aimed at highlighting the story of Saint Nicholas, the initial inspiration for the figure of Santa Claus and known for giving gifts to the poor. ""First of all, on behalf of the bishop, I express my sorrow for this declaration, which has created disappointment in the little ones, and want to specify that Monsignor Stagliano's intentions were quite different,"" Rev Paolino said in a post on the diocesan Facebook page. Rev Paolino, who is the communications director for the diocese of Noto, said the bishop had wanted the children to ""reflect about the meaning of Christmas"", saying that the date had become known for consumerism. ""If we can all draw a lesson, young or old, from the figure of Santa Claus... it is this: fewer gifts to 'create' and 'consume' and more 'gifts' to share,"" the statement said. In an interview with newspaper La Repubblica, the bishop said he had not told the children that Santa did not exist but that there was a need to ""distinguish what is real from what is not"".
