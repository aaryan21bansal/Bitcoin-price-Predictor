"Steve McClaren's last game in charge of Derby County was a 3-0 defeat away to Brighton Steve McClaren has been sacked as Derby County manager for a second time, five months after he was reappointed. Derby, 10th in the Championship, said they acted following a ""significant, unexpected and persistent decline in results, team unity and morale"". Rams chairman Mel Morris said:,external""We need a manager who shares our values and who is prepared to develop the team."" The club said they expect to make an announcement in relation to McClaren's successor ""in the next few days"". Assistant manager Chris Powell and technical director Chris Evans have also left. Former England boss McClaren, 55, was reappointed by Derby in October 2016, 17 months after he was sacked. He returned to replace Nigel Pearson, who left by mutual consent after less than five months. Derby lost 3-0 away to second-placed Brighton on Friday and are 10 points off the play-off places. ""The Brighton game was so far from what we expect to see from those wearing a Derby County shirt,"" added Morris. ""To ensure we are on the right path, it is important to put the building blocks in place so we can develop a team we can all be proud of."" McClaren was in charge for 26 Championship games during his second spell at Derby, winning 12 and losing eight. Derby have won just one of the past nine league games. They first appointed McClaren in September 2013 on a two-and-a-half-year deal aftersacking Nigel Clough. His contract wasterminated in May 2015following ""a thorough review of the 2014-15 season"". In between his spells at Derby, McClaren managed Newcastle between June 2015 and March 2016, when he was sacked. BBC Radio 5 live's Pat Murphy So the Derby players escape responsibility while the manager who has been at the club five months carries the can. Steve McClaren had an immediate effect last autumn, taking the club out of the bottom four and impressing with his acknowledged coaching skill, but the players shrivelled in the face of promotion expectations. McClaren had set in place a major overhaul of the dressing room this summer, aware that he had been undermined by some malcontents speaking to club owner Mel Morris, a micro-manager who demands success and is not known for his patience - four managers in just over a year testify to that. But it is his club, his Â£100m-plus investment, and he will run it his way.

"This video can not be played Adcocks match point away from win, lose dramatically Chris and Gabby Adcock missed out on becoming Britain's first All England Badminton Championship finalists for a decade with an agonising defeat by China's Lu Kai and Huang Yaqiong. They held match point in the third set of their mixed doubles semi-final, but Chris Adcock suffered a broken string and they eventually lost it 22-20. The Adcocks had taken the opening set 21-19, but lost the second 21-12. ""It's so tough to have been so close,"" Gabby Adcock told BBC Sport. ""We were quite a way down in the third set and fought back up to get the match point and then for that to happen to Chris is really, really unlucky."" The Commonwealth champions - who also reached last year's semi-finals - were bidding to become the first British finalists in the event since Anthony Clark and Donna Kellogg in 2007. Their defeat comes just weeks afterBritish Badminton failed to overturn UK Sport's Olympic funding cut. Badminton England's chief executive Adrian Christy said on Thursday that the loss of around Â£1.25m per year in financial support would mean players and staff would now have to leave the programme. ""As you can imagine the atmosphere has been a bit flat at our training centre with the situation and it's a sad time for badminton,"" said Gabby Adcock. Badminton England hopes to raise around Â£600,000 per year in order to help provide some funding support to the Adcocks and Olympic bronze medal-winning pair Chris Langridge and Marcus Ellis. ""It's been a tough patch, but we've shown how resilient we can be on and off the court,"" Chris Adcock told BBC Sport. ""We really believe we've still got the ability to win majors as well as world and Olympic medals so we'll fight through and no doubt we'll be able to prove a lot of people wrong.""
