"The government has released an assessment of the possible effects of a no-deal Brexit on the UK, after MPs demanded that it be made public. The document, marked as ""Official Sensitive"" and dated 2 August 2019,outlines a series of ""reasonable worst-case planning assumptions"". It was drawn up as part of ""Operation Yellowhammer"" - the name for the government's contingency plan to prepare for leaving the European Union (EU) without a deal. The government says it is spending an extra Â£2.1bn on no-deal planning and is updating these planning assumptions. So, what does the document say and what is being done - as far as we know - to prepare for no-deal? What Yellowhammer document says: Between 50-85% of UK lorries travelling to the EU may not be ready for French customs Lack of readiness and limited space in French ports could cut HGV traffic by 40-60% and lead to disruption lasting three months This would lead to significant queues in Kent. In a worst-case scenario, it could take lorries up to two-and-a-half days before being able to cross into France What's being done: To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The Port of Dover in Kent handles approximately 10,500 lorries a day. To prevent nearby roads from clogging up, the government has a traffic management plan codenamed Operation Brock. If the plan is activated, up to 2,000 lorries will be held in a queue leading to the port. Other traffic will be kept flowing around the queued-up lorries, in what is known as a contraflow system. A fallback option would be to divert lorries to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time. If further capacity was still required, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile  M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. But there is a still a lot of confusion, according to Rona Hunnisett, from the Freight Transport Association. ""The report shows there's still significant detail to be clarified if Britain is to keep trading efficiently,"" she says. ""Businesses can only prepare for, and implement, new processes once, and still need confirmation of what they are to adopt in the way of new practices."" What Yellowhammer document says: Certain types of fresh food supply will decrease Key ingredients may be in shorter supply There will not be an overall shortage of food in the UK, but may be reduced availability and choice Prices may increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" What's being done: The government has said that it will continue to recognise EU standards for food being imported into the UK, to minimise disruption. The British Retail Consortium has said,externalretailers are doing all they can to prepare for no-deal, but will not be able to prevent all negative effects. It stresses that many fresh fruits and vegetables will be out of season in the UK and that there will be a shortage of warehouse space ahead of Christmas. ""No deal Brexit would be extremely disruptive to the supply chains that we operate, particularly the fresh food supply chains,"" Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's told BBC News. ""There will inevitably be disruption simply because we've never done this before,"" he added, although he also said that previous delays to the Brexit date mean ""there's probably more understanding of what could go wrong and therefore more contingency planning"". Another factor is what tariffs (the taxes on imports) will be charged on food coming into the UK. The governmentpublished a ""tariff schedule"",externalin March, which removed most tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit That means some food from outside the EU that currently attract a tariff could be cheaper, but some goods from the EU that are currently imported with 0% tariffs, like beef and dairy, will now carry tariffs, and so could become more expensive. What Yellowhammer document says: Supply chains for medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at the Channel ports While some products can be stockpiled, others cannot because they have a short shelf life It will not be practical to stockpile products to cover expected delays of up to six months An increase in inflation would ""significantly impact"" adult social care providers and may lead to some failing, with smaller providers impacted within two-three months. What's being done: At the end of June, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) started putting out contracts for freight, warehouse space and fridges. These will be used to stockpile medicines and fly in those which cannot be stored, like radioisotopes for cancer treatment. Of the Â£2.1bn pledged for no-deal preparations, Â£434m has been set aside for this. That includes a Â£25m contract for planes to bring in emergency medical supplies within 24 hours. Ahead of the UK's original departure date of 29 March - then extended to 12 April - the DHSC said thousands of medicines had been analysed to work out what might be affected by supply disruption from the EU. Suppliers stockpiled an additional six weeks' worth of these drugs over and above the usual ""buffer"" stock. This exercise is being repeated to ensure the department is ""as prepared for leaving the EU without a deal in October as it was on 29 March and 12 April"". Specific ferry routes were made available for suppliers to book onto 11 weeks before the no-deal deadline in March. Six weeks before the 31 October deadline, the government had only just opened the bidding process to freight firms competing to transport medicines. So the pharmaceutical industry doesn't currently know which ports and ferry routes will be made available. Steve Bates, an industry official working with government on no-deal planning, said the time frame to make sure everything was in place for the October deadline was ""significantly compressed"". He said the difference for drug suppliers between three months and potentially three weeks to put plans into action was ""material"". On social care, the government website advises providers to draw up contingency plans and support EU staff who may be working for them. Plans are in place to ensure there are enough essential medicines like insulin What Yellowhammer document says: There will be no immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies However, there are likely to be significant price rises if the UK splits from the EU single energy market, which could happen months or years after Brexit This could lead to some energy companies leaving the market Public water supplies are likely to remain largely unaffected What's being done: In the event of no-deal, the UK has said it will not impose tariffs on electricity and gas coming into the country. However, if the value of the pound falls in response to a no-deal Brexit, it will become more expensive to import energy from abroad. The government intends to remain part of the single energy market, in order for the UK's energy laws to continue to work after Brexit and that supplies are not disrupted. Water is unlikely to be affected, although there is still a low risk in the event of a chemical supply problem. The Yellowhammer report says water companies are well-prepared and have significant stockpiles of critical chemicals. What Yellowhammer document says: The government's planned short-term solution for the border is likely to be unsustainable because of the ""economic, legal and biosecurity risks"" it presents Trade between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic will be ""severely disrupted"" Some businesses will stop trading, some will move and some will experience higher costs that they may pass on to customers Agriculture will be hardest hit, leading to job losses, protests and direct action with road blockages Growth of the ""illegitimate economy"" around the border ""where criminal and dissident groups already operate"" What's being done: The UK government has said it is committed not to have any physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. On 13 Marchit published its contingency plan,externalto avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It said it would not bring in new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for any goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland, in the event of no-deal. But this will only be a temporary measure while negotiations take place to find longer-term solutions. Government has no plans for Irish border controls To protect people's health, some plant and animal products that come into Northern Ireland from outside the EU, via Ireland, will still need to be checked. The UK government has said these checks will not happen at the border itself, but it has not specified exactly where they will take place. It remains unclear what will happen to goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland. Under EU rules, checks would normally be required at the point certain goods enter the EU single market. The Irish government says it is securing additional space, and has recruited more customs and agriculture staff to allow for a ""significant increase in checks and procedures"". What Yellowhammer document says: Protests and counter-protests likely across the UK May be a rise in public disorder and community tensions Information-sharing between UK and EU law enforcement will be disrupted What is being done: The National Police Coordination Centre will plan the allocation of officers across the country althoughit has said there has been no intelligence,externalto suggest that any protests will not be peaceful. The government has also established the International Crime and Coordination Centre, which is supposed to help the police cope with the change to the UK's relationship with law enforcement agencies in the EU. 10 ways you could be affected by no deal Most imports tariff-free under no-deal plan What could happen to food prices after Brexit?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he did not lie to the Queen Boris Johnson has denied lying to the Queen over the advice he gave her over the five-week suspension of Parliament. The prime minister was speaking after Scotland's highest civil court ruled on Wednesday the shutdown was unlawful. Asked whether he had lied to the monarch about his reasons for the suspension, he replied: ""Absolutely not."" He added: ""The High Court in England plainly agrees with us, but the Supreme Court will have to decide."" The power to suspend - or prorogue - Parliament lies with the Queen, who conventionally acts on the advice of the prime minister. The current five-week suspension began in the early hours of Tuesday, and MPs are not scheduled to return until 14 October. Labour has said it is ""more important than ever"" that Parliament is recalled after the government published theYellowhammer document,external, an assessment of a reasonable worst-case scenario in the event of a no-deal Brexit. What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal Brexit? Vets concerned over animal medicines in no-deal Recall urged after no-deal Brexit papers released Bercow warns PM against disobeying Brexit law Meanwhile, the EU has said it is willing to revisit the proposal of a Northern Ireland-only backstop to break the Brexit deadlock, despite Mr Johnson ruling this out. The President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, said there would be no agreement without a backstop - which aims to avoid a hard Irish border after Brexit - in some form. But the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier told MEPs that the ""situation in the UK remains serious and uncertain"", saying: ""We do not have reasons to be optimistic"". He also warned the UK could still leave without a deal, despite Parliament introducing a law to avoid the scenario. The Yellowhammer document - published on Wednesday after MPs forced its release - warned of food and fuel shortages in a no-deal scenario. But Mr Johnson insisted the UK ""will be ready"" to leave the EU by the current 31 October deadline without an agreement ""if we have to"". ""What you're looking at here is just the sensible preparations - the worst-case scenario - that you'd expect any government to do,"" he said. ""In reality we will certainly be ready for a no-deal Brexit if we have to do it and I stress again that's not where we intend to end up."" But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he was ""angry"" that MPs would not be able to debate the planning document during the suspension. Judges rule Parliament suspension is unlawful EU 'willing to revisit NI-only backstop' If you had a usual prime minister who'd been accused overnight of misleading MPs, of breaking the law, having been forced to publish a government report warning of riots and food shortages and telling porkies to the Queen; you would imagine they would emerge a broken, humbled, crushed individual. Not so Boris Johnson. He emerged characteristically brimming with optimism and confidence. No deal? He insisted he had got in place the necessary preparations to avoid the sort of dire scenarios forecast. An agreement with the EU? Yes he was hopeful of getting an agreement. And telling lies to the Queen? Absolutely not. But the difficulty is optimism and confidence only get you so far. MPs want details. They want details about what he's actually doing to avoid the grim no-deal forecast and what he's doing to get an arrangement with the EU And they want details - or the truth - about why he chose to prorogue Parliament. Which means if the judges decide on Tuesday that Parliament should be recalled then I suspect Boris Johnson's going to need an awful lot more than bullish bravado. In a unanimous ruling on Wednesday, the Court of Session in Edinburgh said Mr Johnson's decision to order the suspension was motivated by the ""improper purpose of stymieing Parliament"". It came after a legal challenge launched by more than 70 largely pro-Remain MPs and peers, headed by SNP MP Joanna Cherry. This video can not be played The court ruled the prorogation was unlawful due to the PM's advice But a ruling last week from the High Court in London had dismissed a similar challenge brought by businesswoman and campaigner Gina Miller. In theirrejection of her claim, the judges argued the suspension of Parliament was a ""purely political"" move and was therefore ""not a matter for the courts"". Mr Johnson has suggested it was ""nonsense"" to suggest the move was an attempt to undermine democracy, insisting it is normal practice for a new PM. Prorogation normally takes place every year, but the length and timing of the current suspension - in the run-up to Brexit - has attracted controversy. Opposition parties have accused the prime minister of ordering it to prevent criticism of its Brexit strategy and contingency plans for a no-deal exit. They backed a move to order the release of communications between No 10 aides about the decision to order the suspension. But the government has blocked their release, saying the request to see e-mails, texts and WhatsApp messages from Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's chief aide, and eight other advisers in Downing Street was ""unreasonable and disproportionate"". Queues at ports are among the no-deal consequences explored by the government The Yellowhammer file, which is redacted in parts and almost identical to a versionleaked to the Sunday Times last month, says in a reasonable worst-case scenario a no-deal Brexit could lead to: a ""decrease"" in certain types of fresh food and ""shorter supply"" of key ingredients price rises for food and fuel, which would ""disproportionately"" affect those with low incomes ""disruption lasting up to six months"" potentially affecting medicines and medical supplies protests and counter-protests across the UK lorries waiting for more than two days to cross the English Channel The document also says some businesses could cease trading, and the black market could grow in response to disruption along the UK's border with Ireland. ""This will be particularly severe in border communities, where both criminal and dissident groups already operate with greater threat and impunity,"" it added. It alsoraised the prospectof ""protests and direct action"" in Northern Ireland as a result of disruption to key sectors. Michael Gove, the cabinet minister with responsibility for no-deal planning, told the BBC the government had taken ""considerable steps"" to ensure the safest possible departure after a no-deal Brexit in the six weeks since 2 August, the date which appears on the document. On Wednesday, he said ""revised assumptions"" will be published ""in due course alongside a document outlining the mitigations the government has put in place and intends to put in place"".

"Vets say they are worried about potential problems in the availability of some animal medicines in the case of a no-deal Brexit. The British Veterinary Association said it had concerns over short-shelf life products, such as vaccines. And it urged any pet owners who are worried to speak to their vet. The government said it was ""working closely with the industry on extensive contingency planning to ensure there is no disruption"". It comes after the government published ano-deal Brexit assessment,,externalwhich included warning of possible disruption to medicines for veterinary use. Such disruption would have ""potential detrimental impacts"" for animal welfare, as well as for diseases which are spread between animals and humans, the document said. Most of the veterinary medicines used in the UK are either produced in or enter via the EU, according to industry body the National Office of Animal Health (NOAH). The government has confirmed that animal medicines are classedas ""category 1"" goods,which would be prioritised if there was disruption at the border after a no-deal Brexit. No-deal Brexit papers warn of shortages and riots Reality Check: Are pet passports under threat? Pet travel warning in no-deal Brexit plan Simon Doherty, the president of the BVA, said there were concerns over how lorry delays at ferry ports could affect short shelf-life medicines. ""Where we have products which are short shelf-life products, you need the supply chain to be maintained on a pretty constant basis,"" he told the BBC. ""Most vaccines have to be kept in a refrigerator. ""If we run into a situation where there was a sustained part of time where a lot of animals weren't vaccinated we could have more substantial problems and losses in the industry. ""Where there is specific issues is around use of a lot of product at a specific time. We use a lot of anaesthetic in the springtime, we would be lambing, calving, dehorning calves."" Dr Sophie Aylett, who owns an independent farm animal vet practice in the Midlands with her husband, believes similar problems could arise in autumn - the time when the UK is due to leave the EU. ""We are approaching autumn and vaccine booster times,"" she said. ""In late autumn, farms start to bring cattle into sheds to avoid the worst of the winter weather. ""By necessity this increases stocking density and cow to cow contact, therefore creating a higher risk of infectious disease transmission such as pneumonia. Normally farmers can vaccinate at-risk animals in advance but if there is a delay, it could affect their ability to do so, and consequently adversely affect animal welfare."" And it is not just farmers who should be concerned about no deal, according to Mr Doherty, who said it could affect animals ""across the board"" - including zoo animals and pets. ""It's not as if there will be sudden parvovirus outbreaks in dogs. But where there could be potential problems, is if there isn't a supply of vaccines for an animal to get its booster at a particular time."" He does not anticipate there will be a shortage of cat and dog medicines, but the advice to pet owners would be to speak to their vet if they are concerned. Meanwhile, for pets undergoing longer-term treatment, he added: ""Don't leave the next prescription until you have got one tablet left."" A spokesman for the government's Veterinary Medicines Directorate said ""veterinary medicines will continue to be readily available when we leave the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances of our exit"". They will be given priority on government freight to avoid disruption to supply, he said. The government is also working with the industry to increase stocks of medicines, change supply routes and ensure they have early warning about potential issues with the supply chain. NOAH said its industry has been working on detailed planning for all Brexit scenarios. But if there was a no-deal Brexit, there are broader issues which could affect the availability of vet medicines, it said. It also raised concerns about vaccines. ""This disruption does represent a potential risk to controlling disease and an animal welfare issue. ""If preventative medicines such as vaccines are not available, there is a greater risk of disease in the population. This could increase the risk of its spread, including the spread of zoonotic infections."" The president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, Dr Niall Connell, said: ""As the released Operation Yellowhammer documents demonstrate, any interruption in the supply of veterinary medicines would be a threat to animal health and welfare and public health."" The RCVS also said it was concerned that a no-deal could be a risk to the veterinary workforce, with half of new vets recruited from elsewhere in the EU each year.

"This video can not be played Why do some tumble dryers catch fire? Some 65,000 fire-prone tumble dryers have been found during a recall campaign by Whirlpool, but hundreds of thousands still remain in UK homes. The manufacturer extended its safety programme to offer free replacements in July after the regulator stepped in, four years after the issue emerged. Dangerous dryers under the Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan and Proline brands were sold in the UK for 11 years. Up to 800,000 were estimated to still be in use when the full recall began. The danger in our homes: the full story Machines were blamed for at least 750 fires over an 11-year period, the government has said. The fires have burnt out homes and destroyed possessions of victims - some of whom had no insurance. Before the recall, Whirlpool primarily offered to modify affected dryers - a decision widely criticised by consumer and safety groups and which itself has led to concern over the safety ofsupposedly fixed machines. Anyone who thinks they bought a potentially dangerous dryer should call 0800 151 0905 or visita dedicated website,externalto check if their dryer is affected. If it is on the recall list, they should stop using it and unplug it immediately. They can then choose: A free replacement dryer with no extra charges for collection or disposal of the old machine A free, one-hour modification of the old machine A discounted upgrade to a higher specification model than the free replacement A partial refund of up to Â£150, with owners of older machines getting less than those with newer ones Since the start of the recall 65,000 affected dryers have been located, offers for a resolution have been made on 63,000 of them, with 42,000 of them having been repaired, replaced or refunded so far. The damage caused by a dryer to a flat in Shepherd's Bush, London Whirlpool said it took a week, on average, for customers to receive a new dryer, modification, or refund from the point they make their choice. The majority (73%) had requested a replacement, the company said. ""Nothing matters more to us than people's safety, so it is absolutely vital that we can identify where these affected dryers are and resolve the issue,"" said Jeff Noel, Whirlpool vice-president. Engineer Mark Garner and his wife Deborah owned an affected dryer and were eventually given a replacement, marked with a green sticker to identify it as safe. Then, one day, Deborah, who was in the kitchen near the dryer, smelt smoke and when she opened the dryer door she was met with a cloud of black smoke and could clearly see flames at the back of the dryer. ""The truly scary part is that, assuming this was a safe machine, it had been turned on the previous night as we went to bed,"" said Mark. Mark Garner says he was unhappy with the safety of Whirlpool dryers They were offered a replacement machine for Â£99 but were so unhappy with the situation they chose a refund instead. A letter arrived, with a cheque for Â£220 enclosed. The trouble was, the cheque was unsigned. A signed cheque eventually arrived, two months after the incident, but only after calls to Whirlpool chasing them up for the money. Whirlpool said the number of owners with affected machines who had contacted the company since July amid a huge awareness campaign had risen sharply from fewer than 10,000 throughout the first half of the year. It said its campaign over the past four years had resolved the issue for more than 1.7 million people, making it up to five times more successful than a typical product recall. However, high-profile critics said that Whirlpool, as the owner of these brands, had a responsibility to deal with the situation adequately. Their initial response had been described as ""woeful"". Rachel Reeves, who chairs the influential Business Committee of MPs, told the BBC that - despite an improvement in Whirlpool's handling of the case - concerns remained. She said that the committee was worried about the number of potentially dangerous machines that remained in people's homes, and that the modification process was ""not as good as it should be"", with reports of supposedly safe dryers still catching fire - something which Whirlpool denies. It also wants policing of thesecond-hand marketof white goods to be improved. She added that the wider concerns were not helped by the lack of a fully independent product safety regulator.

"Sainsbury's has become the latest supermarket to target packaging waste, pledging to halve the amount of plastic used in its stores by 2025. Its customers will have to change their behaviour to achieve the ""bold ambition"" it said, for example by buying milk in plastic pouches. It is also inviting the public and business partners to submit new ideas. ""Reducing plastic and packaging is not easy,"" said Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive. ""We can't do this on our own and we will be asking our suppliers and our customers to work with us."" Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing? MPssaid this week,externalreducing packaging should be the priority for retailers, rather than replacing plastic with compostable or recyclable alternatives. The infrastructure is not in place in the UK to dispose of compostable or biodegradable materials effectively, parliament's committee for environment, food and rural affairs found. The committee said wider environmental considerations also needed to be taken into account when replacing plastic packaging, including its carbon footprint. On Friday, Sainsbury's is meeting with food manufacturers, packaging suppliers, material scientists and the waste and recycling industry to kick-start the process of identifying new solutions. However the supermarket said it was already rolling out some measures, including removing all plastic bags from its fruit and veg sections by the end of this month. Instead customers will be invited to bring their own bags, buy reusable bags made from recycled plastic bottles, or put a price sticker onto loose items. Sainsbury's will sell reusable bags for fresh produce The supermarket considered introducing paper bags, but spokeswoman, Rebecca Reilly said the net impact would have been worse for the environment. ""There's the deforestation link, and they are heavier and bulkier [than plastic]. They take up space in transport, so there are knock-on carbon emissions,"" she said. Sainsbury's will encourage customers to bring their own containers for products from shampoo to raw meat and fish, and will sell more products loose by weight, something Waitrose began trialling earlier this year. In many areas it was a question of reducing plastic rather than eliminating it, suggested Ms Reilly. For example milk might be sold in pouches, using less plastic than the current bottles. But Helen Bird from packaging campaign group, Wrap, said plastic milk bottles were one of the items being widely recycled in the UK. Plastic pouches aren't currently recyclable, she said, although they would probably produce lower carbon emissions. But she praised the scale of Sainsbury's ambition and said accepting that it did not yet have all the answers was a sensible approach to the challenge ahead. ""We need to not take decisions like this lightly,"" she said. ""To achieve this they'll need significant levels of innovation. ""They'll also require suppliers to come to them with fresh business models for how they can deliver products to customers in a way that will not have a significant effect on prices as well as carbon and food waste implications.""

"This video can not be played Ryanair and Aer Lingus are cutting some routes to and from Belfast airports Two airlines are cutting routes at both Belfast International and Belfast City airports. Ryanair is understood to have reduced a number of services at Aldergrove this winter. Meanwhile, Aer Lingus has confirmed it will no longer be offering two routes at Belfast City Airport from next summer. The Belfast airports have both expressed their disappointment at the flight cuts. Climate change: Should you fly, drive or take the train? The UK's 'worst' airport revealed From November, it will no longer be possible to book Ryanair flights between Belfast and Berlin, Manchester and Lanzarote. BBC News NI has seen emails sent from Ryanair to customers cancelling flights to Manchester in which it said ""Ryanair regrets that following a commercial review"" certain flights will cease operation from 6 November. When it announced its winter schedule, the carrier said these routes would continue to be operated. Belfast International said it was ""extremely disappointed"" at the further reduction in services In March, Ryanair said it was dropping routes to Poland and Malta from Belfast International, while alsoreducing the number of flights it operates to London Stansted and Manchester. The carrier said this was due to the ""weak UK market"" and UK Air Passenger Duty (APD). APD is a tax levied on air passengers, which varies according to destination and class of travel. Speaking to BBC News NI, the DUP's South Antrim MP Paul Girvan said that APD special conditions for Northern Ireland were a ""major ask"" as part of the confidence and supply agreement with the Conservative Party. ""We are competing directly with Dublin. No other airport in the UK is competing on that basis,"" said Mr Girvan. Belfast International Airport is in Paul Girvan's South Antrim constituency ""One of our major asks is to have that money for our airport and to allow us as a country to compete with Dublin."" A spokesperson for Belfast International said it was ""extremely disappointed"" at the further reduction in service. The airport said it again highlights the disadvantage posed by APD, which it said is ""denying Northern Ireland passengers destination choice"". ""There remains a strong market demand for direct air services to those destinations which will no longer be served by Ryanair,"" the spokesperson said. ""We have already secured some additional capacity to the Canary Islands and will continue to work with our airline partners to replace lost services."" In July, Ryanair said a number of loss-making bases will be cut or closed this winter due tothe late delivery of the Boeing MAX aircraft. When contacted about the route reductions at Belfast International, Ryanair said: ""As announced on 16 July, due to the late delivery of up to 30 Boeing MAX aircraft, a number of loss-making Ryanair bases will be cut or closed this winter. ""We are working hard to minimise the impact on our customers and our people, and to continue as many routes as possible, which will be served by flights from other bases."" But it declined to comment specifically on Belfast. Aer Lingus is cutting routes from Belfast City airport to Malaga and Faro Meanwhile, Aer Lingus said it will no longer operate services from Belfast City to Faro and Malaga during summer 2020 following a ""commercial review"". ""Aer Lingus remains committed to Belfast City and continues to operate a high frequency daily service between Belfast City and London Heathrow."" The airport said it is disappointed at the decision. ""While this news will come as a disappointment to the thousands of passengers that filled the Faro and Malaga flights during the summer months, the airport will continue to work closely with Aer Lingus and IAG to explore other international routes.""

"The first minister and health secretary have both expressed their frustration at the latest delay to the new hospital Nicola Sturgeon has said she ""deeply regrets"" that Edinburgh's new children's hospital will not open for at least another year. The first minister was speaking at Holyrood as opposition parties called for ""heads to roll"" over the delay. The hospital was supposed to open in 2017 - but will now not be ready until next autumn at the earliest. The Tories said the project was a ""shambles"" and accused the government of ""burying its head in the sand"". And Labour called for a public inquiry into what has gone wrong with the construction project, which has been hit by a series of delays and cost increases over the years. Staff and patients were preparing to move into the new Â£150m Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in July when last-minute inspections found serious problems with the ventilation system in the facility's critical care unit. Children's hospital delayed until autumn next year Freeman 'overruled' opening of sick kids hospital A report published on Wednesday said Â£16m of repairs were needed to fix the ventilation and other issues that had been identified, with the work expected to take at least a year. At first minister's questions on Thursday, Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw criticised the ""absolute shambles"" surrounding the new hospital. And he accused Health Secretary Jeane Freeman of doing ""too little, too late"" to address the problems with the project. Staff and patients were preparing to move into the new hospital in July when problems with its ventilation system were found Mr Carlaw said: ""The Sick Kids' Hospital is just 10 minutes' drive from where we all are now and yet it seems that four successive health ministers chose either not to know or simply failed to ask about the full extent of the problems faced until way, way too late. ""This is a saga from which nobody emerges well. Not the health board, not the contractor and certainly not this government - and it's altogether sadly too predictable. ""I think the country thinks - for once - heads should roll."" Ms Sturgeon said it would be an ""understatement"" to say she and Ms Freeman were angry about the ""unacceptable"" situation at the hospital, and insisted the government's focus was on ""putting this right"". But she said the hospital would not be allowed to open until it was fully safe for patients. Ms Sturgeon said the two reports released on Wednesday showed that the ventilation issue that had caused the latest delay did not come to light until the start of July. Staff were preparing to leave the old Sick Kids hospital when the latest problems with the new building were found The first minister said: ""I didn't know about that, the senior management in the health board - as far as I'm aware - didn't know about that and the health secretary didn't know about that. ""As soon as that came to light, the health secretary acted properly and appropriately. ""It would have been wrong to allow that hospital to open before assurances about patient safety could have been given."" Ms Sturgeon added: ""I deeply regret that the hospital will be opening late - extremely late - and it is important that we make sure that every issue that has been identified is addressed so that when it does open it is safe for the patients who use that hospital."" The Royal Hospital for Children and Young People will have 233 beds when it does finally open Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard asked Ms Sturgeon whether she understood ""just how angry people are about this?"" He said: ""We've got a children's hospital in Edinburgh that can't open its doors, and we were reminded at the weekend that we have a hospital in Glasgow built by the same contractor that has been closing its doors to a children's cancer ward. ""We need to get to the bottom of this. We need full public transparency to restore public trust, so what will it take for the first minister to finally listen and deliver a full public inquiry into this abject failure of governance and government?"" The new 233-bed hospital will form part of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh campus at Little France, and will provide care for children and young people up to about 16 years of age. It will also have 10 theatres and a children's emergency department. The building shares the same main contractor and design as the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, which has also had problems with ventilation systems. An independent review was published which found that the main issue with the critical care unit's ventilation stemmed from an error in a document produced by NHS Lothian in 2012. It said that the error led to confusion over the interpretation of building standards and guidance, and that opportunities to spot and rectify the error were missed. The ventilation issue also affects the oncology and haematology departments. Ms Freeman said that a troubleshooter would be brought in to help manage the project, and revealed that the new building would not open until at least the autumn of next year.

"This video can not be played Excerpt from Babcock's design video The race to design and build a new generation of Royal Navy frigates has been won by engineering firm Babcock. It has been named preferred bidder for the Â£1.25bn contract for five Type 31 warships. The deal secures hundreds of jobs at Rosyth in Fife, where the ships will be assembled, with construction work expected to be spread between yards across the UK. Work is to begin by the end of 2019, with the first ships delivered in 2023. The Type 31 is a smaller, cheaper frigate than the Type 26 warships currently being built at the Upper Clyde shipyards. With a price ceiling of Â£250m per ship, the aim is to maintain the size of the Navy's surface fleet and generate export orders. Three firms in warship build contest MoD unveils UK shipyard strategy Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the modular construction method would support 2,500 jobs throughout the UK. He said the UK was ""a great shipbuilding nation"" and that there were ""all sorts of ways"" in which UK naval vessels were helping the modern world. He added: ""What it delivers is high quality jobs for young people - really high-skilled jobs for young people in this country - but also massive export opportunities of vessels that not only help to keep the peace but tackle piracy, help dealing with immigration issues across the seas."" The Babcock team's Arrowhead 140 design beat competition from a Cammell Laird/BAE Systems consortium and a bid led by Atlas Elektronik UK. The winning consortium also includes Thales and BMT, as well as Ferguson Marine, based in Port Glasgow, and Harland and Wolff in Belfast - both of which are currently in administration. Last month, Babcock insisted these firms' financial difficulties would not affect its bid because its ""flexible build approach"" could accommodate ""a range of delivery sites"". Scotland's Economy Secretary Derek Mackay said the awarding of the contract was ""testament to the skilled workforce and expertise which we have in Scotland"". He added: ""I have spoken with Babcock this morning to assure them they have the full support of the Scottish government. ""Once the final details of the contract are announced, we look forward to discussions on the role that Ferguson Marine could play alongside other suppliers in Scotland."" Unions also welcomed the announcement, with Unite saying it would secure hundreds of jobs at Rosyth ""for well over a decade"". GMB Scotland said it was ""excellent news"", adding that the team that put the bid together ""should be congratulated"". By Calum Watson, BBC Scotland news Three different designs were in the running for the Type 31 contract but they all have something in common - they're cheap. The price cap of Â£250m per ship might sound a lot of money but, to put it in context, the bill for the eight Type 26 frigates currently under construction comes to about Â£8bn. The extremely tight cost constraints on the new ship have led some critics to describe it as ""the Lidl frigate"". Each bidder has tried to keep the price down by basing its design on successful existing ships rather than starting from scratch. Babcock's ""Team 31"" design is derived from the Iver Huitfeldt frigates developed for the Danish navy. Plenty of flexibility has been factored in - equipment can be upgraded or reconfigured for different roles . The ship is sometimes referred to as the Type 31e - the ""e"" standing for exportability. The hope is that this ""bargain basement ship"" will prove its worth and orders from foreign navies will lead to economies of scale that will drive down costs. Such value for money, some argue, might even tempt the Royal Navy to bolster its surface fleet by increasing the order. The last big frigate order - for the Type 26 - was announced in the summer of 2014, just months before the Scottish independence referendum, with the work going to the BAE Systems yards in Glasgow. While the government insisted this was a value-for-money decision, many pro-union campaigners argued it demonstrated the benefits of being part of the UK. The 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review scaled back the expected size of the Type 26 fleetfrom 13 to eight ships- and instead proposed building ""at least five"" new general purpose frigates, at a much lower cost. With no guarantee this work would come to Scotland, pro-independence campaigners condemned this as a broken promise. In 2017, the government's newNational Shipbuilding Strategy, based on Sir John Parker's independent review, sought to encourage competition in naval procurement, with an emphasis on supporting shipyards across the UK. The choice of Babcock - with its Rosyth site playing a key role in construction but with work spread across various UK sites - is in line with this strategy. It also reduces the government's reliance on BAE Systems, which has long been the dominant force in naval shipbuilding. The rival BAE Systems bid would have seen the company providing design expertise but the bulk of construction would have taken place at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Merseyside. Analysis by Douglas Fraser, Business and Economy Editor, BBC Scotland New Type 31 frigates will be built by Babcock in the Fife yard, as work comes to an end on the aircraft carrier programme In shipbuilding, they talk a lot about the need for a drumbeat, describing the rhythm of production of ships, to keep the workforce busy and efficient, like you'll find on a factory production line. The industry here has had an irregular drumbeat, partly because of lumpy government orders. And British shipbuilding has not been competitive in export markets. Instead, the larger yards, such as the two on the upper Clyde, have thrived only in the protected market of building warships for the Royal Navy. The Type 31e decision means there should be a steadier drumbeat of work. It's already on the Clyde, with the Type 26 frigate programme running until 2030. Soon, the Forth should have its own drumbeat at Rosyth. That's nearly a decade of work on both sides of Scotland. It's an opportunity to build in more efficiency, helped by an extra Â£50m Babcock investment in Rosyth facilities. What's much less clear than expected is what this means for Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow. It was part of the ""Babcock Team 31"", but at Rosyth, there's no talk of teams or consortiums now. Babcock is the preferred bidder (that is, the only one now in negotiations with the government). It has the capacity for all the work to be done at Rosyth, or it can choose how and where it sub-contracts. That is subject, however, to a lot of political pressure - if not instruction - as to how the contract should be shared around the UK, to fit with the government's shipbuilding strategy. So Ferguson has to fight with others for a share of the work, even including Cammell Laird on Merseyside with BAE Systems, which formed the losing bid. Another uncertainty that has to be built into this announcement stems from the dismal track record of Ministry of Defence estimates of timing and budget for its procurement. This one looks particularly ambitious in driving costs down.

"This video can not be played 'We are on track to be fully prepared' It is ""more important than ever"" that Parliament is recalled after the government published an assessment of the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit, Labour has said. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer saidthe Yellowhammer document,externalconfirms there are ""severe risks"" if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. MPs forced the release of the file before Parliament was suspended. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the government was mitigating the risks. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the planning document only showed what might happen ""if the government didn't do anything about it"". But he added ""lots of measures"" were being taken to reduce risks. What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal Brexit? How are the UK's talks with the EU going? Judges rule Parliament suspension is unlawful Sir Keir said recalling Parliament would allow MPs ""the opportunity to scrutinise these documents and take all steps necessary to stop no deal"". His comments followed a ruling by Scotland's highest civil court on Wednesdaythat the government's proroguing of Parliament was unlawful. The Yellowhammer file, which is redacted in parts and almost identical to a versionleaked to the Sunday Times last month, was released on Wednesday. It says in a reasonable worst-case scenario a no-deal Brexit could lead to: a ""decrease"" in certain types of fresh food and ""shorter supply"" of key ingredients price rises for food and fuel, which would ""disproportionately"" affect those with low incomes ""disruption lasting up to six months"" potentially affecting medicines and medical supplies protests and counter-protests across the UK lorries waiting for more than two days to cross the English Channel The document also says some businesses could cease trading, the black market could grow, and some adult social care providers might fail. On the Northern Ireland border, the report says the current plans for ""no new checks with limited exceptions"" are ""likely to prove unsustainable due to a significant economic, legal and biosecurity risks"". But former PM Gordon Brown said the government was ""still not telling the truth"" about the ""sheer scale"" of the possible effects of no deal. ""The worst-case scenario document downplays the risks to medical supplies, the threat to household budgets and the damage inflicted on the most vulnerable,"" he said. Last week, MPspassed a bill by 327 votes to 299that forces the PM to ask for an extension beyond the 31 October Brexit deadline if a deal is not reached with the EU. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would rather ""die in a ditch"" than request an extension, and at present the UK is still due to leave the EU on Halloween. Michael Gove, the cabinet minister with responsibility for no-deal planning, told the BBC the government had taken ""considerable steps"" to ensure the safest possible departure after a no-deal Brexit in the six weeks since 2 August, the date that appears on the document. On Wednesday, he said ""revised assumptions"" would be published ""in due course alongside a document outlining the mitigations the government has put in place and intends to put in place"". What is the UK doing to get ready for a no-deal Brexit? What questions do you have about Brexit? Vets concerned over animal medicines in no-deal The bill also required the release of communications between No 10 aides about Parliament's suspension but ministers have refused to do this. This video can not be played It's been a fairly extraordinary few days in the House of Commons Mr Gove said,externalMPs' request to see e-mails, texts and WhatsApp messages from Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief aide, and eight other advisers in Downing Street were ""unreasonable and disproportionate"". Publishing the information, he added, would ""contravene the law"" and ""offend against basic principles of fairness"". However, former justice secretary David Gauke told BBC Radio 5 Live the messages ""should be handed over"". He added: ""I understand the concerns about private advice but on this particular issueâ¦ this is work-related information to get to the bottom of why Parliament was prorogued."" Concern about medicines is understandable. Every month more than 30 million packs of medicines arrive from the EU. Supply chains are considered particularly vulnerable to disruption at the Channel ports - the Yellowhammer document itself acknowledges this. The government has put out contracts for warehouse space and fridges to stockpile supplies. But there are some medicines that cannot be stored, like radioisotopes used for cancer treatment. Flu vaccines will also need to be imported - the winter vaccination programme will be well under way by 31 October. There are plans in place to fly in emergency supplies if shortages of crucial products arise. But fears remain. However, it is not just about medicines. Hospitals feed about 120,000 patients a day - any disruption to the food chain could impact on them. And then there is social care. The Yellowhammer document warns that inflation could cause social care providers to go under - the market is already fragile. In this situation it is the responsibility of councils to step and find new care homes for residents affected or new providers to care for people in their own homes. The document also warns of potential clashes if foreign fishing vessels enter British territorial waters on the day after the UK's departure and says economic difficulties could be ""exacerbated"" by flooding or a flu pandemic this winter. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said some of the scenarios outlined were ""stark"", but ministers were insisting the paper was not a prediction about what will happen. The document, which, until now, was categorised as ""official, sensitive"", is not an official cabinet paper. It dates from 10 days after Mr Johnson became PM. Retailers said the document confirmed what they have been saying will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. ""Fresh food availability will decrease, consumer choice will decrease, and prices will rise,"" Helen Dickinson of the British Retail Consortium said. And the British Medical Association described the Yellowhammer file as ""alarming"" and that it confirmed its warnings about no-deal, including the threat of medical supply shortages. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told BBC Breakfast: ""This is more like emergency planning for war or a natural disaster and we're doing this voluntarily."" This is not an ""old"" Yellowhammer assessment, as was claimed by the government in August. It is from the latest internal no-deal planning, from August, from well within the time of Boris Johnson's administration. The government hopes that its recent efforts will change some of the most concerning aspects of what is titled a ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" document, but they are yet to be able to make those changes. Everything hinges on the core assumption made about disruption to freight traffic across the Channel - that over half would be stuck for up to two-and-a-half days. Those assumptions on trade flow have improved recently, but are still poor, and enough to have several highly concerning consequences, from fresh food supply, to stability in Northern Ireland, to social care providers and supplies of medicines for people and animals. I have also been assured that a widely circulated version of this document, from the same day, had the phrase ""base scenario"". It is somewhat confusing that there can be a base case of a worst case planning assumption. In any event, these are the real, plausible short-term shocks from a no-deal Brexit. The section on Northern Ireland is particularly concerning. In many respects it is incredible to have such a list of the plausible consequences of what is government policy. It is not difficult to see why the government resisted its release. It is unlikely to improve the mood of an already sceptical Commons. But it is really the first tangible, quotable, warts and all assessment of what Whitehall fears could be around the corner. What questions do you have about the latest Brexit developments?

"This video can not be played ""I did everything right, everything that you should do"" A woman who says she was raped by a man she had been on a date with has told the BBC she was left ""devastated"" after prosecutors decided to drop her case. Annie Tisshaw says her mental health ""really suffered"" during the year-long investigation, and she was then told the CPS would not proceed further. A report,externalshows the number of rape convictions in England and Wales is at its lowest level since records began. There were 1,925 convictions in 2018-19 - a 27% drop from the previous year. This was in spite of allegations of rape reaching a high of 58,000 in England and Wales. Campaigners say the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has changed its approach in rape cases - no longer building rape prosecutions, but screening cases out if they think a jury will not convict. This is denied by the CPS, which has announced a review of its decisions in rape cases. 'Why did the CPS drop my rape case?' Why are rape prosecutions falling? 'Rape cases dropped' over police phone searches Annie, who has waived her right to anonymity, told the Victoria Derbyshire show that she was raped in her own flat after she had been on a date with a man she had met a few times before. She says she reported the incident straight after it happened, handed over her phone, and the case was passed by police to the CPS, who told her it was ""a positive case"". ""I've done everything right that you should do and then at the end, nearly a year later, I was told there were inconsistencies in the case."" Those included CCTV from earlier in the night, which showed she wasn't looking ""particularly scared or nervous"", and text messages sent before the alleged rape, she says. ""This was a guy that I trusted, this was a guy that I had met before, so obviously at that time I didn't know it was going to happen,"" she says. ""My mental health really, really suffered throughout the police case. It's devastating that I've gone through all of that and it's just been dropped."" This video can not be played Bonny Turner says the CPS dropped her case even though her alleged rapist apologised to her on Facebook Messenger Another woman, Lizi, told the BBC she spent ""49 weeks of my life consumed by anxiety and anorexia"" before she heard her case was being dropped. ""All I really remember from that call is screaming and sobbing,"" she said. The annual Violence Against Women and Girls report shows the number of reports of rape that end in a conviction is about 3%. The figures also reveal that the number of suspects charged with rape or another offence has fallen, from 2,822 in 2017-18 to 1,758 in 2018-19. In 2007-08, when records were first compiled in the current way, 2,220 cases resulted in a charge. Of those, 2,201 cases resulted in a conviction - although some would be for investigations started in previous years. The conviction figure takes in the number of suspects initially investigated for rape who were later convicted of rape or other offences, such as sexual assault or indecent assault. This video can not be played Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill says he ""would be worried"" by the figures if he were a victim of sexual violence The CPS - whose budget has been cut by 25% since 2010 - says it has worked hard to improve how it deals with sexual offence cases. It explains the drop by saying it is getting fewer rape referrals from police - a 23% fall from the previous year - and that cases are taking longer because of digital evidence and the demands to disclose material to the defence. A coalition of women's organisations, represented by the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ), is looking to take legal action against the CPS over claims cases are being ""dropped"" without good reason. Lawyer Harriet Wistrich, founder of the CWJ, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was ""compelling"" evidence the collapse in prosecutions was mainly caused by ""a deliberate change in the approach taken by the CPS dating back to late 2016"". Dame Vera Baird, the victims' commissioner, called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene by giving the justice system adequate resources and funding support services for survivors. She questioned whether ""abandoning thousands of cases of potentially traumatised men and women"" was ""ineptitude"" or ""deliberate policy"" by prosecutors. Max Hill, director of public prosecutions, denied there had been a change in approach from prosecutors at the CPS, but said he shared concerns at the ""growing gap"" between reported rapes and the number of prosecutions. He told Today: ""I am not going to point the finger in any particular direction. We - all of us working in the criminal justice system -  need to come together now to discuss this."" Deputy Chief Constable Sarah Crew, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for rape and adult sexual offences, said the decline in convictions reflects ""a justice system that is stretched and under pressure"". But she said police were working with victims' groups to address issues that prevent people from reporting rape or from continuing to support an investigation. The independent CPS watchdog, Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, has also launched a review of charging decisions in rape cases. Why do so few rape cases go to court?

"The first minister and health secretary have both expressed their frustration at the latest delay to the new hospital Nicola Sturgeon has said she ""deeply regrets"" that Edinburgh's new children's hospital will not open for at least another year. The first minister was speaking at Holyrood as opposition parties called for ""heads to roll"" over the delay. The hospital was supposed to open in 2017 - but will now not be ready until next autumn at the earliest. The Tories said the project was a ""shambles"" and accused the government of ""burying its head in the sand"". And Labour called for a public inquiry into what has gone wrong with the construction project, which has been hit by a series of delays and cost increases over the years. Staff and patients were preparing to move into the new Â£150m Royal Hospital for Children and Young People in July when last-minute inspections found serious problems with the ventilation system in the facility's critical care unit. Children's hospital delayed until autumn next year Freeman 'overruled' opening of sick kids hospital A report published on Wednesday said Â£16m of repairs were needed to fix the ventilation and other issues that had been identified, with the work expected to take at least a year. At first minister's questions on Thursday, Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw criticised the ""absolute shambles"" surrounding the new hospital. And he accused Health Secretary Jeane Freeman of doing ""too little, too late"" to address the problems with the project. Staff and patients were preparing to move into the new hospital in July when problems with its ventilation system were found Mr Carlaw said: ""The Sick Kids' Hospital is just 10 minutes' drive from where we all are now and yet it seems that four successive health ministers chose either not to know or simply failed to ask about the full extent of the problems faced until way, way too late. ""This is a saga from which nobody emerges well. Not the health board, not the contractor and certainly not this government - and it's altogether sadly too predictable. ""I think the country thinks - for once - heads should roll."" Ms Sturgeon said it would be an ""understatement"" to say she and Ms Freeman were angry about the ""unacceptable"" situation at the hospital, and insisted the government's focus was on ""putting this right"". But she said the hospital would not be allowed to open until it was fully safe for patients. Ms Sturgeon said the two reports released on Wednesday showed that the ventilation issue that had caused the latest delay did not come to light until the start of July. Staff were preparing to leave the old Sick Kids hospital when the latest problems with the new building were found The first minister said: ""I didn't know about that, the senior management in the health board - as far as I'm aware - didn't know about that and the health secretary didn't know about that. ""As soon as that came to light, the health secretary acted properly and appropriately. ""It would have been wrong to allow that hospital to open before assurances about patient safety could have been given."" Ms Sturgeon added: ""I deeply regret that the hospital will be opening late - extremely late - and it is important that we make sure that every issue that has been identified is addressed so that when it does open it is safe for the patients who use that hospital."" The Royal Hospital for Children and Young People will have 233 beds when it does finally open Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard asked Ms Sturgeon whether she understood ""just how angry people are about this?"" He said: ""We've got a children's hospital in Edinburgh that can't open its doors, and we were reminded at the weekend that we have a hospital in Glasgow built by the same contractor that has been closing its doors to a children's cancer ward. ""We need to get to the bottom of this. We need full public transparency to restore public trust, so what will it take for the first minister to finally listen and deliver a full public inquiry into this abject failure of governance and government?"" The new 233-bed hospital will form part of the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh campus at Little France, and will provide care for children and young people up to about 16 years of age. It will also have 10 theatres and a children's emergency department. The building shares the same main contractor and design as the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, which has also had problems with ventilation systems. An independent review was published which found that the main issue with the critical care unit's ventilation stemmed from an error in a document produced by NHS Lothian in 2012. It said that the error led to confusion over the interpretation of building standards and guidance, and that opportunities to spot and rectify the error were missed. The ventilation issue also affects the oncology and haematology departments. Ms Freeman said that a troubleshooter would be brought in to help manage the project, and revealed that the new building would not open until at least the autumn of next year.

"This video can not be played 'We are on track to be fully prepared' It is ""more important than ever"" that Parliament is recalled after the government published an assessment of the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit, Labour has said. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer saidthe Yellowhammer document,externalconfirms there are ""severe risks"" if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. MPs forced the release of the file before Parliament was suspended. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the government was mitigating the risks. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the planning document only showed what might happen ""if the government didn't do anything about it"". But he added ""lots of measures"" were being taken to reduce risks. What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal Brexit? How are the UK's talks with the EU going? Judges rule Parliament suspension is unlawful Sir Keir said recalling Parliament would allow MPs ""the opportunity to scrutinise these documents and take all steps necessary to stop no deal"". His comments followed a ruling by Scotland's highest civil court on Wednesdaythat the government's proroguing of Parliament was unlawful. The Yellowhammer file, which is redacted in parts and almost identical to a versionleaked to the Sunday Times last month, was released on Wednesday. It says in a reasonable worst-case scenario a no-deal Brexit could lead to: a ""decrease"" in certain types of fresh food and ""shorter supply"" of key ingredients price rises for food and fuel, which would ""disproportionately"" affect those with low incomes ""disruption lasting up to six months"" potentially affecting medicines and medical supplies protests and counter-protests across the UK lorries waiting for more than two days to cross the English Channel The document also says some businesses could cease trading, the black market could grow, and some adult social care providers might fail. On the Northern Ireland border, the report says the current plans for ""no new checks with limited exceptions"" are ""likely to prove unsustainable due to a significant economic, legal and biosecurity risks"". But former PM Gordon Brown said the government was ""still not telling the truth"" about the ""sheer scale"" of the possible effects of no deal. ""The worst-case scenario document downplays the risks to medical supplies, the threat to household budgets and the damage inflicted on the most vulnerable,"" he said. Last week, MPspassed a bill by 327 votes to 299that forces the PM to ask for an extension beyond the 31 October Brexit deadline if a deal is not reached with the EU. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would rather ""die in a ditch"" than request an extension, and at present the UK is still due to leave the EU on Halloween. Michael Gove, the cabinet minister with responsibility for no-deal planning, told the BBC the government had taken ""considerable steps"" to ensure the safest possible departure after a no-deal Brexit in the six weeks since 2 August, the date that appears on the document. On Wednesday, he said ""revised assumptions"" would be published ""in due course alongside a document outlining the mitigations the government has put in place and intends to put in place"". What is the UK doing to get ready for a no-deal Brexit? What questions do you have about Brexit? Vets concerned over animal medicines in no-deal The bill also required the release of communications between No 10 aides about Parliament's suspension but ministers have refused to do this. This video can not be played It's been a fairly extraordinary few days in the House of Commons Mr Gove said,externalMPs' request to see e-mails, texts and WhatsApp messages from Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief aide, and eight other advisers in Downing Street were ""unreasonable and disproportionate"". Publishing the information, he added, would ""contravene the law"" and ""offend against basic principles of fairness"". However, former justice secretary David Gauke told BBC Radio 5 Live the messages ""should be handed over"". He added: ""I understand the concerns about private advice but on this particular issueâ¦ this is work-related information to get to the bottom of why Parliament was prorogued.""

"Boris Johnson has confirmed the government will introduce a new bill aimed tackling the ""horrific crime"" of domestic abuse when Parliament returns. Previous legislation, forcing councils to provide shelter for victims, was dropped after the prime minister suspended proceedings at Westminster. Several charities wrote to him, asking for a ""clear"" pledge to reintroduce it in the Queen's Speech on 14 October. Mr Johnson said he was ""fully committed"" to such a move. Allow Twitter content?

The Domestic Abuse Bill, introduced with cross-party support by Theresa May's government in July, would place a legal duty on councils to offer secure homes for those fleeing violence, and their children. Which bills have been lost with Parliament's suspension? Domestic abuse: Majority of controlling cases dropped Domestic abuse bill 'will tackle injustice' Applying to England and Wales, it proposed the first government definition of domestic abuse, including financial abuse and controlling and manipulative non-physical behaviour. It would also: Create a Domestic Abuse Commissioner, to champion survivors and hold local and national government to account. Set up Domestic Abuse Protection Notices and Domestic Abuse Protection Orders, allowing police and courts to intervene earlier where abuse is suspected Prohibit the cross-examination of victims by their abusers in the family courts The government confirmed in July that it would also beextended to Northern Ireland, which has been without a devolved administration since January 2017. When the bill was introduced in July, then Victims Minister Victoria Atkins said it addressed ""an injustice that has long needed to be tackled"". It is estimated that almost two million adults in England and Wales are victims of domestic abuse every year. Local authority spending on refuges for victims fell from Â£31m in 2010 to Â£23m in 2017. Charities say there is a severe lack of services in many areas, and victims are being turned away when they seek help because refuges with diminished budgets cannot cope with demand. Women's Aid said victims' services were operating ""on a shoestring"". The suspension - prorogation - of Parliament means all bills currently passing through the Commons and Lords are lost, unless the government decides to carry them over to the next session. The Domestic Abuse Bill was one of those lost when Parliament closed in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Lost bills can be reintroduced in the Queen's Speech, setting out the government's agenda, but all progress made so far in Parliament is undone.

"Zakari Bennett died after being pulled out of the River Irwell in Radcliffe A baby boy who died after being pulled out of a river in Greater Manchester has been named locally as Zakari Bennett. Zakari, believed to have been 11 months old, was lifted from the River Irwell in Radcliffe, Bury, just before 16:30 BST on Wednesday but died in hospital. The boy's father Zak Bennett-Eko, 22, has been arrested on suspicion of murder. The child's mother said her son was the ""whole world and so much more"". An emotional post made earlier on her Facebook account shared her shock and grief following his death. Greater Manchester Police said it was not clear at this stage how the boy came to be in the water but unconfirmed reports suggest he was thrown from a bridge. The force urged ""a significant number of witnesses"" to come forward, particularly those with photos or videos. ""We know that some of the incident was captured in images or on video so I want to ask people to provide these to the investigation team,"" said Det Insp Wes Knights. People have been leaving floral tributes at the scene Police confirmed the baby had been in the area ""for a number of hours beforehand"" and witnesses ""may have information about the circumstances leading up to the incident"". Det Insp Knights added it was ""incredibly tragic"" and thanked those people ""who tried their best to help retrieve the baby from the river"". ""His family have understandably been left devastated by what has happened,"" he added. A post-mortem examination will take place on Friday. A cordon is still in place on Blackburn Street, at the junctions with Stand Lane and Radcliffe New Road, while investigations continue. A post-mortem examination is due to take place on Friday Enzo Cabuderra, who works at Italia Mia restaurant in neighbouring Stand Lane, said he arrived to find police and ambulance staff at the scene. ""I've got grandkids myself and to think that someone could do something like thisâ¦it's just shocking,"" he said. A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service said crews ""rescued one casualty who was then handed over to North West Ambulance Service"".

"SNP MP Marion Fellows with granddaughter Saoirse, who was diagnosed when she was three weeks old Families have welcomed a deal which will make two ""life-changing"" cystic fibrosis drugs available to eligible patients in Scotland. A five-year agreement has been reached between the Scottish government and pharmaceutical company Vertex over the use of Orkambi and Symkevi. The drugs improve lung health but were rejected for NHS use last month because they were not deemed cost-effective. The medication normally costs Â£100,000 per patient, per year. The Scottish government said it had secured a ""confidential discount"" from the manufacturer. Patients in other parts of the UK are still not able to access the treatment, with campaigners calling for an end to the ""postcode lottery"". SNP MP for Motherwell and Wishaw Marion Fellows, whose three-year-old granddaughter Saoirse has cystic fibrosis, said it was a ""big moment"" for patients and their families, who had been ""relentless and inspiring"" in their campaign. Ms Fellows said: ""I'm so glad that so many families across Scotland will benefit from these new drugs. Hundreds will be able to lead longer and fuller lives thanks to this decision. ""The Scottish government never let up in discussions and is leading the way in cystic fibrosis treatment. ""But cystic fibrosis knows no borders. The UK government must follow the Scottish government's lead and make it available to sufferers in England also."" The drugs can reduce hospital admissions by stabilising lung health Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening genetic condition that causes fatal lung damage, and affects about 10,400 people in the UK - around 900 of them in Scotland. Only around half of those with the condition live to the age of 40. NHS Scotland estimates that one in 24 Scots have a CFTR mutation which, if carried by both parents, would lead to a child being born with cystic fibrosis. Glasgow mum Gail Gilmour, whose son has cystic fibrosis, tweeted that there were ""no words adequate"" to thank those who helped secure the deal for Scottish patients. Allow Twitter content?

Others have said that they hoped it would lead to progress in negotiations for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Earlier this year campaigners appealed to the UK government to use its powers to break a deadlock in making Orkambi available on the NHS in England. Vertex refused a Â£500m offer for the drug over five years - which was described as the ""largest commitment"" NHS England had ever made. Those affected want other drug firms to be asked to make a cheaper version. The UK government's Department of Health said its approach was still to urge Vertex to accept NHS England's ""generous offer"". The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) had rejected the routine use of the drug in August, saying there were uncertainties about the long-term health benefits of Orkambi and Symkevi in relation to their costs. David Ramsden, chief executive of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said the deal was a ""landmark moment"" for the hundreds of people with CF and their families across Scotland. ""This breakthrough is a victory for their perseverance and enduring hope. It means 350 eligible people living in Scotland will have access to drugs that stabilise their lung health and reduce the need for hospital admissions."" He said the trust would continue to campaign for access to the drugs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, adding: ""Scotland's success must now be replicated across the UK without further damaging delay."" What are Orkambi andSymkevi? Since 2015, the drug Orkambi has been licensed to treat cystic fibrosis in patients from two-year-olds to adults, who have a specific genetic mutation known as F508del. It was not available on the NHS, except for certain people on compassionate grounds. Symkevi is used to treat the same mutation in patients age 12 and older. The mutation causes the production of an abnormal protein that disrupts how water and chloride are transported in the body. Orkambi has been shown in clinical trials to improve lung function and respiratory symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. It is the first of a string of drugs that have been developed, with newer ones expected to be even more effective. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the ""fantastic news"" would allow cystic fibrosis patients to ""live fuller lives for longer"". ""The agreement has been reached after extensive discussions between the Scottish government and Vertex Pharmaceuticals and means the medicines will now be made available to patients on the NHS in Scotland, subject to a confidential discount,"" she added. Vertex has also committed to collecting real-time data on the medicines to support any future submissions to the SMC. Ludovic Fenaux, Vertex senior vice president, said: ""We would like to thank the Scottish authorities for their partnership and the collaborative and flexible way that we have worked together to find this access solution. ""It means that approximately 400 eligible cystic fibrosis patients in Scotland now have access to Orkambi and Symkevi."" Some Scottish patients have previously had access to Orkambi and Symkevi through the Peer Approved Clinical System Tier 2 (PACS Tier 2), which allows doctors to apply for access on behalf of individual patients. A spokesperson for SMC said the pharmaceutical industry had responsibility for bringing their medicines to market at a fair price. ""The SMC members make these difficult decisions based on extensive clinical experience and taking all of the available evidence into account, including that provided by patient groups.  We look forward to receiving new evidence from Vertex on the impact of these medicines following the agreement they have reached with the Scottish government.""

"Mario Draghi said the ECB had cut its forecasts for both inflation and economic growth The European Central Bank has unveiled fresh stimulus measures to bolster the eurozone, including cutting a key interest rate. The deposit facility rate, paid by banks on reserves parked at the ECB, was already negative, but has now been cut from minus 0.4% to minus 0.5%. The ECB also said,externalit was re-starting quantitative easing. It will buy â¬20bn of debt a month from 1 November. The eurozone's main interest rate has remained unchanged at zero. The moves come as the ECB combats an economic slowdown. The bank said its asset purchase programme would ""run for as long as necessary"", while interest rates would remain ""at their present or lower levels"" until eurozone inflation reached its target rate of 2%. Quantitative easing, or QE, is a way for central banks to pump money into the financial system when interest rates are ultra-low and conventional stimulus methods no longer work. The central bank buys assets, usually government bonds, with money it has ""printed"" - or, more accurately, created electronically. Making more money available in this way is supposed to encourage financial institutions to lend more to businesses and individuals. What is quantitative easing? Under its previous QE programme, the ECB bought â¬2.6 trillion of bonds between 2015 and 2018. The eurozone's biggest economy, Germany, is thought to be on the brink of recession ECB chief Mario Draghi told a news conference that the inflation outlook had been further downgraded. ""Headline inflation is likely to decline before rising again towards the end of the year,"" he said. Mr Draghi also announced that the ECB had lowered this year's and next year's GDP growth forecasts for the eurozone. It now expects growth of 1.1% this year and 1.2% in 2020. He said the eurozone was suffering from the ""prevailing weakness of international trade in an environment of prolonged global uncertainties"". The eurozone's biggest economy, Germany, is widely thought to be on the brink of recession. Germany steels itself to face recession threat The ECB's decisions drew a swift reaction from US President Donald Trump, who tweeted that the ECB was ""trying, and succeeding, in depreciating the euro against the VERY strong dollar"".

Responding to Mr Trump's comments, Mr Draghi referred to him as ""the First Tweeter"". ""We have a mandate, we pursue price stability, and we do not target exchange rates, period,"" he said. Mr Draghi is due to make way for incoming ECB President Christine Lagarde on 1 November. The ECB's main refinancing rate has been at zero since March 2016. ""At first glance, the ECB has not quite thrown the kitchen sink at the eurozone economy,"" said Ranko Berich, head of market analysis at Monex Europe. ""The QE package is shy of market expectations, which were â¬30bn a month. But the Bank is clearly back in the business of serious policy easing and more aggressive action could easily be taken in response to a worsening in conditions."" By Andrew Walker, BBC economics correspondent So the ECB has fired off another volley of its monetary policy ammunition.  But will it hit the target? Will it get inflation up towards the ECB's target and will it stimulate the eurozone's flagging economy? Many people are very sceptical. The interest rate move takes us even further into the strange world of negative rates. There is a view that that measure is actually counterproductive, that it has an adverse impact on bank profitability. Perhaps ECB policy more widely has reached the limit of its ability to stimulate economic activity. The other main weapon against economic weakness is in the hands of governments - fiscal policy, or public spending and taxation.  For some governments in the eurozone, their scope to use that weapon is constrained by the amount of debt they already have and by eurozone rules. But the likely next head of the ECB, Christine Lagarde has called for more action in that area. Countries such as Germany have strong government finances, but so far have been wary of departing from what they see as prudent financial management.  There is, however, a growing debate about what the eurozone needs. Germany steels itself to face recession threat Eurozone prepares for rate cut as growth slows Christine Lagarde resigns as head of IMF What is quantitative easing?

"Vets say they are worried about potential problems in the availability of some animal medicines in the case of a no-deal Brexit. The British Veterinary Association said it had concerns over short-shelf life products, such as vaccines. And it urged any pet owners who are worried to speak to their vet. The government said it was ""working closely with the industry on extensive contingency planning to ensure there is no disruption"". It comes after the government published ano-deal Brexit assessment,,externalwhich included warning of possible disruption to medicines for veterinary use. Such disruption would have ""potential detrimental impacts"" for animal welfare, as well as for diseases which are spread between animals and humans, the document said. Most of the veterinary medicines used in the UK are either produced in or enter via the EU, according to industry body the National Office of Animal Health (NOAH). The government has confirmed that animal medicines are classedas ""category 1"" goods,which would be prioritised if there was disruption at the border after a no-deal Brexit. No-deal Brexit papers warn of shortages and riots Reality Check: Are pet passports under threat? Pet travel warning in no-deal Brexit plan Simon Doherty, the president of the BVA, said there were concerns over how lorry delays at ferry ports could affect short shelf-life medicines. ""Where we have products which are short shelf-life products, you need the supply chain to be maintained on a pretty constant basis,"" he told the BBC. ""Most vaccines have to be kept in a refrigerator. ""If we run into a situation where there was a sustained part of time where a lot of animals weren't vaccinated we could have more substantial problems and losses in the industry. ""Where there is specific issues is around use of a lot of product at a specific time. We use a lot of anaesthetic in the springtime, we would be lambing, calving, dehorning calves."" Dr Sophie Aylett, who owns an independent farm animal vet practice in the Midlands with her husband, believes similar problems could arise in autumn - the time when the UK is due to leave the EU. ""We are approaching autumn and vaccine booster times,"" she said. ""In late autumn, farms start to bring cattle into sheds to avoid the worst of the winter weather. ""By necessity this increases stocking density and cow to cow contact, therefore creating a higher risk of infectious disease transmission such as pneumonia. Normally farmers can vaccinate at-risk animals in advance but if there is a delay, it could affect their ability to do so, and consequently adversely affect animal welfare."" And it is not just farmers who should be concerned about no deal, according to Mr Doherty, who said it could affect animals ""across the board"" - including zoo animals and pets. ""It's not as if there will be sudden parvovirus outbreaks in dogs. But where there could be potential problems, is if there isn't a supply of vaccines for an animal to get its booster at a particular time."" He does not anticipate there will be a shortage of cat and dog medicines, but the advice to pet owners would be to speak to their vet if they are concerned. Meanwhile, for pets undergoing longer-term treatment, he added: ""Don't leave the next prescription until you have got one tablet left."" A spokesman for the government's Veterinary Medicines Directorate said ""veterinary medicines will continue to be readily available when we leave the EU on 31 October, whatever the circumstances of our exit"". They will be given priority on government freight to avoid disruption to supply, he said. The government is also working with the industry to increase stocks of medicines, change supply routes and ensure they have early warning about potential issues with the supply chain. NOAH said its industry has been working on detailed planning for all Brexit scenarios. But if there was a no-deal Brexit, there are broader issues which could affect the availability of vet medicines, it said. It also raised concerns about vaccines. ""This disruption does represent a potential risk to controlling disease and an animal welfare issue. ""If preventative medicines such as vaccines are not available, there is a greater risk of disease in the population. This could increase the risk of its spread, including the spread of zoonotic infections."" The president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, Dr Niall Connell, said: ""As the released Operation Yellowhammer documents demonstrate, any interruption in the supply of veterinary medicines would be a threat to animal health and welfare and public health."" The RCVS also said it was concerned that a no-deal could be a risk to the veterinary workforce, with half of new vets recruited from elsewhere in the EU each year.

"Johnston suffered from debilitating mental health issues throughout his career Daniel Johnston, whose guileless, homemade recordings inspired dozens of musicians from Kurt Cobain to Lana Del Rey, has died at the age of 58.

He was mourned online by those he inspired, including musician Beck and film star Elijah Wood, who called him ""a gentle, beautiful treasure,external"".

Born in California in 1961 and raised in West Virginia, Johnston became known as a songwriter after moving to Austin, Texas. His reputation in the city grew after he started handing out cassette tapes of his no-frills home recordings to people in the street. A cult figure on the local music scene, he gained wider exposure when MTV filmed a programme on the Austin music scene in 1985 for its series The Cutting Edge. Johnston's performance brought him almost overnight acclaim, and his early home recordings received a belated vinyl release on the indie label Homestead. He was never an accomplished player, and his pinched, high tenor vocals ensured he would never be a mainstream star - but the aching emotional sincerity of songs Life In Vain and True Love Will Find You In The End, earned him a fiercely loyal fanbase.

Kurt Cobain once described him as ""the best songwriter on earth,"" and famously wore one of Johnston's t-shirts to the 1992 MTV Awards. Other musicians who have covered Johnston's songs include Pearl Jam, Tom Waits, Wilco, Death Cab for Cutie, Sufjan Stevens and Yo La Tengo. In 2013, Lana Del Rey and rapper Mac Miller each contributed $10,000 to fund a short film about the singer, with Del Rey recording a version of his song about heartbreak,Some Things Last A Long Time,externalfor the soundtrack. Johnston was also known as an artist and comic-book writer, and his magic marker cartoon drawings were an inspiration for The Simpsons' creator Matt Groening. In 1993, he was asked to turn Jeremiah the Innocent, the alien frog featured on the cover of his album Hi, How Are You, into a mural in Austin. In 2006, his artwork was featured in a major exhibition at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art. Fans have been laying flowers at the foot of Johnston's mural following news of his death But Johnston was plagued by mental health problems, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, that hindered his career and endangered his life - including one incident where he attempted to crash a plane being piloted by his father. A harrowing documentary, The Devil and Daniel Johnston, released in 2005, showed how fragile he had become, while bringing his music and story to a new audience. ""It sure was embarrassing,""Johnston reflected in an interview with the Austin Chronicle,external. ""Every terrible dilemma, every fabled mistake. Nothing I can do about it now, though. I wish they'd added a laugh track to it, because it sure is funny"". Johnston's own musical output had slowed in recent years and, following a farewell tour in 2017, he was largely confined to the family home. His brother, Dick Johnston, told the New York Times he had been treated for kidney issues shortly before his death. ""He was still productive, writing songs and drawing, and was just annoyed by his health more than anything,""he said,external. ""It was just one thing after another."" In a statement posted on Facebook,external, Johnston's family remembered him as ""a friend to all"". ""Although he struggled with mental health issues for much of his adult life, Daniel triumphed over his illness through his prolific output of art and songs. ""He inspired countless fans, artists, and songwriters with his message that no matter how dark the day that ""the sun shines down on me"" and ""true love will find you in the end."" The singer-songwriter [pictured in his youth] was known for his unfiltered lyrics, which spoke of depression and unrequited love As news of his death spread,fans laid flowers and cassettes at the foot of his mural,externalin Austin, while musicians and fellow creators spoke of Johnston's impact on their life. ""There are not enough words I can say about the vitality of Daniel Johnston's musical spirit,""said musician Zola Jesus,external. ""He was a huge inspiration to me, to follow my creative impulses no matter how messy or simple."" Indie band Death Cab For Cutie, who covered Johnston's song Dream Scream, wrote that their ""hearts were heavy,external"". ""His unique songwriting voice, so pure and so direct, spoke to us deeply,"" they continued. ""It is quite safe to say there will never be another like him and thankfully, his music will play on."" David Bowie's son,Duncan Jones, tweeted,external: ""My dad introduced me to Daniel Johnston's music... Once I'd listened to a few songs, I heard the DNA of so many others' work.

"The government has released an assessment of the possible effects of a no-deal Brexit on the UK, after MPs demanded that it be made public. The document, marked as ""Official Sensitive"" and dated 2 August 2019,outlines a series of ""reasonable worst-case planning assumptions"". It was drawn up as part of ""Operation Yellowhammer"" - the name for the government's contingency plan to prepare for leaving the European Union (EU) without a deal. The government says it is spending an extra Â£2.1bn on no-deal planning and is updating these planning assumptions. So, what does the document say and what is being done - as far as we know - to prepare for no-deal? What Yellowhammer document says: Between 50-85% of UK lorries travelling to the EU may not be ready for French customs Lack of readiness and limited space in French ports could cut HGV traffic by 40-60% and lead to disruption lasting three months This would lead to significant queues in Kent. In a worst-case scenario, it could take lorries up to two-and-a-half days before being able to cross into France What's being done: To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The Port of Dover in Kent handles approximately 10,500 lorries a day. To prevent nearby roads from clogging up, the government has a traffic management plan codenamed Operation Brock. If the plan is activated, up to 2,000 lorries will be held in a queue leading to the port. Other traffic will be kept flowing around the queued-up lorries, in what is known as a contraflow system. A fallback option would be to divert lorries to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time. If further capacity was still required, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile  M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. But there is a still a lot of confusion, according to Rona Hunnisett, from the Freight Transport Association. ""The report shows there's still significant detail to be clarified if Britain is to keep trading efficiently,"" she says. ""Businesses can only prepare for, and implement, new processes once, and still need confirmation of what they are to adopt in the way of new practices."" What Yellowhammer document says: Certain types of fresh food supply will decrease Key ingredients may be in shorter supply There will not be an overall shortage of food in the UK, but may be reduced availability and choice Prices may increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" What's being done: The government has said that it will continue to recognise EU standards for food being imported into the UK, to minimise disruption. The British Retail Consortium has said,externalretailers are doing all they can to prepare for no-deal, but will not be able to prevent all negative effects. It stresses that many fresh fruits and vegetables will be out of season in the UK and that there will be a shortage of warehouse space ahead of Christmas. ""No deal Brexit would be extremely disruptive to the supply chains that we operate, particularly the fresh food supply chains,"" Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's told BBC News. ""There will inevitably be disruption simply because we've never done this before,"" he added, although he also said that previous delays to the Brexit date mean ""there's probably more understanding of what could go wrong and therefore more contingency planning"". Another factor is what tariffs (the taxes on imports) will be charged on food coming into the UK. The governmentpublished a ""tariff schedule"",externalin March, which removed most tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit That means some food from outside the EU that currently attract a tariff could be cheaper, but some goods from the EU that are currently imported with 0% tariffs, like beef and dairy, will now carry tariffs, and so could become more expensive. What Yellowhammer document says: Supply chains for medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at the Channel ports While some products can be stockpiled, others cannot because they have a short shelf life It will not be practical to stockpile products to cover expected delays of up to six months An increase in inflation would ""significantly impact"" adult social care providers and may lead to some failing, with smaller providers impacted within two-three months. What's being done: At the end of June, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) started putting out contracts for freight, warehouse space and fridges. These will be used to stockpile medicines and fly in those which cannot be stored, like radioisotopes for cancer treatment. Of the Â£2.1bn pledged for no-deal preparations, Â£434m has been set aside for this. That includes a Â£25m contract for planes to bring in emergency medical supplies within 24 hours. Ahead of the UK's original departure date of 29 March - then extended to 12 April - the DHSC said thousands of medicines had been analysed to work out what might be affected by supply disruption from the EU. Suppliers stockpiled an additional six weeks' worth of these drugs over and above the usual ""buffer"" stock. This exercise is being repeated to ensure the department is ""as prepared for leaving the EU without a deal in October as it was on 29 March and 12 April"". Specific ferry routes were made available for suppliers to book onto 11 weeks before the no-deal deadline in March. Six weeks before the 31 October deadline, the government had only just opened the bidding process to freight firms competing to transport medicines. So the pharmaceutical industry doesn't currently know which ports and ferry routes will be made available. Steve Bates, an industry official working with government on no-deal planning, said the time frame to make sure everything was in place for the October deadline was ""significantly compressed"". He said the difference for drug suppliers between three months and potentially three weeks to put plans into action was ""material"". On social care, the government website advises providers to draw up contingency plans and support EU staff who may be working for them. Plans are in place to ensure there are enough essential medicines like insulin What Yellowhammer document says: There will be no immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies However, there are likely to be significant price rises if the UK splits from the EU single energy market, which could happen months or years after Brexit This could lead to some energy companies leaving the market Public water supplies are likely to remain largely unaffected What's being done: In the event of no-deal, the UK has said it will not impose tariffs on electricity and gas coming into the country. However, if the value of the pound falls in response to a no-deal Brexit, it will become more expensive to import energy from abroad. The government intends to remain part of the single energy market, in order for the UK's energy laws to continue to work after Brexit and that supplies are not disrupted. Water is unlikely to be affected, although there is still a low risk in the event of a chemical supply problem. The Yellowhammer report says water companies are well-prepared and have significant stockpiles of critical chemicals. What Yellowhammer document says: The government's planned short-term solution for the border is likely to be unsustainable because of the ""economic, legal and biosecurity risks"" it presents Trade between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic will be ""severely disrupted"" Some businesses will stop trading, some will move and some will experience higher costs that they may pass on to customers Agriculture will be hardest hit, leading to job losses, protests and direct action with road blockages Growth of the ""illegitimate economy"" around the border ""where criminal and dissident groups already operate"" What's being done: The UK government has said it is committed not to have any physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. On 13 Marchit published its contingency plan,externalto avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It said it would not bring in new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for any goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland, in the event of no-deal. But this will only be a temporary measure while negotiations take place to find longer-term solutions. Government has no plans for Irish border controls To protect people's health, some plant and animal products that come into Northern Ireland from outside the EU, via Ireland, will still need to be checked. The UK government has said these checks will not happen at the border itself, but it has not specified exactly where they will take place. It remains unclear what will happen to goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland. Under EU rules, checks would normally be required at the point certain goods enter the EU single market. The Irish government says it is securing additional space, and has recruited more customs and agriculture staff to allow for a ""significant increase in checks and procedures"". What Yellowhammer document says: Protests and counter-protests likely across the UK May be a rise in public disorder and community tensions Information-sharing between UK and EU law enforcement will be disrupted What is being done: The National Police Coordination Centre will plan the allocation of officers across the country althoughit has said there has been no intelligence,externalto suggest that any protests will not be peaceful. The government has also established the International Crime and Coordination Centre, which is supposed to help the police cope with the change to the UK's relationship with law enforcement agencies in the EU. 10 ways you could be affected by no deal Most imports tariff-free under no-deal plan What could happen to food prices after Brexit?

"Cyclists Jason and Laura Kenny became parents in 2017 Parents should ask local councils to regularly shut down their streets so children can play outside, British cyclist Jason Kenny has said. The six-time Olympic gold medallist told the BBC that traffic on residential roads was one of the ""big hurdles"" for parents who wanted their children to play outdoors near home. Kenny's call is part of thePlaying Out,externalcampaign, which began in Bristol. Playing Out says only 21% of children play on their street regularly. ""A lot of parents don't feel confident to let their kids out on the street in front of them,"" Kenny said on Radio 5 Live. ""So it's giving them power to get in contact with the council, make it official and shut the road for a bit and let the kids play out."" Whitley Bay street closed so children can play out The politics of pedestrianisation Barney Worfolk-Smith, who lives in Hackney, London, is among a growing number of people trying to persuade their council to regularly shut their streets to help children play outside. He says there is now a ""thriving"" community based around the efforts, which he has been organising for the past three years, with about 15 children and 20 adults regularly taking part. Barney Worfolk-Smith tries to close his street down about once a month so children can play outside Mr Worfolk-Smith says his son did play outside ""a bit"" prior to the closure - but, he adds, it has ""without doubt changed the colour, the attitude, of everyone around"". ""I really believe in this,"" he tells BBC News. ""I grew up in the countryside, I had complete freedom, especially on my bicycle. ""We try to do it every single month. ""On Sundays from two until four we shut off the streets - the main reason is for children to come out and reclaim the streets, but I'm also a big believer in community, in getting the neighbours out and talking to the older people who live here."" Not only does closing the road encourage children to play out at the time, Mr Worfolk-Smith says, but it has also ""normalised"" playing outside on a regular basis. ""There's a gang of kids out most nights now just on their roller skates or bikes just having fun,"" he says. Mr Worfolk-Smith's son now regularly plays outside Holly Beasley says her street in Stockport used to be ""civil but quite distant"", with almost none of the children playing outside before the road closures were organised. ""But now lots of children do play out and there's a good mix of ages,"" she says. ""Lots of the children go to different schools but actually they've become friends and built those new friendships and little networks locally."" The road closures have been taking place on Ms Beasley's street for almost two years, and while she admits not all residents were keen on the idea initially, that has changed. ""People have come round to the idea and have realised it hasn't had any negative impact on their lives and has only brought good things for them,"" she says. Holly Beasley's street has been closing regularly for about two years ""I think the biggest surprising benefit has been the adult friendships. ""Not just for those of us who are directly involved in organising it - there are a lot of older people on the street who have really embraced it. ""I was surprised to see people who don't have children coming out regularly and just enjoying having a cup of tea and just getting involved in the practical side of things."" However, not everyone is convinced by the campaign. Dan Plummer, a resident of Bristol, questioned whether the idea could lead children to be less careful on roads in general. ""We should be very careful about normalising playful activities on roads,"" he told the BBC. ""Closing roads and allowing children to play on these roads may cause children to not think of the dangers of the road in other environments. ""Rather than allowing children to play on the road, perhaps parents could take their children to parks."" Phil Crampton, from York, echoed that sentiment, saying he didn't believe the idea would catch on. ""Why can't the parents take their kids to the local park like they used to do?""

"SNP MP Marion Fellows with granddaughter Saoirse, who was diagnosed when she was three weeks old Families have welcomed a deal which will make two ""life-changing"" cystic fibrosis drugs available to eligible patients in Scotland. A five-year agreement has been reached between the Scottish government and pharmaceutical company Vertex over the use of Orkambi and Symkevi. The drugs improve lung health but were rejected for NHS use last month because they were not deemed cost-effective. The medication normally costs Â£100,000 per patient, per year. The Scottish government said it had secured a ""confidential discount"" from the manufacturer. Patients in other parts of the UK are still not able to access the treatment, with campaigners calling for an end to the ""postcode lottery"". SNP MP for Motherwell and Wishaw Marion Fellows, whose three-year-old granddaughter Saoirse has cystic fibrosis, said it was a ""big moment"" for patients and their families, who had been ""relentless and inspiring"" in their campaign. Ms Fellows said: ""I'm so glad that so many families across Scotland will benefit from these new drugs. Hundreds will be able to lead longer and fuller lives thanks to this decision. ""The Scottish government never let up in discussions and is leading the way in cystic fibrosis treatment. ""But cystic fibrosis knows no borders. The UK government must follow the Scottish government's lead and make it available to sufferers in England also."" The drugs can reduce hospital admissions by stabilising lung health Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening genetic condition that causes fatal lung damage, and affects about 10,400 people in the UK - around 900 of them in Scotland. Only around half of those with the condition live to the age of 40. NHS Scotland estimates that one in 24 Scots have a CFTR mutation which, if carried by both parents, would lead to a child being born with cystic fibrosis. Glasgow mum Gail Gilmour, whose son has cystic fibrosis, tweeted that there were ""no words adequate"" to thank those who helped secure the deal for Scottish patients. Allow Twitter content?

Others have said that they hoped it would lead to progress in negotiations for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Earlier this year campaigners appealed to the UK government to use its powers to break a deadlock in making Orkambi available on the NHS in England. Vertex refused a Â£500m offer for the drug over five years - which was described as the ""largest commitment"" NHS England had ever made. Those affected want other drug firms to be asked to make a cheaper version. The UK government's Department of Health said its approach was still to urge Vertex to accept NHS England's ""generous offer"". The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) had rejected the routine use of the drug in August, saying there were uncertainties about the long-term health benefits of Orkambi and Symkevi in relation to their costs. David Ramsden, chief executive of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said the deal was a ""landmark moment"" for the hundreds of people with CF and their families across Scotland. ""This breakthrough is a victory for their perseverance and enduring hope. It means 350 eligible people living in Scotland will have access to drugs that stabilise their lung health and reduce the need for hospital admissions."" He said the trust would continue to campaign for access to the drugs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, adding: ""Scotland's success must now be replicated across the UK without further damaging delay."" What are Orkambi andSymkevi? Since 2015, the drug Orkambi has been licensed to treat cystic fibrosis in patients from two-year-olds to adults, who have a specific genetic mutation known as F508del. It was not available on the NHS, except for certain people on compassionate grounds. Symkevi is used to treat the same mutation in patients age 12 and older. The mutation causes the production of an abnormal protein that disrupts how water and chloride are transported in the body. Orkambi has been shown in clinical trials to improve lung function and respiratory symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. It is the first of a string of drugs that have been developed, with newer ones expected to be even more effective. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the ""fantastic news"" would allow cystic fibrosis patients to ""live fuller lives for longer"". ""The agreement has been reached after extensive discussions between the Scottish government and Vertex Pharmaceuticals and means the medicines will now be made available to patients on the NHS in Scotland, subject to a confidential discount,"" she added. Vertex has also committed to collecting real-time data on the medicines to support any future submissions to the SMC. Ludovic Fenaux, Vertex senior vice president, said: ""We would like to thank the Scottish authorities for their partnership and the collaborative and flexible way that we have worked together to find this access solution. ""It means that approximately 400 eligible cystic fibrosis patients in Scotland now have access to Orkambi and Symkevi."" Some Scottish patients have previously had access to Orkambi and Symkevi through the Peer Approved Clinical System Tier 2 (PACS Tier 2), which allows doctors to apply for access on behalf of individual patients. A spokesperson for SMC said the pharmaceutical industry had responsibility for bringing their medicines to market at a fair price. ""The SMC members make these difficult decisions based on extensive clinical experience and taking all of the available evidence into account, including that provided by patient groups.  We look forward to receiving new evidence from Vertex on the impact of these medicines following the agreement they have reached with the Scottish government.""

But the MPs found the industry was reluctant to accept responsibility for intervening when a player was over-spending or even to put a figure on how much was too much.

"Cyclists Jason and Laura Kenny became parents in 2017 Parents should ask local councils to regularly shut down their streets so children can play outside, British cyclist Jason Kenny has said. The six-time Olympic gold medallist told the BBC that traffic on residential roads was one of the ""big hurdles"" for parents who wanted their children to play outdoors near home. Kenny's call is part of thePlaying Out,externalcampaign, which began in Bristol. Playing Out says only 21% of children play on their street regularly. ""A lot of parents don't feel confident to let their kids out on the street in front of them,"" Kenny said on Radio 5 Live. ""So it's giving them power to get in contact with the council, make it official and shut the road for a bit and let the kids play out."" Whitley Bay street closed so children can play out The politics of pedestrianisation Barney Worfolk-Smith, who lives in Hackney, London, is among a growing number of people trying to persuade their council to regularly shut their streets to help children play outside. He says there is now a ""thriving"" community based around the efforts, which he has been organising for the past three years, with about 15 children and 20 adults regularly taking part. Barney Worfolk-Smith tries to close his street down about once a month so children can play outside Mr Worfolk-Smith says his son did play outside ""a bit"" prior to the closure - but, he adds, it has ""without doubt changed the colour, the attitude, of everyone around"". ""I really believe in this,"" he tells BBC News. ""I grew up in the countryside, I had complete freedom, especially on my bicycle. ""We try to do it every single month. ""On Sundays from two until four we shut off the streets - the main reason is for children to come out and reclaim the streets, but I'm also a big believer in community, in getting the neighbours out and talking to the older people who live here."" Not only does closing the road encourage children to play out at the time, Mr Worfolk-Smith says, but it has also ""normalised"" playing outside on a regular basis. ""There's a gang of kids out most nights now just on their roller skates or bikes just having fun,"" he says. Mr Worfolk-Smith's son now regularly plays outside Holly Beasley says her street in Stockport used to be ""civil but quite distant"", with almost none of the children playing outside before the road closures were organised. ""But now lots of children do play out and there's a good mix of ages,"" she says. ""Lots of the children go to different schools but actually they've become friends and built those new friendships and little networks locally."" The road closures have been taking place on Ms Beasley's street for almost two years, and while she admits not all residents were keen on the idea initially, that has changed. ""People have come round to the idea and have realised it hasn't had any negative impact on their lives and has only brought good things for them,"" she says. Holly Beasley's street has been closing regularly for about two years ""I think the biggest surprising benefit has been the adult friendships. ""Not just for those of us who are directly involved in organising it - there are a lot of older people on the street who have really embraced it. ""I was surprised to see people who don't have children coming out regularly and just enjoying having a cup of tea and just getting involved in the practical side of things."" However, not everyone is convinced by the campaign. Dan Plummer, a resident of Bristol, questioned whether the idea could lead children to be less careful on roads in general. ""We should be very careful about normalising playful activities on roads,"" he told the BBC. ""Closing roads and allowing children to play on these roads may cause children to not think of the dangers of the road in other environments. ""Rather than allowing children to play on the road, perhaps parents could take their children to parks."" Phil Crampton, from York, echoed that sentiment, saying he didn't believe the idea would catch on. ""Why can't the parents take their kids to the local park like they used to do?""

"The saga surrounding the new sick children's hospital in Edinburgh is the main focus of first minister's questions Sturgeon defends her health secretary in the face of criticism from Carlaw and Leonard Carlaw insists someone must be held accountable for the sick kids' hospital delay Leonard calls for a full public inquiry Craig Hutchison and Louise Wilson That's all from Holyrood Live on Thursday 12 September 2019. Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs during FMQs she ""deeply regrets"" that Edinburgh's new children's hospital will not open for at least another year. The first minister was speaking at Holyrood as opposition parties called for ""heads to roll"" over the delay. The hospital was supposed to open in 2017 - but will now not be ready until next autumn at the earliest. Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative interim leader, said the project was a ""shambles"" and accused the government of ""burying its head in the sand"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard called for a public inquiry into what has gone wrong with the construction project, which has been hit by a series of delays and cost increases over the years.

Police Scotland has more than 250 cars over a decade old, figures have revealed. A total of 870 cars, about a quarter of the fleet, have driven 100,000 miles or more, with 126 covering between 150,000 and 200,000 miles. The average vehicle was four to five years old with up to 50,000 miles on the clock. The Scottish government insisted the police resource budget was being protected in real terms. Read more. Scotland's fire service may have to close stations and cut vehicles in order to meet a massive repairs bill, a spending watchdog warned last year. Audit Scotland said the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service faced a Â£389m backlog in vehicle and property costs. A report said annual investment of Â£80.4m was needed to bring assets up to ""satisfactory"" standards. The Scottish government said the report recognised ""real progress"" since the formation of a single national force. Read more. Allow Twitter content?

Phil Gormley resigned as chief constable after complaints were made against him The former Lord Advocate, Dame Elish Angiolini, has called for changes in the way complaints against senior police officers are handled. It follows criticism of the process during an investigation intoallegations against the former chief constable, Phil Gormley. Dame Elish said complaints against senior officers in Scotland should be dealt with more speedily. She has also called for wider use of body cameras by on-duty officers. Read more. John Yuill and Lamara Bell were found in the car three days after the crash was first reported Police Scotland is to change the way it handles calls to 101 and 999 services. It follows a report from HM Inspector of Constabulary which recommended improvements to the way risk and vulnerability of callers was assessed. Independent watchdogs have also highlighted failures in a number of cases in which vulnerable people have been found dead despite calls for help. Police chiefs said the new approach would improve the force's ability to despatch officers to urgent incidents. Read more. Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur reminds the chamber his party consistently opposed the centralisation that lies at the heart of the 2012 Act. Warnings were repeatedly given about accountability and transparency by his party he adds. The Lib Dem MSP reminds the chamber about serious concerns raised about call handling, not dealt with before the tragic deaths of Lamara Bell and John Yuill. They were found dead in a car three days after the crash was first reported. He goes on to say the public would want the parliament to carry out its role and not let Police Scotland and the SPA mark their own homework. The number of police officers in Scotland has risen to its highest level since the end of 2017. Figures published by the Scottish government show there were 17,251 officers in the national force at the end of March. This represents an increase of 77 on the previous quarter. The numbers reflect the force's decision to accelerate recruitment to deal with any uncertainty caused by the Brexit process. Read more. Allow Twitter content?

He expresses concern about the potential of collateral damage while new technology is rolled out, such as facial recognition. Demands on police change with legislation, Mr Finnie states, pointing to the new domestic abuse law which he describes as quite resource intensive. That might mean officers are off the street but this is still a very important function, he explains. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour MSP James Kelly Labour MSP James Kelly stresses the importance of post-legislative scrutiny over Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. Mr Kelly starts with Police Scotland and issues around the SPA and relating to the role of ministers in terms of governance. The Labour MSP is concerned there is a deficit in Police Scotland funding of Â£35.7m that could lead to a shortfall of 100 officers. He warns the service and the safety of the public may be crucially undermined. Turning to the fire service, Mr Kelly says the FBU is very supportive about the move to a single service. He points out there are 648 less firefighters diminishing the frontline service. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tory MSP Liam Kerr highlights that the committee broadly agreed that governance within Police Scotland did not need to change despite issues with chief constables since it was established. This was put down to individual personalities rather than a governance problem, he states. He suggests there are insufficient numbers of officers, highlighting suggestions that police in Aberdeen are struggling to tackle drug dealing because of this. At least Â£70m extra is required to stop a cut to staff numbers he states. He also expresses concern about capital funding not being met more broadly, explaining this is why the vehicle fleet is ageing. Mr Kerr also highlights concerns about reduced numbers of firefighters. A recruitment drive to hire 300 firefighters across Scotland has been launched. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said its latest campaign will actively encourage people from a wide range of backgrounds to apply. Just 5% of Scotland's 3,000 firefighters are women and less than 1% belong to an ethnic minority. The recruitment push comes as up to half of the SFRS workforce is eligible for retirement in the next decade. Read more. Mr Yousaf Mr Yousaf pivots to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, the largest in the UK. He says last year's Glasgow School of Art fire and the recent huge fire in Moray reminds us of the bravery of our firefighters. Protecting frontline services is the government priority, he tells the chamber he adds. The committee concluded that although reform had led to greater consistency of service across Scotland, as well as allowing for more equal access to specialist capabilities and support, a number of issues, particularly within Police Scotland, should be further addressed. The committee's report on policing indicated that poor financial management, unclear lines of responsibility and a failure to focus on the views of officers and staff in the early stages of reform lie at the root of many of the problems faced by Police Scotland. Among the issues highlighted were forecast savings not being realised, IT problems hampering police effectiveness and a string of well-publicised personnel problems resulting in senior management ""instability and concerns over a lack of clear leadership"" in the initial years of the reform process. A need for an exemption for police and fire services from the payment of VAT was also highlighted in the committee's considerations. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf says the Act was the biggest change to the public sector since devolution. He welcomes the Justice Committee's reports, saying it both points to positive aspects of the mergers as well as highlighting challenges which need to be addressed. Policing services in Scotland have been protected and improved by the change, he states. The justice secretary also points out that police numbers are at the highest point they have been. He commits to engaging closely with the SPA and chief constable of Police Scotland to ensure the service continues to deliver, as well as continuing to sufficient fund it. Ms Mitchell now moves on to talk about the report into the fire and rescue service. The committee convener says Audit Scotland said the merger of the eight fire and rescue services had been handled effectively. Currently the fire service is on track to meet its savings targets and perhaps exceed them, says Ms Mitchell, with frontline services being maintained. Less encouraging was the retained duty service, described as ""not fit for purpose"" by Audit Scotland she says. Ms Mitchell says the goal of the 2012 Act was to see local authority engagement with the fire service improve. Â© 2025 BBC.

"In-game spending should be regulated by gambling laws and so-called loot boxes banned entirely for children, MPs say. The industry's UK trade body responded it would ""review these recommendations with utmost seriousness"". But the committee of MPs had accused some of those who had given evidence of a ""lack of honesty and transparency"". Free video games often encourage players to buy virtual loot boxes, which contain an unspecified amount of items to improve further game-play. Some games have associated online marketplaces where players can trade or sell these items. Have your say: Should loot boxes be banned? 'My son spent Â£3,160 in one game' EA games: Loot boxes aren't gambling, they're just like a Kinder Egg Loot boxes should be banned, says US senator The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee's inquiry into addictive and immersive technologies heard stories of young adults who had built up debts of thousands of pounds through spending in games. Jagex, the company behind online game RuneScape, admitted players could spend up to Â£1,000 a week or Â£5,000 a month. But the MPs found the industry was reluctant to accept responsibility for intervening when a player was over-spending or even to put a figure on how much was too much. And some had been ""wilfully obtuse"" in answering questions about game-play, which MPs needed to know in order to better understand how players engaged with games. Without naming names, they said they had sometimes found it difficult to get full and clear answers from the gaming industry representatives who had appeared before them, in particular when it came to answering questions about what data they collected, how it was used and the psychology underpinning how games were designed. ""Social media platforms and online games makers are locked in a relentless battle to capture ever more of people's attention, time and money,"" Mr Collins said. ""Their business models are built on this but it's time for them to be more responsible in dealing with the harms these technologies can cause for some users."" In response Dr Jo Twist, the chief executive of UK Interactive Entertainment, said: """"The video games industry has always, and will continue to, put the welfare of players at the heart of what we do. ""The industry does not dispute that, for a minority, finding balance is a problem. ""This is why we are vocal in supporting efforts to increase digital literacy and work with schools and carers on education programmes."" But Mr Collins said the games industry should contribute financially towards independent research into the long-term effects of gaming. ""Gaming disorder based on excessive and addictive game-play has been recognised by the World Health Organization,"" he said. ""It's time for game companies to use the huge quantities of data they gather about their players to do more to proactively identify vulnerable gamers."" The MPs also called for both social media platforms and game-makers to establish effective age-verification tools. Currently both rely on a honesty system and, as a result, there are large numbers of under-age users on social media and playing games. Loot boxes offer a variety of rewards that can improve game-play Loot boxes should not be sold to children and should instead be earned as rewards for game-play, the MPs said. ""Loot boxes are particularly lucrative for games companies but come at a high cost, particularly for problem gamblers, while exposing children to potential harm,"" Mr Collins said. ""Buying a loot box is playing a game of chance and it is high time the gambling laws caught up. ""We challenge the government to explain why loot boxes should be exempt from the Gambling Act."" There is growing international disquiet about loot boxes, with a US senator calling for them to be banned and the government of Belgium ruling they were in violation of gambling laws.

"John Lewis has fallen to a half-year loss and says a no-deal Brexit will have a ""significant"" impact. The retailer said while it had prepared for no deal, it could not fully offset the effect and the impact on fresh food supplies was a concern. The stores group, which also owns Waitrose,reported a loss of Â£25.9m,external, down from a profit of Â£0.8m last year. Sales slipped amid ""difficult"" trading conditions, which were not helped by ""subdued consumer confidence"". John Lewis pointed to ""soft demand"" for its home and electrical goods as a particular weak spot. Could a no-deal Brexit still happen on 31 October? Retailers shut 2,870 stores in first half of 2019 Five ways the High Street is changing John Lewis to start building home extensions The partnership, which normally makes most of its profits in the second half of the year, said it had been making preparations for a no-deal Brexit, including building up stocks ""where that is sensible"". However, the partnership's chairman, Charlie Mayfield, said: ""Should the UK leave the EU without a deal, we expect the effect to be significant and it will not be possible to mitigate that impact. ""Brexit continues to weigh on consumer sentiment at a crucial time for the sector as we enter the peak trading period."" He said the group was worried about the impact of a no-deal Brexit on fresh food supplies and consumer confidence. ""Ultimately, that could have a knock-on impact on profits,"" he said. ""That could be significant."" Salary increases and an IT overhaul also ate into the group's profits, John Lewis said. Amid what it described as a ""weak grocery market"" sales at Waitrose slipped slightly to Â£3.4bn in the six months to 27 July. However, the supermarket chain also reported a 10.7% growth in online sales, which the partnership said was ""well ahead of the market"". At the John Lewis department store business, total sales were Â£2.1bn, down 1.8%. ""After a disappointing end to last year, and the well-documented problems at fellow department stores Debenhams and House of Fraser, it's no surprise to see John Lewis' like-for-like sales and profits falling,"" said Hargreaves Lansdown analyst George Salmon. ""Weakness in big ticket purchases is particularly interesting because it implies consumers are factoring in Brexit uncertainty before splashing savings on large screen TVs or setting up repayment plans for new furniture."" John Lewis plans to reach more customers by expanding its network of ""click and collect"" points at Co-op stores. In May, the department store announced that online shoppers would be able to pick up their purchases at six Co-op stores as part of a trial.

"SNP MP Marion Fellows with granddaughter Saoirse, who was diagnosed when she was three weeks old Families have welcomed a deal which will make two ""life-changing"" cystic fibrosis drugs available to eligible patients in Scotland. A five-year agreement has been reached between the Scottish government and pharmaceutical company Vertex over the use of Orkambi and Symkevi. The drugs improve lung health but were rejected for NHS use last month because they were not deemed cost-effective. The medication normally costs Â£100,000 per patient, per year. The Scottish government said it had secured a ""confidential discount"" from the manufacturer. Patients in other parts of the UK are still not able to access the treatment, with campaigners calling for an end to the ""postcode lottery"". SNP MP for Motherwell and Wishaw Marion Fellows, whose three-year-old granddaughter Saoirse has cystic fibrosis, said it was a ""big moment"" for patients and their families, who had been ""relentless and inspiring"" in their campaign. Ms Fellows said: ""I'm so glad that so many families across Scotland will benefit from these new drugs. Hundreds will be able to lead longer and fuller lives thanks to this decision. ""The Scottish government never let up in discussions and is leading the way in cystic fibrosis treatment. ""But cystic fibrosis knows no borders. The UK government must follow the Scottish government's lead and make it available to sufferers in England also."" The drugs can reduce hospital admissions by stabilising lung health Cystic fibrosis is a life-shortening genetic condition that causes fatal lung damage, and affects about 10,400 people in the UK - around 900 of them in Scotland. Only around half of those with the condition live to the age of 40. NHS Scotland estimates that one in 24 Scots have a CFTR mutation which, if carried by both parents, would lead to a child being born with cystic fibrosis. Glasgow mum Gail Gilmour, whose son has cystic fibrosis, tweeted that there were ""no words adequate"" to thank those who helped secure the deal for Scottish patients. Allow Twitter content?

Others have said that they hoped it would lead to progress in negotiations for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Earlier this year campaigners appealed to the UK government to use its powers to break a deadlock in making Orkambi available on the NHS in England. Vertex refused a Â£500m offer for the drug over five years - which was described as the ""largest commitment"" NHS England had ever made. Those affected want other drug firms to be asked to make a cheaper version. The UK government's Department of Health said its approach was still to urge Vertex to accept NHS England's ""generous offer"". The Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) had rejected the routine use of the drug in August, saying there were uncertainties about the long-term health benefits of Orkambi and Symkevi in relation to their costs. David Ramsden, chief executive of the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, said the deal was a ""landmark moment"" for the hundreds of people with CF and their families across Scotland. ""This breakthrough is a victory for their perseverance and enduring hope. It means 350 eligible people living in Scotland will have access to drugs that stabilise their lung health and reduce the need for hospital admissions."" He said the trust would continue to campaign for access to the drugs in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, adding: ""Scotland's success must now be replicated across the UK without further damaging delay."" What are Orkambi andSymkevi? Since 2015, the drug Orkambi has been licensed to treat cystic fibrosis in patients from two-year-olds to adults, who have a specific genetic mutation known as F508del. It was not available on the NHS, except for certain people on compassionate grounds. Symkevi is used to treat the same mutation in patients age 12 and older. The mutation causes the production of an abnormal protein that disrupts how water and chloride are transported in the body. Orkambi has been shown in clinical trials to improve lung function and respiratory symptoms in people with cystic fibrosis. It is the first of a string of drugs that have been developed, with newer ones expected to be even more effective. Scotland's Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said the ""fantastic news"" would allow cystic fibrosis patients to ""live fuller lives for longer"". ""The agreement has been reached after extensive discussions between the Scottish government and Vertex Pharmaceuticals and means the medicines will now be made available to patients on the NHS in Scotland, subject to a confidential discount,"" she added. Vertex has also committed to collecting real-time data on the medicines to support any future submissions to the SMC. Ludovic Fenaux, Vertex senior vice president, said: ""We would like to thank the Scottish authorities for their partnership and the collaborative and flexible way that we have worked together to find this access solution. ""It means that approximately 400 eligible cystic fibrosis patients in Scotland now have access to Orkambi and Symkevi."" Some Scottish patients have previously had access to Orkambi and Symkevi through the Peer Approved Clinical System Tier 2 (PACS Tier 2), which allows doctors to apply for access on behalf of individual patients. A spokesperson for SMC said the pharmaceutical industry had responsibility for bringing their medicines to market at a fair price. ""The SMC members make these difficult decisions based on extensive clinical experience and taking all of the available evidence into account, including that provided by patient groups.  We look forward to receiving new evidence from Vertex on the impact of these medicines following the agreement they have reached with the Scottish government.""

"The saga surrounding the new sick children's hospital in Edinburgh is the main focus of first minister's questions Sturgeon defends her health secretary in the face of criticism from Carlaw and Leonard Carlaw insists someone must be held accountable for the sick kids' hospital delay Leonard calls for a full public inquiry Craig Hutchison and Louise Wilson That's all from Holyrood Live on Thursday 12 September 2019. Nicola Sturgeon told MSPs during FMQs she ""deeply regrets"" that Edinburgh's new children's hospital will not open for at least another year. The first minister was speaking at Holyrood as opposition parties called for ""heads to roll"" over the delay. The hospital was supposed to open in 2017 - but will now not be ready until next autumn at the earliest. Jackson Carlaw, the Scottish Conservative interim leader, said the project was a ""shambles"" and accused the government of ""burying its head in the sand"". Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard called for a public inquiry into what has gone wrong with the construction project, which has been hit by a series of delays and cost increases over the years.

Police Scotland has more than 250 cars over a decade old, figures have revealed. A total of 870 cars, about a quarter of the fleet, have driven 100,000 miles or more, with 126 covering between 150,000 and 200,000 miles. The average vehicle was four to five years old with up to 50,000 miles on the clock. The Scottish government insisted the police resource budget was being protected in real terms. Read more.

Phil Gormley resigned as chief constable after complaints were made against him The former Lord Advocate, Dame Elish Angiolini, has called for changes in the way complaints against senior police officers are handled. It follows criticism of the process during an investigation intoallegations against the former chief constable, Phil Gormley. Dame Elish said complaints against senior officers in Scotland should be dealt with more speedily. She has also called for wider use of body cameras by on-duty officers. Read more. John Yuill and Lamara Bell were found in the car three days after the crash was first reported Police Scotland is to change the way it handles calls to 101 and 999 services. It follows a report from HM Inspector of Constabulary which recommended improvements to the way risk and vulnerability of callers was assessed. Independent watchdogs have also highlighted failures in a number of cases in which vulnerable people have been found dead despite calls for help. Police chiefs said the new approach would improve the force's ability to despatch officers to urgent incidents. Read more. Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur Lib Dem MSP Liam McArthur reminds the chamber his party consistently opposed the centralisation that lies at the heart of the 2012 Act. Warnings were repeatedly given about accountability and transparency by his party he adds. The Lib Dem MSP reminds the chamber about serious concerns raised about call handling, not dealt with before the tragic deaths of Lamara Bell and John Yuill. They were found dead in a car three days after the crash was first reported. He goes on to say the public would want the parliament to carry out its role and not let Police Scotland and the SPA mark their own homework. The number of police officers in Scotland has risen to its highest level since the end of 2017. Figures published by the Scottish government show there were 17,251 officers in the national force at the end of March. This represents an increase of 77 on the previous quarter. The numbers reflect the force's decision to accelerate recruitment to deal with any uncertainty caused by the Brexit process. Read more. Allow Twitter content?

He expresses concern about the potential of collateral damage while new technology is rolled out, such as facial recognition. Demands on police change with legislation, Mr Finnie states, pointing to the new domestic abuse law which he describes as quite resource intensive. That might mean officers are off the street but this is still a very important function, he explains. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour MSP James Kelly Labour MSP James Kelly stresses the importance of post-legislative scrutiny over Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service. Mr Kelly starts with Police Scotland and issues around the SPA and relating to the role of ministers in terms of governance. The Labour MSP is concerned there is a deficit in Police Scotland funding of Â£35.7m that could lead to a shortfall of 100 officers. He warns the service and the safety of the public may be crucially undermined. Turning to the fire service, Mr Kelly says the FBU is very supportive about the move to a single service. He points out there are 648 less firefighters diminishing the frontline service. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tory MSP Liam Kerr highlights that the committee broadly agreed that governance within Police Scotland did not need to change despite issues with chief constables since it was established. This was put down to individual personalities rather than a governance problem, he states. He suggests there are insufficient numbers of officers, highlighting suggestions that police in Aberdeen are struggling to tackle drug dealing because of this. At least Â£70m extra is required to stop a cut to staff numbers he states. He also expresses concern about capital funding not being met more broadly, explaining this is why the vehicle fleet is ageing. Mr Kerr also highlights concerns about reduced numbers of firefighters. A recruitment drive to hire 300 firefighters across Scotland has been launched. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) said its latest campaign will actively encourage people from a wide range of backgrounds to apply. Just 5% of Scotland's 3,000 firefighters are women and less than 1% belong to an ethnic minority. The recruitment push comes as up to half of the SFRS workforce is eligible for retirement in the next decade. Read more. Mr Yousaf Mr Yousaf pivots to the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, the largest in the UK. He says last year's Glasgow School of Art fire and the recent huge fire in Moray reminds us of the bravery of our firefighters. Protecting frontline services is the government priority, he tells the chamber he adds. The committee concluded that although reform had led to greater consistency of service across Scotland, as well as allowing for more equal access to specialist capabilities and support, a number of issues, particularly within Police Scotland, should be further addressed. The committee's report on policing indicated that poor financial management, unclear lines of responsibility and a failure to focus on the views of officers and staff in the early stages of reform lie at the root of many of the problems faced by Police Scotland. Among the issues highlighted were forecast savings not being realised, IT problems hampering police effectiveness and a string of well-publicised personnel problems resulting in senior management ""instability and concerns over a lack of clear leadership"" in the initial years of the reform process. A need for an exemption for police and fire services from the payment of VAT was also highlighted in the committee's considerations. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf says the Act was the biggest change to the public sector since devolution. He welcomes the Justice Committee's reports, saying it both points to positive aspects of the mergers as well as highlighting challenges which need to be addressed. Policing services in Scotland have been protected and improved by the change, he states. The justice secretary also points out that police numbers are at the highest point they have been. He commits to engaging closely with the SPA and chief constable of Police Scotland to ensure the service continues to deliver, as well as continuing to sufficient fund it. Ms Mitchell now moves on to talk about the report into the fire and rescue service. The committee convener says Audit Scotland said the merger of the eight fire and rescue services had been handled effectively. Currently the fire service is on track to meet its savings targets and perhaps exceed them, says Ms Mitchell, with frontline services being maintained. Less encouraging was the retained duty service, described as ""not fit for purpose"" by Audit Scotland she says. Ms Mitchell says the goal of the 2012 Act was to see local authority engagement with the fire service improve. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Johnston suffered from debilitating mental health issues throughout his career Daniel Johnston, whose guileless, homemade recordings inspired dozens of musicians from Kurt Cobain to Lana Del Rey, has died at the age of 58. The songwriter and artist ""passed away of natural causes"" at his home in Texas, said his family in a statement. He was mourned online by those he inspired, including musician Beck and film star Elijah Wood, who called him ""a gentle, beautiful treasure,external"".

Born in California in 1961 and raised in West Virginia, Johnston became known as a songwriter after moving to Austin, Texas. His reputation in the city grew after he started handing out cassette tapes of his no-frills home recordings to people in the street. A cult figure on the local music scene, he gained wider exposure when MTV filmed a programme on the Austin music scene in 1985 for its series The Cutting Edge. Johnston's performance brought him almost overnight acclaim, and his early home recordings received a belated vinyl release on the indie label Homestead. He was never an accomplished player, and his pinched, high tenor vocals ensured he would never be a mainstream star - but the aching emotional sincerity of songs Life In Vain and True Love Will Find You In The End, earned him a fiercely loyal fanbase.

Kurt Cobain once described him as ""the best songwriter on earth,"" and famously wore one of Johnston's t-shirts to the 1992 MTV Awards. Other musicians who have covered Johnston's songs include Pearl Jam, Tom Waits, Wilco, Death Cab for Cutie, Sufjan Stevens and Yo La Tengo. In 2013, Lana Del Rey and rapper Mac Miller each contributed $10,000 to fund a short film about the singer, with Del Rey recording a version of his song about heartbreak,Some Things Last A Long Time,externalfor the soundtrack. Johnston was also known as an artist and comic-book writer, and his magic marker cartoon drawings were an inspiration for The Simpsons' creator Matt Groening. In 1993, he was asked to turn Jeremiah the Innocent, the alien frog featured on the cover of his album Hi, How Are You, into a mural in Austin. In 2006, his artwork was featured in a major exhibition at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art. Fans have been laying flowers at the foot of Johnston's mural following news of his death But Johnston was plagued by mental health problems, including bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, that hindered his career and endangered his life - including one incident where he attempted to crash a plane being piloted by his father. A harrowing documentary, The Devil and Daniel Johnston, released in 2005, showed how fragile he had become, while bringing his music and story to a new audience. ""It sure was embarrassing,""Johnston reflected in an interview with the Austin Chronicle,external. ""Every terrible dilemma, every fabled mistake. Nothing I can do about it now, though. I wish they'd added a laugh track to it, because it sure is funny"". Johnston's own musical output had slowed in recent years and, following a farewell tour in 2017, he was largely confined to the family home. His brother, Dick Johnston, told the New York Times he had been treated for kidney issues shortly before his death. ""He was still productive, writing songs and drawing, and was just annoyed by his health more than anything,""he said,external. ""It was just one thing after another."" In a statement posted on Facebook,external, Johnston's family remembered him as ""a friend to all"". ""Although he struggled with mental health issues for much of his adult life, Daniel triumphed over his illness through his prolific output of art and songs. ""He inspired countless fans, artists, and songwriters with his message that no matter how dark the day that ""the sun shines down on me"" and ""true love will find you in the end.""

""There are not enough words I can say about the vitality of Daniel Johnston's musical spirit,""said musician Zola Jesus,external. ""He was a huge inspiration to me, to follow my creative impulses no matter how messy or simple."" Indie band Death Cab For Cutie, who covered Johnston's song Dream Scream, wrote that their ""hearts were heavy,external"".

"Another step has been taken towards the potential creation of a bridge or tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland. An official feasibility studyis to look at the possibility of some kind of ""fixed link"". The research is being carried out as part of wider efforts to improve UK transport connectivity. Two engineering experts will assess the scheme - along with outline costs and timescale and any associated work needed. Official feasibility study for Irish Sea link Will the 'Boris Bridge' ever rise from the seas? The idea has been around for some time with two potential routes suggested - from Portpatrick to Larne, or near Campbeltown to the Antrim coast. However, are cost and technical issues likely to rule it out before it begins? Portpatrick would be one potential point for the bridge being built The price of any construction would, obviously, be dependent on the route chosen. Sources have said the most likely option is between Portpatrick and Larne. More than a decade ago the think tank, the Centre for Cross Border Studies,suggested a 21-mile bridge from Dumfries and Galloway could provide international rail links and ease the strain on air services.,external At that time it estimated the cost of the scheme would be about Â£3.5bn. However, the suggested price tag has risen considerably since then. Some experts have suggested Â£15bn might be required for the project but others have said that Â£20bn would be a ""conservative estimate"". The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge runs for 30 miles over water In terms of distance - at more than 20 miles for the Portpatrick project - that bridge would not be the longest over water in the world. That honour goes, according to Guinness World Records, to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge which has 48.3km (about 30 miles) of its span over water. It credits the 36km (22.4 mile) Hangzhou Bay Bridge as the structure spanning the greatest expanse of open sea. They are all dwarfed by the longest bridge of all - the Danyang-Kunshan Grand Bridge - at 164 km (102 miles) which stretches the furthest but not over water. The construction costs of major bridges, such as the Yangtze bridge, run into billions of pounds According to a previous report by Channel 4, Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to know ""the risks around the project"" - including ""WW2 munitions in the Irish Sea"". This is nothing new as concerns have long been expressed about the area known as Beaufort's Dyke - a deep submarine trench where it has been estimated that more than one million tonnes of weapons have been jettisoned. Between logistics and costs, some have dismissed the scheme as unlikely to ever happen. Last year Scotland's transport secretary Michael Mathesonbranded it a Â£20bn ""vanity project"". However, one of the UK's leading architects Prof Alan Dunlop told Channel 4 News there would always be ""naysayers"". ""Such a project could be potentially tremendous for the country and show us as a forward looking and thinking country,"" he said. He also previously told the BBC: ""We do have incredibly talented architects and engineers in Scotland so I am sure that as a technical challenge it wouldn't be insurmountable."" It's understood one of the options being considered is a bridge which turns into a tunnel, before reverting to a bridge. This video can not be played What do people in Portpatrick think of the Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge? Larne has been suggested as one end of the huge construction project Plans for some kind of link - either a tunnel or a bridge - go back as far as the 1890s but, despite much consideration, nothing has ever been built. However, some political will has emerged in recent years. In Northern Ireland, a proposal was contained in the 2015 DUP manifesto. One MP told the BBC a bridge could make travel ""less expensive and probably more certain"". Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was ""certainly not averse"" to the proposal being examined but felt there were other ""more immediate priorities"" for investment. In particular, it highlighted the trunk roads network from the Cairnryan ports to the motorway network. The Scottish government has said that any such project would require close examination before it could even be considered. ""We are always keen to talk about how we can strengthen connections between Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland,"" a spokesman said. ""There are an obvious number of practical obstacles and challenges to such a concept, and it would require a robust assessment of the costs or benefits of such a project in the first instance."" The UK government has now said that it will look at the feasibility of a bridge or tunnel as part of a wider review of transport links. A report is expected back in the summer.

"This video can not be played 'We are on track to be fully prepared' It is ""more important than ever"" that Parliament is recalled after the government published an assessment of the possible impact of a no-deal Brexit, Labour has said. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer saidthe Yellowhammer document,externalconfirms there are ""severe risks"" if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. MPs forced the release of the file before Parliament was suspended. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said the government was mitigating the risks. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the planning document only showed what might happen ""if the government didn't do anything about it"". But he added ""lots of measures"" were being taken to reduce risks. What does Yellowhammer say about no-deal Brexit? How are the UK's talks with the EU going? Judges rule Parliament suspension is unlawful Sir Keir said recalling Parliament would allow MPs ""the opportunity to scrutinise these documents and take all steps necessary to stop no deal"". His comments followed a ruling by Scotland's highest civil court on Wednesdaythat the government's proroguing of Parliament was unlawful. The Yellowhammer file, which is redacted in parts and almost identical to a versionleaked to the Sunday Times last month, was released on Wednesday. It says in a reasonable worst-case scenario a no-deal Brexit could lead to: a ""decrease"" in certain types of fresh food and ""shorter supply"" of key ingredients price rises for food and fuel, which would ""disproportionately"" affect those with low incomes ""disruption lasting up to six months"" potentially affecting medicines and medical supplies protests and counter-protests across the UK lorries waiting for more than two days to cross the English Channel The document also says some businesses could cease trading, the black market could grow, and some adult social care providers might fail. On the Northern Ireland border, the report says the current plans for ""no new checks with limited exceptions"" are ""likely to prove unsustainable due to a significant economic, legal and biosecurity risks"". But former PM Gordon Brown said the government was ""still not telling the truth"" about the ""sheer scale"" of the possible effects of no deal. ""The worst-case scenario document downplays the risks to medical supplies, the threat to household budgets and the damage inflicted on the most vulnerable,"" he said. Last week, MPspassed a bill by 327 votes to 299that forces the PM to ask for an extension beyond the 31 October Brexit deadline if a deal is not reached with the EU. However, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he would rather ""die in a ditch"" than request an extension, and at present the UK is still due to leave the EU on Halloween. Michael Gove, the cabinet minister with responsibility for no-deal planning, told the BBC the government had taken ""considerable steps"" to ensure the safest possible departure after a no-deal Brexit in the six weeks since 2 August, the date that appears on the document. On Wednesday, he said ""revised assumptions"" would be published ""in due course alongside a document outlining the mitigations the government has put in place and intends to put in place"". What is the UK doing to get ready for a no-deal Brexit? What questions do you have about Brexit? Vets concerned over animal medicines in no-deal The bill also required the release of communications between No 10 aides about Parliament's suspension but ministers have refused to do this. This video can not be played It's been a fairly extraordinary few days in the House of Commons Mr Gove said,externalMPs' request to see e-mails, texts and WhatsApp messages from Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson's chief aide, and eight other advisers in Downing Street were ""unreasonable and disproportionate"". Publishing the information, he added, would ""contravene the law"" and ""offend against basic principles of fairness"". However, former justice secretary David Gauke told BBC Radio 5 Live the messages ""should be handed over"". He added: ""I understand the concerns about private advice but on this particular issueâ¦ this is work-related information to get to the bottom of why Parliament was prorogued."" Concern about medicines is understandable. Every month more than 30 million packs of medicines arrive from the EU. Supply chains are considered particularly vulnerable to disruption at the Channel ports - the Yellowhammer document itself acknowledges this. The government has put out contracts for warehouse space and fridges to stockpile supplies. But there are some medicines that cannot be stored, like radioisotopes used for cancer treatment. Flu vaccines will also need to be imported - the winter vaccination programme will be well under way by 31 October. There are plans in place to fly in emergency supplies if shortages of crucial products arise. But fears remain. However, it is not just about medicines. Hospitals feed about 120,000 patients a day - any disruption to the food chain could impact on them. And then there is social care. The Yellowhammer document warns that inflation could cause social care providers to go under - the market is already fragile. In this situation it is the responsibility of councils to step and find new care homes for residents affected or new providers to care for people in their own homes. The document also warns of potential clashes if foreign fishing vessels enter British territorial waters on the day after the UK's departure and says economic difficulties could be ""exacerbated"" by flooding or a flu pandemic this winter. BBC political correspondent Chris Mason said some of the scenarios outlined were ""stark"", but ministers were insisting the paper was not a prediction about what will happen. The document, which, until now, was categorised as ""official, sensitive"", is not an official cabinet paper. It dates from 10 days after Mr Johnson became PM. Retailers said the document confirmed what they have been saying will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. ""Fresh food availability will decrease, consumer choice will decrease, and prices will rise,"" Helen Dickinson of the British Retail Consortium said. And the British Medical Association described the Yellowhammer file as ""alarming"" and that it confirmed its warnings about no-deal, including the threat of medical supply shortages. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald told BBC Breakfast: ""This is more like emergency planning for war or a natural disaster and we're doing this voluntarily."" This is not an ""old"" Yellowhammer assessment, as was claimed by the government in August. It is from the latest internal no-deal planning, from August, from well within the time of Boris Johnson's administration. The government hopes that its recent efforts will change some of the most concerning aspects of what is titled a ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" document, but they are yet to be able to make those changes. Everything hinges on the core assumption made about disruption to freight traffic across the Channel - that over half would be stuck for up to two-and-a-half days. Those assumptions on trade flow have improved recently, but are still poor, and enough to have several highly concerning consequences, from fresh food supply, to stability in Northern Ireland, to social care providers and supplies of medicines for people and animals. I have also been assured that a widely circulated version of this document, from the same day, had the phrase ""base scenario"". It is somewhat confusing that there can be a base case of a worst case planning assumption. In any event, these are the real, plausible short-term shocks from a no-deal Brexit. The section on Northern Ireland is particularly concerning. In many respects it is incredible to have such a list of the plausible consequences of what is government policy. It is not difficult to see why the government resisted its release. It is unlikely to improve the mood of an already sceptical Commons. But it is really the first tangible, quotable, warts and all assessment of what Whitehall fears could be around the corner. What questions do you have about the latest Brexit developments?

"A revised Brexit deal, acceptable to both UK and EU negotiators, remains elusive. Only a few people know exactly what has been discussed behind closed doors, and the legal text of any proposed agreement has not been made public. But it's worth bearing in mind that most of the deal hammered out by Theresa May's government -the withdrawal agreementand the accompanying political declaration - would remain in place. The main changes Boris Johnson's government wants to see concern the Irish border, and the type of relationship it wishes the UK to have with the EU in the future. All sides have ruled out customs checks at the land border in Ireland (between Northern Ireland and the Republic), and Mr Johnson's suggestion that checks could take place at ""designated locations"" away from the border was rejected by the EU. That means there would have to be some customs checks within the UK instead, at ports along the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That's a big UK concession. But Mr Johnson also insists that Northern Ireland has to leave the EU customs union, along with the rest of the UK, to allow it to take advantage of any future trade deals the government manages to negotiate. The suggested compromise is that the legal customs border between the UK and the EU would be at the land border in Ireland. But the practical border, where checks would actually take place, would be in the Irish Sea. Diplomats say that means Northern Ireland would remain legally in the UK customs territory but it would apply EU customs processes on goods arriving from Great Britain. There would be exemptions, including on personal items and other goods, to be agreed at a later date by the UK and the EU. So it's a dual customs system, which has no obvious parallel anywhere else in the world, and it raises plenty of technical and legal issues which will take some time to pin down. There's also the issue of political consent in Northern Ireland. Both sides agree that any new economic status for Northern Ireland, which sets it apart from the rest of the country, needs to win democratic approval. But the EU won't accept anything that appears to give a veto to one party in Northern Ireland, in this case the government's allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). That, in the EU's view, would mean the entire proposed settlement on the Irish border could be unexpectedly torn up with nothing to replace it. The Northern Ireland Assembly has not been sitting for more than 1,000 days For its part, the DUP has been arguing that the Good Friday agreement, which forms the basis of the Northern Ireland peace process, provides for a dual majority (in other words a majority among both unionist and nationalist representatives) on controversial issues in the Northern Ireland assembly. Others in Northern Ireland argue that if a dual majority is needed, then the prospect of Northern Ireland leaving the EU should also be subject to similar dual consent. Diplomats say the latest draft agreement outlines a plan which would give the Northern Ireland Assembly a consent vote four years after the Brexit transition period ends in 2020. If it voted to continue the new arrangements by a simple majority, another vote would be held four years later. If the vote was carried with a dual majority it would be held again eight years later. Diplomats say that if the Assembly voted to end the arrangements, the UK and the EU would have two years to negotiate a new method to avoid a hard border. All of this would replace the so-called backstop- the proposed guarantee to avoid a hard border in Ireland under all circumstances. But so far, the DUP has made it pretty clear that it cannot accept the proposals as they stand. The UK has submitted a new draft of the political declaration on the future relationship. Again, the text has not been made public, but Mr Johnson has made it clear that he wants a looser economic relationship with the EU in the future than Mrs May was seeking. Diplomats say the political declaration will point towards a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU with zero tariffs or quotas, but one which is embedded in a framework for economic competition that is ""fair"". One of the key phrases to watch out for here is the ""level playing field"" - the degree to which the UK will agree to stick closely to EU regulations on things like social and environmental policies. Mr Johnson wants to make fewer level playing field guarantees, and the EU fears that could mean he will seek to undercut EU regulation in the future to gain a competitive advantage. And that in turn has made a number of EU countries even more determined that any solution for the Irish border is legally watertight and fully thought through, before they sign up to any amended Brexit deal. In any complex negotiation, there is nearly always an issue bubbling under the surface which emerges as a last-minute hitch. This time it is VAT, and how to prevent fraud involving goods crossing any new border arrangement. On all of these issues, time is against the negotiators and their political masters. Mr Johnson still says he is determined to leave the EU on 31 October. But if the House of Commons has not voted in favour either of a deal or of leaving with no deal by 19 October, then UK law says he must seek an extension to the Brexit process. The EU has said it will not negotiate directly with Mr Johnson during the summit, which begins on Thursday. But the next few days are obviously crucial. Brexit - British exit - refers to the UK leaving the EU. A public vote was held in June 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain.

"The government has released an assessment of the possible effects of a no-deal Brexit on the UK, after MPs demanded that it be made public. The document, marked as ""Official Sensitive"" and dated 2 August 2019,outlines a series of ""reasonable worst-case planning assumptions"". It was drawn up as part of ""Operation Yellowhammer"" - the name for the government's contingency plan to prepare for leaving the European Union (EU) without a deal. The government says it is spending an extra Â£2.1bn on no-deal planning and is updating these planning assumptions. So, what does the document say and what is being done - as far as we know - to prepare for no-deal? What Yellowhammer document says: Between 50-85% of UK lorries travelling to the EU may not be ready for French customs Lack of readiness and limited space in French ports could cut HGV traffic by 40-60% and lead to disruption lasting three months This would lead to significant queues in Kent. In a worst-case scenario, it could take lorries up to two-and-a-half days before being able to cross into France What's being done: To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The Port of Dover in Kent handles approximately 10,500 lorries a day. To prevent nearby roads from clogging up, the government has a traffic management plan codenamed Operation Brock. If the plan is activated, up to 2,000 lorries will be held in a queue leading to the port. Other traffic will be kept flowing around the queued-up lorries, in what is known as a contraflow system. A fallback option would be to divert lorries to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time. If further capacity was still required, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile  M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. But there is a still a lot of confusion, according to Rona Hunnisett, from the Freight Transport Association. ""The report shows there's still significant detail to be clarified if Britain is to keep trading efficiently,"" she says. ""Businesses can only prepare for, and implement, new processes once, and still need confirmation of what they are to adopt in the way of new practices."" What Yellowhammer document says: Certain types of fresh food supply will decrease Key ingredients may be in shorter supply There will not be an overall shortage of food in the UK, but may be reduced availability and choice Prices may increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" What's being done: The government has said that it will continue to recognise EU standards for food being imported into the UK, to minimise disruption. The British Retail Consortium has said,externalretailers are doing all they can to prepare for no-deal, but will not be able to prevent all negative effects. It stresses that many fresh fruits and vegetables will be out of season in the UK and that there will be a shortage of warehouse space ahead of Christmas. ""No deal Brexit would be extremely disruptive to the supply chains that we operate, particularly the fresh food supply chains,"" Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's told BBC News. ""There will inevitably be disruption simply because we've never done this before,"" he added, although he also said that previous delays to the Brexit date mean ""there's probably more understanding of what could go wrong and therefore more contingency planning"". Another factor is what tariffs (the taxes on imports) will be charged on food coming into the UK. The governmentpublished a ""tariff schedule"",externalin March, which removed most tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit That means some food from outside the EU that currently attract a tariff could be cheaper, but some goods from the EU that are currently imported with 0% tariffs, like beef and dairy, will now carry tariffs, and so could become more expensive. What Yellowhammer document says: Supply chains for medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at the Channel ports While some products can be stockpiled, others cannot because they have a short shelf life It will not be practical to stockpile products to cover expected delays of up to six months An increase in inflation would ""significantly impact"" adult social care providers and may lead to some failing, with smaller providers impacted within two-three months. What's being done: At the end of June, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) started putting out contracts for freight, warehouse space and fridges. These will be used to stockpile medicines and fly in those which cannot be stored, like radioisotopes for cancer treatment. Of the Â£2.1bn pledged for no-deal preparations, Â£434m has been set aside for this. That includes a Â£25m contract for planes to bring in emergency medical supplies within 24 hours. Ahead of the UK's original departure date of 29 March - then extended to 12 April - the DHSC said thousands of medicines had been analysed to work out what might be affected by supply disruption from the EU. Suppliers stockpiled an additional six weeks' worth of these drugs over and above the usual ""buffer"" stock. This exercise is being repeated to ensure the department is ""as prepared for leaving the EU without a deal in October as it was on 29 March and 12 April"". Specific ferry routes were made available for suppliers to book onto 11 weeks before the no-deal deadline in March. Six weeks before the 31 October deadline, the government had only just opened the bidding process to freight firms competing to transport medicines. So the pharmaceutical industry doesn't currently know which ports and ferry routes will be made available. Steve Bates, an industry official working with government on no-deal planning, said the time frame to make sure everything was in place for the October deadline was ""significantly compressed"". He said the difference for drug suppliers between three months and potentially three weeks to put plans into action was ""material"". On social care, the government website advises providers to draw up contingency plans and support EU staff who may be working for them. Plans are in place to ensure there are enough essential medicines like insulin What Yellowhammer document says: There will be no immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies However, there are likely to be significant price rises if the UK splits from the EU single energy market, which could happen months or years after Brexit This could lead to some energy companies leaving the market Public water supplies are likely to remain largely unaffected What's being done: In the event of no-deal, the UK has said it will not impose tariffs on electricity and gas coming into the country. However, if the value of the pound falls in response to a no-deal Brexit, it will become more expensive to import energy from abroad. The government intends to remain part of the single energy market, in order for the UK's energy laws to continue to work after Brexit and that supplies are not disrupted. Water is unlikely to be affected, although there is still a low risk in the event of a chemical supply problem. The Yellowhammer report says water companies are well-prepared and have significant stockpiles of critical chemicals. What Yellowhammer document says: The government's planned short-term solution for the border is likely to be unsustainable because of the ""economic, legal and biosecurity risks"" it presents Trade between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic will be ""severely disrupted"" Some businesses will stop trading, some will move and some will experience higher costs that they may pass on to customers Agriculture will be hardest hit, leading to job losses, protests and direct action with road blockages Growth of the ""illegitimate economy"" around the border ""where criminal and dissident groups already operate"" What's being done: The UK government has said it is committed not to have any physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. On 13 Marchit published its contingency plan,externalto avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It said it would not bring in new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for any goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland, in the event of no-deal. But this will only be a temporary measure while negotiations take place to find longer-term solutions. Government has no plans for Irish border controls To protect people's health, some plant and animal products that come into Northern Ireland from outside the EU, via Ireland, will still need to be checked. The UK government has said these checks will not happen at the border itself, but it has not specified exactly where they will take place. It remains unclear what will happen to goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland. Under EU rules, checks would normally be required at the point certain goods enter the EU single market. The Irish government says it is securing additional space, and has recruited more customs and agriculture staff to allow for a ""significant increase in checks and procedures"". What Yellowhammer document says: Protests and counter-protests likely across the UK May be a rise in public disorder and community tensions Information-sharing between UK and EU law enforcement will be disrupted What is being done: The National Police Coordination Centre will plan the allocation of officers across the country althoughit has said there has been no intelligence,externalto suggest that any protests will not be peaceful. The government has also established the International Crime and Coordination Centre, which is supposed to help the police cope with the change to the UK's relationship with law enforcement agencies in the EU. 10 ways you could be affected by no deal Most imports tariff-free under no-deal plan What could happen to food prices after Brexit?

"This video can not be played ""I did everything right, everything that you should do"" A woman who says she was raped by a man she had been on a date with has told the BBC she was left ""devastated"" after prosecutors decided to drop her case. Annie Tisshaw says her mental health ""really suffered"" during the year-long investigation, and she was then told the CPS would not proceed further. A report,externalshows the number of rape convictions in England and Wales is at its lowest level since records began. There were 1,925 convictions in 2018-19 - a 27% drop from the previous year. This was in spite of allegations of rape reaching a high of 58,000 in England and Wales. Campaigners say the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has changed its approach in rape cases - no longer building rape prosecutions, but screening cases out if they think a jury will not convict. This is denied by the CPS, which has announced a review of its decisions in rape cases. 'Why did the CPS drop my rape case?' Why are rape prosecutions falling? 'Rape cases dropped' over police phone searches Annie, who has waived her right to anonymity, told the Victoria Derbyshire show that she was raped in her own flat after she had been on a date with a man she had met a few times before. She says she reported the incident straight after it happened, handed over her phone, and the case was passed by police to the CPS, who told her it was ""a positive case"". ""I've done everything right that you should do and then at the end, nearly a year later, I was told there were inconsistencies in the case."" Those included CCTV from earlier in the night, which showed she wasn't looking ""particularly scared or nervous"", and text messages sent before the alleged rape, she says. ""This was a guy that I trusted, this was a guy that I had met before, so obviously at that time I didn't know it was going to happen,"" she says. ""My mental health really, really suffered throughout the police case. It's devastating that I've gone through all of that and it's just been dropped."" This video can not be played Bonny Turner says the CPS dropped her case even though her alleged rapist apologised to her on Facebook Messenger Another woman, Lizi, told the BBC she spent ""49 weeks of my life consumed by anxiety and anorexia"" before she heard her case was being dropped. ""All I really remember from that call is screaming and sobbing,"" she said. The annual Violence Against Women and Girls report shows the number of reports of rape that end in a conviction is about 3%. The figures also reveal that the number of suspects charged with rape or another offence has fallen, from 2,822 in 2017-18 to 1,758 in 2018-19. In 2007-08, when records were first compiled in the current way, 2,220 cases resulted in a charge. Of those, 2,201 cases resulted in a conviction - although some would be for investigations started in previous years. The conviction figure takes in the number of suspects initially investigated for rape who were later convicted of rape or other offences, such as sexual assault or indecent assault. This video can not be played Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill says he ""would be worried"" by the figures if he were a victim of sexual violence The CPS - whose budget has been cut by 25% since 2010 - says it has worked hard to improve how it deals with sexual offence cases. It explains the drop by saying it is getting fewer rape referrals from police - a 23% fall from the previous year - and that cases are taking longer because of digital evidence and the demands to disclose material to the defence. A coalition of women's organisations, represented by the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ), is looking to take legal action against the CPS over claims cases are being ""dropped"" without good reason. Lawyer Harriet Wistrich, founder of the CWJ, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was ""compelling"" evidence the collapse in prosecutions was mainly caused by ""a deliberate change in the approach taken by the CPS dating back to late 2016"". Dame Vera Baird, the victims' commissioner, called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene by giving the justice system adequate resources and funding support services for survivors. She questioned whether ""abandoning thousands of cases of potentially traumatised men and women"" was ""ineptitude"" or ""deliberate policy"" by prosecutors. Max Hill, director of public prosecutions, denied there had been a change in approach from prosecutors at the CPS, but said he shared concerns at the ""growing gap"" between reported rapes and the number of prosecutions. He told Today: ""I am not going to point the finger in any particular direction. We - all of us working in the criminal justice system -  need to come together now to discuss this."" Deputy Chief Constable Sarah Crew, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for rape and adult sexual offences, said the decline in convictions reflects ""a justice system that is stretched and under pressure"". But she said police were working with victims' groups to address issues that prevent people from reporting rape or from continuing to support an investigation. The independent CPS watchdog, Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, has also launched a review of charging decisions in rape cases. Why do so few rape cases go to court?

This video can not be played Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill says he ""would be worried"" by the figures if he were a victim of sexual violence The CPS - whose budget has been cut by 25% since 2010 - says it has worked hard to improve how it deals with sexual offence cases. It explains the drop by saying it is getting fewer rape referrals from police - a 23% fall from the previous year - and that cases are taking longer because of digital evidence and the demands to disclose material to the defence. A coalition of women's organisations, represented by the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ), is looking to take legal action against the CPS over claims cases are being ""dropped"" without good reason. Lawyer Harriet Wistrich, founder of the CWJ, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was ""compelling"" evidence the collapse in prosecutions was mainly caused by ""a deliberate change in the approach taken by the CPS dating back to late 2016"". Dame Vera Baird, the victims' commissioner, called on Prime Minister Boris Johnson to intervene by giving the justice system adequate resources and funding support services for survivors. She questioned whether ""abandoning thousands of cases of potentially traumatised men and women"" was ""ineptitude"" or ""deliberate policy"" by prosecutors. Max Hill, director of public prosecutions, denied there had been a change in approach from prosecutors at the CPS, but said he shared concerns at the ""growing gap"" between reported rapes and the number of prosecutions. He told Today: ""I am not going to point the finger in any particular direction. We - all of us working in the criminal justice system -  need to come together now to discuss this."" Deputy Chief Constable Sarah Crew, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for rape and adult sexual offences, said the decline in convictions reflects ""a justice system that is stretched and under pressure"". But she said police were working with victims' groups to address issues that prevent people from reporting rape or from continuing to support an investigation. The independent CPS watchdog, Her Majesty's Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate, has also launched a review of charging decisions in rape cases. Why do so few rape cases go to court?

"In-game spending should be regulated by gambling laws and so-called loot boxes banned entirely for children, MPs say. The industry's UK trade body responded it would ""review these recommendations with utmost seriousness"". But the committee of MPs had accused some of those who had given evidence of a ""lack of honesty and transparency"". Free video games often encourage players to buy virtual loot boxes, which contain an unspecified amount of items to improve further game-play. Some games have associated online marketplaces where players can trade or sell these items. Have your say: Should loot boxes be banned? 'My son spent Â£3,160 in one game' EA games: Loot boxes aren't gambling, they're just like a Kinder Egg Loot boxes should be banned, says US senator The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee's inquiry into addictive and immersive technologies heard stories of young adults who had built up debts of thousands of pounds through spending in games. Jagex, the company behind online game RuneScape, admitted players could spend up to Â£1,000 a week or Â£5,000 a month. But the MPs found the industry was reluctant to accept responsibility for intervening when a player was over-spending or even to put a figure on how much was too much. And some had been ""wilfully obtuse"" in answering questions about game-play, which MPs needed to know in order to better understand how players engaged with games. Without naming names, they said they had sometimes found it difficult to get full and clear answers from the gaming industry representatives who had appeared before them, in particular when it came to answering questions about what data they collected, how it was used and the psychology underpinning how games were designed. ""Social media platforms and online games makers are locked in a relentless battle to capture ever more of people's attention, time and money,"" Mr Collins said. ""Their business models are built on this but it's time for them to be more responsible in dealing with the harms these technologies can cause for some users."" In response Dr Jo Twist, the chief executive of UK Interactive Entertainment, said: """"The video games industry has always, and will continue to, put the welfare of players at the heart of what we do. ""The industry does not dispute that, for a minority, finding balance is a problem. ""This is why we are vocal in supporting efforts to increase digital literacy and work with schools and carers on education programmes."" But Mr Collins said the games industry should contribute financially towards independent research into the long-term effects of gaming. ""Gaming disorder based on excessive and addictive game-play has been recognised by the World Health Organization,"" he said. ""It's time for game companies to use the huge quantities of data they gather about their players to do more to proactively identify vulnerable gamers."" The MPs also called for both social media platforms and game-makers to establish effective age-verification tools. Currently both rely on a honesty system and, as a result, there are large numbers of under-age users on social media and playing games. Loot boxes offer a variety of rewards that can improve game-play Loot boxes should not be sold to children and should instead be earned as rewards for game-play, the MPs said. ""Loot boxes are particularly lucrative for games companies but come at a high cost, particularly for problem gamblers, while exposing children to potential harm,"" Mr Collins said. ""Buying a loot box is playing a game of chance and it is high time the gambling laws caught up. ""We challenge the government to explain why loot boxes should be exempt from the Gambling Act."" There is growing international disquiet about loot boxes, with a US senator calling for them to be banned and the government of Belgium ruling they were in violation of gambling laws. China has restricted the number of loot boxes players can open each day. Sweden is also investigating them.

"Cancer survival in the UK is on the up, but is still lagging behind other high-income countries, analysis suggests. Five-year survival rates for rectal and colon cancer improved the most since 1995, and pancreatic cancer the least. Advances in treatment and surgery are thought to be behind the UK's progress. But the UK still performed worse than Australia, Canada, Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand and Norway,the study in Lancet Oncology,externalfound. Cancer Research UK said the UK could do better and called for more ""investment in the NHS and the systems and innovations that support it"". The research looked at data on nearly four million patients with seven types of cancer - oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, lung and ovary - from seven high-income countries. The cancer patients were all diagnosed between 1995 and 2014. The estimated survival rates of people diagnosed with cancer increased in all seven countries over the period studied, from 1995-2014. But some countries did better than others. Australia was found to have higher survival rates than other countries, while the UK on the whole had lower survival rates. In fact, despite improvements, the UK is the worst for key cancers including lung, colon, rectum, stomach and pancreas. The 20 years of failure on cancer Cancer waiting times 'at worst level ever' The worst places for cancer care waits revealed Survival rates for stomach cancer In the UK, rectal cancer survival went up from 48% to 62% over 20 years. For colon cancer, there was good progress too - from 47% surviving for five years in 1995-99 to 59% in 2010-14. In comparison, Ireland made similar improvements, and Denmark even greater ones. Australia's survival increased to 71% for both rectal and colon cancer. Pancreatic cancer had the lowest five-year survival of all - ranging from 7.9% in the UK (lowest) to 14.6% in Australia (highest). Cancer survival rates in UK compared to other countries For lung cancer, Canada had the highest five-year survival (21.7%) while the UK had the lowest (14.7%). All countries had similar improvements in survival from stomach cancer, while Norway saw the highest five-year survival for ovarian cancer (46%). The improvements were better for the under-75s than the over-75s. The researchers say steady improvements by all countries in the study are probably due to major healthcare reforms and advances in technology, which have led to earlier diagnosis, more effective treatments and better managing of patients. Bowel (rectal and colon) had one of the largest increases in five-year survival. John Butler, consultant surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London and Cancer Research UK's clinical adviser, said this was due to better surgical techniques, greater use of radiotherapy and more older patients being treated. He added that improvements in the UK were the result of a combination of many different factors. Cancer treatments are improving across high-income countries, the study found ""Over the last 20 years we've seen improvements in cancer planning, development of national cancer strategies and the rollout of new diagnostic and treatment services. ""For lung, ovarian, and oesophageal cancer in particular, survival has increased largely because the quality of surgery has radically improved, and more surgery is taking place than before. ""More people are being looked after by specialist teams, rather than surgeons who aren't experts in that area."" Mr Butler said investing in early diagnosis and cancer care would play a big part in closing the survival gap on other countries. The UK government said other data showed that one-year survival rates in England, for all types of cancer, were at a record high. One-year survival has increased from 62% in 2001 to 72.8% in 2016. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Cancer survival rates are at a record high, but we are determined to go further and save even more lives. ""Through our NHS Long Term Plan, we will detect more cancers at an earlier stage, saving an estimated 55,000 lives a year. ""Alongside this, the record Â£33.9 billion extra a year we're investing in our NHS will help support the health service in recruiting the staff it needs for the future."" An NHS England spokeswoman said the report was out of date and pointed to improved survival rates. She said this was ""thanks to improvements in NHS cancer services, including the introduction of revolutionary treatments like proton beam therapy and immunotherapy"". The latest NHS data for cancer waiting times in shows hospitals are continuing to miss their target to see patients quickly. The NHS in England is meant to start treatment within 62 days of an urgent referral by a GP. But currently nearly one in four patients wait longer, according to figures released on Thursday. The other parts of the UK are also struggling to hit their targets.

"This video can not be played Excerpt from Babcock's design video The race to design and build a new generation of Royal Navy frigates has been won by engineering firm Babcock. It has been named preferred bidder for the Â£1.25bn contract for five Type 31 warships. The deal secures hundreds of jobs at Rosyth in Fife, where the ships will be assembled, with construction work expected to be spread between yards across the UK. Work is to begin by the end of 2019, with the first ships delivered in 2023. The Type 31 is a smaller, cheaper frigate than the Type 26 warships currently being built at the Upper Clyde shipyards. With a price ceiling of Â£250m per ship, the aim is to maintain the size of the Navy's surface fleet and generate export orders. Three firms in warship build contest MoD unveils UK shipyard strategy Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the modular construction method would support 2,500 jobs throughout the UK. He said the UK was ""a great shipbuilding nation"" and that there were ""all sorts of ways"" in which UK naval vessels were helping the modern world. He added: ""What it delivers is high quality jobs for young people - really high-skilled jobs for young people in this country - but also massive export opportunities of vessels that not only help to keep the peace but tackle piracy, help dealing with immigration issues across the seas."" The Babcock team's Arrowhead 140 design beat competition from a Cammell Laird/BAE Systems consortium and a bid led by Atlas Elektronik UK. The winning consortium also includes Thales and BMT, as well as Ferguson Marine, based in Port Glasgow, and Harland and Wolff in Belfast - both of which are currently in administration. Last month, Babcock insisted these firms' financial difficulties would not affect its bid because its ""flexible build approach"" could accommodate ""a range of delivery sites"". Scotland's Economy Secretary Derek Mackay said the awarding of the contract was ""testament to the skilled workforce and expertise which we have in Scotland"". He added: ""I have spoken with Babcock this morning to assure them they have the full support of the Scottish government. ""Once the final details of the contract are announced, we look forward to discussions on the role that Ferguson Marine could play alongside other suppliers in Scotland."" Unions also welcomed the announcement, with Unite saying it would secure hundreds of jobs at Rosyth ""for well over a decade"". GMB Scotland said it was ""excellent news"", adding that the team that put the bid together ""should be congratulated"". By Calum Watson, BBC Scotland news Three different designs were in the running for the Type 31 contract but they all have something in common - they're cheap. The price cap of Â£250m per ship might sound a lot of money but, to put it in context, the bill for the eight Type 26 frigates currently under construction comes to about Â£8bn. The extremely tight cost constraints on the new ship have led some critics to describe it as ""the Lidl frigate"". Each bidder has tried to keep the price down by basing its design on successful existing ships rather than starting from scratch. Babcock's ""Team 31"" design is derived from the Iver Huitfeldt frigates developed for the Danish navy. Plenty of flexibility has been factored in - equipment can be upgraded or reconfigured for different roles . The ship is sometimes referred to as the Type 31e - the ""e"" standing for exportability. The hope is that this ""bargain basement ship"" will prove its worth and orders from foreign navies will lead to economies of scale that will drive down costs. Such value for money, some argue, might even tempt the Royal Navy to bolster its surface fleet by increasing the order. The last big frigate order - for the Type 26 - was announced in the summer of 2014, just months before the Scottish independence referendum, with the work going to the BAE Systems yards in Glasgow. While the government insisted this was a value-for-money decision, many pro-union campaigners argued it demonstrated the benefits of being part of the UK. The 2015 Strategic Defence and Security Review scaled back the expected size of the Type 26 fleetfrom 13 to eight ships- and instead proposed building ""at least five"" new general purpose frigates, at a much lower cost. With no guarantee this work would come to Scotland, pro-independence campaigners condemned this as a broken promise. In 2017, the government's newNational Shipbuilding Strategy, based on Sir John Parker's independent review, sought to encourage competition in naval procurement, with an emphasis on supporting shipyards across the UK. The choice of Babcock - with its Rosyth site playing a key role in construction but with work spread across various UK sites - is in line with this strategy. It also reduces the government's reliance on BAE Systems, which has long been the dominant force in naval shipbuilding. The rival BAE Systems bid would have seen the company providing design expertise but the bulk of construction would have taken place at the Cammell Laird shipyard in Merseyside. Analysis by Douglas Fraser, Business and Economy Editor, BBC Scotland New Type 31 frigates will be built by Babcock in the Fife yard, as work comes to an end on the aircraft carrier programme In shipbuilding, they talk a lot about the need for a drumbeat, describing the rhythm of production of ships, to keep the workforce busy and efficient, like you'll find on a factory production line. The industry here has had an irregular drumbeat, partly because of lumpy government orders. And British shipbuilding has not been competitive in export markets. Instead, the larger yards, such as the two on the upper Clyde, have thrived only in the protected market of building warships for the Royal Navy. The Type 31e decision means there should be a steadier drumbeat of work. It's already on the Clyde, with the Type 26 frigate programme running until 2030. Soon, the Forth should have its own drumbeat at Rosyth. That's nearly a decade of work on both sides of Scotland. It's an opportunity to build in more efficiency, helped by an extra Â£50m Babcock investment in Rosyth facilities. What's much less clear than expected is what this means for Ferguson shipyard in Port Glasgow. It was part of the ""Babcock Team 31"", but at Rosyth, there's no talk of teams or consortiums now. Babcock is the preferred bidder (that is, the only one now in negotiations with the government). It has the capacity for all the work to be done at Rosyth, or it can choose how and where it sub-contracts. That is subject, however, to a lot of political pressure - if not instruction - as to how the contract should be shared around the UK, to fit with the government's shipbuilding strategy. So Ferguson has to fight with others for a share of the work, even including Cammell Laird on Merseyside with BAE Systems, which formed the losing bid. Another uncertainty that has to be built into this announcement stems from the dismal track record of Ministry of Defence estimates of timing and budget for its procurement. This one looks particularly ambitious in driving costs down.

"Another step has been taken towards the potential creation of a bridge or tunnel between Scotland and Northern Ireland. An official feasibility studyis to look at the possibility of some kind of ""fixed link"". The research is being carried out as part of wider efforts to improve UK transport connectivity. Two engineering experts will assess the scheme - along with outline costs and timescale and any associated work needed. Official feasibility study for Irish Sea link Will the 'Boris Bridge' ever rise from the seas? The idea has been around for some time with two potential routes suggested - from Portpatrick to Larne, or near Campbeltown to the Antrim coast. However, are cost and technical issues likely to rule it out before it begins? Portpatrick would be one potential point for the bridge being built The price of any construction would, obviously, be dependent on the route chosen. Sources have said the most likely option is between Portpatrick and Larne. More than a decade ago the think tank, the Centre for Cross Border Studies,suggested a 21-mile bridge from Dumfries and Galloway could provide international rail links and ease the strain on air services.,external At that time it estimated the cost of the scheme would be about Â£3.5bn. However, the suggested price tag has risen considerably since then. Some experts have suggested Â£15bn might be required for the project but others have said that Â£20bn would be a ""conservative estimate"". The Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge runs for 30 miles over water In terms of distance - at more than 20 miles for the Portpatrick project - that bridge would not be the longest over water in the world. That honour goes, according to Guinness World Records, to the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge which has 48.3km (about 30 miles) of its span over water. It credits the 36km (22.4 mile) Hangzhou Bay Bridge as the structure spanning the greatest expanse of open sea. They are all dwarfed by the longest bridge of all - the Danyang-Kunshan Grand Bridge - at 164 km (102 miles) which stretches the furthest but not over water. The construction costs of major bridges, such as the Yangtze bridge, run into billions of pounds According to a previous report by Channel 4, Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to know ""the risks around the project"" - including ""WW2 munitions in the Irish Sea"". This is nothing new as concerns have long been expressed about the area known as Beaufort's Dyke - a deep submarine trench where it has been estimated that more than one million tonnes of weapons have been jettisoned. Between logistics and costs, some have dismissed the scheme as unlikely to ever happen. Last year Scotland's transport secretary Michael Mathesonbranded it a Â£20bn ""vanity project"". However, one of the UK's leading architects Prof Alan Dunlop told Channel 4 News there would always be ""naysayers"". ""Such a project could be potentially tremendous for the country and show us as a forward looking and thinking country,"" he said. He also previously told the BBC: ""We do have incredibly talented architects and engineers in Scotland so I am sure that as a technical challenge it wouldn't be insurmountable."" It's understood one of the options being considered is a bridge which turns into a tunnel, before reverting to a bridge. This video can not be played What do people in Portpatrick think of the Scotland-Northern Ireland bridge? Larne has been suggested as one end of the huge construction project Plans for some kind of link - either a tunnel or a bridge - go back as far as the 1890s but, despite much consideration, nothing has ever been built. However, some political will has emerged in recent years. In Northern Ireland, a proposal was contained in the 2015 DUP manifesto. One MP told the BBC a bridge could make travel ""less expensive and probably more certain"". Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was ""certainly not averse"" to the proposal being examined but felt there were other ""more immediate priorities"" for investment. In particular, it highlighted the trunk roads network from the Cairnryan ports to the motorway network. The Scottish government has said that any such project would require close examination before it could even be considered. ""We are always keen to talk about how we can strengthen connections between Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland,"" a spokesman said. ""There are an obvious number of practical obstacles and challenges to such a concept, and it would require a robust assessment of the costs or benefits of such a project in the first instance."" The UK government has now said that it will look at the feasibility of a bridge or tunnel as part of a wider review of transport links. A report is expected back in the summer.

"A rise in public disorder, higher food prices and reduced medical supplies are real risks of leaving the EU with no deal, a UK government document says. Ministers have publisheddetails of their Yellowhammer contingency plan,external, after MPs voted to force its release. It outlines a series of ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" for the impact of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the paper confirmed the PM ""is prepared to punish those who can least afford it"". Michael Gove, one of Boris Johnson's senior cabinet colleagues who has been given responsibility for no-deal planning, said ""revised assumptions"" will be published ""in due course alongside a document outlining the mitigations the government has put in place and intends to put in place"". However, ministers have blocked the release of communications between No 10 aides about Parliament's suspension. Mr Gove said,externalMPs' request to see e-mails, texts and WhatsApp messages from Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson's chief aide, and eight other advisers in Downing Street were ""unreasonable and disproportionate"". Publishing the information, he added, would ""contravene the law"" and ""offend against basic principles of fairness"". Dominic Cummings was one of those named in the request to release communications The government sought to resist the publication of the Operation Yellowhammer document, but lost a vote on the issue in the Commons on Monday, prior to the suspension of Parliament, so it was compelled it to do so. The six-page document, dated 2 August andleaked to the Sunday Times last month, warns of disruption at Dover and other channel crossings for at least three months, an increased risk of public disorder, and some shortages of fresh food. On food, the document says certain types of fresh food supply ""will decrease"" and ""critical dependencies for the food chain"" such as key ingredients ""may be in shorter supply"". It says these factors would not lead to overall food shortages ""but will reduce the availability and choice of products and will increase price, which could impact vulnerable groups"". The document also says low-income groups ""will be disproportionately affected by any price rises in food and fuel"". The flow of cross-Channel goods could face ""significant disruption lasting up to six months"". ""Unmitigated, this will have an impact on the supply of medicines and medical supplies,"" it says. ""The reliance of medicines and medical products' supply chains on the short straits crossing make them particularly vulnerable to severe extended delays."" Among its other key points are: Protests and counter-protests will take place across the UK Lorries could have to wait more than two days to cross the Channel Some businesses will cease trading There will be a growth in the black market Some providers of adult social care could fail The document also warns of potential clashes if foreign fishing vessels enter British territorial waters on the day after the UK's departure and says economic difficulties could be ""exacerbated"" by flooding or a flu pandemic this winter. The BBC's Chris Mason said some of the scenarios outlined were ""stark"", but ministers were insisting the paper was not a prediction about what will happen. The document, which, until now, was categorised as ""official, sensitive"", is not an official cabinet paper. It dates from 10 days after Mr Johnson became prime minister. Retailers said the document confirmed what they have been saying will happen in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""Fresh food availability will decrease, consumer choice will decrease, and prices will rise,"" Helen Dickinson of the British Retail Consortium said. And the British Medical Association described the Yellowhammer file as ""alarming"" and that it confirmed its warnings about no-deal, including the threat of medical supply shortages. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said: ""These documents confirm the severe risks of a no-deal Brexit, which Labour has worked so hard to block. ""It is completely irresponsible for the government to have tried to ignore these stark warnings and prevent the public from seeing the evidence."" Judges rule Parliament suspension is unlawful How does prorogation happen? What is the UK doing to get ready for a no-deal Brexit? MPs voted on Monday to order the release of all internal correspondence and communications, including e-mails, texts and WhatsApp messages, between nine No 10 advisers relating to Parliament's suspension. But the government has said it will not comply with the MPs' request, citing potential legal breaches of data protection and employment rights. This is not an ""old"" Yellowhammer assessment, as was claimed by the government in August. It is from the latest internal no-deal planning, from August, from well within the time of Boris Johnson's administration. The government hopes that its recent efforts will change some of the most concerning aspects of what is titled a ""reasonable worst case assumptions"" document, but they are yet to be able to make those changes. Everything hinges on the core assumption made about disruption to freight traffic across the Channel - that over half would be stuck for up to two and a half days. Those assumptions on trade flow have improved recently, but are still poor, and enough to have several highly concerning consequences, from fresh food supply, to stability in Northern Ireland, to social care providers and supplies of medicines for people and animals. I have also been assured that a widely circulated version of this document, from the same day, had the phrase ""base scenario"". It is somewhat confusing that there can be a base case of a worst case planning assumption. In any event, these are the real, plausible short-term shocks from a no-deal Brexit. The section on Northern Ireland is particularly concerning. In many respects it is incredible to have such a list of the plausible consequences of what is government policy. It is not difficult to see why the government resisted its release. It is unlikely to improve the mood of an already sceptical Commons. But it is really the first tangible, quotable, warts and all assessment of what Whitehall fears could be around the corner. Mr Gove said the legal advice received by Mr Johnson before requesting the prorogation of Parliament was in the public domain after being disclosed as part of the ongoing court cases, but there was no justification for the ""far broader"" information being sought. ""To name individuals without any regard for their rights or the consequences of doing so goes far beyond any reasonable right of Parliament under this procedure. ""These individuals have no right of reply, and the procedure used fails to afford them any of the protections that would properly be in place. ""It offends against basic principles of fairness and the Civil Service duty of care towards its employees,"" he said. He said it was ministers, not civil servants or special advisers, who were ultimately accountable to Parliament for decisions taken. The request, therefore was ""inappropriate in principle and in practice, would on its own terms purport to require the government to contravene the law, and is singularly unfair to the named individuals"". Correction 2nd October 2019: An earlier version of this story suggested the Yellowhammer document had referred to the potential risk of rioting; it has been amended to more closely reflect the paper's exact wording, which referred to protests and ""a rise in public disorder and community tensions"".

"A revised Brexit deal, acceptable to both UK and EU negotiators, remains elusive. Only a few people know exactly what has been discussed behind closed doors, and the legal text of any proposed agreement has not been made public. But it's worth bearing in mind that most of the deal hammered out by Theresa May's government -the withdrawal agreementand the accompanying political declaration - would remain in place. The main changes Boris Johnson's government wants to see concern the Irish border, and the type of relationship it wishes the UK to have with the EU in the future. All sides have ruled out customs checks at the land border in Ireland (between Northern Ireland and the Republic), and Mr Johnson's suggestion that checks could take place at ""designated locations"" away from the border was rejected by the EU. That means there would have to be some customs checks within the UK instead, at ports along the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. That's a big UK concession. But Mr Johnson also insists that Northern Ireland has to leave the EU customs union, along with the rest of the UK, to allow it to take advantage of any future trade deals the government manages to negotiate. The suggested compromise is that the legal customs border between the UK and the EU would be at the land border in Ireland. But the practical border, where checks would actually take place, would be in the Irish Sea. Diplomats say that means Northern Ireland would remain legally in the UK customs territory but it would apply EU customs processes on goods arriving from Great Britain. There would be exemptions, including on personal items and other goods, to be agreed at a later date by the UK and the EU. So it's a dual customs system, which has no obvious parallel anywhere else in the world, and it raises plenty of technical and legal issues which will take some time to pin down. There's also the issue of political consent in Northern Ireland. Both sides agree that any new economic status for Northern Ireland, which sets it apart from the rest of the country, needs to win democratic approval. But the EU won't accept anything that appears to give a veto to one party in Northern Ireland, in this case the government's allies in the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). That, in the EU's view, would mean the entire proposed settlement on the Irish border could be unexpectedly torn up with nothing to replace it. The Northern Ireland Assembly has not been sitting for more than 1,000 days For its part, the DUP has been arguing that the Good Friday agreement, which forms the basis of the Northern Ireland peace process, provides for a dual majority (in other words a majority among both unionist and nationalist representatives) on controversial issues in the Northern Ireland assembly. Others in Northern Ireland argue that if a dual majority is needed, then the prospect of Northern Ireland leaving the EU should also be subject to similar dual consent. Diplomats say the latest draft agreement outlines a plan which would give the Northern Ireland Assembly a consent vote four years after the Brexit transition period ends in 2020. If it voted to continue the new arrangements by a simple majority, another vote would be held four years later. If the vote was carried with a dual majority it would be held again eight years later. Diplomats say that if the Assembly voted to end the arrangements, the UK and the EU would have two years to negotiate a new method to avoid a hard border. All of this would replace the so-called backstop- the proposed guarantee to avoid a hard border in Ireland under all circumstances. But so far, the DUP has made it pretty clear that it cannot accept the proposals as they stand. The UK has submitted a new draft of the political declaration on the future relationship. Again, the text has not been made public, but Mr Johnson has made it clear that he wants a looser economic relationship with the EU in the future than Mrs May was seeking. Diplomats say the political declaration will point towards a free trade agreement between the UK and the EU with zero tariffs or quotas, but one which is embedded in a framework for economic competition that is ""fair"". One of the key phrases to watch out for here is the ""level playing field"" - the degree to which the UK will agree to stick closely to EU regulations on things like social and environmental policies. Mr Johnson wants to make fewer level playing field guarantees, and the EU fears that could mean he will seek to undercut EU regulation in the future to gain a competitive advantage. And that in turn has made a number of EU countries even more determined that any solution for the Irish border is legally watertight and fully thought through, before they sign up to any amended Brexit deal. In any complex negotiation, there is nearly always an issue bubbling under the surface which emerges as a last-minute hitch. This time it is VAT, and how to prevent fraud involving goods crossing any new border arrangement. On all of these issues, time is against the negotiators and their political masters. Mr Johnson still says he is determined to leave the EU on 31 October. But if the House of Commons has not voted in favour either of a deal or of leaving with no deal by 19 October, then UK law says he must seek an extension to the Brexit process. The EU has said it will not negotiate directly with Mr Johnson during the summit, which begins on Thursday. But the next few days are obviously crucial. Brexit - British exit - refers to the UK leaving the EU. A public vote was held in June 2016, to decide whether the UK should leave or remain.

"Boris Johnson will tell EU leaders there needs to be a new Brexit deal when he makes his first trip abroad as PM later this week. The UK will leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal, he will insist. Meanwhile, theSunday Times has printed leaked government documents,externalwarning of food, medicine  and fuel shortages in a no-deal scenario. A No 10 source told the BBC a former minister leaked the dossier to try to influence discussions with EU leaders. Brexit: A really simple guide 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Brexit: What happens next? The documents say the cross-government paper on preparations for a no-deal Brexit, codenamed Operation Yellowhammer, reveals the UK could face months of disruption at its ports. It also states plans to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are unlikely to prove sustainable. The dossier, reported by the Sunday Times, says leaving the EU without a deal could lead to: Fresh food becoming less available and prices rising A hard Irish border after plans to avoid checks fail, sparking protests Fuel becoming less available and 2,000 jobs being lost if the government sets petrol import tariffs to 0%, potentially causing two oil refineries to close UK patients having to wait longer for medicines, including insulin and flu vaccines A rise in public disorder and community tensions resulting from a shortage of food and drugs Passengers being delayed at EU airports, Eurotunnel and Dover Freight disruption at ports lasting up to three months, caused by customs checks, before traffic flow improves to 50-70% of the current rate The Downing Street source told the BBC the leaked document ""is from when ministers were blocking what needed to be done to get ready to leave and the funds were not available"". Michael Gove, who is responsible for overseeing the devolution consequences of Brexit, said in a tweet that Operation Yellowhammer was ""a worst case scenario"". ""V significant steps have been taken in the last 3 weeks to accelerate Brexit planning,"" he added. Energy Minister Kwasi Kwarteng told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday:  ""I think there's a lot of scaremongering around and a lot of people are playing into project fear."" But a former head of the British civil service, Lord Bob Kerslake, who described the document as ""credible"", said the dossier ""lays bare the scale of the risks we are facing with no-deal Brexit in almost every area"". ""These risks are completely insane for this country to be taking and we have to explore every avenue to avoid them,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House. Irish deputy prime minister Simon Coveney said, in a tweet, that Ireland had ""always been clear"" a hard border in Ireland ""must be avoided"". The Irish backstop - the provision in Theresa May's withdrawal agreement that could see Northern Ireland continue to follow some of the same trade rules as the Republic of Ireland and the rest of the EU, thus preventing a hard border - was an ""insurance policy"" designed to protect the peace process, he said. What is the Irish border backstop? Liberal Democrat MP Tom Brake said the leaked documents showed the effects of a no-deal Brexit should be taken more seriously. ""The government have simply, I think, pretended that this wasn't an issue,"" he said The government was in ""a real pickle"", since the ""the US has said that if that border is jeopardised, we're not going to get a trade deal with them"", he said. Speaker of the US House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi said, on Wednesday,a US-UK trade deal would not get through Congressif Brexit undermined the Good Friday Agreement. The leak comes as the prime minister prepares to travel to Berlin to meet German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday, before going to Paris to meet French President Emmanuel Macron on Thursday. Mr Johnson is expected to say Parliament cannot and will not change the outcome of the 2016 referendum and insist there must be a new deal to replace Mrs May's withdrawal agreement - defeated three times by MPs - if the UK is to leave the EU with a deal. However, it is thought their discussions will chiefly focus on issues such as foreign policy, security, trade and the environment, ahead of the G7 summit next weekend. Boris Johnson had been reluctant to fly to meet European leaders until it seemed a breakthrough was likely. But - it still doesn't. When Mr Johnson meets the EU's most powerful leaders - Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron - he will repeat his message that the UK is leaving, no matter what, at the end of October. He will tell them face-to-face for the first time that the only way the UK will sign up to a deal is if the EU thinks again, and replaces the agreement brokered by Mrs May. But there seems to be little chance of any serious progress in the coming days. No 10 does not seem particularly optimistic and says it expects both sides will say their piece, then move on to other issues. Anti-Brexit campaigner Gina Miller said the Government had ""unequivocally"" accepted it could not shut down Parliament to clear the way for a no-deal Brexit. Could the government shut down Parliament? She told Sky's Sophy Ridge On Sunday: ""What they have said is, unequivocally, they accept that to close down Parliament, to bypass them in terms of Brexit - stopping a no-deal Brexit, in particular - is illegal."" But Ms Miller said she would continue to seek further reassurances that MPs would be able to pass legislation to stop a no-deal Brexit. Meanwhile, a cross-party group of more than 100 MPs has urged the prime minister to recall Parliament and let it sit permanently until the UK leaves the EU. In a letter, MPs say the country is ""on the brink of an economic crisis"". It continues: ""Parliament must be recalled now in August and sit permanently until 31 October, so that the voices of the people can be heard, and that there can be proper scrutiny of your government."" Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has reiterated his call for MPs to work together to stop a no-deal Brexit. Speaking to the Observer,external, Mr Corbyn said his plan to be installed as an interim prime minister was the ""simplest and most democratic way to stop no deal"". The Labour leader has said, as a caretaker PM, he would delay Brexit, call a snap election, and campaign for another referendum. But Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn was ""divisive"" and instead suggested Conservative MP Ken Clarke or former Labour leader Harriet Harman could head a temporary government. Senior Tory MP rules out backing Corbyn Corbyn outlines plans to defeat no-deal Brexit Would a Labour government cancel Brexit? Elsewhere, in a letter seen by the Mail on Sunday, Mr Johnson warned rebel Tory MPs their opposition to a no-deal Brexit was damaging the prospect of getting a new deal. He said it was ""plain as a pikestaff"" that the EU will ""not compromise as long as they believe there is the faintest possibility that Parliament can block Brexit on 31 October"".
