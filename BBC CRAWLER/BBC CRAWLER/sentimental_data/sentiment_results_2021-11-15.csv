"Harry Kane's four goals saw him draw level with Gary Lineker on 48 England goals England hit double figures for the first time since 1964 as they secured qualification for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar with embarrassing ease in San Marino. Harry Kane also racked up the records by scoring four in the first half to go level with Gary Lineker on 48 England goals, additionally setting a new high of 13 for his country in a calendar year as he followed up his hat-trick in the5-0 win against Albania. Only Sir Bobby Charlton and Wayne Rooney are ahead of Kane in the England goalscorers list. He now stands just five behind record-holder Rooney's tally of 53. Kane also became only the fourth player to score a hat-trick in consecutive England games after Vivian Woodward, Dixie Dean and Tommy Taylor, and the first to score four since Ian Wright, also against San Marino in 1993. Harry Maguire's early header set England on their way and Bukayo Saka's shot was deflected in off Filippo Fabri before Kane took centre stage with two penalties and a couple of trademark finishes in the area. England continued to punish San Marino after the break with Emile Smith Rowe and Tyrone Mings scoring their first international goals with a crisp finish and angled header respectively. The rout continued with goals from substitute Tammy Abraham and Saka as England hit 10 for the first time since they beat USA 10-0 in New York City in May 1964, and the first time ever in a competitive fixture. The scoreline again raises questions about the worth of fixtures such as this. England score 10 as Scotland win again San Marino are ranked 210th out of 210 in the Fifa rankings and the only bonus for their players may be that they can say they shared a pitch with stellar names such as Kane, because otherwise this was simply an exercise in humiliation for a country that has won only one fixture out of 186. It was a good night for Kane, who made no mistake with penalties given for handball against Dante Rossi, who was later sent off for two yellow cards, and Alessandro D'Addario. He scuffed one finish but showed neat footwork for another, although he was helped by hapless San Marino defending. Smith Rowe made a good impression in his first England start and deserved his goal, while Conor Gallagher, so impressive on loan at Crystal Palace from Chelsea, also got on for his first cap. England's only obstacle was a slightly treacherous surface which meant one of the other aims of the night was ensuring all their players emerged unscathed to return to their clubs. For England, this was a case of job very comfortably done. Now Southgate can start all the planning in earnest for next year's World Cup as he tries to improve on reaching the semi-final in Russia in 2018. England boss Gareth Southgate:""We gave a performance that was enjoyable for the supporters that travelled, was clinical in the way we went about it, and then showed some exciting young players coming through. ""Of course we will have much tougher tests but I've been involved in nights like this with England that have been horrible, where the crowd were on our backs, where the whole environment was very different. ""It was nice to see young players going in and enjoying themselves and giving a good showing. ""I just like the fact we have got a mentality where we don't take our foot off the gas and whatever the challenge I have set the players they have responded to it."" England were 6-0 up at half-time England last scored 10 goals in one game in 1964 when they beat the USA. England have scored 52 goals in 2021. Harry Kane has scored 16 of those goals. It is back-to-back hat-tricks for Kane. It has been 64 years since an England player -Tommy Taylor - scored hat-tricks in consecutive international matches. With 38 goals, England have finished with their highest tally in any European or World Cup qualifying campaign.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Steve Rosenberg: ""A stand-off between the migrants on one side and the Polish police on the other"" The European Union is to step up sanctions against Belarus in response to an escalating migrant crisis on the border with Poland. Top EU diplomat Josep Borrell confirmed the move, saying that vulnerable migrants were being exploited in a ""hybrid war"" that is ""intensifying"". Belarus is accused of pushing migrants towards its borders to undermine security, a charge it denies. On Monday, hundreds of migrants were blocked at a crossing by Polish troops. A video filmed at the border by the BBC showed migrants sitting down on a road in front of barbed wire and Polish forces in a tense stand-off. Those migrants came from a large makeshift camp at the Kuznica crossing, where thousands have settled in tents just inside Belarus. ""Goodbye!"" called out a smiling girl, flashing a peace sign as she, and hundreds more, streamed towards the border, hoping to get through. But they are trapped between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other. The migrants cannot get into Poland, but are also being prevented from retreating back into Belarus, according to Polish authorities. ""All these babies are crying for milk, for nappies,"" one man was filmed saying to the line of heavily armed Polish guards. ""We... have nothing, please come and help these people,"" he pleaded, speaking through the barbed wire from the Belarusian side. The Polish border guard said it expected a forced attempt to breach the border, describing the presence of the Belarusian forces in the area as ""worrying"". Since August thousands of men, women and children have amassed at Belarus's western border with Poland. They are mostly from Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and are now enduring freezing conditions in the hope of crossing into the EU. The EU has accused Belarus of encouraging thousands of people to cross into Poland and other members states to spark a humanitarian crisis in the bloc. ""It's like a football game. We are in the middle,"" one woman told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg. Hiding her identity with a scarf, she explained how Belarusian soldiers had helped some migrants cross illegally into Poland in the middle of the night by cutting the fence. But the migrants were founding hiding in a Polish forest, and sent back to Belarus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

European officials have accused Belarus's authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, of orchestrating a scheme to entice migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU. Calling the accusations ""absurd"", Mr Lukashenko's government has repeatedly denied it is sending migrants over the border in revenge forexisting EU sanctions that were imposed in June. EU-Belarus relations have been severely strained since Mr Lukashenko declared victory in a discredited presidential election last year and tried to silence dissent by cracking down on mass protests and arresting political opponents. VOICES:The lives entangled in the Poland-Belarus crisis REALITY CHECK:What routes do migrants use to reach Minsk? BEHIND THE SCENES:How social media posts fuelled the Belarus crisis On Monday, he spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for about 50 minutes, Belta state news reports. It is the first conversation Mr Lukashenko has held with a Western leader since last year's election. The pair reportedly discussed providing humanitarian aid to the migrants at the border. At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close ally of Mr Lukashenko, spoke to France's Emmanuel Macron for nearly two hours. While the leaders did not see eye-to-eye on how the crisis began, they agreed on the need for a de-escalation at the border, an adviser to Mr Macron said. Mr Putin has been accused of being the main orchestrator of the crisis. The White House has called on him to use his influence over Mr Lukashenko to ""cease its callous exploitation and coercion of vulnerable people"", spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Pictures show many hundreds of migrants camped at the border, shivering through bitterly cold weather as they try to get into Poland On Monday, EU foreign ministers held a meeting and agreed to move ahead with imposing more sanctions on Belarus - the fifth round of such restrictions. The exact details will by confirmed later this week, but the Belarusian airline Belavia will be affected, with the EU ending its leasing contract with the company. Travel agencies are also expected to be sanctioned if they helped to fly migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere to Minsk. On Monday, Mr Lukashenko threatened to retaliate against fresh sanctions. He claimed Belarusian authorities were trying to repatriate stranded migrants but many were refusing to go.

"The homes of Frank and Christine Lampard, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, and Tamara Ecclestone and her husband were all broken into during December 2019 An international gang of jewellery thieves have been jailed for a series of high-end raids which netted burglars Â£26m worth of luxury stolen goods. Jugoslav Jovanovic, Alessandro Maltese and Alessandro Donati each admitted toburgling the Kensington mansion of Tamara Ecclestone in December 2019. The Italian trio were also convicted of raids on the west London homes of Frank Lampard and the late Leicester City chairman, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. They were jailed for 28 years in total. At Isleworth Crown Court Jovanovic, 24, was jailed for nine years for conspiracy to burgle and a further two years for money laundering. Donati, 45, and Maltese, 44, were each jailed for eight years and nine months after being convicted of conspiracy to burgle. Alessandro Maltese, Jugoslav Jovanovic and Alessandro Donati were all arrested in Italy and extradited to the UK Judge Martin Edmunds QC said the three burglaries were each ""immensely serious"". During the first 13 days of December 2019, an estimatedÂ£26m worth of items were takenfrom the west London homes of Ms Ecclestone, Mr Lampard and Mr Srivaddhanaprabha. Most of the stolen jewellery and valuable watches have never been recovered. More than Â£60,000 worth of items were stolen from Frank and Christine Lampard's home Prosecutor Timothy Cray QC said the gang ""planned and executed the highest value burglaries that have ever come to light in the United Kingdom."" ""The burglaries involved careful research and reconnaissance. In particular, the victims were deliberately targeted because of their wealth and public profiles,"" he added. ""The execution of the second and third burglaries was ruthless. The properties were ransacked. ""Safes and secure cabinets were broken open. The presence of at least three burglars inside the properties would have been a significant physical threat to anyone who disturbed them."" A safe inside Vicahi Srivaddhanaprabha's home was forced open Mr Cray told the court that on 30 November 2019, Jovanovic travelled to London Stansted from Stockholm with a man named Daniel Vukovic. Jovanovic operated as ""the second in command"" to Mr Vukovic who was ""the prime mover in organising"" the gang in the UK, Mr Cray said. Mr Vukovic remains a wanted man, the court heard. Arecent BBC investigation revealed he has at least 19 different identitiesand is believed to be in Belgrade, Serbia. After arriving in London, Mr Vukovic and Jovanovic set up a base at a hotel in Orpington, south-east London, Mr Cray said. Jugoslav Jovanovic was arrested in Santa Marinella, Italy, in October 2020 He told the court that on 1 December, Jovanovic burgled the home of Chelsea legend Frank Lampard and his wife Christine, while the couple were out. More than Â£60,000 worth of items were stolen, including white-gold Patek Philippe cufflinks, a Cartier pocket watch, two rose-gold ladies' watches and a Mia Lia gold necklace. In victim impact statements the couple said they struggled to sleep in the weeks after the burglary. Mrs Lampard said: ""Since this break-in at my house, I am much more fearful of being alone in my own home, I am less trusting of visitors to the house and feel unsafe in my home."" Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha bought Leicester City in 2010 and died in a helicopter crash in 2018 Then on 10 December, a Knightsbridge property belonging to the family of billionaire Leicester City owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, was burgled by Jovanovic, Donati and Maltese. Mr Srivaddhanaprabhadied in a helicopter crash outside the King Power Stadium in October 2018. His family said the home had been left untouched since his death. Detectives said while the property was ""ransacked"" the gang opened a Â£500 bottle of Cristal champagne. Among the items taken were seven Patek Philippe watches, a Tag Heuer smart watch and about â¬400,000 in cash. European manhunt for Â£26m celebrity raids suspect Man admits full role in Â£26m celebrity heists Man cleared over celebrity raids 'sleeping in car' Mr Srivaddhanaprabha's family said his home was a ""place of reflection and to pray"". A family statement said: ""We felt it was the strongest connection to him as he spent his last night there before his death. ""Since the burglary, our sacred and special connection has been damaged and violated beyond repair."" The next day the group dined at a sushi restaurant near Harrods where they had a Â£760 champagne and sashimi lunch. Jay Rutland, Tamara Ecclestone and their daughter had left for Lapland on the morning of the burglary Finally, on 13 December, the gang carried out the Ecclestone raid. Mr Vukovic was accused of being involved along with Maltese and Donati, while Jovanovic kept watch. Equipped with screwdrivers, the gang targeted the palatial home opposite Kensington Palace, which Formula 1 heiress Ms Ecclestone shares with her husband Jay Rutland. The couple had left for a Christmas holiday in Lapland only hours earlier. Kensington Palace Gardens is the most expensive street in the world, has an armed-guard presence and is home to the Russian, French and Israeli embassies as well as Chelsea FC owner Roman Abramovic and the Sultan of Brunei. Many of the rooms inside Ms Ecclestone's mansion were cleared of valuables. In just over an hour, the burglars made off with 400 items of jewellery and large sums of cash. Two security guards were present on the evening of the burglary, but one had gone to Tesco to get some vegetables at the time of the raid. Hundreds of items of jewellery, cash, diamonds and precious stones worth Â£25 million were taken from Tamara Ecclestone's home Mr Cray said: ""In simple terms it looks as if the burglars were lucky in two main ways. ""First, once they had got through the perimeter via the back garden, the house was so large that noise was difficult to pick up from the security office. ""Second, the internal alarms were not set because the security guards were present and there were various administrative tasks they had to carry out, for example, making and receiving deliveries, even though the family were away. ""All this meant that once the burglars got past the monitors and cameras in the back garden, they had a large empty house to themselves and were therefore able to steal Â£25m pounds worth of jewellery and cash."" In her victim impact statement, Ms Ecclestone said she struggles to trust people and felt ""violated"" in a home she thought was safe and secure. Mr Rutland added: ""We find ourselves naturally questioning everyone around us as there is an assumption that this offence could only have been committed by someone with inside knowledge. ""My daughter is now on a semi-regular basis talking about it even though we told her that the burglars did not actually manage to break in. She asks me and Tamara if the burglars are coming back."" A Cartier bangle was among Ms Ecclestone's personal items stolen in the burglary In the days after the final raid, the burglars went on a spending spree inside Harrods and even opened up loyalty cards. Donati, Jovanovic and Maltese all left the country by 18 December. The three were arrested in Italy in 2020 and then extradited back to the UK.

"Maurice Chambers played his last first-class match in 2015 for Northants Warning: Contains content that is offensive Former bowler Maurice Chambers says he suffered racist abuse over a 10-year period at Essex, just days after another former player Zoheb Sharifalleged racism at the club. Chambers, 34, who was born in Jamaica, alleges he was repeatedly racially abused by two team-mates and a senior coach at the county. He says he was frequently subjected to racist jokes, including banana taunts. Chambers, who played for Essex from 2005-2013, told The Cricketer he ""would go home at the end of the day and cry"". On Saturday, Sharif made allegations relating to his time at the club between 2001 and 2004. Both men have spoken out after a racism scandal at fellow County Championship side Yorkshire. Chambers says he first experienced ""anything that made me uncomfortable"" was when he was playing for the age group teams aged 15. The incidents he alleged happened during his time at Essex include: Â·Being told by a player to climb up the stairs for a banana after a team night out A coach making a racist remark during fielding practice and the same coach reading out racist jokes in the dressing room A senior player offering him a banana in a mocking manner ""on several occasions"" ""It was humiliating. It was isolating. I never told anyone, but I would go home at the end of the day and cry. It made me very unhappy,"" Chambers said. He said other than one occasion, when his mother reported an incident on his behalf, he ""never reported anything"" as he was ""always worried about being seen as a troublemaker"". Essex chief executive John Stephenson said he was ""extremely disappointed to hear of further historic racial allegations"" which made ""distressing reading"". He said none of the individuals were now involved with the club, and that Essex had referred the matter to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). ""After learning of the allegations last night, I instantly contacted the former player to offer the club's full support,"" Stephenson said. ""He has shown immense bravery in coming forward and in speaking with us about the incidents he describes. I appreciate how difficult this must be for him."" Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Stumped podcast: Azeem Rafiq: What lessons should cricket learn? The Sports Desk podcast: Yorkshire racism scandal and cricket's 'uncomfortable truths' In a statement, the ECB said it was appalled by the behaviour Chambers described, which ""no person should ever have to endure"". ""There is absolutely no room for racism in cricket,"" an ECB spokesperson said. ""We are sorry that Maurice has only been able to feel comfortable to speak out after his playing career had ended and as a game we must ensure that cannot prevail. ""We will be investigating this alongside the other allegations at Essex and applaud Maurice for his bravery in coming forward."" On Friday, Essex chairman John Faragher resigned following anallegation he used racist languagein a 2017 board meeting, which he denies. Chambers has also made a racism allegation against a team-mate during his time at Northamptonshire, where he played between 2013 and 2015. The player in question is no longer with the club. ""Racism is the antithesis of what Northamptonshire County Cricket Club stands for,"" said a club statement. ""The club is disappointed to hear of Maurice's experience and this clearly goes against the expectation we hold for all Northamptonshire players and staff."" These latest allegations come in the wake of a racism scandal at Yorkshire that has engulfed cricket. A report found former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" but the county said it would not discipline anyone, drawing widespread condemnation. Chief executive Mark Arthur and chairman Roger Hutton have both resigned since. ""That's why it feels so important to speak now,"" Chambers said. ""I've been inspired by the example of Azeem Rafiq and I want other players to have the courage to speak up and share their experiences.

"This video can not be played Watch: The cab pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital and exploded into flames The UK terror threat level has been raised to ""severe"" after an explosion outside Liverpool Women's Hospital. Taxi driver David Perry survived the blast but his passenger was killed when a homemade bomb exploded shortly before 11:00 GMT on Remembrance Sunday. The man, who is believed to have manufactured and brought the device into the taxi, died at the scene. Police said the motivation for the attack was unclear but it had been declared as a terrorist incident. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the threat level had been raised from ""substantial"" to ""severe"", meaning an attack is highly likely, because the explosion in Liverpool was the second incident in a month. The death of Conservative MP Sir David Amess, who was stabbed multiple times during a meeting with his constituents in Essex on 15 October, has beentreated as a terrorist incident by police. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: ""What we saw yesterday was the second incident within a month"" Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, Russ Jackson, said the taxi passenger appeared to have made an ""improvised explosive device"" which caused the blast. He said police knew the identity of the attacker but would not confirm his name at this stage. The man is not believed to have been known to MI5, according to BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera. Four men have been arrested in the city under the Terrorism Act as part of the investigation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who chaired an emergency Cobra meeting earlier in response to the explosion, described it as a ""sickening attack"". He said it was a ""stark reminder for all of us to remain vigilant"", but added ""the British people will never be cowed by terrorism"". Taxi driver David Perry has been released from hospital Mr Jackson said Delta Taxis driver Mr Perry picked up a passenger in Rutland Avenue, near Sefton Park, on Sunday. ""As the taxi approached the drop-off point at the hospital an explosion occurred from within the car. This quickly engulfed it in flames,"" he said. ""Remarkably the taxi driver escaped from the cab."" Posting on Facebook, Mr Perry's wife Rachel said he was ""lucky to be alive"". ""The explosion happened whilst he was in the car and how he managed to escape is an utter miracle,"" she added. Liverpool explosion: What we know so far Taxi driver 'lucky to be alive' after explosion Liverpool Women's Hospital open for patients Mr Jackson said the taxi driver had been released from hospital after being treated for his injuries. He said police were ""aware there were Remembrance events just a short distance away from the hospital and that the ignition occurred shortly before 11:00 GMT"". ""We cannot at this time draw any connection with this but it is a line of inquiry we are pursuing,"" he added. While the police believe they know who the attacker was, difficult forensic work may be continuing to confirm the identity - particularly if experts have to resort to dental records and DNA. Digital forensic teams investigate the dead man's online habits and contacts. Officers will want to build a picture of his movements from mobile phone data and financial transactions. Bomb experts will be looking at how the device was made. These strands may lead detectives to vital CCTV evidence and locations or witnesses that will help reveal the attacker's planning. But the biggest priority will be to establish - if possible - whether there is any ongoing threat to the public. Police said a man, aged 20, was arrested earlier in the Kensington area of the city and was in custody. Three other men - aged 21, 26 and 29 - were detained on Sunday in Sutcliffe Street in Kensington. Mr Jackson said the arrested men were believed to be ""associates"" of the taxi passenger. He said officers were looking at the man's associates, his telephone records and purchases he may have made. This video can not be played Watch: Police say passenger brought explosive device into taxi Officers are searching two addresses, one in Sutcliffe Street and a second at Rutland Avenue, where ""significant items"" had been found, police said. A cordon is in place at both locations and eight families have been evacuated from their homes. Police have confirmed a controlled explosion was carried out as a precaution in the Sefton Park area, close to Rutland Avenue, at about 16:00 GMT on Monday as part of the investigation but there was no wider risk to the public. Frances Evans, who witnessed the explosion, told BBC News that three police vans and a little black van had pulled up before covering an unknown item. ""They weren't there long, probably 20 minutes max,"" she said. ""I saw the explosion, the smoke and heard the bang."" Mr Jackson said police had linked the taxi passenger to both the addresses but were uncertain which one he lived at. Neighbour Sharon Cullen said she was evacuated from her home near Sutcliffe Street by officers telling her ""whatever is going on at the back of the house, it could blow the block"". The home secretary said the explosion had a ""very significant impact across the community"" in Liverpool and her thoughts were with people in the city. Ms Patel said the government would ""continue to work with everyone when it comes to the security of our country and making sure that we're taking all the necessary steps required"". Assessments of threat levels are taken by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), part of MI5, which makes recommendations independently from the government. A ""severe"" threat,externalis classed as an attack on the UK being ""highly likely"" and is the second highest alert below ""critical"", which means an attack is ""highly likely in the near future"". The rise in the threat level is not based on specific intelligence of an ongoing threat in Liverpool. Rather it is based on an overall assessment by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. They have looked at the fact that there have been two incidents in the last month - the killing of Sir David Amess MP and now Liverpool - and judged that the overall picture has changed. It is not totally clear what the cause is - some speculate about people being inspired by international events, others wonder if it is to do with people emerging out of lockdown after having been radicalised online.

"Harry Kane's four goals saw him draw level with Gary Lineker on 48 England goals England hit double figures for the first time since 1964 as they secured qualification for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar with embarrassing ease in San Marino. Harry Kane also racked up the records by scoring four in the first half to go level with Gary Lineker on 48 England goals, additionally setting a new high of 13 for his country in a calendar year as he followed up his hat-trick in the5-0 win against Albania. Only Sir Bobby Charlton and Wayne Rooney are ahead of Kane in the England goalscorers list. He now stands just five behind record-holder Rooney's tally of 53. Kane also became only the fourth player to score a hat-trick in consecutive England games after Vivian Woodward, Dixie Dean and Tommy Taylor, and the first to score four since Ian Wright, also against San Marino in 1993. Harry Maguire's early header set England on their way and Bukayo Saka's shot was deflected in off Filippo Fabri before Kane took centre stage with two penalties and a couple of trademark finishes in the area. England continued to punish San Marino after the break with Emile Smith Rowe and Tyrone Mings scoring their first international goals with a crisp finish and angled header respectively. The rout continued with goals from substitute Tammy Abraham and Saka as England hit 10 for the first time since they beat USA 10-0 in New York City in May 1964, and the first time ever in a competitive fixture. The scoreline again raises questions about the worth of fixtures such as this. England score 10 as Scotland win again San Marino are ranked 210th out of 210 in the Fifa rankings and the only bonus for their players may be that they can say they shared a pitch with stellar names such as Kane, because otherwise this was simply an exercise in humiliation for a country that has won only one fixture out of 186. It was a good night for Kane, who made no mistake with penalties given for handball against Dante Rossi, who was later sent off for two yellow cards, and Alessandro D'Addario. He scuffed one finish but showed neat footwork for another, although he was helped by hapless San Marino defending. Smith Rowe made a good impression in his first England start and deserved his goal, while Conor Gallagher, so impressive on loan at Crystal Palace from Chelsea, also got on for his first cap. England's only obstacle was a slightly treacherous surface which meant one of the other aims of the night was ensuring all their players emerged unscathed to return to their clubs. For England, this was a case of job very comfortably done. Now Southgate can start all the planning in earnest for next year's World Cup as he tries to improve on reaching the semi-final in Russia in 2018. England boss Gareth Southgate:""We gave a performance that was enjoyable for the supporters that travelled, was clinical in the way we went about it, and then showed some exciting young players coming through. ""Of course we will have much tougher tests but I've been involved in nights like this with England that have been horrible, where the crowd were on our backs, where the whole environment was very different. ""It was nice to see young players going in and enjoying themselves and giving a good showing. ""I just like the fact we have got a mentality where we don't take our foot off the gas and whatever the challenge I have set the players they have responded to it."" England were 6-0 up at half-time England last scored 10 goals in one game in 1964 when they beat the USA. England have scored 52 goals in 2021. Harry Kane has scored 16 of those goals. It is back-to-back hat-tricks for Kane. It has been 64 years since an England player -Tommy Taylor - scored hat-tricks in consecutive international matches. With 38 goals, England have finished with their highest tally in any European or World Cup qualifying campaign.

"This video can not be played The BBC's Steve Rosenberg: ""A stand-off between the migrants on one side and the Polish police on the other"" The European Union is to step up sanctions against Belarus in response to an escalating migrant crisis on the border with Poland. Top EU diplomat Josep Borrell confirmed the move, saying that vulnerable migrants were being exploited in a ""hybrid war"" that is ""intensifying"". Belarus is accused of pushing migrants towards its borders to undermine security, a charge it denies. On Monday, hundreds of migrants were blocked at a crossing by Polish troops. A video filmed at the border by the BBC showed migrants sitting down on a road in front of barbed wire and Polish forces in a tense stand-off. Those migrants came from a large makeshift camp at the Kuznica crossing, where thousands have settled in tents just inside Belarus. ""Goodbye!"" called out a smiling girl, flashing a peace sign as she, and hundreds more, streamed towards the border, hoping to get through. But they are trapped between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other. The migrants cannot get into Poland, but are also being prevented from retreating back into Belarus, according to Polish authorities. ""All these babies are crying for milk, for nappies,"" one man was filmed saying to the line of heavily armed Polish guards. ""We... have nothing, please come and help these people,"" he pleaded, speaking through the barbed wire from the Belarusian side. The Polish border guard said it expected a forced attempt to breach the border, describing the presence of the Belarusian forces in the area as ""worrying"". Since August thousands of men, women and children have amassed at Belarus's western border with Poland. They are mostly from Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and are now enduring freezing conditions in the hope of crossing into the EU. The EU has accused Belarus of encouraging thousands of people to cross into Poland and other members states to spark a humanitarian crisis in the bloc. ""It's like a football game. We are in the middle,"" one woman told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg. Hiding her identity with a scarf, she explained how Belarusian soldiers had helped some migrants cross illegally into Poland in the middle of the night by cutting the fence. But the migrants were founding hiding in a Polish forest, and sent back to Belarus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

European officials have accused Belarus's authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, of orchestrating a scheme to entice migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU. Calling the accusations ""absurd"", Mr Lukashenko's government has repeatedly denied it is sending migrants over the border in revenge forexisting EU sanctions that were imposed in June. EU-Belarus relations have been severely strained since Mr Lukashenko declared victory in a discredited presidential election last year and tried to silence dissent by cracking down on mass protests and arresting political opponents. VOICES:The lives entangled in the Poland-Belarus crisis REALITY CHECK:What routes do migrants use to reach Minsk? BEHIND THE SCENES:How social media posts fuelled the Belarus crisis On Monday, he spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for about 50 minutes, Belta state news reports. It is the first conversation Mr Lukashenko has held with a Western leader since last year's election. The pair reportedly discussed providing humanitarian aid to the migrants at the border. At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close ally of Mr Lukashenko, spoke to France's Emmanuel Macron for nearly two hours. While the leaders did not see eye-to-eye on how the crisis began, they agreed on the need for a de-escalation at the border, an adviser to Mr Macron said. Mr Putin has been accused of being the main orchestrator of the crisis. The White House has called on him to use his influence over Mr Lukashenko to ""cease its callous exploitation and coercion of vulnerable people"", spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Pictures show many hundreds of migrants camped at the border, shivering through bitterly cold weather as they try to get into Poland On Monday, EU foreign ministers held a meeting and agreed to move ahead with imposing more sanctions on Belarus - the fifth round of such restrictions. The exact details will by confirmed later this week, but the Belarusian airline Belavia will be affected, with the EU ending its leasing contract with the company. Travel agencies are also expected to be sanctioned if they helped to fly migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere to Minsk. On Monday, Mr Lukashenko threatened to retaliate against fresh sanctions. He claimed Belarusian authorities were trying to repatriate stranded migrants but many were refusing to go.

"Afghans arriving in the UK having been relocated from Afghanistan The Ministry of Defence has said it is ""not aware anyone has come to harm"" as a result of data breaches involving the email addresses of Afghan interpreters who worked for British forces. The MoD launched an inquiry after more than 300 people hoping to relocate to the UK were mistakenly visibly copied into an email from the department. The inquiry - now complete - blamed the mistakes on human error. However, it also said better training would have prevented the breach. Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said: ""This is the fifth serious data breach in nine months and it's time the defence secretary got his house in order. ""This is a basic issue of competence for this government... until the defence secretary stops these leaks our service personnel will rightly be wondering whether the MoD has their back."" In a written statement, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said,externalthat more than 7,000 Afghan nationals, including family members, who worked for the UK government in Afghanistan, had been successfully relocated in the UK. He added that fewer than 200 eligible people now remain in Afghanistan and that the government was working ""with urgency"" to help relocate them. MoD shared 250 Afghan interpreters' details on email Afghanistan facing desperate food crisis, UN warns 'The more we wait, the more in danger we are' The Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) was launched to help people who might be under threat from the new Taliban government due to their work supporting the UK government in Afghanistan. The data breaches occurred when defence staff emailed people covered by Arap but used the 'carbon copy' - or cc - button instead of 'blind carbon copy' field to anonymise the recipients. There were a total of three breaches occurring on 7, 13 and 20 September. Mr Wallace said a lack of procedures - as well as training - were exacerbated by the ""intense speed"" and ""operational pressure"" of the circumstances. As a result, he said some members of the team were ""inexperienced and insufficiently trained"". The investigation found that the individuals' actions had not been ""deliberate or negligent"" and that they had since been reassigned to other roles outside the Arap team. Mr Wallace said the Ministry of Defence was not aware that ""anyone has come to harm as a result of the breaches"" but that those affected had been offered security support. The minister added that the breaches were ""unacceptable and fell short of the high standards to which the MoD typically holds itself"".

"Maurice Chambers played his last first-class match in 2015 for Northants Warning: Contains content that is offensive Former bowler Maurice Chambers says he suffered racist abuse over a 10-year period at Essex, just days after another former player Zoheb Sharifalleged racism at the club. Chambers, 34, who was born in Jamaica, alleges he was repeatedly racially abused by two team-mates and a senior coach at the county. He says he was frequently subjected to racist jokes, including banana taunts. Chambers, who played for Essex from 2005-2013, told The Cricketer he ""would go home at the end of the day and cry"". On Saturday, Sharif made allegations relating to his time at the club between 2001 and 2004. Both men have spoken out after a racism scandal at fellow County Championship side Yorkshire. Chambers says he first experienced ""anything that made me uncomfortable"" was when he was playing for the age group teams aged 15. The incidents he alleged happened during his time at Essex include: Â·Being told by a player to climb up the stairs for a banana after a team night out A coach making a racist remark during fielding practice and the same coach reading out racist jokes in the dressing room A senior player offering him a banana in a mocking manner ""on several occasions"" ""It was humiliating. It was isolating. I never told anyone, but I would go home at the end of the day and cry. It made me very unhappy,"" Chambers said. He said other than one occasion, when his mother reported an incident on his behalf, he ""never reported anything"" as he was ""always worried about being seen as a troublemaker"". Essex chief executive John Stephenson said he was ""extremely disappointed to hear of further historic racial allegations"" which made ""distressing reading"". He said none of the individuals were now involved with the club, and that Essex had referred the matter to the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB). ""After learning of the allegations last night, I instantly contacted the former player to offer the club's full support,"" Stephenson said. ""He has shown immense bravery in coming forward and in speaking with us about the incidents he describes. I appreciate how difficult this must be for him."" Yorkshire cricket racism scandal - how we got here Stumped podcast: Azeem Rafiq: What lessons should cricket learn? The Sports Desk podcast: Yorkshire racism scandal and cricket's 'uncomfortable truths' In a statement, the ECB said it was appalled by the behaviour Chambers described, which ""no person should ever have to endure"". ""There is absolutely no room for racism in cricket,"" an ECB spokesperson said. ""We are sorry that Maurice has only been able to feel comfortable to speak out after his playing career had ended and as a game we must ensure that cannot prevail. ""We will be investigating this alongside the other allegations at Essex and applaud Maurice for his bravery in coming forward."" On Friday, Essex chairman John Faragher resigned following anallegation he used racist languagein a 2017 board meeting, which he denies. Chambers has also made a racism allegation against a team-mate during his time at Northamptonshire, where he played between 2013 and 2015. The player in question is no longer with the club. ""Racism is the antithesis of what Northamptonshire County Cricket Club stands for,"" said a club statement. ""The club is disappointed to hear of Maurice's experience and this clearly goes against the expectation we hold for all Northamptonshire players and staff."" These latest allegations come in the wake of a racism scandal at Yorkshire that has engulfed cricket. A report found former Yorkshire player Azeem Rafiq was a victim of ""racial harassment and bullying"" but the county said it would not discipline anyone, drawing widespread condemnation. Chief executive Mark Arthur and chairman Roger Hutton have both resigned since. ""That's why it feels so important to speak now,"" Chambers said. ""I've been inspired by the example of Azeem Rafiq and I want other players to have the courage to speak up and share their experiences. ""Only by letting people know about the things that have being going on can we bring about change.""

"Royal Dutch Shell has announced a plan to move its headquarters to the UK as part of proposals to simplify the company's structure. The oil giant will ask shareholders to vote on shifting its tax residence from the Netherlands to the UK. It also wants to do away with its dual share structure in favour of just one class of shares to boost ""the speed and flexibility"" of shareholder payouts. Shell's chief executive, Ben van Beurden, will relocate to the UK. The company's chief financial officer, Jessica Uhl, will also move, alongside seven other senior employees. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed Shell's announcement,external, tweeting that it was ""a clear vote of confidence in the British economy"". The Dutch government, however, said it was ""unpleasantly surprised"" by Shell's proposal. According to reports in theFinancial Times,externalnewspaper, Dutch government officials are scrambling to find a parliamentary majority to scrap a 15% withholding tax charged on dividends, which Shell has previously described as a problem. Stef Blok, economic affairs and climate minister, said earlier on Monday: ""We are in a dialogue with the management of Shell over the consequences of this plan for jobs, crucial investment decisions and sustainability."" Royal Dutch Shell's structure is pretty complicated. The company is currently registered in the UK, but its headquarters are in the Netherlands. There are two different types of shares - effectively a Dutch share and a UK share - and this affects the way payments to shareholders are taxed. Now, under pressure from an activist investor, and facing huge change as the world moves away from fossil fuels, the company has decided it is time to simplify further. The move is designed to make payments to shareholders easier, while Shell says it will also help it to transform its business. But whether intended or not, this is also a deeply political move. If the proposals are adopted, Shell will no longer be ""Royal Dutch"" - and questions are being asked in The Hague about the extent to which the new company will be Dutch at all. The company said: ""Shell is proud of its Anglo-Dutch heritage and will continue to be a significant employer with a major presence in the Netherlands. ""Its projects and technology division, global upstream and integrated gas businesses and renewable energies hub remain located in The Hague."" The decision to simplify Shell's structure comes after Third Point, a US activist investor, recently bought a stake in the company and suggested the business should be split into two firms,according to the Wall Street Journal,external. Third Point told Shell in a letter it should split itself into ""multiple standalone companies"", one of which would house its legacy oil and gas business while another would contain renewable energy. In an interview with the BBC earlier this month, Mr van Beurden dismissed Third Point's proposal. He said that while Shell could transition to net zero by 2050, the move to greener energy could only be funded by oil and gas. Earlier this year, a court in the Netherlands ruled that by 2030 Shell must cut its CO2 emissions by 45% compared to 2019 levels. The decision only applies in the Netherlands and Shell said it would appeal against the ruling. Shell's chief executive Ben van Beurden will relocate to the UK Shell has been incorporated in the UK and had a Dutch tax residence - as well as the dual share structure - since 2005. The changes also mean the company will drop ""Royal Dutch"" from its title and be renamed Shell. This element dates back to 1890 when the Royal Dutch Petroleum Company was formed. That company merged with the UK's Shell Transport and Trading Company in 1907. ""Carrying the Royal designation has been a source of immense pride and honour for Shell for more than 130 years,"" Shell said. ""However, the company anticipates it will no longer meet the conditions for using the designation following the proposed change."" Shell said the simplified share structure means it would be able to ""accelerate"" shareholder distributions through, for example, share buybacks. The company announced a $2bn (Â£1.5bn) share buyback in July and will distribute an additional $7bn from the sale of its Permian Basin oilfield in the US. ""Aside from the fact that the shares they hold will no longer come with a 'Royal' designation, this new alignment won't change much for investors,"" said Laura Hoy, an equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The long-term growth story for Shell still rests heavily on the oil price. For now, buoyant oil prices are keeping the group's cash coffers topped up. However, with the inevitable shift to more sustainable energy picking up steam we suspect the need to invest in greener operations will keep a lid on what the group can pass on to shareholders."" Shares in Shell rose by more than 2% on Monday. The company said its shares would continue to be listed in Amsterdam, London and New York. Shareholders will vote on the proposals at a meeting on 10 December.

"Afghans arriving in the UK having been relocated from Afghanistan The Ministry of Defence has said it is ""not aware anyone has come to harm"" as a result of data breaches involving the email addresses of Afghan interpreters who worked for British forces. The MoD launched an inquiry after more than 300 people hoping to relocate to the UK were mistakenly visibly copied into an email from the department. The inquiry - now complete - blamed the mistakes on human error. However, it also said better training would have prevented the breach. Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said: ""This is the fifth serious data breach in nine months and it's time the defence secretary got his house in order. ""This is a basic issue of competence for this government... until the defence secretary stops these leaks our service personnel will rightly be wondering whether the MoD has their back."" In a written statement, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said,externalthat more than 7,000 Afghan nationals, including family members, who worked for the UK government in Afghanistan, had been successfully relocated in the UK. He added that fewer than 200 eligible people now remain in Afghanistan and that the government was working ""with urgency"" to help relocate them. MoD shared 250 Afghan interpreters' details on email Afghanistan facing desperate food crisis, UN warns 'The more we wait, the more in danger we are' The Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy (Arap) was launched to help people who might be under threat from the new Taliban government due to their work supporting the UK government in Afghanistan. The data breaches occurred when defence staff emailed people covered by Arap but used the 'carbon copy' - or cc - button instead of 'blind carbon copy' field to anonymise the recipients. There were a total of three breaches occurring on 7, 13 and 20 September. Mr Wallace said a lack of procedures - as well as training - were exacerbated by the ""intense speed"" and ""operational pressure"" of the circumstances. As a result, he said some members of the team were ""inexperienced and insufficiently trained"". The investigation found that the individuals' actions had not been ""deliberate or negligent"" and that they had since been reassigned to other roles outside the Arap team. Mr Wallace said the Ministry of Defence was not aware that ""anyone has come to harm as a result of the breaches"" but that those affected had been offered security support. The minister added that the breaches were ""unacceptable and fell short of the high standards to which the MoD typically holds itself"".

"Royal Dutch Shell has announced a plan to move its headquarters to the UK as part of proposals to simplify the company's structure. The oil giant will ask shareholders to vote on shifting its tax residence from the Netherlands to the UK. It also wants to do away with its dual share structure in favour of just one class of shares to boost ""the speed and flexibility"" of shareholder payouts. Shell's chief executive, Ben van Beurden, will relocate to the UK. The company's chief financial officer, Jessica Uhl, will also move, alongside seven other senior employees. Business and Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng welcomed Shell's announcement,external, tweeting that it was ""a clear vote of confidence in the British economy"". The Dutch government, however, said it was ""unpleasantly surprised"" by Shell's proposal. According to reports in theFinancial Times,externalnewspaper, Dutch government officials are scrambling to find a parliamentary majority to scrap a 15% withholding tax charged on dividends, which Shell has previously described as a problem. Stef Blok, economic affairs and climate minister, said earlier on Monday: ""We are in a dialogue with the management of Shell over the consequences of this plan for jobs, crucial investment decisions and sustainability.""

"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg says ""they even succeeded in watering down the blah, blah, blah"" Greta Thunberg has said the eventual agreement struck at COP26 was ""very vague"" with many loopholes. The 18-year-old - who came to Glasgow for the summit - said it only succeeded in ""watering down the blah blah blah."" Countries agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after India and China led opposition to the commitment in earlier negotiation drafts. After 15 days of talks, COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was ""deeply sorry"" for how events had unfolded. The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. The deal also presses for more urgent emission cuts and promises more money for developing countries - to help them adapt to climate impacts. But the pledges do not go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C. Ms Thunberg said that the ""small progress"" made could demonstrate a ""losing"" fight against the climate crisis, since time is a major factor. She told BBC Scotland News: ""I have to say unfortunately it turned out just the way I and many others had expected. ""They even succeeded at watering down the blah, blah, blah which is quite an achievement. There is still no guarantee that we will reach the Paris Agreement. ""You can still interpret it [the Glasgow pact] in many different ways - we can still expand fossil fuel infrastructure, we can increase the global emissions. It's very, very vague."" Has the COP26 summit been poorly organised? 'Glasgow's name will reverberate into the future' How might decisions made at COP26 change our lives? This video can not be played Greta Thunberg says conferences like COP26 maintain the status quo of countries taking part The Swedish activist joined thousands of young people - including striking school pupils - for a march through the city on 5 November. She addressed the crowd when it arrived in George Square, saying ""immediate and drastic"" cuts to emissions were needed. The protest was organised by Fridays for Future Scotland - part of an international network of young climate activists inspired by Ms Thunberg. Activists from several other countries, including Vanessa Nakate from Uganda, also gave speeches about how climate change is already affecting their homelands. Previously Greta Thunberg has called the climate summit a ""failure"" and a ""PR exercise"". She has also criticised goals for cutting emissions which cause global warming, saying: ""We don't just need goals for just 2030 or 2050. We, above all, need themfor 2020 and every following month and year to come."",external However, Ms Thunberg has so far avoided getting into the detail of what action should be taken, saying ""it is nothing to do with me"". Ms Thunberg joined two marches through Glasgow during COP26 Asked if she had dismissed the conference before it had begun, she said that was how some people had ""interpreted"" her words - but added ""of course, we need these conferences"". She continued: ""It's a democratic process that is absolutely necessary for us to make progress - but they cannot be the way they are now. ""As long as there is no real massive pressure from the outside then politicians unfortunately will most likely get away with continuing like now. ""It feels like today COP is not really challenging the structures of today - it's mostly maintaining status quo. It's like we are trying to solve a problem with the methods that got us into this in the first place."" This video can not be played Alok Sharma fights back tears as Glasgow Climate Pact reached UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the world would ""look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change"". However, Mr Sharma was visibly emotional as he confirmed the agreement had been reached with last-minute changes to the wording. Now back in Sweden, Ms Thunberg said she would not like to be in his shoes - and said that although China and India had disagreed with terms on coal, there were ""many villains"". Who is Greta Thunberg and what are her aims? In Pictures: Young protesters march for the future COP26 youth march: 'We don't have a choice' She said that people inside negotiations had told her ""lots of different stories"". ""When we talk about climate policy we have to include the aspect of equity,"" she said. ""It is wrong that some countries do not want to take action. ""But we have to understand that when the so-called global north refuses to take the leadership role and still refuses to deliver on the loss and damage on the promised yearly $100bn to the most vulnerable countries - the least responsible countries - of course that creates lots of tension.

"Rapper Travis Scott said he was devastated by what happened at the Astroworld festival A nine-year-old boy placed in an induced coma after a crowd surge at the Astroworld festival in Houston, Texas, has died, a family lawyer says. Ezra Blount had been on life support in hospital due to severe brain and organ trauma since the show on 5 November. He is the youngest of 10 concertgoers to have been killed after panic broke out during rapper Travis Scott's headline performance. Hundreds of others were hurt when the crowd began to press towards the stage. Attorneys representing more than 200 people claiming they were injured in the crush told reporters on Friday they were filing another 90 lawsuits against the promoters of the event. Astroworld tragedy: Were warning signs missed? Festival survivors recall panic: 'I had to get out of there' Who were the victims? On Sunday, a lawyer for the family of Ezra Blount confirmed the boy's death. ""Ezra's death is absolutely heartbreaking,"" civil rights attorney Ben Crump said in a statement. ""This should not have been the outcome of taking their son to a concert."" In an earlier interview with local news outlet ABC13, Ezra's father Treston Blount said he was ""not ready to lose my boy"". ""We still got a bunch of living to do,"" he said, describing how his son was a huge Scott fan who was ""stoked"" ahead of the performance. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said he was ""saddened to learn of Ezra's death"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The crowd surge at the concert began at about 21:15 local time on Friday, 5 November. There were about 50,000 people at the festival at the city's NRG Park complex. As the crush began causing injuries to people, panic grew and the casualties quickly overwhelmed the on-site first aiders, officials said. Investigators are reviewing video from the scene to explore the causes of the surge and what had prevented people from being able to escape. They are also working to interview victims and witnesses. Those who lost their lives were aged between nine and 27. This video can not be played ""I'm honestly just devastated"" â Travis Scott posted this video on Instagram Scott, one of the biggest names in rap music, launched Astroworld with concert promoters Live Nation in 2018. He has asked victims to reach out to him, saying he ""desperately wishes to share his condolences and provide aid"", according to a statement. Police said the victims were crushed in a surge of fans near the stage at around 21:30 local time. Scott continued to perform for almost 40 minutes longer, eventually ending the set about 15 to 20 minutes ahead of the advertised time. Last week, Houston fire chief Samuel PeÃ±a said that Scott should have halted the show more quickly. ""At one point there was an ambulance that was trying to make its way through the crowd. The artist has command of that crowd,"" Mr PeÃ±a told NBC's Today show. Astroworld: Who were the victims?

"This video can not be played The BBC's Steve Rosenberg: ""A stand-off between the migrants on one side and the Polish police on the other"" The European Union is to step up sanctions against Belarus in response to an escalating migrant crisis on the border with Poland. Top EU diplomat Josep Borrell confirmed the move, saying that vulnerable migrants were being exploited in a ""hybrid war"" that is ""intensifying"". Belarus is accused of pushing migrants towards its borders to undermine security, a charge it denies. On Monday, hundreds of migrants were blocked at a crossing by Polish troops. A video filmed at the border by the BBC showed migrants sitting down on a road in front of barbed wire and Polish forces in a tense stand-off. Those migrants came from a large makeshift camp at the Kuznica crossing, where thousands have settled in tents just inside Belarus. ""Goodbye!"" called out a smiling girl, flashing a peace sign as she, and hundreds more, streamed towards the border, hoping to get through. But they are trapped between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other. The migrants cannot get into Poland, but are also being prevented from retreating back into Belarus, according to Polish authorities. ""All these babies are crying for milk, for nappies,"" one man was filmed saying to the line of heavily armed Polish guards. ""We... have nothing, please come and help these people,"" he pleaded, speaking through the barbed wire from the Belarusian side. The Polish border guard said it expected a forced attempt to breach the border, describing the presence of the Belarusian forces in the area as ""worrying"". Since August thousands of men, women and children have amassed at Belarus's western border with Poland. They are mostly from Iraq, Syria and Yemen, and are now enduring freezing conditions in the hope of crossing into the EU. The EU has accused Belarus of encouraging thousands of people to cross into Poland and other members states to spark a humanitarian crisis in the bloc. ""It's like a football game. We are in the middle,"" one woman told the BBC's Steve Rosenberg. Hiding her identity with a scarf, she explained how Belarusian soldiers had helped some migrants cross illegally into Poland in the middle of the night by cutting the fence. But the migrants were founding hiding in a Polish forest, and sent back to Belarus. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

European officials have accused Belarus's authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, of orchestrating a scheme to entice migrants with the false promise of easy entry to the EU. Calling the accusations ""absurd"", Mr Lukashenko's government has repeatedly denied it is sending migrants over the border in revenge forexisting EU sanctions that were imposed in June. EU-Belarus relations have been severely strained since Mr Lukashenko declared victory in a discredited presidential election last year and tried to silence dissent by cracking down on mass protests and arresting political opponents. VOICES:The lives entangled in the Poland-Belarus crisis REALITY CHECK:What routes do migrants use to reach Minsk? BEHIND THE SCENES:How social media posts fuelled the Belarus crisis On Monday, he spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel for about 50 minutes, Belta state news reports. It is the first conversation Mr Lukashenko has held with a Western leader since last year's election. The pair reportedly discussed providing humanitarian aid to the migrants at the border. At the same time, Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close ally of Mr Lukashenko, spoke to France's Emmanuel Macron for nearly two hours. While the leaders did not see eye-to-eye on how the crisis began, they agreed on the need for a de-escalation at the border, an adviser to Mr Macron said. Mr Putin has been accused of being the main orchestrator of the crisis. The White House has called on him to use his influence over Mr Lukashenko to ""cease its callous exploitation and coercion of vulnerable people"", spokeswoman Jen Psaki said. Pictures show many hundreds of migrants camped at the border, shivering through bitterly cold weather as they try to get into Poland On Monday, EU foreign ministers held a meeting and agreed to move ahead with imposing more sanctions on Belarus - the fifth round of such restrictions. The exact details will by confirmed later this week, but the Belarusian airline Belavia will be affected, with the EU ending its leasing contract with the company. Travel agencies are also expected to be sanctioned if they helped to fly migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere to Minsk. On Monday, Mr Lukashenko threatened to retaliate against fresh sanctions. He claimed Belarusian authorities were trying to repatriate stranded migrants but many were refusing to go.

"The Trump Organization bought a 60-year lease on the building in 2012 The Trump Organization has reportedly reached a deal to sell its prized Washington hotel for $375m (Â£279m). Under the planned sale, the Trump International will be renamed the Waldorf Astoria and managed by the Hilton group, according to reports. Last month, a US congressional probe found the hotel lost more than $70m during Donald Trump's presidency. The former US president's company opened the hotel to the public in September 2016. The Trump Organization, which bought a 60-year lease on the building, had been looking for buyers for the 263-room hotel since 2019. The deal with Miami-based investment firm CGI Merchant Group is expected to be finalised in the first quarter of next year, sources told The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. The 120-year-old building stands less than a mile away from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue. The Trump Organization won approval to redevelop the historic Old Post Office building in 2012. It opened as a hotel four years later, just weeks after Mr Trump accepted the Republican Party's nomination to run for president. The hotel is on Pennsylvania Avenue and less than a mile from the White House During Mr Trump's term as president, the hotel became popular amongst Republicans visiting the city. But it also attracted controversy. In 2018,religious leaders called for its liquor licence to be revoked, claiming its owner was ""not a person of good character"". More recently,a congressional investigationfound that Mr Trump had ""grossly exaggerated"" the hotel's profits when he claimed it made $150m during his term. The congressional committee said the hotel had instead lost more than $70m while he was in office. The report also found Mr Trump seemed to have ""concealed potential conflicts of interest"" related to his ownership of the hotel and his roles as its lender and the guarantor of third-party loans. Documents showed that the hotel received $3.7m in payments from foreign governments - enough to cover 7,400 nights at the hotel on an average daily rate, according to the committee. The Trump Organization denied wrongdoing and called the report ""misleading"". The Trump Organization and CGI Merchant Group did not immediately respond to the BBC's requests for comment on the sale of the Trump International Hotel.

"This video can not be played Watch: The cab pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital and exploded into flames A man who was killed outside Liverpool Women's Hospital on Remembrance Sunday when his homemade bomb went off has been identified as 32-year-old Emad Al Swealmeen. He was an asylum seeker born in Iraq who is understood to have converted to Christianity in 2017. Al Swealmeen was the passenger of the taxi destroyed in the blast. The driver, David Perry, did not suffer life-threatening injuries. Four men were arrested under the Terrorism Act, but have since been released from police custody without charge. Merseyside Police were called at 10:59 GMT on 14 November to reports of a car explosion at Liverpool Women's Hospital. The taxi carrying Al Swealmeen had pulled up to the hospital and exploded shortly afterwards. Al Swealmeen, who had been picked up from the Rutland Avenue area and asked to be taken to the hospital about 10 minutes away, died at the scene. This video can not be played Watch: Police say passenger brought explosive device into taxi On Monday Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said the passenger appeared to have made an improvised device that caused the explosion. He said officers investigating the incident could not ""at this time draw any connection"" with Remembrance Sunday events taking place near the hospital but he confirmed this was ""a line of inquiry"". Taxi driver David Perry has been discharged from hospital and his wife Rachel said it had been ""an utter miracle"" that he had escaped from the vehicle. Mr Jackson said he could not confirm reports Mr Perry had locked the doors of the taxi before the explosion. He said it appeared to have been an ""unremarkable journey"" to the hospital. Taxi driver David Perry has been discharged from hospital Pictures of a burning car outside the hospital have been widely shared on social media About two hours after the blast, properties on Rutland Avenue near Sefton Park, in the south-east of the city, and in the Kensington area, east of the city centre, were raided by armed officers. Three arrests took place in Sutcliffe Street, in Kensington, where witnesses reported seeing armed officers approach a terraced house. The second raid around Sutcliffe Street and the adjacent Boaler Street - about a mile from the hospital -  took place an hour later, at about 14:00 GMT. There was a heavy police presence, including police negotiators, outside the house on Rutland Avenue overnight. Police confirmed a controlled explosion had been carried out as a precaution in the Sefton Park area at about 16:00 GMT as part of the investigation but there was no wider risk to the public. Mr Jackson said officers had made ""significant progress"" and had a ""much greater understanding of the component parts of the device, how they were obtained and how the parts are likely to have been assembled"". He said following interviews with the arrested men, police were ""satisfied with the accounts they have provided"" and they were released from custody. Specialist officers were seen on Rutland Avenue The wreckage of the taxi was removed on Wednesday and specialist officers were expected to continue searches at the hospital into Thursday, said Mr Jackson. A post mortem on Al Swealmeen found the cause of death to be ""injuries sustained from the fire and explosion"", he said. Police have traced his next of kin who told them he was born in Iraq. ""Our inquiries have found that Al Swealmeen has had episodes of mental illness, this will form part of the investigation and will take some time to fully understand,"" said Mr Jackson. He said they had not found any link to others in the Merseyside area but could not yet rule it out. Nick Aldworth, a former counter terror co-ordinator, said investigators would be focused on what happened inside the vehicle. ""I have to say from what I've seen there is very little blast damage - a lot of fire damage but very little blast damage. So whatever was in that vehicle was either a low yield or didn't work properly or was possibly an incendiary."" Emad Al Swealmeen during a service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral, alongside Bishop Cyril Ashton Al Swealmeenbegan making purchases for his attack in April, counter-terror police said. Mr Jackson said the bomber had lived at a property in Sutcliffe Street for some time. And he began renting a property in Rutland Avenue in April. Police recovered ""significant items"" from his latest address, where searches have been taking place since Sunday. Al Swealmeen is not believed to have been known to MI5, according to BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera. One of the members of his tribe in Jordan told the BBC that Al Swealmeen was Jordanian, but born in Iraq. His family settled in the United Arab Emirates in 1996. Al Swealmeen left for Syria 12 years ago, then headed to Turkey, eventually applying for asylum by claiming he was Syrian. The tribe member - who knows Al Swealmeen's father - said the attacker had a history of mental illness. Immigration records seen by the BBC show Al Swealmeen was first refused asylum in the UK in 2014. He challenged the decision, but in April 2015 a judge ruled the Home Office had been correct. In June 2015 he launched an attempt to overturn that decision, but that application was refused in August 2015 by the Upper Tier Tribunal - the court dedicated to immigration appeals. At that stage the case appears to have been closed - and by 2017 friends of Al Swealmeen in Liverpool understood his legal avenues had been exhausted. Whether the Home Office ordered him to leave the UK is not clear. During this period he turned to Christianity and became known locally as Enzo Almeni, a name he adopted as part of his conversion. Court records show that he then renewed his immigration appeal - under this alternative name - in January this year. His submissions were under review at the time of his death. A Christian couple,Elizabeth and Malcolm Hitchcott told ITV News that Al Swealmeen briefly lived with them,externalat their Liverpool home after his conversion to Christianity. Mr Hitchcott described him as a ""very quiet fellow"" who formally converted from Islam at a ceremony in Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral. Al Swealmeen is believed to have been baptised in 2015 and confirmed in 2017 - before the cathedral lost contact with him in 2018, according to the Diocese of Liverpool's communication's director, Stuart Haynes. The Reverend Mike Hindley said Al Swealmeen was involved in the Emmanuel Church in the Fazakerley area of Liverpool from 2017 to 2019, when they lost touch with him. A spokesman for the City of Liverpool College said Al Swealmeen was an adult cake decorating student at the college during the 2018-2019 academic year. In the years before the attack, Al Swealmeen was sectioned under the Mental Health Act for about six months because of his behaviour with a knife, Mr Hitchcott said. Al Swealmeen was described as a ""lovely guy"" by Mrs Hitchcott, who told the BBC ""we just loved him"", adding she was saddened and ""very shocked"" by Sunday's incident.

"World leaders agreed to phase-out ""inefficient"" subsidies for fossil fuels at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow. Despite pledges to limit support, governments around the worldspend more than $420bn (Â£313bn) each year,externalsubsidising the non-renewable energy, according to the UN Development Programme. How do fossil fuel subsidies work and which countries are spending the most? Fossil fuel subsidies are measures taken by governments that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. These take two forms: production subsidies - tax breaks or direct payments that reduce the cost of producing fossil fuels consumption subsidies - energy price cuts for consumers, such as setting fixed prices at petrol stations Transparency on fossil fuel funding is generally poor, but about three-quarters of the world's subsidies are estimated to be focused on consumers, and a quarter on producers. Consumption subsidies are often seen in lower-income countries - largely to help alleviate poverty through measures that can make cooking gas cheaper, or lower the cost of transport. Iran topped the list for consumption subsidies for 2020 -according to data from the International Energy Agency (IEA),external-  followed by China and India, all of whom subsidise petrol prices. An agreement published at the end of COP26 climate summit called on all countries to accelerate the phasing-out of ""inefficient"" subsidies for fossil fuels - but no firm dates have been set. All countries in the G7 - representing the world's largest advanced economies - have previously committed to phase out ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies by 2025. The IEA defines an ""inefficient"" subsidy as something that encourages wasteful consumption. ""If you look globally, you can see there is progress on phasing out subsidies, but it is slow,"" says Peter Wooders, senior director at the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD). ""Within the G7 members there's been some progress on subsidy reform, but it's been quite limited - they really need to do better and it's obviously inconsistent with climate pledges,"" he adds. Support for fossil fuels across 81 major economieshas been declining in recent years,externalbut was still more than $350bn in 2020. The Energy Policy Tracker has collected data,externalon how major countries have enacted new policies since January 2020 to help fund the energy industry. It found that since the start of 2020, the world's major economies have spent more funding fossil fuels through new or amended policies than clean energy. The definition of a subsidy is broader than the IEA and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimates, so the overall figures are higher, but they give us an idea of how countries are funding clean energy compared with fossil fuels. The US and the UK have invested in clean energy, but they have still spent significantly more funding fossil fuels, according to the data. US President Joe Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have both said tackling fossil fuel subsidies is a top priority. In January this year, Mr Biden signed an order to stop fossil fuel subsidies - pledging to eliminate government support by 2022. The Environmental and Energy Study Institute estimates,externaldirect subsidies to the fossil fuel industry in the US amount to $20bn per year - 80% of which goes towards oil and gas. On top of this, the US provides a number of tax breaks to the fossil fuel industry to encourage domestic energy production. Mr Johnson announced in December 2020 that the UK would stop supporting the fossil fuel industry overseas. A BBC investigation last yearfound the UK was spending billions of pounds on fossil fuel projects abroad. China and India have been increasing investment in renewable energy - but they remain amongst the world's largest public financiers of fossil fuels, spending tens of billions of dollars every year by subsidising both their production and consumption. Saudi Arabia and Russia have long-standing policies of subsidising fossil fuel consumption through low energy prices, because of vast natural resources of oil and natural gas. According to the IISD, Saudi Arabiais doing the least,externalof the G20 countries to phase out fossil fuel funding. It has joined other G20 nations in a pledge to phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, but no target date has been set. The COP26 global summit, in Glasgow, in November, is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions - and it could lead to major changes to everyday lives.

"This video can not be played Watch: The cab pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital and exploded into flames The UK terror threat level has been raised to ""severe"" after an explosion outside Liverpool Women's Hospital. Taxi driver David Perry survived the blast but his passenger was killed when a homemade bomb exploded shortly before 11:00 GMT on Remembrance Sunday. The man, who is believed to have manufactured and brought the device into the taxi, died at the scene. Police said the motivation for the attack was unclear but it had been declared as a terrorist incident. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the threat level had been raised from ""substantial"" to ""severe"", meaning an attack is highly likely, because the explosion in Liverpool was the second incident in a month. The death of Conservative MP Sir David Amess, who was stabbed multiple times during a meeting with his constituents in Essex on 15 October, has beentreated as a terrorist incident by police. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: ""What we saw yesterday was the second incident within a month"" Head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, Russ Jackson, said the taxi passenger appeared to have made an ""improvised explosive device"" which caused the blast. He said police knew the identity of the attacker but would not confirm his name at this stage. The man is not believed to have been known to MI5, according to BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera. Four men have been arrested in the city under the Terrorism Act as part of the investigation. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who chaired an emergency Cobra meeting earlier in response to the explosion, described it as a ""sickening attack"". He said it was a ""stark reminder for all of us to remain vigilant"", but added ""the British people will never be cowed by terrorism"". Taxi driver David Perry has been released from hospital Mr Jackson said Delta Taxis driver Mr Perry picked up a passenger in Rutland Avenue, near Sefton Park, on Sunday. ""As the taxi approached the drop-off point at the hospital an explosion occurred from within the car. This quickly engulfed it in flames,"" he said. ""Remarkably the taxi driver escaped from the cab."" Posting on Facebook, Mr Perry's wife Rachel said he was ""lucky to be alive"". ""The explosion happened whilst he was in the car and how he managed to escape is an utter miracle,"" she added. Liverpool explosion: What we know so far Taxi driver 'lucky to be alive' after explosion Liverpool Women's Hospital open for patients Mr Jackson said the taxi driver had been released from hospital after being treated for his injuries. He said police were ""aware there were Remembrance events just a short distance away from the hospital and that the ignition occurred shortly before 11:00 GMT"". ""We cannot at this time draw any connection with this but it is a line of inquiry we are pursuing,"" he added. While the police believe they know who the attacker was, difficult forensic work may be continuing to confirm the identity - particularly if experts have to resort to dental records and DNA. Digital forensic teams investigate the dead man's online habits and contacts. Officers will want to build a picture of his movements from mobile phone data and financial transactions. Bomb experts will be looking at how the device was made. These strands may lead detectives to vital CCTV evidence and locations or witnesses that will help reveal the attacker's planning. But the biggest priority will be to establish - if possible - whether there is any ongoing threat to the public. Police said a man, aged 20, was arrested earlier in the Kensington area of the city and was in custody. Three other men - aged 21, 26 and 29 - were detained on Sunday in Sutcliffe Street in Kensington. Mr Jackson said the arrested men were believed to be ""associates"" of the taxi passenger. He said officers were looking at the man's associates, his telephone records and purchases he may have made. This video can not be played Watch: Police say passenger brought explosive device into taxi Officers are searching two addresses, one in Sutcliffe Street and a second at Rutland Avenue, where ""significant items"" had been found, police said. A cordon is in place at both locations and eight families have been evacuated from their homes. Police have confirmed a controlled explosion was carried out as a precaution in the Sefton Park area, close to Rutland Avenue, at about 16:00 GMT on Monday as part of the investigation but there was no wider risk to the public. Frances Evans, who witnessed the explosion, told BBC News that three police vans and a little black van had pulled up before covering an unknown item. ""They weren't there long, probably 20 minutes max,"" she said. ""I saw the explosion, the smoke and heard the bang."" Mr Jackson said police had linked the taxi passenger to both the addresses but were uncertain which one he lived at. Neighbour Sharon Cullen said she was evacuated from her home near Sutcliffe Street by officers telling her ""whatever is going on at the back of the house, it could blow the block"". The home secretary said the explosion had a ""very significant impact across the community"" in Liverpool and her thoughts were with people in the city. Ms Patel said the government would ""continue to work with everyone when it comes to the security of our country and making sure that we're taking all the necessary steps required"". Assessments of threat levels are taken by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), part of MI5, which makes recommendations independently from the government. A ""severe"" threat,externalis classed as an attack on the UK being ""highly likely"" and is the second highest alert below ""critical"", which means an attack is ""highly likely in the near future"". The rise in the threat level is not based on specific intelligence of an ongoing threat in Liverpool. Rather it is based on an overall assessment by the Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre. They have looked at the fact that there have been two incidents in the last month - the killing of Sir David Amess MP and now Liverpool - and judged that the overall picture has changed. It is not totally clear what the cause is - some speculate about people being inspired by international events, others wonder if it is to do with people emerging out of lockdown after having been radicalised online. Health Secretary Sajid Javid paid tribute to NHS staff at Liverpool Women's Hospital, as well as members of the emergency services, saying in the House of Commons they had showed the ""utmost professionalism in the most difficult of circumstances"". The chief executive of Liverpool Women's Hospital, Kathryn Thomson, paid tribute to ""brave and dedicated"" staff and emergency service workers but added the last two days had been ""extremely upsetting and traumatising"". She added that despite security and police on site, services were now running ""as close to normal as can be expected"". Did you witness what happened? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"More than 300,000 people working for employers who have voluntarily signed up to the Real Living Wage are getting a pay boost of 40p to Â£9.90 an hour. This is not to be confused with the compulsory National Living Wage, which is currently Â£8.91 an hour for anyone over the age of 23. Real Living Wage employers in London will pay Â£11.05 an hour, a 20p rise. Almost 9,000 employers throughout the country have signed up to the policy - 3,000 of them during the pandemic. The latest employers to join include housebuilders Taylor Wimpey and Persimmon Homes, Fujitsu, food delivery company Getir and outsourcing firm Capita. Companies already accredited include half of the FTSE 100 and big household names such as Everton Football Club, insurer Aviva, luxury goods brand Burberry and the Nationwide building society. The recommended rate is intended to ensure all staff earn a wage that meets the real cost of living and covers everyday needs. Latest research by the Living Wage Foundation shows that there are still 4.8 million jobs - 17.1% of all employees - still paying less than the Real Living Wage in the UK. Northern Ireland had the highest proportion of jobs paying below the Living Wage at 21.3%, while south-east England had the lowest at 12.8%. Workers from ethnic minority groups are also more likely to be low-paid, with 19.4% of these workers earning below the Living Wage, compared with 16.3% of white workers. The Living Wage Foundation's director, Katherine Chapman, said the new pay rates, which apply from Monday, would ""provide hundreds of thousands of workers and their families with greater security and stability"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme. she said: ""It is still a pound, two pounds higher than the [national] minimum wage and that makes a huge difference. That means not having to worry about putting food on the table, or paying the bills at the end of the month. ""And we've seen record numbers of employers signing up this year because ultimately they want to do the right thing by their workers."" Minimum wage for 23 year-olds to rise to Â£9.50 How much is the minimum wage? Gerald Mason, senior vice president at Tate and Lyle Sugars, told the BBC it had signed up to the Real Living Wage last year because ""it was the right thing to do"". ""The teams that benefited feel much more stable and secure because their pay is much more secure. Previously they'd have to move jobs for 20 or 30 pence and hour, now the turnover in those teams is right down,"" he said. ""Secondly, although it only affects 5% of our workforce, it has a disproportionate impact on the wellbeing of everybody, because [the workers who see a pay rise] are the people that feed them breakfast in the canteen, keep their workplaces clean, and keep them safe."" TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said that the organisation's report showed that low pay was ""endemic"", with millions of workers in jobs that do not fully cover their bills. ""With Britain in the middle of a cost-of-living crunch, it's time for the government to act,"" she said. ""Ministers must start by increasing the minimum wage to Â£10 immediately, banning zero hours contracts and giving trade unions greater access to workplaces to negotiate improved pay and conditions."" At the Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced that the National Living Wage will increase next year by 6.6%, to Â£9.50 an hour. The Universal Credit taper rate will also be cut, allowing claimants to keep more of the payment. Minimum wage for 23 year-olds to rise to Â£9.50 How much will the minimum wage rise by?

"Chris Davies, Amelia Armour and Jack Barton from the charity Mustard Tree in Greater Manchester Hundreds of charities are concerned about whether they will cope with rising demand for services this winter, according to research given exclusively to the BBC's Wake Up to Money podcast. The survey of nearly 350 charity managers was carried out by the Law Family Commission on Civil Society between 18 and 24 October 2021. Of those who took part, 210 said they expected demand to rise this winter. The commission said charities were facing a ""perfect storm"" of factors. Charity managers across the UK were asked by YouGov how demand had changed during the Covid pandemic. Budget: Millions of poor families hit, analysis finds Tax burden to rise by Â£3,000 per family, warns think tank Jack Barton works for the Mustard Tree charity, which works to tackle poverty and homelessness in Greater Manchester. The charity was busy before the coronavirus pandemic, but now staff and volunteers are seeing demand surge. ""Winter especially is always our hardest time of year - particularly on the food front,"" Mr Barton said. ""We're located in an area of incredible inequality. We're surrounded by a very affluent residential area, a commercial district, but we also know there's roughly 900 families within a couple of miles' radius of this hub who are living in appalling conditions."" Matt Whittaker, chief executive of the Law Family Commission on Civil Society, toldthe BBC's Wake Up to Money programme: ""Charities have been dealing with a perfect storm of constrained resources and bigger demand. But they've coped and helped as many people as they can. ""We're now at the stage, though, where some of those problems are going to amplify."" Amelia Armour of the Mustard Tree charity is braced for a hard winter Charities working in health and social services reported being particularly affected. Some said they would not have the capacity to meet the anticipated rise in demand over the next three months. Cultural and recreational charities say they have also seen a rise in demand now that restrictions have lifted. The biggest worry for charity bosses is the pressure that this puts on staff and volunteers. Amelia Armour had a career change during the lockdown from retail to adult social care. She joined the Mustard Tree team during the coronavirus lockdown. ""Occasionally, yes, it's challenging, but I love it. Every day is like a new experience,"" she says. Amelia says she has noticed the service is feeling more stretched. ""I am fairly concerned. I think it's going to get a lot busier. ""When it's really cold weather, we get crisis warnings, we need to find a bed for people. Our hubs are going to get busier as well."" The charity's food and drink manager, Chris Davies, agrees. ""When I first joined, our food clubs were probably doing around 300 to 400 visits a month. Last month, we did about 2,800 visits,"" he told the BBC. There are many possible reasons for an increase in demand for the services that these charities provide. Managers cite the rise in the cost of living, delays in medical operations, delays in the justice system, cuts to other services and the end of the Universal Credit uplift. Charities have received additional government support during the pandemic. In spring 2020, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced a Â£750m support package for the not-for-profit sector, aimed at supporting charities that needed to continue working as part of the Covid-19 response. Mr Whittaker says the solution lies in investing in skills and more collaboration between charities, government and business. ""It's also about the public. Better-off households haven't been spending as much,"" he says. ""Longer-term, there also needs to be some structural change to weather future storms."" A spokesperson for the government said it was ""committed"" to supporting charities, having provided ""an unprecedented multi-billion-pound package of government support for them during the most critical stage of the pandemic"". The spokesperson added that the government continued to work closely with the sector.

"There will ""definitely"" be enough turkeys for Christmas, the British Poultry Council (BPC) has said. The pledge from the industry body came as the deadline closes to recruit thousands of temporary workers from the European Union to help process turkeys, amid widespread UK labour shortages. It believes about half of the visas made available have been taken up, but says this will be enough. ""It'll get us over the line,"" said the head of the BPC, Richard Griffiths. Although he predicted there would be ""a bird for everyone who wants one"", people would have less choice overall this year, he said. ""We've been able to streamline products and reduce the variety, so that helps with the overall volume. There will be a focus on whole birds and very simple crowns and roasts,"" he added. After months of pressure, the government relaxed immigration rules in September, making 5,500 visas available for foreign workers as a temporary measure to help the poultry industry get through Christmas. Farmers warn of Christmas turkey shortage Abattoir labour shortage sees farmer kill piglets Christmas turkey shortage likely, farmers warn The BPC reckons 2,500 to 3,000 applications have been made, although the Home Office and Defra would not comment, and those workers are now starting to arrive. These numbers are way below the 5,500 visas up for grabs - the number that the industry had estimated were needed at the start of the year. But Mr Griffiths says that thanks to a cut in the number of birds being reared, as well as producers managing to recruit some local EU seasonal workers who have settled status in the UK, the industry can now cope. For Paul Kelly, the owner of KellyBronze, a turkey producer in Essex, the government's temporary visa scheme has made all the difference. He now has the workers he needs. ""Christmas has been saved. I just wish they'd done it earlier,"" he says. This relatively small family business is now in its 50th year and prides itself on raising free range, hand plucked birds. ""It's impossible to do this job without seasonal workers. People say to me, you should employ local people,"" Mr Kelly said. ""Well, I have four weeks' work at Christmas. So how can I expect people to give up a full-time job to come for a month? ""We're a seasonal agriculture business, just like raspberries and strawberries, and we need people to help with our harvest."" He managed to hire 63 mainly EU seasonal workers and needed another 22 through the government's emergency scheme. ""These 22 workers make up about 20% of my full team. It was touch and go and a lot of sleepless nights, up until the last week in September when we got the green light from the Government to get some visas"". Many shoppers have also been anxious. Consumers spent Â£6m more on frozen turkeys last month than a year earlier, according to data from Kantar. Households, it seems, have been racing to buy turkeys to stuff in the freezer, amid fears of festive shortages closer to Christmas. ""I don't think there will be people fighting over turkeys in the supermarket. The industry has pulled out all the stops and we will be supplying the Christmas market this year,"" said Mr Kelly. But he also agreed there would be less variety on offer. ""The visa scheme has helped, but it came too late for a lot of the Christmas catalogues which get done in May and June. ""All those lattice joints, stuffed joints, and all those fancy turkey joints - they've been shrunk right down. The range will be reduced, but the numbers will be there. "" His workers will be arriving over the next few days ready to start in earnest by the weekend, when the business will go at breakneck speed to fulfil some 26,000 orders. But Paul is already starting to think about next Christmas. He believes that without a permanent seasonal workers' scheme, the industry will shrink by another 15-20% next year. ""Without it, it's game over for the turkey industry,"" he said. ""If we can't supply the supermarkets, they might have to import turkeys from big producers in Poland and Germany, which is crazy.""

"Pictures of a burning car outside the hospital have been widely shared on social media Three men have been arrested under the Terrorism Act after a man was killed in a car explosion outside Liverpool Women's Hospital. A taxi carrying one passenger pulled up just before 11:00 GMT on Remembrance Sunday, as a national two minutes' silence was due to begin, and exploded. The passenger was declared dead at the scene and is yet to be formally identified. The male driver was injured and is in hospital in a stable condition. Liverpool explosion: What we know so far Detectives from Counter Terrorism Police North West said three men - aged 29, 26 and 21 - were detained in the Kensington area of the city. They said they were continuing to keep an open mind about the cause of the blast and were working with Merseyside Police as the investigation continued ""at pace"". The security service, MI5, is also assisting. Armed officers have carried out raids on properties on Rutland Avenue near Sefton Park, and around Sutcliffe Street and Boaler Street in Kensington. Specialist officers remain outside a house on Rutland Avenue, in an operation police say is linked to the explosion. Police negotiators are on the scene, a fire crew is on standby, and a number of residents have been evacuated. A large cordon, guarded by uniformed officers, remains in place. Police officers at an address in Rutland Avenue Specialist officers were seen on the street Carl Bessant, whose partner had just had a baby, was inside the hospital at the time of the blast. ""My partner is really shook up to be honest,"" he said. ""We were so close and she was feeding the baby when it happened. We heard a loud bang and looked out of the window. ""We saw the car on fire and someone jump out... screaming, and there was someone inside the car. ""The hospital shut down, no-one in or out, so they said, but people were using the back entrance."" Police, fire and bomb disposal crews were at the scene of the blast which remains cordoned off Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsaid on Twitter,external: ""My thoughts are with all those affected by the awful incident in Liverpool today. ""I want to thank the emergency services for their quick response and professionalism, and the police for their ongoing work on the investigation."" Home Secretary Priti Patelalso tweeted,externalshe was ""being kept regularly updated on the awful incident"". By Jim Clarke, BBC North West Tonight deputy editor The first raid happened at about 13:00 GMT on Rutland Avenue in the Sefton Park area of the city. It's about 0.75 miles from the hospital. It's an area of the city with large Victorian houses. The house that was raided had been split up into flats. Local residents said they had not seen anybody coming or going from the property for some weeks - they thought it was unoccupied. The street remains cordoned off and some residents have been evacuated. Police were also seen at Boaler Street in the Kensington area of the city. It's about a mile away from the hospital. Eyewitnesses on the street said armed police arrived at about 14:00 and raided a house. They said they saw men being arrested and handcuffed. They were led by armed officers into a car. That street also remains cordoned off. Chief Constable Serena Kennedy, of Merseyside Police, sought to reassure the public, saying events of this nature were very rare and that there would be an increased and visible police presence on the streets in the coming days. A bomb disposal unit and fire engines attended the scene earlier, which remains cordoned off. Road closures are also in place. Raids have been carried out by armed police near Sefton Park, and also in the Kensington area of the city Chief Constable Serena Kennedy said the police response would be ongoing ""for some time"" Police were called at 10:59 to reports of a car explosion. Phil Garrigan, chief fire officer of Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, said the car fire had been ""fully developed"" when crews arrived shortly after 11:00. ""The operational crews extinguished the fire rapidly but... there was one fatality,"" he said. ""Another individual had left the vehicle prior to the fire developing to the extent that it did. Our thoughts are with them and the families of those involved."" Nick Aldworth, a former counter terror co-ordinator, said investigators would be looking to ascertain what happened inside the vehicle. ""They'll be looking at what sort of damage has been caused, trying to get an assessment of what might have caused that blast,"" he toldBBC Radio 4's Todayprogramme. ""From what I've seen there is very little blast damage - a lot of fire damage but very little blast damage. ""So whatever was in that vehicle was either a low yield or didn't work properly or was possibly an incendiary."" Mr Aldworth explained it was common for investigations to be linked to terrorism quickly as it provides investigators with more resources from an earlier stage. He added that it was entirely appropriate to involve MI5 to understand if it holds relevant information. Liverpool Women's Hospital said visiting access had been restricted until further notice and patients had been diverted to other hospitals where possible. ""We are reviewing our patient activity for the next 24-48 hours and patients should wait to be contacted for updates about any planned appointments or other attendance at the hospital,"" chief executive Kathryn Thomson said. Liverpool Women's Hospital receives about 50,000 patients annually and is thelargest hospital in its specialism,externalin Europe. Did you witness what happened? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"David Perry has been discharged from hospital The wife of a taxi driver who survived an explosion inside his cab has said he is ""lucky to be alive"". David Perry was injured when a homemade bomb exploded shortly after he pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital on Sunday morning. The passenger, who is believed to have brought the device into the taxi, died at the scene. Mr Perry's wife Rachel said it had been ""an utter miracle"" that he had escaped from the vehicle. Posting on Facebook, she said she felt ""some guardian angels"" had been looking over him. Ms Perry also thanked the ""amazing staff, doctors and nurses"" at the hospital and the police officers and detectives ""who have been looking after us"". The explosion has since beendeclared as a terrorist incident. This video can not be played Watch: The cab pulled up outside Liverpool Women's Hospital and exploded into flames Mr Perry picked up a fare in the Rutland Avenue area of Liverpool and was asked to be taken to the hospital, about 10 minutes away, police said. As the taxi arrived at the hospital's drop-off area just before 11:00 GMT, it exploded and Mr Perry escaped the car seconds before it was engulfed in flames. ""He is without a doubt lucky to be alive,"" Ms Perry said. ""The explosion happened whilst he was in the car and how he managed to escape is an utter miracle."" Man killed in Liverpool hospital blast named Liverpool explosion: What we know so far Hospital open for patients amid tightened security Russ Jackson, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North West, said he had spoken to Mr Perry who was still ""shaken and injured"" but had yet to receive his full account of what happened. The driver did not suffer life-threatening injuries and has since been discharged from hospital. Mr Jackson said he could not confirm reports Mr Perry had locked the doors of the taxi before the explosion. Police, fire and bomb disposal crews were at the scene of the blast, which remains cordoned off Prime Minister Boris Johnson has praised Mr Perry's actions. ""It does look as though the taxi driver in question did behave with incredible presence of mind and bravery,"" he said. The city's mayor Joanne Anderson said the taxi driver's ""heroic efforts"" averted what could have been an ""awful disaster"" on Remembrance Sunday. The dead passenger has not yet been formally identified. Four men have been arrested under the Terrorism Act, while MI5 is assisting regional counter-terrorism police. Raids were carried out by armed police near Sefton Park, and also in the Kensington area of Liverpool Liverpool's Metro Mayor Steve Rotheram thanked ""everyone who acted so quickly to intervene"" and appealed for people to ""remain calm and vigilant"" and to ""avoid spreading rumours and misinformation"". He said this was ""an attempt to sow discord and division within our communities"" but Liverpool was known for ""solidarity and resilience"", adding: ""We will never let those who seek to divide us win."" A police cordon remains in place around Liverpool Women's Hospital, although it remains open for patients. Visiting arrangements have been restricted until further notice, the hospital said. An online fundraiser started by people involved in the taxi trade in the city has raised more than Â£21,000. Organiser Jenny Phillips said the appeal was ""simply to help a family and a good guy who didn't deserve this, and has a lot of recovery to do but deserves a medal for his actions"". She told the Liverpool Echo:,external""We waited until we knew more details of what had happened and we were shocked. ""His family have since been in touch and said there are a number of other fundraisers that have been set up but are not official and the family are concerned people will be giving money to people they do not know.""

"Rapper Travis Scott said he was devastated by what happened at the Astroworld festival A nine-year-old boy placed in an induced coma after a crowd surge at the Astroworld festival in Houston, Texas, has died, a family lawyer says. Ezra Blount had been on life support in hospital due to severe brain and organ trauma since the show on 5 November. He is the youngest of 10 concertgoers to have been killed after panic broke out during rapper Travis Scott's headline performance. Hundreds of others were hurt when the crowd began to press towards the stage. Attorneys representing more than 200 people claiming they were injured in the crush told reporters on Friday they were filing another 90 lawsuits against the promoters of the event. Astroworld tragedy: Were warning signs missed? Festival survivors recall panic: 'I had to get out of there' Who were the victims? On Sunday, a lawyer for the family of Ezra Blount confirmed the boy's death. ""Ezra's death is absolutely heartbreaking,"" civil rights attorney Ben Crump said in a statement. ""This should not have been the outcome of taking their son to a concert."" In an earlier interview with local news outlet ABC13, Ezra's father Treston Blount said he was ""not ready to lose my boy"". ""We still got a bunch of living to do,"" he said, describing how his son was a huge Scott fan who was ""stoked"" ahead of the performance. Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner said he was ""saddened to learn of Ezra's death"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"There will ""definitely"" be enough turkeys for Christmas, the British Poultry Council (BPC) has said. The pledge from the industry body came as the deadline closes to recruit thousands of temporary workers from the European Union to help process turkeys, amid widespread UK labour shortages. It believes about half of the visas made available have been taken up, but says this will be enough. ""It'll get us over the line,"" said the head of the BPC, Richard Griffiths. Although he predicted there would be ""a bird for everyone who wants one"", people would have less choice overall this year, he said. ""We've been able to streamline products and reduce the variety, so that helps with the overall volume. There will be a focus on whole birds and very simple crowns and roasts,"" he added. After months of pressure, the government relaxed immigration rules in September, making 5,500 visas available for foreign workers as a temporary measure to help the poultry industry get through Christmas. Farmers warn of Christmas turkey shortage Abattoir labour shortage sees farmer kill piglets Christmas turkey shortage likely, farmers warn The BPC reckons 2,500 to 3,000 applications have been made, although the Home Office and Defra would not comment, and those workers are now starting to arrive. These numbers are way below the 5,500 visas up for grabs - the number that the industry had estimated were needed at the start of the year. But Mr Griffiths says that thanks to a cut in the number of birds being reared, as well as producers managing to recruit some local EU seasonal workers who have settled status in the UK, the industry can now cope. For Paul Kelly, the owner of KellyBronze, a turkey producer in Essex, the government's temporary visa scheme has made all the difference. He now has the workers he needs. ""Christmas has been saved. I just wish they'd done it earlier,"" he says. This relatively small family business is now in its 50th year and prides itself on raising free range, hand plucked birds. ""It's impossible to do this job without seasonal workers. People say to me, you should employ local people,"" Mr Kelly said. ""Well, I have four weeks' work at Christmas. So how can I expect people to give up a full-time job to come for a month? ""We're a seasonal agriculture business, just like raspberries and strawberries, and we need people to help with our harvest."" He managed to hire 63 mainly EU seasonal workers and needed another 22 through the government's emergency scheme. ""These 22 workers make up about 20% of my full team. It was touch and go and a lot of sleepless nights, up until the last week in September when we got the green light from the Government to get some visas"". Many shoppers have also been anxious. Consumers spent Â£6m more on frozen turkeys last month than a year earlier, according to data from Kantar. Households, it seems, have been racing to buy turkeys to stuff in the freezer, amid fears of festive shortages closer to Christmas. ""I don't think there will be people fighting over turkeys in the supermarket. The industry has pulled out all the stops and we will be supplying the Christmas market this year,"" said Mr Kelly. But he also agreed there would be less variety on offer. ""The visa scheme has helped, but it came too late for a lot of the Christmas catalogues which get done in May and June. ""All those lattice joints, stuffed joints, and all those fancy turkey joints - they've been shrunk right down. The range will be reduced, but the numbers will be there. "" His workers will be arriving over the next few days ready to start in earnest by the weekend, when the business will go at breakneck speed to fulfil some 26,000 orders. But Paul is already starting to think about next Christmas. He believes that without a permanent seasonal workers' scheme, the industry will shrink by another 15-20% next year. ""Without it, it's game over for the turkey industry,"" he said. ""If we can't supply the supermarkets, they might have to import turkeys from big producers in Poland and Germany, which is crazy.""
