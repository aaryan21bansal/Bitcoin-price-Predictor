"Day one: Canada 1-1 GB - Davis Cup World Group 1st round (Ottawa) Vasek Pospisil (Can) beats Kyle Edmund (GB) 6-4 6-1 7-6 (7-3) Dan Evans (GB) beats Denis Shapovalov (Can) 6-3 6-3 6-4 Best-of-five tie - doubles on Saturday, reverse singles on Sunday Jonathan Jurejko and Caroline Chapman We're nicely poised going into Saturday's rubber, then, eh? Join us on BBC Two and on BBC Sport website from 18:00 GMT on Saturday for the doubles, where Dom Inglot and Jamie Murray will be taking to the court for Great Britain. Goodnight! Pospisil 6-4 6-1 7-6 (7-3) Edmund Jamie BakerFormer GB Davis Cup player on BBC Two As good as Kyle Edmund is, that match highlighted the one thing that he needs to improve. There just isn't a plan B. He's needs to be able to take a step back and realise it's not working. Pospisil was struggling to hold serve and was burning too much energy early on but Edmund wasn't saying anything.  Pospisil 6-4 6-1 7-6 (7-3) Edmund John LloydFormer GB Davis Cup captain on BBC Two The fast court definitely didn't suit Kyle Edmund. But the match getting away from him so quickly was what I found really disappointing.Â He's had enough experience to hang in more on his serve and make it a closer match.Â He was playing a man with no confidence. But he looked like the player bereft of confidence. Pospisil 6-4 6-1 7-6 (7-3) Edmund Our tennis correspondent takes a positive view of the wider context...Â Allow Twitter content?

Pospisil played the better tennis and deserved the win. The middle part of the second set got away too quickly for him. Then it was difficult ask for anyone. Pospisil 6-4 6-1 7-6 (7-3) Edmund This video can not be played Pospisil completes straight sets victory over Edmund And with another huge, huge serve Vasek Pospisil takes the tie-break, takes the game, takes the third set and takes the match. That makes it Canada 1-1 Great Britain after Friday's rubbers.Â *Pospisil 6-4 6-1 6-6 (6-3) Edmund Four match points for Vasek Pospisil... Net first serve...let...Edmund finally gets the ball in play... A forehand goes deep, is it out? Hawkeye intervenes...in. One match point saved by the Brit. But Pospisil has two serves for the match... Pospisil 6-4 6-1 6-6 (6-2) Edmund* Pospisil moves clear - he has four match points.Â Pospisil 6-4 6-1 6-6 (5-2) Edmund* Whooosh! Pospisil goes out wide with a howitzer of an ace. Edmund wafting fresh air. *Pospisil 6-4 6-1 6-6 (4-2) Edmund A fist pump and a yelp as Pospisil sends a trademark huge serve towards Edmund and the Brit fails to return.Â *Pospisil 6-4 6-1 6-6 (3-2) Edmund Mini-break for Pospisil. The big Canadian goes on the aggressive, Edmund buckles with a loose backhand. Pospisil 6-4 6-1 6-6 (2-2) Edmund* Edmund reckons he's just landed a killer ace. Pospisil reviews...and it's in! Just... Pospisil 6-4 6-1 6-6 (2-1) Edmund* Huge first serve down the 'T' from Pospisil. Edmund gets strings on the ball - but no direction. *Pospisil 6-4 6-1 6-6 (1-1) Edmund Pospisil, on his second serve, overpowers Edmund, who hits well wide of the tramlines.Â *Pospisil 6-4 6-1 6-6 (0-1) Edmund Right then. Edmund to serve first... A brief rally ends when Pospisil slaps forehand into the net. So far so good for the Brit... Pospisil 6-4 6-1 6-6 Edmund* Is this a change of tide we see? It's Kyle Edmund's turn to go 0-30 up. Pospisil fends of the immediate danger to level, and he comes into the net and slices on to the chalk of the baseline.Â But now Edmund brings us to deuce... A delicate exchange at the net, with both men stooping low, sees Pospisil earn the point and he serves ace number 18 on the two-hour mark. Tie break time!  *Pospisil 6-4 6-1 5-6 Edmund Jamie BakerFormer GB Davis Cup player on BBC Two That point at 40-30 was one of the best points of the match, certainly from the baseline from Pospisil. He was so quick to get around and use his forehand when he saw Edmund was in trouble. But Edmund came back for an incredible hold. He fended off a lot of heat from Pospisil. *Pospisil 6-4 6-1 5-6 Edmund Is the Canadian on the home straight now? Pospisil moves 0-30 up on Kyle Edmund's serve.Â But the big man in red slams into the net and then carelessly flicks it into the same spot on the next point for 30-30. Edmund edges ahead to 40-30 but then his opponent comes out on top after a brilliant rally. Deuce. Pospisil shanks wide after a big second serve from Edmund and the Briton hits a fabulous forehand to hold. A big hold.Â Pospisil 6-4 6-1 5-5 Edmund* Oooh, ok. This is interesting. A double fault from Pospisil.Â But the Canadian is back fist pumping again as he edges 30-15 ahead before slamming down another ace - his 16th of the match - for 40-15, which Edmund reviews but it's well in. Pospisil overawes Edmund with another big serve and we are back level again in the third set. #bbctennis Jack Roberts:ÂThese games are going so quick! Come on Kyle, let's start the comeback here!

"CCTV images showing the aftermath of an attack by a man with a machete at the Louvre museum in Paris feature in many papers - with theDaily Telegraph saying troops had prevented a fresh terrorist incident,external. Thei reports that the man was shot several times,externalin the stomach, after he allegedly attacked soldiers with a machete, shouting ""Allahu Akbar"". TheDaily Mirror reports,external50 sixth formers from Surrey were held inside the museum for two hours as the authorities searched for possible bombs. There is anger at Npower's decision to increase its energy prices by an average of more than a Â£100 a year for customers on its standard variable tariff. TheDaily Express describes the move as a ""kick in the teeth"",externalfor families. ""For too long these companies have been making huge profits while punishing their customers,"" it says. TheDaily Mirror comments that such a price hike demands ""powerful action"",externaland calls for the ""tough regulation of companies ripping off customers"". TheTimes reports on its front page that the shadow international trade secretary,externalBarry Gardiner is receiving money from a law firm with links to the Chinese state. The paper says the son of the law firm's founder works in the MP's office - and that the donations partly pay his salary. There's no suggestion of impropriety, but some Labour sources have expressed ""disquiet"" to the paper. According to the Guardian,,externalJeremy Corbyn's team have ""informally explored the idea of collaborating with the Greens and Liberal Democrats"" in Stoke Central, to prevent UKIP winning the seat at the upcoming by-election. The paper says a senior figure in the Labour leader's office has asked a go-between what it would take to persuade the other parties to ""dial down"" their campaigns - or even withdraw candidates. The Daily Telegraph and Times both report on what the government may do to alleviate the housing crisis. ""Get building or lose planning"" is the headline on the front of the Telegraph,external, which says developers will be ordered to make use of planning permission quickly - or risk losing it. The paper says ministers want to discourage firms from sitting on land earmarked for new homes. According to the Times, local authorities will be told to target vacant properties,externalwith sharp rises in council tax, as part of a drive to bring hundreds of thousands of empty homes back into use. Elsewhere,a police chief in Merseyside has spoken to the Guardian,externalabout the pressing need for communities in Liverpool to break the wall of silence around gang crime. Assistant chief constable Nikki Holland urges residents to ""stop tolerating"" gang members in their midst and ""take back control"" by talking to police. What is called the on-going ""veg panic"" also attracts headlines. TheDaily Mail says a growing number of supermarkets are rationing vegetables,externalin response to crop shortages caused by adverse weather across the Mediterranean. Some stores, it reports, have even decided to block people from buying certain products online. ""Seize a salad"" is the headline in the Sun,,externalwhich accuses Spanish supermarkets of ""stockpiling"" lettuces, while shelves across the UK are left bare. For some columnists, the entire episode illustrates the lunacy of our consumer habits.""Humans are absurd"" writes Deborah Orr in the Guardian.,external ""Why do we persist in flying planes full of lettuce to Britain? How can it be said to be a consumer crisis when such a  piece of ridiculous foolishness goes wrong?"" Finally, the papers seem bemused by David Cameron's reappearance in the limelight - alongside Arnold Schwarzenegger. TheSun says the former prime minister appeared in a short 10-second video,externalposted by the actor-turned-politician on social media. TheDaily Mail says he is seen leaning into the shot and draping his arm over the star,external, before saying ""I'll be back"". ""Exactly what the former PM means is a mystery"" says the paper, adding he ""should probably know better than to make bold promises"" only seven months after being forced to bid ""hasta la vista to Number 10"".

"Isabella Lovin's photo posted on Facebook is being compared to an image of President Trump Sweden's deputy PM is causing a stir after posting an image appearing to parody Donald Trump's signing of an anti-abortion executive order. Isabella Lovin, who is also the country's climate minister,published a photo,externalthat shows her signing a new law surrounded by female colleagues. The image has drawn comparisons with Mr Trump's photo in which no women were present. Within hours the post was shared and liked thousands of times on Facebook. ""Wonderful Picture! Hope you sent it to the man on the other side of the ocean,"" writes one user. ""Make the Planet Great Again!"" writes another. Facebook user Kimini Delfos said in a post that such an image should not spark the reaction that it has, suggesting that people ""calm down"". ""Why is it so difficult to see a picture with just women and not difficult to see a picture with only men?"" she questioned. Why are people talking about this picture? Trump reverses foreign abortion policy Can Paris climate agreement survive Trump presidency? Meanwhile, users of the social media site Twitter have praised what is being described as Ms Lovin's ""dig"" at the US president. ""Love how the Swedish Deputy PM is taking a dig at Donald Trump in her publicity photo for passing climate change law,"" writes user Ian Sinkins. Another, Mikaela Hildebrand, writes: ""@IsabellaLovin signs new the Swedish climate law & issues funniest #Trumbburn foto! Epic!"" The comparisons are being made to a photo last month of Mr Trump signing an executive order to ban federal money going to international groups which perform or provide information on abortions. The image of Mr Trump signing the document surrounded by male colleagues was ridiculed on social media. On Friday, while signing Sweden's new climate law, Ms Lovin urged European countries to take a leading role in tackling climate change as ""the US is not there any more to lead"". The new law sets long-term goals for greenhouse gas reductions and will be legally binding for future administrations. Ms Lovin said Sweden wanted to set an example at a time when ""climate sceptics [are] really gaining power in the world again"". Mr Trump, who has previously called climate change a hoax, has raised speculation that he might pull the US out of theParis Agreement, which aims to tackle greenhouse gas emissions and limit the increase in global temperatures. The Swedish government, which claims to be ""the first feminist government in the world"", has also issued a statement affirming that gender equality is ""central"" to its priorities. ""Gender equality is also part of the solution to society's challenges and a matter of course in a modern welfare state - for justice and economic development,""the statement reads,external.

"Police officer Elizabeth Rooney felt the comments were ""misogynistic and unpresidential"" It seems President Trump has high standards when it comes to the way his staff are dressed. Looking the part is as important as acting the part when you are in the president's circle, apparently. But his reported requirement that his female staff ""should dress like women"" has provoked an inevitable backlash on social media. According to a former Trump campaign worker, quoted in anews report by Axios,external, the president wants the men who work for him to wear ties and the women to dress ""appropriately"". Dresses are apparently preferred, but if a female staffer wears jeans, they must ""look neat and orderly"", the publication reported. The internet responded in a powerful way, with many using the hashtag #DressLikeAWoman. Elizabeth Rooney, a police officer in Worcester, Massachusetts, and army veteran, posted a photo of her in uniform. She told the BBC:  ""I'll start dressing like a woman when he starts acting like a president.  I felt his remarks that women should ""dress like a woman"" are misogynistic and unpresidential. ""Each morning when I wake up, I dress myself in pride, honour, duty and freedom."" Dr Judy Melinek tweeted ""Yes I'm doing an autopsy wearing pearls."" The hashtag has already generated more than 130,000 tweets since early on Friday. One of the first tweets was by @NJGirlSEliza whose army uniform selfie has been retweeted nearly 2,000 times. Others followed suit by posting pictures of themselves in their own work attire or of other inspirational women. ""This is how you #DressLikeAWoman when there is hazardous waste"" Dr Rebecca Alleyne posted a photo of herself in scrubs during surgery. She told the BBC: ""I believe in social media as a change agent and a photo is an efficient means for making a point. I've had a very positive reaction, only one or two negatives. ""I want women everywhere to be judged on their abilities, not on what they're wearing. I believe that, no matter who's issuing the dress code."" Dr Rebecca Alleyne in Los Angeles responded to Trump's alleged comment with this picture of her at work There were some voices in favour of the more gender-appropriate approach, but the majority of comments appeared to mock the remarks, which have not been confirmed as coming from President Trump, which they perceived to be sexist.

"""Having tuberculosis in the brain is so painful. Sometimes I just wish I could cut off my head and put it to one side."" Johnny Islam, 29, is from Leyton in east London. Although having TB in the brain is rare, the disease itself is not. Once deadly in the Victorian era - when it was known as the white plague - it is often assumed that tuberculosis has long since been eradicated. But there are so many cases in London that the city is known as the TB capital of Western Europe. Having the disease has changed Johnny's life. It could cause long-term damage, or even kill him. ""I'm scared to go outside, I'm scared to do things on my own because I can blackout at any time. ""It can spread to any brain cells, it can damage your memory, and I forget things all the time. ""Everyone is going to die one day. This disease could kill me, anything can happen."" The most recent data on infection rates show parts of London still have higher rates of TB than in some developing countries, such as Iraq, Libya and even Yemen. It is a bacterial infection, which mainly affects the lungs, but can target any part of the body. It is curable in most cases. This video can not be played Tracking tuberculosis on the streets of London TB in the lungs is spread through inhaling tiny droplets containing the bacteria, from the coughs or sneezes of someone infected with it. Johnny's condition is rare and complex, and he's been taking a combination of 12 antibiotic tablets for more than a year. He's involved in video observed treatment - which involves him recording himself taking his medicine on a smartphone, and then sending the recording on a secure server to his health care workers, so they know he's sticking to the treatment. The first-ever trial of this method was carried out by University College London, in collaboration with University College London Hospitals. It saw patients recording themselves taking their medication daily using a dedicated smartphone. They then employ a custom app allowing secure upload to an NHS-approved server, for remote viewing by a trained observer. The trial's been described as a potential game-changer in the fight against tuberculosis in the UK. The preliminary results show more than 80% of patients completed the treatment using the technology, which paves the way for it to be used in the most complicated cases, such as Johnny's. Millions have been invested to try to eliminate TB as a public health problem. There were 5,758 new cases of active TB in the UK, in 2015 - and almost 40% of those were in London. Recently there's been a fall in overall cases, but those involving the most at risk and difficult to treat, such as people who are homeless, abusing drugs or in prison, are rising. Finding active cases is the first challenge - the next is getting them to stick to the long treatment, which involves a minimum of six months on a combination of antibiotics. Patients often stop midway, which can cause a relapse and strains of the bacteria to become resistant to drugs. Experts hope the video-observed treatment might help with this. Dr Alistair Story was involved in the video trial and said that if it ""works for TB, it works for other conditions"". ""With the emergence of drug-resistant strains of bacteria, we think this has an important role to play to prevent the spread of the disease."" Johnny is now nearing the end of his treatment. ""I have so many side-effects from all the medicines I'm taking. I've been losing my hair, and my left leg stops working sometimes. ""It's been difficult to stick to the treatment, but I hope it's worked and I can finally be TB free.""

"A top aide to US President Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway, has cited a ""massacre"" which never happened while defending the president's controversial immigration ban. Ms Conway said Mr Obama brought in a six-month ban on Iraqis after the arrest of ""the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre"". ""Most people don't know that because it didn't get covered,"" she added. In fact, there was no massacre at Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ms Conway, whose official role is counsellor to the president,later tweeted that she meant to say,external""Bowling Green terrorists"". She made her remarks during an interview with MSNBC television, in which she defended Donald Trump's ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. ""President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee programme after two Iraqis came here to this country were radicalised, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre,"" she said. Journalists versus Trump: A battle for the truth Are Pakistanis next for entry ban? Inside Trump's whirlwind Week 2 In 2011, Barack Obama's administration brought in enhanced security measures for Iraqis after two men were arrested on terror charges - but there was never a formal ban in place. It came after Iraqi natives Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadiwere arrested on charges of attempting to send weapons and money to Iraq to support al-Qaeda there. They also admitted using homemade bombs against US troops when they lived in Iraq. The pair lived in Bowling Green, Kentucky - but were never accused of planning or attempting to carry out an attack in the US. Both are still in prison. ""Bowling Green Massacre"" began to trend on Twitter following the interview, as users ridiculed Ms Conway's error in tributes to the fictional people who lost their lives in a massacre which did not happen. She also recently made headlines for coining the term ""alternative facts"" when defending President Trump's White House. In his first briefing, incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer gave attendance figures on Mr Trump's inauguration which contradicted photographic evidence - and were quickly denounced in many US news outlets as ""falsehoods"" and ""lies"". Ms Conway later said Mr Spicer had been presenting ""alternative facts"". The phrasequickly became the subject of ridicule online. Why the row about inauguration 'lies'?

"It has been three long years in the making, but today it seems as if we have a resolution to the closure of Tube ticket offices. On 21 November 2013, the then mayor Boris Johnson stood with the then head of London Underground (LU) Mike Brown and announced all ticket offices would be shut on the Tube network. Both have moved on to greater things but the hangover of that announcement has lasted until today. It was one of the most radical changes in Tube history and 953 jobs were earmarked for closure. The bosses tried to sweeten the pill on that day by announcing theNight Tube, but it was the job losses the unions really hated. From that day, there have been countless strikes, pickets, demonstrations, offers and counter offers over the issue of job cuts and safety. But under the Tory mayor, Boris Johnson, the unions had given up striking as they were making very little headway. The ticket offices shut in 2015 and the unions managed to get the number of lost staff down to 838. So what changed? Politics. In the mayoral election last year, the unions reinvigorated their campaign against the cuts and whenLabour's Sadiq Khan took powerhe promised a review of the ticket office closures - carried out byLondon TravelWatch,external. Countless strikes, pickets and demonstrations have been held in the last three years It found staff were not visible enough (but didn't comment on specific numbers) and it did not say ticket offices should be re-opened. However, crucially for the first time LU admitted they were short of staff. That was the turning point and then it became a question of numbers. The RMT  and TSSA unions walked out on 9 January much to the annoyance of the new mayor whose promise of ""zero strikes"" evaporated. LU offered 200 new posts then. This week that number rose - according to LU - to 325 with at least 200 of them being full-time. On top of that 325 will be taken on as part of annual recruitment to match those leaving their jobs on the Tube.  (The unions say 300 or so jobs are lost a year through retirement etc and there are already 70 unfilled posts.) So, who can claim this as a victory? Certainly the unions are delighted. They have got more staff but it is some way short of the 838 laid off. LU said getting rid of 838 staff would save Â£50m a year. That saving will be reduced and now there is inevitably the question of affordability. Transport for London (TfL) is having to make big changes and big savings and there are job losses being made elsewhere.

"This video can not be played Last month, UK suppliers told the BBC produce from the continent was being ""treated like gold"" Anyone trying to stock their kitchen full of vegetables may have noticed a shortage of their favourite greens or salad items. It started last month with some supermarkets having problems stocking courgettes and spinach, while iceberg lettuce is now being rationed by some chains. Retailers have blamed empty shelves on bad weather in Spain and Italy. A combination of flooding, cold weather and poor light levels in southern Europe is said to have created the""perfect storm"" of poor growing conditions. During the winter months, Spain's south-eastern Murcia region supplies 80% of Europe's fresh produce. But after suffering its heaviest rainfall in 30 years, only 30% of Murcia's growing fields are useable. Snow covers crops in a field in the countryside in Murcia This has coincided with a cold snap in Italy, which normally exports vegetables at this time of the year but is now having to import them. The effects of shortages are particularly pronounced in Britain, which imports an estimated 50% of its vegetables and 90% of its fruit. The Grocer magazine's fresh and chilled foods editor, Kevin White, told the BBC he could not recall the weather affecting supplies so severely. Courgettes and spinach supplies have been severely affected by the cold weather. Jordi Vorderman, UK sales manager at Dutch vegetable supplier Valstar Holland, said courgette prices were the worst affected, but that ""the cost of everything imported from Spain and Italy is sky-high at the moment"". Philippe Binard, of Freshfel Europe which represents the fresh produce industry, said the problems afflicting vegetable production were unprecedented and had left the yield of courgettes, aubergines, tomatoes, broccoli and peppers from Spain down by about 25%. Iceberg lettuces and cabbages have also been affected, with experts unsure where the shortages could fall next. Fruit and vegetable wholesaler Nick Padley told BBC News that more than 90% of Europe's iceberg lettuce came from one small region in south-east Spain. He said: ""There's a gap of about six weeks on iceberg lettuce, nothing is coming from Spain for six to eight weeks. Our supplier is now going to be bringing in iceberg from America which is obviously costing more. It's a tough time."" BBC News spoke to traders at New Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market, who said they were struggling to meet demand and were planning to import produce from the US. Michael Goodwin said: ""I've been in this trade for 40-odd years and I've never known it so bad, where everything is so dear. I've got plenty of English parsnips, potatoes and carrots but foreign produce is like gold."" At New Covent Garden market, vegetable seller Mark Gregory said: ""Whereas normally courgettes are Â£6 or Â£7 [a crate], they're now 20-22 quid and we're struggling to get them. ""We usually have a couple of pallets full of them, this morning we've got just 80 boxes."" He is awaiting delivery of a lorry load of courgettes which should have arrived on Wednesday but will not be in the UK until Friday. Mr Vorderman said some supermarkets were not prepared to buy courgettes at such high prices and would rather leave their shelves empty. Tessa Knowles, who goes to Italy each week buying fruit and vegetables for a wholesaler, said: ""Prices have rocketed. The cold weather has devastated their crops out there. It's also affected the upcoming fruit on trees so we may still feel the longer-term effects."" Another trader, Tom Craig, said: ""Because there's so little produce coming over, the prices have escalated out of control. ""It normally is a little bit more expensive in January because of the bad weather but this year is exceptionally bad. Aubergines are Â£20 [a crate], peppers are two or three pounds dearer than they are normally at this time of year so it's very hard."" This man's quest for courgettes ended in failure Supermarkets can chase the sun to get seasonal produce all year round, but the rest of Europe will also be looking for new sources for their produce - all of which could push up prices even further. Wholesalers have told the BBC they know of customers who have cleared supermarket shelves to try to supply restaurants and caterers. Though customers have noticed some empty shelves, not all the supermarkets are reporting shortages. Co-op said it was not experiencing any shortages, and Sainsbury's said it was working to maintain its courgette supply for customers. Similarly, Lidl said: ""We are working closely with our suppliers to maintain the supply of products affected by the weather conditions in Europe."" On a shortage of iceberg lettuce, Tesco said it was ""working with our suppliers to resolve them as quickly as possible"".

"A top aide to US President Donald Trump, Kellyanne Conway, has cited a ""massacre"" which never happened while defending the president's controversial immigration ban. Ms Conway said Mr Obama brought in a six-month ban on Iraqis after the arrest of ""the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre"". ""Most people don't know that because it didn't get covered,"" she added. In fact, there was no massacre at Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ms Conway, whose official role is counsellor to the president,later tweeted that she meant to say,external""Bowling Green terrorists"". She made her remarks during an interview with MSNBC television, in which she defended Donald Trump's ban on immigrants from seven Muslim-majority countries. ""President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee programme after two Iraqis came here to this country were radicalised, and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre,"" she said. Journalists versus Trump: A battle for the truth Are Pakistanis next for entry ban? Inside Trump's whirlwind Week 2 In 2011, Barack Obama's administration brought in enhanced security measures for Iraqis after two men were arrested on terror charges - but there was never a formal ban in place. It came after Iraqi natives Waad Ramadan Alwan and Mohanad Shareef Hammadiwere arrested on charges of attempting to send weapons and money to Iraq to support al-Qaeda there. They also admitted using homemade bombs against US troops when they lived in Iraq. The pair lived in Bowling Green, Kentucky - but were never accused of planning or attempting to carry out an attack in the US. Both are still in prison. ""Bowling Green Massacre"" began to trend on Twitter following the interview, as users ridiculed Ms Conway's error in tributes to the fictional people who lost their lives in a massacre which did not happen. She also recently made headlines for coining the term ""alternative facts"" when defending President Trump's White House. In his first briefing, incoming White House press secretary Sean Spicer gave attendance figures on Mr Trump's inauguration which contradicted photographic evidence - and were quickly denounced in many US news outlets as ""falsehoods"" and ""lies"". Ms Conway later said Mr Spicer had been presenting ""alternative facts"". The phrasequickly became the subject of ridicule online. Why the row about inauguration 'lies'?

"Kale is used as an alternative to iceberg lettuce in Riverford's Caesar salad Some supermarkets are rationing iceberg lettuces, with experts warning it could be the, er, tip of the iceberg. Bad weather in Europe has already caused a#courgette crisis, alongside a shortage of broccoli, tomatoes, salad peppers and aubergines. Withvegetable shortagesexpected to continue until April, what alternatives are there for shoppers? During the UK's winter months of December, January and February, UK farmers produce beetroot, Brussel sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celeriac, chicory, fennel, Jerusalem artichokes, kale, leeks, parsnips, potatoes, red cabbage, swede and turnips. We've become a ""slightly strange group"", expecting all-year-round produce, according to Lord Haskins, the former chairman of Northern Foods, which supplies Tesco. Riverford founder Guy Watson with the January King cabbage ""Thirty years ago you'd never have worried about buying lettuce in the middle of the winter - lettuces were things that grew in the summer and you ate them in the summer - you ate cauliflowers and Brussels sprouts in the winter,"" he says. Why is there a vegetable shortage? As for courgettes, they are actually ""very, very out of season"", says organic vegetable retailer Riverford.  We have just got used to supermarkets supplying them all year round. Eating British produce that's in season is often cheaper, as it is produced locally - and it can be healthier too. According to food industry campaign group Love British Food, fruit and vegetables that are in season contain the nutrients, minerals and trace elements that our bodies need at particular times of year. Apples, for example, are packed with vitamin C to boost our resistance to winter colds. Beetroot is ""terrific in soups"" says Alexia Robinson from Love British Food The group's Alexia Robinson recommends beetroot, kale, cabbages, broccoli and traditional root vegetables for their health-giving properties. Riverford says a slaw made with cabbage, beetroot or swede will offer ""10 times more nutrients"" than an iceberg lettuce - which it says aren't known for their nutritional value. If you are really keen on iceberg lettuces, you can probably pay a bit more for one from Peru or South Africa, says Lord Haskins. But imported vegetables can clock up a lot of air miles before they land on your plate - making them worse for the environment. Hatty Richards, from the Community Farm in Chew Magna, Somerset, says buying local is better. ""We have such a range on our doorsteps already, it's fresher, it's really good for the environment - it reduces air miles - and it supports local business which is crucial."" Lord Haskins agrees, and suggests your tastebuds may also be grateful: ""We all buy stuff from far parts. They don't taste nearly as good: strawberries at this time of year from Egypt don't taste anything like as good as a British strawberry in May, June, July."" Kale is a hardy winter leaf that can withstand frosty weather A leafy salad is nice - but there are plenty of alternative dishes to try. Riverford's Guy Watson thinks the UK's more bitter winter salad leaves and root vegetables can provide ""a far superior substitute"" which will easily make up for a lack of lettuce. Vibrant winter coleslaws and cauliflower salads ""bring British veg to life"", he says, adding that one of the Riverford Field Kitchen's most popular winter dishes is a kale caesar salad. Kale, which was originally used to feed cows, is a robust, hardy winder leaf that can withstand frosty weather. It can also be used in soups, stews, stir fries, gratins or just wilted with butter. Ms Robinson suggests embracing winter comfort food with a ""good old fashioned winter stew with plenty of root vegetables with tender meat"". If you're still not convinced you can do without leafy salads, try growing your own. Those who do want to eat lettuce need not despair. According to the campaign group Eat Seasonably, lettuce, rocket and other crunchy salad leaves are some of the easiest things to grow at home, all year around - on a seed tray indoors, on your window sill or in the garden. Spinach is easily grown, even in window boxes, says Ms Robinson Ms Robinson says: ""As well as the cress there are many great veg that can be easily grown in window boxes such as leaf lettuce, radishes, spinach, green onions and of course a good selection of herbs."" Another easy win is beetroot, Eat Seasonably says, which can be grown in a big pot. Though beetroot is harvested in October, Riverford says it can last up to four months if it's kept in a cold storage. ""Carrots are not too hard to grow either,"" Riverford's Emily Muddeman said, ""Leeks, kale - you could plant just four or five stalks of kale and it will go on sprouting."" Any budding gardeners could start with planting onions later this month - Eat Seasonably says they are ""not even slightly difficult to grow"".

"For more than 200 years the town of Ebbw Vale, situated in an isolated valley in south Wales, owed its existence to the heavy industries of coal and iron that emerged there in the late 18th Century.  But by the late 1990s a collapse of the international steel market led to eventual closure in 2002. Photographer Joseph Murphy was on hand to document the last men to work at the plant, and, to mark the 15th anniversary of its closure, has spent the past year asking them to recall their time at the steelworks. The resulting pictures can be seen at theNational Waterfront Museum in Swansea,externaluntil early April. I suppose that it took a long time for it to sink in that it was actually going to close. I loved every minute of every day at that plant. I never imagined that the steelworks would ever close. My thoughts were: What were the people who worked there going to do? What were my mates going to do? What was I going to do? The last shift I worked was the 06:00-14:00 shift on the day of closure itself. I walked the complete area of the pickle line from the hot mill warehouse to the exit warehouse - just taking in as many memories as possible on the way. I was gutted and hurt, but I knew deep down that we all had to pick ourselves up and move on. I worked across all the shifts and encountered some unbelievable characters. There was Arthur Jones, who would eat an onion like an apple, and his operator, Alan Holvey, who was completely deaf and dumb but who managed to get his message over sort of telepathically. You had [another of my co-workers], who was so mean that it was said that he knocked the gas off to turn the bacon over and that he still had every free-issue donkey jacket and towel he had ever been given over his 30 years of service stuffed into his locker. devastation sad end of an era wanted to die relieved (knew it was coming) cheated resigned to the fact helpless keen to move on wanted to prove people wrong about the closure cheated again and again I felt angry. I felt frustrated because we were told that we were the best performing works with the highest quality. I believe that a mixture of politics and location led to the downfall of Ebbw Vale. Mike Gardner:My strongest memory of the plant is comradeship. The experience of working in that environment will be with me forever. You met people from different areas and different ways of life. Some were strong characters, some were comedians, some were more serious, but when you put them all together you had a brilliant place to work. To give an example, when I worked in the coal and coking plant you relied on your workmates to wash your backs in the showers - just as it was in the coal industry. One of the proudest moments of Ebbw Vale has to be the last coil that was run through number three ETL. It was a prime coil. They should have made a film of the workers in the rundown to closure, to show people how a proud workforce acts in adversity. It would have been so easy for them to say: ""Why bother?"" but they stayed proud of their work, and carried on regardless. Lyndon T Crosby:I was extremely apprehensive during the time of closure, but remember feeling fortunate. Fortunate at having left school and starting work within a week, and lucky enough to be employed for 35 years, and leaving with a considerable lump sum and a small pension. I was also fortunate enough to gain further employment, albeit with a great sadness, in the demolition of the works. That time was tough emotionally. Steve Watkins:The time of closure was upsetting. There had been rumours flying around, so it wasn't a complete surprise. But I remember after the meeting at which it was announced, that I finished work early feeling sick and went home with a tear in my eye. The enormous size of the plant was locked into my memory when in my first year of employment I had to walk to work through the snow. Walking through the various mills and departments along the vast length of the works was the easiest and quickest option. The sounds and sights I experienced on that trek left a lasting impression on someone who had only just left school. The constant noise from the tinplate lines, the smell of the acid being used to clean the steel coils in the pickler, the sight of a large hot steel ingot as bright as the Sun, being reduced to a thin steel slab, together with the bright light emanating from the converter shop, lingers in the mind. I was actually in the works when I was told of the closure. We were told to down tools and called in to be spoken to by senior management, who broke the news. We were all numb really. The last day was very muted, with little conversation. I felt terrible. Some people were taking photos at the gates, but most people clocked in, stayed for a couple of hours and then left quietly, alone with their thoughts. At the time of closure I was 60 and would have liked to have had five more years to take me to retirement. But I was devastated seeing young men with families losing their jobs. My strongest memories are of my workmates. We all had a good relationship with each other, so to recall the atmosphere at the time is emotional. I remember I was working a nightshift on the eve of the announcement. We were all talking amongst ourselves about the outcome. I remember saying to the boys that I thought they would put us on Monday-Friday working, rather than shut us down. At the end of the shift, I went home to bed. I got up at 13:00, and my partner was watching the Welsh news, and she said:""They are shutting the plant, with 18 months grace."" I was absolutely devastated. My strongest memories are all my friends and work colleagues who I worked with during my 29 years service at the plant. It's difficult for many on the outside to understand the camaraderie that the steelworks had. Only the coal industry could equal it. We socialised together, our children and grandchildren played and went to school together. Ever since the early 1800s, the works were part of the community, which our children have now lost.

"Music, poetry and wine-drinking at the court of 17th Century Persian ruler Shah Abbas Until the Islamic revolution, Iran had a tradition of wine-making which stretched back centuries. It centred on the ancient city of Shiraz - but is there a connection between the place and the wine of the same name now produced and drunk across the world? ""I remember my father bringing in the grapes and putting them in a big clay vat,"" says California-based wine-maker Darioush Khaledi, recalling his childhood in pre-revolutionary Iran. ""I would climb on top and smell and enjoy the wine."" Darioush's family was from Shiraz, a fabled city in south-western Iran, whose name was once synonymous with viticulture and the poetry and culture of wine. He remembers happy evenings when the family would gather, sipping wine from clay cups, and reciting lines from the 14th Century Persian poet Hafez. ""It wasn't just about drinking wine,"" he says. ""It was an adventure."" The world Darioush remembers came to an end in 1979 when Iran's new Islamic rulers banned alcohol. They shut down wineries, ripped up commercial vineyards and consigned to history a culture stretching back thousands of years. Does this ancient jar hold the key to the provenance of Shiraz? An ancient clay jar has pride of place at the University of Pennsylvania museum in Philadelphia in the US. It was one of six discovered by a team of American archaeologists at a site in the Zagros mountains in northern Iran in 1968. The jars date back to the Neolithic period more than 7,000 years ago, and provide the first scientific proof of the ancient nature of Iranian wine production. Chemical analysis on one of them revealed that a dark stain at the bottom was actually wine residue. ""This is the oldest chemically-identified wine jar in the world,"" says Prof Patrick McGovern. The first evidence of grape cultivation in Shiraz came around 2,500 BC, when vines were brought down from the mountains to the plains of south-west Iran, the professor says. By the 14th Century, Shiraz wine was immortalised in the poetry of Hafez, whose tomb in the city is still venerated today. ""Last night, the wise tavern master deciphered the enigma,"" he wrote. ""Gazing at the lines traced in the cup of wine, he unravelled our awaiting fate."" The wine-pourer or ""saghi"" had a special role in the ritual of Persian royal banquets In the 1680s, a French diamond merchant, Jean Chardin, travelled to Persia to the court of Shah Abbas. He attended elaborate banquets and recorded the first European account of what Shiraz wine actually tasted like. ""It was a very specific red,"" says French historian and Chardin expert Francis Richards. ""It was a wine with good conservation because generally the local wines very quickly turned to vinegar."" But is there a connection between the ""dark red wine that smells like musk"" immortalised by Hafez, and the Shiraz wine drunk across the world today? Napa Valley vintner Darioush Khaledi emphasises Shiraz's ""Persian heritage"" The first stop in my research is one of France's most famous vineyards in the Rhone valley in the south and home to the Syrah vine. According to local legend, the Hermitage vineyard was founded by a 13th Century knight called Gaspard de Sterimberg, who brought back a Persian vine from the Crusades. Syrah grapes at the world famous Hermitage vineyard in southern France The names Syrah and Shiraz are often used interchangeably. Could Syrah be a corruption of Shiraz and prove a Persian connection? The definitive answer came in 1998 when DNA testing was carried out on the local vines to pinpoint their origin. ""Some people think it comes from Persians and others from Sicily where you have Syracuse city,"" says grape geneticist Jose Vouillamoz. ""But today we know all of that is wrong. ""Testing was done by two different labs,"" he continues. ""And it was really a surprise to find out that Syrah is a natural spontaneous crossing between two local vines from this area."" So wherever the name came from, it seems there is no genetic connection between Syrah grapes and the wines of ancient Shiraz. But the trail does not end there. James Busby, seen as the father of the Australian wine industry Outside of France, the biggest producer of Syrah in the world is Australia and the wine is always called Shiraz. This can be traced back to a Scot called James Busby who exported Syrah vines from the Hermitage to Australia in the 19th Century. His first consignment of vines was labelled ""scyras"" which many thought was a misspelling of Syrah. But when I re-read his journal, I came across a line which proved he knew about the Hermitage Persian vine legend. ""According to the tradition of the neighbourhood,"" he wrote. ""The plant - scyras - was originally brought from Shiraz in Persia."" At that time European wine-makers sometimes imported wine from Persia to add sweetness and body. So perhaps Busby hoped the ancient name Shiraz would add some Persian mystique and flavour to his New World wine-making endeavour. The United States imported Syrah vines in the 1970s and the wine is always marketed under the Syrah name - with one notable exception. Darioush Khaledi, a son of Shiraz, is the proud owner of a 120-acre vineyard in California's Napa Valley producing what he insists on calling Shiraz wine. ""My French friends say Shiraz/Syrah comes from the Rhone and [has] a 500-year-old history,"" he says. ""But if you open an atlas of the world there's only one place in the whole world called Shiraz and it has a 7,000-year-old history of wine growing."" Persian-style columns at the entrance to the Darioush winery in Napa Valley He highlights his Iranian heritage in the vineyard. The entrance to the main building is lined with Persian-style columns reminiscent of the ancient city of Persepolis. The day we visit, his marketing manager Dan de Polo is holding a wine tasting for a group of Chinese buyers. ""What's great about Shiraz is that it's always been a very soulful wine,"" he tells them. Soulfulness, spirit and poetry - words that come up time and again when talking about Shiraz wine. And for Darioush, and for me, I think that is what matters most. It is not about the DNA of the grapes, it is about the link Shiraz offers us to the spirit of our faraway homeland and the romance of its fabled wine.

"A US-based human rights campaigner has apologised for mistakenly accusing BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis of running an alleged CIA torture site. Kenneth Roth, director of Human Rights Watch, tweeted a picture of her, saying President Trump ""chose [a] woman who ran CIA black site for torture"". Mr Roth had meant to tweet a picture of Gina Haspel, named as CIA deputy director by Mr Trump on Thursday. Maitlis replied: ""Erm. This is me."" Mr Roth then deleted the tweet. Mr Trump's appointment of Ms Haspel was met with claims from human rights groups that she played a role in secret ""black site"" prisons run by CIA officers and contractors. Ms Haspel, who joined the CIA in 1985, ran a prison in Thailand where terror suspects were waterboarded. So-calledblack sites were secret overseas locations where the CIAcarried out interrogation techniques. They were closed by the former US President Barack Obama. Newsnight's Emily Maitlis said she was ""pretty sure"" she had never run a CIA black site for torture Christopher Anders, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Washington office, told theNew York Times,externalhe was ""gravely concerned"" about Ms Haspel's appointment. Announcing the decision, CIA director Mike Pompeo said Ms Haspel was ""an exemplary intelligence officer"" with an ""uncanny ability to get things done and to inspire those around her"". But the BBC's Maitlis said she was ""pretty sure"" she herself had never run a CIA black site for torture. A spokesman for Human Rights Watch, Andrew Stroehlein, said he had ""no idea"" how the mix-up had occurred. He added: ""BBC interviews can be tough but not to that level. Seriously: Very sorry. Ken will pick this up in US time."" Mr Roth tweeted that he was ""sorry"" for posting the wrong picture. But this was not enough for some critics, with one tweeting: ""Are you going to apologise to her?"" and another posting: ""'Sorry'? That's all you got? Try little harder Ken!""

"Davis Cup matches are known for their wild atmosphere and passionate fans Davis Cup: Canada v Great Britain Venue:TD Place Arena, OttawaDates:3-5 Feb Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, Red Button, Connected TV and online, plus follow text updates on the BBC Sport website. Theabsence of Andy Murrayand Milos Raonic may not prevent a dramatic weekend from unfolding in snowy Ottawa, but after the thrills of the Australian Open, the Davis Cup is struggling to make its voice heard as it returns for another year. Great Britain start clear favourites to reach the quarter-finals for the fourth year in a row. While Dan Evans and Kyle Edmund are both ranked in the world's top 50, Canada are unable to field any singles players in the top 100. And they are not alone. There remains a lot of affection for the 117-year-old competition around the world. Last year's Davis Cup was staged in 58 countries and featured 618 players from 124 different nations. On a good weekend, the atmosphere is unrivalled in tennis - just ask those lucky enough to be in Glasgow, Birmingham or at the Queen's Club for recent British ties, or in Zagreb in November where Argentina won the cup for the first time over the course of three memorable days. And yet this week, Serbia's Novak Djokovic is the only member of the world's top 10 in action. There is once again no Roger Federer or Stan Wawrinka for Switzerland; Rafael Nadal was a late withdrawal from the Spain team; Japan's Kei Nishikori is preferring to play ATP Tour events in Buenos Aires and Rio later in the month; and last year's runners-up, Croatia, will have to do without Marin Cilic. Their number one player for the week is Franko Skugor - their fifth-best player, according to the rankings, and outside the world's top 200. That is not part of the plan. It is unsustainable. World number two Novak Djokovic is the only player in the top 10 to be playing in any of this weekend's Davis Cup matches across the world A package of reforms is under discussion, and will be put to the International Tennis Federation's (ITF) member nations during August's AGM in Vietnam. The problem is a lukewarm initial response from players, and an increasing lack of support from the main tours. The ATP and the WTA see the Davis Cup and the women's Fed Cup as competitors, not partners. Reducing five-set matches to three is on the agenda, and likely to prove popular. However. that in itself is unlikely to encourage the top players to commit to playing up to four weeks of Davis Cup each year, given the first round currently follows the Australian Open and the semi-finals are the week after the US Open. The ATP's interest is in maximising the strength of its tour: senior figures indicate privately the likelihood of a more confrontational approach in future. If the ITF were to attempt to schedule the Davis Cup in different weeks, they could expect to find ATP events - with ranking points and the potential for far greater financial rewards - running alongside them. This video can not be played Judy Murray tells Radio 4's Today that David Cup schedule needs an overhaul The formation of a 16-team Fed Cup World Group has also been proposed by the ITF. This would include a 'final four' event to avoid an extra week being added to the schedule, but there seems little desire within the ITF to budge from four weeks of Davis Cup tennis per year. These weeks can be hugely valuable in raising revenue and increasing exposure in countries where tennis does not have a huge following. Pakistan, for example, have the chance to host Iran in Islamabad this week, while in Tunis, Tunisia take on Sweden. Undesirable though it is for the ITF, the number of weeks of World Group tennis will need to be reduced if the Davis Cup is going to thrive. But even that is not as easy as it sounds. An annual World Cup style tournament - or the biennial staging of the event - would significantly reduce exposure to the competition. And the establishment of a 'final four' event may not be well received by players, given their initial hostility to the ITF's proposal for fixed host cities for the final. Andy Murray, who was elected to the ATP Player Council last year, addressed that idea during the Australian Open. ""I sat in a room with all of the guys on the player council, and nobody was for the neutral venue,"" the British world number one explained, wary of a potential lack of atmosphere in non-partisan cities. (The ITF, keen to promote the final much earlier than it currently can, points to away support in excess of 5,000 fans at each of the last three Davis Cup finals). ""There were many things discussed that could change the Davis Cup, we thought for the better,"" Murray, who inspired Great Britain to victory in the tournament in 2015, added. ""None of that's been done yet. ""I do think it needs to change. If the top players aren't playing, the event loses value."" And so to this weekend. Kyle Edmund and Denis Shapovalov may yet be called upon to settle matters in a fifth and final rubber - and I am sure those in attendance will have a hugely enjoyable three days. It is just unlikely to be a major talking point in either Canada or Britain during the Monday morning commute.

"Sean Crawshaw was cautioned by police while still dangling from the window Police could scarcely believe their luck when they found a bungling burglar dangling out of a bathroom window. Sean Crawshaw, 47, got stranded after trying to break in to the house in Radcliffe, Bury, Greater Manchester. The homeowner, in her 60s, found him wedged on the windowsill about 15ft (4.5m) off the ground after returning from a trip to the shops. The long arm of the law plucked Crawshaw to safety and he has now been jailed for the botched burglary. The burglar hurt his ear after getting wedged in the window Crawshaw, of James Street, Radcliffe was sentenced to two years and five months at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court last month. He had pleaded guilty to burglary with intent to steal after being caught in the bathroom window in Bank Street  in December. Sgt Richard Garland of Greater Manchester Police told the BBC: ""It was nice of him to hang around. ""He was actually cautioned as he was in mid-air. ""We did all have a chuckle about it later but the homeowner was actually pretty shaken up about it all. ""It's not nice having someone burgle your home and then finding them still there."" A police officer snapped Crawshaw on his head camera It took fire crews 20 minutes to rescue Crawshaw, who hurt his ear in the raid.

"Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard played a combined 1,113 Premier League games Frank Lampard or Steven Gerrard? Ask a blue and they will tell you Lampard is a Chelsea legend, ask a red and they will say Gerrard lives on forever in Liverpool folklore. They were arguably two of their generation's best midfielders, the trajectories of their careers and similar playing styles meaning they were forever compared. After both brought an end to trophy-laden careers, BBC Sport looked to tackle the debate on who was better one last time - and gave you the chance to cast your vote. 52% of voters thought that Steven Gerrard was better. Lampard played 649 league games in spells with Swansea (for whom he made his professional debut), West Ham, Chelsea, Manchester City and New York City, while Gerrard's career spanned Liverpool and LA Galaxy. Though he went on to be a Chelsea legend, Lampard's Premier League life began at West Ham, making his debut as a replacement for John Moncur in a 3-2 win over Coventry in January 1996. Gerrard arrived in the top flight two years later in Liverpool colours, which he would sport for his entire career in English football. There are 211 reasons to place Lampard in the Stamford Bridge hall of fame, the midfielder's goals making him Chelsea's all-time top scorer, while Gerrard's contribution to the Liverpool cause was often evident via heart-on-his-sleeve performances. Neither were shy of goals or games - Lampard would go on to make 609 Premier League appearances to Gerrard's 504, scoring 177 goals to the Liverpudlian's 120. In his most prolific season, 2009-10, Lampard scored 22 goals in 36 games as he claimed the third of three Premier League winner's medals with Chelsea. He had previously won the title in 2004-05 and 2005-06. The closest Gerrard's Liverpool came to a league title was the season of his infamous 'slip' against Chelsea in 2013-14. That season, he weighed in with 13 goals and 13 assists from midfield. Gerrard missed out on a Premier League crown, but the hometown hero guided his club to Champions League success in 2005, as well as two FA Cups, three League Cups, a Uefa Cup and a Uefa Super Cup. But it is Lampard who boasts the most silverware. In 2005, Lampard finished second to Barcelona and Brazil forward Ronaldinho in the Fifa World Player of the Year awards as well as in the Ballon d'Or, in which Gerrard came third. Gerrard won Uefa Club Player of the Year Football finance expert Rob Wilson says if you took both players in their prime and sold them in last month's transfer window, Lampard would attract a marginally higher fee. But neither would match the world-record Â£89mManchester United spentto re-sign Paul Pogba from Juventus. ""I wouldn't put them on the same level as what we have seen with Pogba, simply because of the marketability of Pogba and his association with Adidas,"" said Wilson, from Sheffield Hallam University. ""Hindsight is a perfect science. We have seen the performances they were able to generate for their respective clubs, the consistency they were able to deliver and, particularly in the case of Lampard, the goals he scored as well. ""You would be comfortably talking Â£50m-Â£60m in transfer value - Lampard would be slightly more because of the number of goals he scored from midfield. ""If we were to have seen them sold this summer or next summer, you would be talking about wage packets of Â£250,000 a week."" During their final seasons in England,both players were included in the Sunday Times Rich List,with Gerrard's wealth in 2015 calculated at Â£42m, and Lampard's at Â£39m. While Lampard only once commanded a transfer fee, Chelsea signing him for Â£11m from West Ham in 2001, Gerrard left Anfield only when his contract expired in 2015, 18 years after signing his first professional deal. Gerrard was first included in Panini's collection for the 2002 World Cup, although he would miss the tournament through injury. The Liverpool man had already made one appearance at Euro 2000, having made his England debut shortly before the tournament. Lampard got his first tournament sticker at Euro 2004 Having first played in the same England team in 2002, Lampard and Gerrard featured 73 times together before both retired in the summer of 2014. Despite the suggestionthe duo ""couldn't play together"",,externalduring that time England won 63% of their games with both in the team, and 51% without. Gerrard was the more successful of the two when playing on his own, England winning 61% of 41 games, compared with 48.5% of the 33 matches with just Lampard involved. Lampard made his debut a year before Gerrard's first England appearance, but it was the Liverpool man who established himself first, scoring his first international goal in the 5-1 win over Germany in 2001, and captaining his country at three major tournaments. Lampard never scored at a World Cup despite 40 attempts on goal, including one against Germany in 2010 that crossed the line Squeezing two of England's most glittering members of the 'golden generation' into one midfield was seen to be a problem for a string of national managers, but BBC Sport football analyst Pat Nevin believes the issue lay with the coaches rather than the players. ""The problem wasn't Gerrard or Lampard, the problem was the managers,"" said former Scotland international Nevin. ""I don't think it was that complicated what they had to do, so that was a huge disappointment. ""Playing within a system, England tended to play 4-4-2 and teams were never stretched. There were two guys who were phenomenal at going into space and finding space, but had nowhere to run."" England won 46 of the 73 games that both Lampard and Gerrard played in Gerrard's performances in a Liverpool shirt sometimes led to the perception he had single-handedly dragged his team-mates towards glory, not least in the Champions League final against AC Milan in 2005 and the Reds' FA Cup triumph over West Ham a year later. Lampard, meanwhile, was no doubt a great player, reaching double figures for goals in 10 successive Premier League seasons, but was his career helped by playing in world-class Chelsea teams? In a bid to compare who played in the better side, we took the XIs that started the clubs' respective Champions League-winning finals and calculated the reported cost of each player to see how expensive the teams were to assemble. A Liverpool XI including youth products Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher cost the club an estimated Â£40.35m in transfer fees, with the amount paid for each player shown above Gerrard was part of the Liverpool side that came from 3-0 down at half-time to beat AC Milan on penalties in the 'Miracle of Istanbul'. That team would go on to boast 635 caps between them, with Gerrard's 114 England appearances matched by Spain's Xabi Alonso, while Norway's John Arne Riise (110) and Finland's Sami Hyypia (105) also reached their centuries. With Liverpool's success seven years earlier than Chelsea's, it is inevitable their starting XI would be cheaper than the Blues'. But at face value the Anfield outfit built their European victory for Â£100m less, with the side that started in Turkey costing a combined Â£40.35m. The side that started Chelsea's Champions League final against Bayern Munich cost Â£140.1m Chelsea's Champions League triumph also came via a penalty shootout, the Blues beating Bayern Munich on German soil. Lampard was among the scorers from the spot after Didier Drogba's late goal levelled the game in 90 minutes. Lampard (106) was one of four Chelsea players to win more than 100 caps for his country, with Petr Cech (Czech Republic, 124), Ashley Cole (England, 107) and Drogba (Ivory Coast, 104) contributing to a total 784 caps for the Blues. The cost of that side? Â£140.1m - and that's not including Fernando Torres (Â£50m) and Michael Essien (Â£24.4m), who were on the bench in Munich. Phil Neville, who played alongside the pair for England and against them for Manchester United and Everton, told BBC Sport they were ""always driving each other on to be better"". ""If Frank scored a goal, Stevie had to score a goal,"" he added. ""It's what great players do and you see it with how Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi compete with each other. You are inspired by the biggest challenges. ""It was a strength and a weakness of why they couldn't play together, in a way. ""I think Stevie, in his club career, maybe felt a little bit on his own at times. Maybe he looked at Frank as part of a great team, winning league titles and other cups - whereas he made Liverpool a good team by his own performances."" Oyo Sports immortalised Gerrard and Lampard as figurines when they arrived in the MLS As players of such similar style and stature in the game, leaving the Premier League for the MLS only furthered the Lampard-Gerrard debate. Gerrard joined LA Galaxy for the 2015-16 season, while Lampard chose New York City. Over the course of two campaigns in the MLS, Gerrard made 36 appearances to Lampard's 31. However, it was the former West Ham, Chelsea and Manchester City man who turned a stuttering Stateside start around to eventually make the bigger impact for his club, scoring 15 times including his 300th career goal. Gerrard's La Galaxy career ended in a penalty shootout defeat by Colorado Rapids in the play-offs Lampard on Gerrard:""There were many a night I can recall Stevie driving from midfield at Anfield and I tried to reverse that at Chelsea and be our driving force. ""There's a huge respect we both have for each other. We get on very well, particularly in our latter years. It's nice to come up against Stevie."" Gerrard on Lampard:""When that whistle goes and for 90 minutes when we are competing against each other it is war. We fight against each other, we always have. And when it's over there is a mutual respect there. ""I'm a huge fan of Frank. He's a phenomenal goalscorer from midfield. I play in the same position myself so I understand how difficult that is."" Following some fantastic battles on the field, will Gerrard and Lampard renew their rivalry in the technical area? Gerrard is set to begin his coaching career at Anfield, where the Liverpool legend will work with the club's youth teams. He was linked with the manager's job at League One side MK Dons last year but said the opportunity had come ""too soon"" for him. Lampard, meanwhile, has said he will study for his coaching qualifications with the Football Association - meaning they could yet line up in opposing dugouts. Coach or pundit?

"This video can not be played ""I remember... looking at Roger Dodds with his big bunch of keys, locking the door, and that was horrifying"", one victim said Predatory sex offender Roger Dodds was left free to abuse his victims by Sheffield City Council despite bosses having known about his offending for years, BBC News has found. Dodds, who was jailed earlier for 16 years after pleading guilty to four counts of indecent assault, was allowed to operate as an employee of the council ""without sufficient challenge, accountability or consequences"", a council-commissioned report found. Council officials not only knew about his behaviour, but also failed to report his activities to police and gave him early retirement with an enhanced pension. Kenny Dale, who was abused by Dodds in the early 1990s and has waived his right to anonymity, said: ""I was the victim of a horrible man and the council are to blame for that."" Sheffield City Council said it ""accepted responsibility"" and was ""deeply sorry"" Dodds had been allowed to commit these offences while in its employment. Dodds abused at least one man while heading up the council's Grants and Awards Department Dodds, now 81, was employed in 1975 to head the council's Grants and Awards Department. The unit was responsible for providing financial support to students attending college or university. However, Dodds used his position to sexually abuse young men, typically in their late teens. One victim, who did not want to be named, said he was assaulted during their very first meeting. He told the BBC: ""Dodds was asking me things about my studies, and, very gradually, his left hand started to feel its way into my right jeans pocket. When that started to happen, I just became frozen and unable to move."" According to former colleagues, Dodds was part of a club that operated within the council swapping hardcore pornographic magazines in internal envelopes and screening adult films in a basement room. He was first investigated by Sheffield City Council in the early 1980s after a series of allegations were made against him. The complaints gave one employee the courage to tell managers about the abuse he had been subjected to. Richard Rowe said he grew to fear turning up for work as a result of his abuse at the hands of Dodds Richard Rowe, who has also waived his legal right to anonymity, said he was subjected to ""terrifying"" assaults over an 18-month period. However, he said when he told bosses what was happening, he was told to stay quiet. ""They asked for specifics and I gave them as much details as I could bring myself to voice. But they knew, they knew exactly,"" he said. ""At the end of the interview it was, 'there is nothing more to tell us, so go back to the office and you do not speak about this inside or outside the building'.  I clearly remember that warning."" Following the investigation, Dodds was moved to a position working with schools. An investigation carried out for Sheffield City Council, and seen by the BBC, said he was given ""substantial unregulated and unsupervised access to schools"". The report continues that ""there appears to have been no disciplinary consequences to his behaviour at the time"". Nor was his transfer a chastening experience for Dodds. Kenny Dale said he blamed the council for failing to stop Dodds Mr Dale began working at the council in the early 1990s and, despite warnings from colleagues, applied for a post working alongside Dodds. ""Everyone told me not to go for it,"" he said, ""[but] I didn't think that kind of behaviour would be allowed"". He said Dodds began touching him inappropriately almost immediately and continued to do so despite his objections and the lack of challenge from managers. Another investigation by the local authority was launched and in 1993 Roger Dodds left the council. However, despite Mr Dale's insistence Dodds should not be given a payoff, he was given an early retirement package that included an enhanced pension. Mr Dale said he blames the council for the abuse he suffered. ""The council are so responsible, more responsible than he was,"" he said. Roger Dodds was the subject of two internal investigations while working for Sheffield City Council Following the second internal investigation officials concluded a criminal investigation should have been launched. In 2008, one of Dodds' victims went to South Yorkshire Police with his allegations. However, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided not to prosecute at the time - a CPS spokesman said its files did not contain details on why that decision was taken. Dodds was eventually charged in 2016 after another complainant came forward in 2014. The police investigation prompted the council to commission consultants to investigate how it had handled Dodds. The 2008 review concluded: ""It was clearly wrong that Dodds should receive early retirement. He was not subject to any official sanction by the council for his alleged behaviour."" The 28-page dossier also revealed repeated failures by the council, describing the authority's action as clearly unacceptable not just by present-day standards but by the policies and legislation in place at the time. It conceded the council did not know how many other victims there might be.

"Since Beyonce announced she and husband Jay Z are expecting twins, social media has been abuzz with theories about the deeper meaning behind the record-breaking Instagram photo.

"Anne Mulhern ran The Willow Tea Rooms in Sauchiehall Street The woman who ran The Willow Tea Rooms on Sauchiehall Street for more than 30 years has won a legal battle to keep its name. Anne Mulhern had opposed an attempt by the Willow Tea Rooms Trust to trademark the name, which is associated with designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh. The UK Intellectual Property Office (UK IPO) told BBC Scotland that her challenge had been successful. The Tea Rooms Trust has 28 days to appeal against the ruling. The Sauchiehall Street building and interiors were designed by Mackintosh and built in 1903 for Kate Cranston, who ran a number of tea rooms. Ms Mulhern, 60, transformed the Tea Rooms back to their original use in 1983 after the building had been used as a retail unit. However, she did not own the building and it was acquired by the Willow Tea Rooms Trust in 2014. The trust recently closed the building for a Â£10m two-year refurbishment. The interior of the Willow Tea Rooms will be recreated at the Watt Brothers department store Two waitresses in the Room de Luxe Meanwhile, Ms Mulhern, who also operates the Willow Tea Rooms on Buchanan Street, has moved her Sauchiehall Street operation to the third floor of the Watt Bros department store. The UK IPO said a 73-page ruling on the trademark dispute would be published next week. It said Ms Mulhearn's opposition to the Willow Tea Rooms Trust's trademark application had been successful because she had a similar existing trademark. She also had a ""reputation among a known class of people"" - meaning that tourists and locals had used her tea rooms for many years. The Willow Tea Rooms Trust has 28 days to appeal against the ruling. If it does not the trademark will be formally refused.

"Ciaran Maxwell was set upon and beaten unconscious as a teenager in Larne A Royal Marine Commando from Northern Ireland has pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism linked to dissident republicanism. Ciaran Maxwell's case raises alarming questions of how he was able to penetrate the ranks of an elite British military unit and smuggle out arms. In the early hours of a morning back in June 2002, Maxwell, then 16, was walking from his home in Larne towards the Seacourt estate, which sits on a hill overlooking the port. What happened next left the Catholic teenager ""angry and traumatised"", according to someone in the nationalist community who knew him. Maxwell was struck by a bottle, fell to the ground and was set upon and beaten unconscious by a gang of loyalists armed with golf clubs and iron bars. The unprovoked attack featured in the republican newspaper An Phoblacht, which claimed that an Army patrol arrived at the scene but did not intervene. That cannot be substantiated, though amid escalating tension in the town, soldiers were back on the streets to support the police who dealt with nearly 300 sectarian incidents between April 2001 and March 2004. Ciaran Maxwell pleaded guilty to preparing acts of terrorism A security source we spoke to recalled shootings, houses being burnt out and regular beatings. This was the environment in which Maxwell - described as a ""quiet republican"" - became an adult. Several residents in his home town said the mental scars of his beating never fully healed, leaving a vulnerability that others would later exploit. The failure of police to prosecute anyone for the assault may also have caused him bitterness. Eight years later the adventure-loving, physically fit Maxwell began the gruelling 32-week training to become a Royal Marine, writing online: ""Pain is temporary, the Green Beret is forever."" Explosive ingredients were found buried in blue barrels In May 2011 his mother expressed her pride ahead of attending his passing out parade in England. But all was not as it seemed. One of the men who completed training with Maxwell, and does not want to be identified, told the BBC: ""He was a strange character, very reserved, didn't join in with the banter."" He described him as ""shifty"" and unwilling to form close relationships with others in the unit. Before he had even completed his training, court papers show that Maxwell began ""assisting another to commit an act of terrorism"" although it is not clear which individual or group he was working with. He was not the only young man from Larne being drawn into the orbit of dissident republicanism. A friend from the Seacourt estate was jailed in 2014 after pleading guilty to possession of explosives with intent to endanger life. Niall Lehd had buried chemicals, a pipe bomb and a deactivated submachine gun in blue barrels in a field. By 2016, despite having become a father, Maxwell had begun burying his own blue barrels full of explosive ingredients during visits to see family in Larne. Some of the ammunition discovered In a country park, he stockpiled chemicals which he bought online, timer units and improvised detonators. Even more alarmingly, in a remote forest he hid a handgun, ammunition, pipe bombs and Claymore anti-personnel mines he had stolen from the British military. His behaviour was becoming increasingly reckless as he built more hides in the woods near his home in Devon where he also stashed cannabis he planned to sell in Larne. In his work locker were bank card details stolen from fellow Marines to carry out fraud and handwritten notes on tactics used by terrorist groups. But his plans unravelled when police uncovered the hides in Northern Ireland in one of the most significant arms finds of recent years. Detectives traced the serial numbers on the mines across the Irish Sea to 40 Commando, the Royal Marine unit based near Taunton where Ciaran Maxwell had been quietly building a career. They also found his DNA on some of the material found in the woods. Maxwell had endured so much to get the green beret only to trade it for terrorism. Was his a long-planned infiltration or was he dragged back by others to a past he thought he had escaped? In his hometown few are willing to talk on the record about his case. Larne is much calmer these days but the occasional street mural and flag hint at the continuing presence of loyalist paramilitary groups such as the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster Defence Association. There are concerns that dissident republicans are becoming more active in parts of Northern Ireland. Last month a police officer was shot and injured in north Belfast. Although Maxwell had links to dissident republicans, it is not known how extensive they were. A security source told the BBC that he was ""operating as a bit of a lone wolf."" Sammy Wilson, Democratic Unionist MP for East Antrim, said: ""There has always been a dissident group which has been operating around Larne engaged in firebombing, that kind of activity, and it's been known that they have been trying to move into the area and recruit."" Mr Wilson is concerned that Ciaran Maxwell was able to sneak munitions out of his base and evade detection for so long. He said: ""Where it is clear that someone is vulnerable either to coercion or may well have sympathies to aid and abet terrorist groups because of their background, perhaps we should give special attention to them when they come back to their own community."" The BBC asked the Ministry of Defence about its security vetting procedures for Royal Marines but received no response. The criminal case against Ciaran Maxwell was overwhelming, paving the way for today's guilty plea. What is much less clear is exactly why he turned to terrorism, although his actions offer a stark reminder of the dark forces that still threaten stability in Northern Ireland.

"Aman Salman's mobile barely stops ringing these days. He runs a small travel agency in Long Island, New York, catering mostly to clients of Pakistani origin. Phone calls usually mean good business. But since last Friday, when President Trump signed his Executive Order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, most of these calls have been to cancel tickets. Pakistan, a Muslim-majority country, is not on Mr Trump's list. But there is huge concern and anxiety in the community that its inclusion is imminent. ""At least 95% of my Green Card holding clients, who had booked their tickets to Pakistan months in advance, have cancelled it,"" says Mr Salman. He is also getting frantic calls from those already in Pakistan trying to get the earliest possible return dates, even if that means paying stiff charges to change tickets. Mr Trump's order stops the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and further bans entry of all citizens from seven countries including Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. A Customs and Border Protection statement clarifies that the current order doesn't apply to Green Card holders' entry to the United States, but there has been much confusion about the order, and reports of inconsistencies as to how it's being applied at airports. Aman Salman has seen many cancellations The visa ban for this list is in place for 90 days, but administration officials have hinted that it will be reconsidered and possibly expanded to include other countries. The uncertainty has prompted immigration lawyers to advise their Pakistani clients to cancel their travel plans for now and for those already in Pakistan to return immediately. Immigration attorney Rafia Zakaria says Pakistani citizens who are legal permanent residents of US or hold other US non-immigrant visas must take seriously the possibility of an imminent ban on Pakistani citizens as well. ""The text of the order says that further review is taking place, and the outcome of that is not really known to anyone,"" she told the BBC. She noted that White House spokesman Sean Spicer and White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus have both implied that the ban could be expanded. She says if the ban is expanded, the legal challenges will take a long time to be ironed out. Khizr Khan, a Pakistani-American lawyer attacked by Donald Trump spoke against the order in front of Congress on Thursday Mr Trump presented his ""extreme vetting"" plan as a way to crack down on countries that could be a source of terrorism. Anwar Iqbal, the Washington correspondent for Pakistan's leading English newspaper, Dawn, says this has further added to the community's anxiety. ""Pakistan has been on the top of this unspecified list for years and that's a reality we can't overlook,"" says Mr Iqbal, referring to the list of countries where terrorism is a major concern. The San Bernardino attack of 2015, allegedly carried out by a couple of Pakistani origin, has been used to justify the president's executive order. All this has meant sleepless nights for many of Mr Salman's clients. He says one lives in the US with his wife and daughter, but has a mother in Pakistan who is very ill. ""I saw a 45-year-old man crying. If he doesn't go and something happens to his mother, he'll never be able to forgive himself,"" says Mr Salman. ""On the other hand, if he gets stuck in Pakistan there's nobody to look after his wife and child in the US, as he is the sole breadwinner."" This is also the time when many Pakistanis look for highly sought-after bargains combining pilgrimages to holy sites in Saudi Arabia with a trip to home. A family is reunited in Boston's Logan Airport after the father was questioned as a result of the executive order ""An excellent deal from Saudi Airlines for $895 (Â£710) came up last week but there are barely any takers,"" says Mr Salman. Just about an hour's drive from his office is Brooklyn's Coney Island, home to thousands of Pakistani immigrants and aptly named Little Pakistan. Thousands here were deported in the post-9/11 crackdown. Now the rumour mills are in overdrive again. ""We hear that it's going to be worse than 9/11 this time, and unlike then it will be irreversible,"" says Baza Roohi, who works as a tax consultant. There are unsubstantiated talks of midnight raids on Pakistani-run businesses. People are scouring the internet and social media for information. Ms Roohi says this is all most of her clients talk about, with even some US citizens fearing deportation. ""I know of at least one family that owns two houses, and has already put up one for sale,"" she says. They want to make sure that if need be, they can leave in a hurry. Baza Roohi sees a high level of anxiety in her clients ""There are lots of rumours,"" a White House spokesperson admitted to the BBC. But he noted that US officials have no plans to add more countries to the ban, saying there's ""nothing imminent that I'm aware of"". According to the spokesperson, the countries that are currently mentioned in the Executive Order had not been sharing the kind of information US officials need in order to process travel documents of its citizens.  But he believed officials in other countries - such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Lebanon - were at this point providing the required information. If that changes, he said, these or other countries could be added to the list. Pakistan has been an important non-Nato ally for the United States in the war against terrorism, but the relationship has also been marked by mutual mistrust and acrimonious finger-pointing. There are many in Congress now who favour putting a squeeze on Pakistan because of its alleged support to militant groups who harm US interests in the region. There's also a feeling - expressed by the new Secretary of Defence James Mattis, during his confirmation hearing - that the US needs to stay engaged with the world's only nuclear-armed Islamic country. Some experts point to this as a sign that Pakistan may not be included in the travel ban even if the list is expanded. But for the community in New York, that's hardly reassuring.

"Our bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles, toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished with. Yet research shows our green intentions are washed away as soon as we step near a toilet. Now a business group has come up with an idea for how to combat this problem - two bathroom bins. The Circular Economy Taskforce, who were brought together by Prince Charles's Business in the Community environment charity, says it could boost recycling. So should two bins really sit alongside your stack of loo roll in the bathroom? Why should people have two bins in their bathrooms? ""It's trying to address the problem that people are less likely to recycle packaging for things we use in our bathrooms than for things we use in other rooms of the house,"" says Jonny Hazell, senior policy adviser for environmental think tank Green Alliance. The Recycle Now campaign points to its statistics, which show that while 90% of packaging is recycled in our kitchens, only 50% is being recycled in the bathroom. ""Often homes have one central recycling bin located in the kitchen, so when in the shower or washing your face it can be tricky to remember to transfer it to that bin,"" it says. ""This is why having a recycling bin or bag in the bathroom might be useful, if there is space."" Business in the Community says two bins could make it easier to separate out the plastics that can be recycled. ""But it doesn't have to be a bin, it could be as simple as a bag on the door handle that you bring down to the kitchen every week,"" it added. Where has this idea come from? While recycling has grown from 12% to 45% in the UK over the last decade, campaigners say the bathroom is an area that needs more focus. The Circular Economy Taskforce came up with the idea as part of its work looking at practical collaborative ways to boost recycling and re-use rates. ""The bathroom is one of the areas that has come up time and time again in the group as somewhere where both business and consumers can make a difference to help us all reduce our impact on the environment,"" says Business in the Community. ""Thinking about how different types of bins could boost recycling in the bathroom is just one example of a potential simple solution that could have a big impact."" Why are people failing to recycle their bathroom products? Campaigners believes it comes down not just to where a recycling bin is located but also to confusion over what can be recycled. Recycle Now says: ""There can also be confusion about what can or can't be recycled with bathroom products. ""For example many people don't realise that bleach bottles can be easily recycled - simply make sure it's empty and put the lid back on. ""Recycling just one bleach bottle saves enough energy to power a street light for 6.5 hours, so the value quickly adds up."" Research from the University of Exeter,externalalso found that people who threw away waste in the bathroom saw it as being ""dirty"" and were less likely to recycle it. Going through your bathroom bin to separate out what can and can't be recycled can seem off-putting,"" says Business in the Community. It added: ""There is also a lot of confusion around what can be recycled in the bathroom, for example many consumers are confused by aerosols."" How much recyclable waste comes from a bathroom? A surprising amount. Typical products include: Plastic shampoo, conditioner and shower gel bottles, plastic moisturiser bottles (such as for hand cream and body lotion), glass face cream pots (plus the cardboard packaging they come in), perfume and aftershave bottles, aerosols for deodorant, air freshener and shaving foam, bleach and bathroom cleaner bottles, toothpaste boxes and toilet roll tubes. Is a lack of recycling in bathrooms a real problem? Every little helps, is the message from environmental and recycling groups. ""In general, the less we recycle, the more water and energy we need to use to produce the materials we use in our daily lives,"" said Mr Hazell. Recycle Now says recycling reduces the amount we are sending to landfill and makes use of resources already available rather than making them from scratch. ""Ultimately this means reduced levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere which contribute to climate change,"" it added. ""For instance it takes 75% less energy to make a plastic shampoo bottle from recycled plastic compared with using virgin materials."" Can two bins have a meaningful impact on recycling overall? ""Ensuring you recycle in the bathroom can make a big difference,"" says Recycle Now. ""It would save Â£135,000 in landfill costs if every UK household threw their next empty shampoo bottles into the recycling bin. ""On top of this, if everyone recycled one more toilet roll tube it would save enough cardboard inner tubes from landfill to go round the M25 38 times."" But what if you don't have the space for two bins? There are other options. Hang a reusable bag on the bathroom door so you can transfer your recyclable items straight into the recycling bin. Or opt for a bin with split compartments which can be used to separate recyclable and non-recyclable items. UK recycling figure drops for first time Are you rubbish at recycling?

"Bob Stanley (left) lets his love of pop shine through in Saint Etienne, who turn 27 this year Every time a rock star dies (and, let's face it, it's happened a lot recently) a few trusted books get grabbed off the BBC bookshelves for a hastily-written obituary. They include classic tomes like the Guinness Book of Hit Singles and Colin Larkin's peerless Encyclopaedia of Popular Music, but they've been joined recently by Bob Stanley's Yeah Yeah Yeah. Packed with anecdotes and insights (he describes Berlin-era David Bowie as ""a silent movie ghost""), it reflects pop through the prism of the charts, rejecting the ""rockist"" perspective of most reference books. ""A film isn't necessarily more enjoyable if it's based on a true story,"" Stanley explains. ""Likewise, a song isn't necessarily any better or any more heartfelt, or convincing, because it was written by the singer."" Although Yeah Yeah Yeah ends in 2000, Stanley had already come up with chapter headings for the next instalment, including the fantastic ""Oops I Did It Again and Again"", about the Swedish hit factory behind Britney Spears, Taylor Swift and Justin Timberlake. So it's a surprise to discover his next book won't deal with grime, crunk or EDM - but big bands, ragtime and jazz. Called Too Darn Hot: The Story of Popular Music, it's an attempt to make sense of the 50-year period between the advent of recorded music and the birth of rock and roll. ""It's the classic case of, 'if you can't find the book you want to read, write it yourself,'"" explains Stanley. ""There are plenty of books on jazz or the great American songbook - but some of those genres have forceful advocates, who see their music asthemusic of the era and completely ignore Broadway or Hollywood musicals. So I really want to tie it all together"". Bing Crosby revolutionised the sound of recorded music, thanks to his unique microphone technique Last time around, Stanley was immersed in the music he was describing. He started his career at the NME and Melody Maker, before forming his own group, Saint Etienne, as the physical embodiment of his pop obsession - mixing 60s girl group harmonies with elements of folk, house, dub and northern soul. His knowledge of pop's pre-history is altogether more sketchy. ""I'm really starting from a position of knowing nothing about the music, except for the standards which everyone knows,"" he says. "" But learning things as I'm going is fascinating and terrific."" He recently discovered how Bing Crosby's intimate, laid-back delivery on songs like White Christmas was only made possible by the advent of electric microphones (previously, singers like Al Jolson were vaudeville ""belters"", screaming down the rafters in order to be heard). ""Nobody could have recorded a voice that soft before the late 20s,"" says Stanley. ""And then in the late 30s, he  [Crosby] funded the Ampex tape company, gave them thousands of pounds, and made the first pre-recorded radio broadcast. ""He said it was because he got fed up of going into the studio every day and wanted to play golf. But he speeded along recording technology."" Stanley's research has received a boost from the British Library, who have awarded him a Â£20,000 grant and a year's residency at the Eccles Centre - which houses the library's collection of American journals, newspapers and sound recordings. ""It means I'll have access to a lot more material in Britain than I thought,"" says the writer, ""from early music magazines with amazing names like 'Talking Machine News' to wax cylinder [recordings] and people's diaries."" The advent of jazz torpedoed the careers of music hall stars like George Robey The book's only in the early stages, but he's already uncovered a few surprising themes... including the fact that Britain was the dominant force in pop at the start of the 20th Century. ""America at that point just didn't have the confidence or belief in its own music,"" he says, referencing the story of Jerome Kern, who wrote standards like Smoke Gets In Your Eyes and A Fine Romance. ""As a young songwriter, he came over to England and went to see the music halls. Then he went back to America and passed himself off as English because that was the only way he could get his songs on Broadway,"" Stanley says. ""That changed very quickly once jazz came in. There are lots of [British] songs about how ragtime is a joke - 'my wife ragged herself to death' - but music hall got hit really badly by ragtime and jazz. ""As soon as it has the confidence, America becomes so brash, and everyone is cowed by it that it feels like Britain's doing a lame imitation of America until the Beatles."" Technology also plays a huge role in the story - particularly with the advent of radio in the 1920s. ""It's hard to conceive how it would have felt, if you were working on a farm in Iowa, to be able to hear a live broadcast of a big band from a ballroom in New York. ""That obviously affected what music people wanted to listen to, how it was recorded, how it was broadcast. The sound quality of early records lacked the depth and clarity of modern vinyl - as actress Gloria Swanson apparently discovered ""Something else I wasn't aware of was that record players, like in the 1990s, were consigned to the attic. The quality on radio was so much better than on the 78s [the precursor to vinyl records], which always sounded like a man shouting into a tube. ""It was only in the late 20s and early 30s, when the recording technology improved that people started getting 78s out again."" Stanley's home in North London is littered with record players - a vintage Dansette and a 1948 gramophone join his sleek, modern turntable amidst the neatly filed vinyl and scattered baby toys of his new son, Len. He says he intends to listen to the songs he writes about in their original format, whether it be wax cylinder or shellac discs ""because they would have been recorded to be played on that format. ""It's like The Who's singles in the 1960s. They were made to be played on a Dansette and that's why they sound thin and strange on a CD. ""So what I want to get across is what it was like to live through that period and how people were listening to music, and what they were listening to."" Writing the book will have to be slotted in around his other commitments, including a film about the jazz musician Basil Kirchin for Hull City of Culture and a brand new Saint Etienne album, which is due in June. Saint Etienne are due to tour later this year Called Home Counties, it reflects the band's experiences of growing up in Surrey and Berkshire. The songs tackle everything from the Enfield Poltergeist (a notorious hoax that made the national press in the 1970s) to the rail drivers' union Aslef, as well as ""teenage parties and deceased pets"". Stanley says he may miss a few of Saint Etienne's concerts as he finishes Too Darn Hot - grimacing he recalls flying the 1,000-page manuscript for his previous book on a tour of eastern Europe. ""I want to get this one done faster than the last, because that was five years,"" he says. ""I've got the structure sorted out, and I'm looking forward to talking to collectors.

"This video can not be played Footage from the BFI shows the journey of a Ford Model T car driving down Ben Nevis in 1911 Artists have been sought to create a life-size bronze replica of a Ford Model T car that was driven to the summit of Ben Nevis in 1911. Henry Alexander Jr, the son of Scotland's first Ford dealer, drove the Model T up and then down the mountain. The publicity stunt was to show that the mass produced American car was superior to hand-crafted British ones. Highland Council has sought a contractor to develop, cast and install the sculpture in Fort William. The replica is to be installed in the town's Cameron Square. The footage from more than 100 years ago is in the care of BFIâs Britain on Film collection Footage from the BFIâs Britain on Film collection shows the Model T on its descent of Ben Nevis In a notice inviting bids for the work,external, Highland Council said that up to Â£89,000 was available for the contract. A group called The Ben Bronze Model T has been promoting the idea of the statue in Fort William, the nearest town to Ben Nevis. In 2011,a team of about 60 volunteers carried a dismantled replica of a Model T Ford car up and then back down from the summit of Ben Nevis. The attempt, made in strong winds, hail and snow, was successfully completed. A mock up of the planned sculpture Volunteers carried wheels, seats and the chassis. Other parts of the car were put into 40 bags weighing 10 pounds (4kg) each. After being reassembled on the summit the car was again dismantled for the descent. Parts of the that replica car would be available to artists as templates for the sculpture, Highland Council said. Footage of the original drive on Ben Nevis was thought to have been lost,before being found. The film, which is in the care of the British Film Institute, shows a peat bank being dynamited to make the journey a bit smoother for the Model T.

"There is universal condemnation in Friday's papers for the lawyer struck off after he was found to have acted dishonestly in bringing murder and torture claims against British Iraq War veterans. The Daily Telegraph thinks Phil Shiner should now be investigated by the criminal authorities ""with the same vigour they showed in investigating those he falsely accused"". It says he was ""on a crusade;,externala mission, it seemed, to tear apart the reputation of the British armed forces"". The Times says he has been made a""pariah of his profession"",external, and calls for proper safeguards for soldiers so they cannot in future be subjected to allegations based on ""cooked-up evidence"". The Daily Mail agrees, saying the ""witch-hunt"" extends as far as Northern Ireland, where police are investigating more than 300 killings by the Army during the Troubles. The paper says Mr Shiner""is a stain on the legal establishment"",external. The Guardian has discovered that there is aban on non-urgent surgery in West Kent,externaluntil the new financial year begins, in April. It says around 1,700 people will be affected by the decision, which has been prompted by a cash crisis. The Royal College of Surgeons tells the paper the policy will prolong patients' suffering and may even cost more in the long term as conditions worsen. The group which commissions treatment in the area says no patients will have operations cancelled as a result of the measures. Rationing of a different kind is on thefront page of the Daily Mail,external. It says some supermarkets have begun imposing limits on the number of vegetables customers can buy due to the shortages caused by bad weather in the Mediterranean. Iceberg lettuces are being rationed in Tesco and Morrisons, which is also capping the purchase of broccoli. For the Guardian, it is""just the tip of the iceberg"",external. It says: ""British shoppers have already been warned that shortages of courgettes, aubergines, salad and celery will continue until the spring - and they can expect to pay substantially higher prices for the stock that is available."" The Mirror leads withan investigation into the poaching of gorillas,externalin the Democratic Republic of Congo, where populations have fallen by 80% in 20 years. The paper says the animals are being shot for bush meat by militia groups and miners looking for a rare metal used in the manufacture of mobile phones and games consoles. It is calling on the international community to act now to stop the slaughter. The Times, meanwhile, is urging the government to bring abouta housing revolution,externalby allowing more development of the Green Belt. It reports that a white paper on housing - due out next week - is expected to relax building height restrictions, among other measures. However, the paper thinks the Tories should go further - and have the stomach for a fight in its heartlands, where the Green Belt is seen as sacrosanct. Staying in the countryside, a new study about the benefits of camping is widely reported. Apparently a night under canvas can help with insomnia by resetting the body's circadian rhythm, or internal clock, because campers are forced to adapt their sleeping patterns to the natural light. However,the Telegraph warns,externalthere is a price to be paid for new-found health: it only works if there's strictly no peeking at the mobile phone. And finally. Several newspapers reveal the possible secret of Donald Trump's remarkable hair. According to the Times, it's an issue which has fascinated Americans throughout his career. Meanwhile, the new US president's head of hair is described in the Daily Express as a ""gravity-defying bouffant"". Its mystery, though, may have been solved by his long-time doctor. Dr Harold Bornstein told theNew York Times,externalthat the president takes a prostate-related drug that stimulates hair growth. He confirmed the president's hair was all real, but said it was helped to grow by a small dose of the drug finasteride, which lowers levels of prostate-specific antigen.

"Can virtual software be as effective as virtual superheroes? In the Disney Pixar animation The Incredibles, the daughter in the family of superheroes, Violet, has a particular superpower. She can create a protective force field around herself - an impenetrable bubble. She can also make herself invisible. Businesses trying to ward off millions of dangerous cyber-attacks in an increasingly connected world probably wish they had the same superpower. Well, perhaps now, they do. A cybersecurity firm called Bromium reckons its technology can protect laptop and desktop users in large organisations against malware hidden in email attachments and compromised websites. It does this through a process called micro-virtualisation. Every time you open a document or visit a website, Bromium creates a mini protected virtual environment for each task - like a series of Violet's bubbles. Even if you've clicked on an email link containing a virus, there's nowhere for that malware to go because it is isolated within its bubble. It cannot infect the rest of the machine or penetrate the corporate network. Violet's forcefield can protect anyone inside from attack. Can software do the same thing? Bromium co-founder and president Ian Pratt, who sold his first company XenSource to Citrix for $500m (Â£398m) in 2007, says it has taken his firm six years to perfect the product. ""This is by far the hardest thing I've done by miles,"" he tells the BBC. One helpful development was when the big computer chip designers, such as Intel and Arm, began producing chips that had virtualisation capability built in to them. ""We've created a billion virtual machines since we started - no bad stuff has ever escaped from one of them,"" says Mr Pratt. The technology has proved popular with intelligence services and other government agencies, he says. Bromium co-founder Simon Crosby says trying to detect the bad guy ""always fails"" ""The US intelligence services tend to compartmentalise data from secret sources using separate banks of computers. Now, using virtualisation, they can keep secret data separate and secure virtually on one computer,"" he says. One computer can have 50 virtual machines (VMs) running at the same time without much loss in performance speed, he says, although a typical user will have five to 10 running concurrently. It is this ability to create VMs instantly without much drain on the computer processor's resources that is one of the product's main advantages, he believes. At the World Economic Forum's recent Davos summit, a cybersecurity roundtable discussion revealed that the biggest banks can now expect up to two billion cyber-attacks a year; retailers, a mere 200 million. And recent research from IT consultancy Capgemini finds that only 21% of financial service organisations are ""highly confident"" they could detect a data breach. Unfortunately, despite all the latest firewalls and antivirus software, it is we humans who are the weakest link in any organisation's security defences. Despite all the warnings, we still click on email links and attachments, download software to enable us to watch that cute kitten video, and visit websites we probably shouldn't - even while at work. Virtualisation is one defence against such attacks. How many of us have visited websites we shouldn't have, even at work? Prof Giovanni Vigna is a director of the University of California in Santa Barbara's cybersecurity centre and co-founder of malware detection company, Lastline. He says: ""Virtualisation is a very effective way of containing the effects of an attack because it isolates the bad stuff, and that's awesome,"" he says. But it is not a ""silver bullet"", he warns. ""It won't prevent users from giving away sensitive security data in targeted spear phishing attacks,"" he says. This is where staff are hoodwinked into giving away security details because hackers have collated enough personal details to make an email or document look entirely official and convincing. This type of manipulation - called social engineering - is still ""very effective"", says Prof Vigna. ""It's difficult to protect against human stupidity."" Bromium's Ian Pratt accepts that this is a limitation of virtualisation, but he maintains: ""In 80% of cases hackers are gaining access to enterprise networks through staff clicking on dodgy links. ""Our system limits the damage that can be caused. We're trying to make these attacks far more expensive to execute."" Traditional anti-virus (AV) software works by identifying malware signatures and adding them to the huge database. Once a known signature has been detected it can then quarantine and delete the suspect program. The problem with this approach, however, is that it's reactive and does nothing to prevent previously unknown attacks made by new forms of malware, many of which can evolve within an infected system and evade the AV software. One cybersecurity firm trying to tackle this issue is Invincea, which describes its X product as ""machine learning next-generation antivirus"". Big banks can expect billions of cyber-attacks a year It aims to detect and stop malware without relying on signatures. It learns how suspect programs look and behave when compared to legitimate programs and other known forms of malware. And if a suspect file exceeds a risk threshold it is quarantined or deleted. The deluxe version of Invincea's product also ensures that all links and attachments are opened in a virtual isolated environment - its own version of Violet's bubble. ""Invincea is a major competitor to Bromium,"" says Prof Vigna. ""The advantage is that it works on CPUs [central processing units] that don't support micro-virtualisation, so it can be used in organisations with older computers."" Microsoft has also been exploring the benefits of virtualisation. Its next major Windows 10 update will enable users to run the Edge browser within a protected virtual machine environment. Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey's computer science department thinks the tech giant could go further. ""Virtualisation is a neat idea,"" he says. ""Lots of people are taking it very seriously. My personal suspicion is that someone like Microsoft may well try to build it into their operating system [OS] directly."" Although we have much better malware detection systems these days, we - ""the squidgy bit in the chair"", as Prof Woodward calls us - remain the most vulnerable point in this cybersecurity warfare.

"Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard played a combined 1,113 Premier League games Frank Lampard or Steven Gerrard? Ask a blue and they will tell you Lampard is a Chelsea legend, ask a red and they will say Gerrard lives on forever in Liverpool folklore. They were arguably two of their generation's best midfielders, the trajectories of their careers and similar playing styles meaning they were forever compared. After both brought an end to trophy-laden careers, BBC Sport looked to tackle the debate on who was better one last time - and gave you the chance to cast your vote. 52% of voters thought that Steven Gerrard was better. Lampard played 649 league games in spells with Swansea (for whom he made his professional debut), West Ham, Chelsea, Manchester City and New York City, while Gerrard's career spanned Liverpool and LA Galaxy. Though he went on to be a Chelsea legend, Lampard's Premier League life began at West Ham, making his debut as a replacement for John Moncur in a 3-2 win over Coventry in January 1996. Gerrard arrived in the top flight two years later in Liverpool colours, which he would sport for his entire career in English football. There are 211 reasons to place Lampard in the Stamford Bridge hall of fame, the midfielder's goals making him Chelsea's all-time top scorer, while Gerrard's contribution to the Liverpool cause was often evident via heart-on-his-sleeve performances. Neither were shy of goals or games - Lampard would go on to make 609 Premier League appearances to Gerrard's 504, scoring 177 goals to the Liverpudlian's 120. In his most prolific season, 2009-10, Lampard scored 22 goals in 36 games as he claimed the third of three Premier League winner's medals with Chelsea. He had previously won the title in 2004-05 and 2005-06. The closest Gerrard's Liverpool came to a league title was the season of his infamous 'slip' against Chelsea in 2013-14. That season, he weighed in with 13 goals and 13 assists from midfield. Gerrard missed out on a Premier League crown, but the hometown hero guided his club to Champions League success in 2005, as well as two FA Cups, three League Cups, a Uefa Cup and a Uefa Super Cup. But it is Lampard who boasts the most silverware. In 2005, Lampard finished second to Barcelona and Brazil forward Ronaldinho in the Fifa World Player of the Year awards as well as in the Ballon d'Or, in which Gerrard came third. Gerrard won Uefa Club Player of the Year Football finance expert Rob Wilson says if you took both players in their prime and sold them in last month's transfer window, Lampard would attract a marginally higher fee. But neither would match the world-record Â£89mManchester United spentto re-sign Paul Pogba from Juventus. ""I wouldn't put them on the same level as what we have seen with Pogba, simply because of the marketability of Pogba and his association with Adidas,"" said Wilson, from Sheffield Hallam University. ""Hindsight is a perfect science. We have seen the performances they were able to generate for their respective clubs, the consistency they were able to deliver and, particularly in the case of Lampard, the goals he scored as well. ""You would be comfortably talking Â£50m-Â£60m in transfer value - Lampard would be slightly more because of the number of goals he scored from midfield. ""If we were to have seen them sold this summer or next summer, you would be talking about wage packets of Â£250,000 a week."" During their final seasons in England,both players were included in the Sunday Times Rich List,with Gerrard's wealth in 2015 calculated at Â£42m, and Lampard's at Â£39m. While Lampard only once commanded a transfer fee, Chelsea signing him for Â£11m from West Ham in 2001, Gerrard left Anfield only when his contract expired in 2015, 18 years after signing his first professional deal. Gerrard was first included in Panini's collection for the 2002 World Cup, although he would miss the tournament through injury. The Liverpool man had already made one appearance at Euro 2000, having made his England debut shortly before the tournament. Lampard got his first tournament sticker at Euro 2004 Having first played in the same England team in 2002, Lampard and Gerrard featured 73 times together before both retired in the summer of 2014. Despite the suggestionthe duo ""couldn't play together"",,externalduring that time England won 63% of their games with both in the team, and 51% without. Gerrard was the more successful of the two when playing on his own, England winning 61% of 41 games, compared with 48.5% of the 33 matches with just Lampard involved. Lampard made his debut a year before Gerrard's first England appearance, but it was the Liverpool man who established himself first, scoring his first international goal in the 5-1 win over Germany in 2001, and captaining his country at three major tournaments. Lampard never scored at a World Cup despite 40 attempts on goal, including one against Germany in 2010 that crossed the line Squeezing two of England's most glittering members of the 'golden generation' into one midfield was seen to be a problem for a string of national managers, but BBC Sport football analyst Pat Nevin believes the issue lay with the coaches rather than the players. ""The problem wasn't Gerrard or Lampard, the problem was the managers,"" said former Scotland international Nevin. ""I don't think it was that complicated what they had to do, so that was a huge disappointment. ""Playing within a system, England tended to play 4-4-2 and teams were never stretched. There were two guys who were phenomenal at going into space and finding space, but had nowhere to run."" England won 46 of the 73 games that both Lampard and Gerrard played in Gerrard's performances in a Liverpool shirt sometimes led to the perception he had single-handedly dragged his team-mates towards glory, not least in the Champions League final against AC Milan in 2005 and the Reds' FA Cup triumph over West Ham a year later. Lampard, meanwhile, was no doubt a great player, reaching double figures for goals in 10 successive Premier League seasons, but was his career helped by playing in world-class Chelsea teams? In a bid to compare who played in the better side, we took the XIs that started the clubs' respective Champions League-winning finals and calculated the reported cost of each player to see how expensive the teams were to assemble. A Liverpool XI including youth products Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher cost the club an estimated Â£40.35m in transfer fees, with the amount paid for each player shown above Gerrard was part of the Liverpool side that came from 3-0 down at half-time to beat AC Milan on penalties in the 'Miracle of Istanbul'. That team would go on to boast 635 caps between them, with Gerrard's 114 England appearances matched by Spain's Xabi Alonso, while Norway's John Arne Riise (110) and Finland's Sami Hyypia (105) also reached their centuries. With Liverpool's success seven years earlier than Chelsea's, it is inevitable their starting XI would be cheaper than the Blues'. But at face value the Anfield outfit built their European victory for Â£100m less, with the side that started in Turkey costing a combined Â£40.35m. The side that started Chelsea's Champions League final against Bayern Munich cost Â£140.1m Chelsea's Champions League triumph also came via a penalty shootout, the Blues beating Bayern Munich on German soil. Lampard was among the scorers from the spot after Didier Drogba's late goal levelled the game in 90 minutes. Lampard (106) was one of four Chelsea players to win more than 100 caps for his country, with Petr Cech (Czech Republic, 124), Ashley Cole (England, 107) and Drogba (Ivory Coast, 104) contributing to a total 784 caps for the Blues. The cost of that side? Â£140.1m - and that's not including Fernando Torres (Â£50m) and Michael Essien (Â£24.4m), who were on the bench in Munich. Phil Neville, who played alongside the pair for England and against them for Manchester United and Everton, told BBC Sport they were ""always driving each other on to be better"". ""If Frank scored a goal, Stevie had to score a goal,"" he added. ""It's what great players do and you see it with how Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi compete with each other. You are inspired by the biggest challenges. ""It was a strength and a weakness of why they couldn't play together, in a way. ""I think Stevie, in his club career, maybe felt a little bit on his own at times. Maybe he looked at Frank as part of a great team, winning league titles and other cups - whereas he made Liverpool a good team by his own performances."" Oyo Sports immortalised Gerrard and Lampard as figurines when they arrived in the MLS As players of such similar style and stature in the game, leaving the Premier League for the MLS only furthered the Lampard-Gerrard debate. Gerrard joined LA Galaxy for the 2015-16 season, while Lampard chose New York City. Over the course of two campaigns in the MLS, Gerrard made 36 appearances to Lampard's 31. However, it was the former West Ham, Chelsea and Manchester City man who turned a stuttering Stateside start around to eventually make the bigger impact for his club, scoring 15 times including his 300th career goal. Gerrard's La Galaxy career ended in a penalty shootout defeat by Colorado Rapids in the play-offs Lampard on Gerrard:""There were many a night I can recall Stevie driving from midfield at Anfield and I tried to reverse that at Chelsea and be our driving force. ""There's a huge respect we both have for each other. We get on very well, particularly in our latter years. It's nice to come up against Stevie."" Gerrard on Lampard:""When that whistle goes and for 90 minutes when we are competing against each other it is war. We fight against each other, we always have. And when it's over there is a mutual respect there. ""I'm a huge fan of Frank. He's a phenomenal goalscorer from midfield. I play in the same position myself so I understand how difficult that is."" Following some fantastic battles on the field, will Gerrard and Lampard renew their rivalry in the technical area? Gerrard is set to begin his coaching career at Anfield, where the Liverpool legend will work with the club's youth teams. He was linked with the manager's job at League One side MK Dons last year but said the opportunity had come ""too soon"" for him. Lampard, meanwhile, has said he will study for his coaching qualifications with the Football Association - meaning they could yet line up in opposing dugouts. Coach or pundit?

"Investigators found vaseline in Lawrence's locker A former Royal Canadian Mint employee has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for stealing gold coins by concealing them in his rectum. Leston Lawrence stole $127,116 (CA$165,451; Â£100,000) of gold in 22 pieces. The 35-year-old, who was found guilty last November, was caught after he had successfully sold 17 of the gold pieces through Ottawa Gold Buyers. Ontario Court Judge Peter Doody ordered Lawrence to pay a $145,900 fine. Passing sentence on Thursday, he ruled that Lawrence should serve another 30 months in prison if he fails to pay the penalty within three years of his release. Lawrence worked at the Royal Canadian Mint from 2008 until 2015 Investigators found vaseline and latex gloves in the mint employee's locker. Judge Doody said these items ""could have been used to facilitate insertion of gold items inside his rectum"", reports the Toronto Star. The 17 laundered pucks weighed as much as 264g apiece and were sold for sums up to $7,300 each between 2014 and 2015. Lawrence was convicted of conveying gold out of the mint, breach of trust by a public official and possession of property obtained by crime. He used the money to buy a boat in Florida and build a house in Jamaica, the court heard. Lawrence's job was to purify gold and he occasionally worked alone in an area not covered by security cameras. He worked at the mint from 2008 to 2015.

"Here's an exclusive first look at David Hockney's masthead for Friday's edition of the Sun. What do you think? Newspapers are forever doing cool stunts with their front pages and mastheads. When he was editor of the Independent (my former parish), Simon Kelner designed several memorable front pages, often with the help of celebrities such as Bono or Tracey Emin. In my time as editor we had the odd stunt too. They tended to be aimed at promoting charitable causes. Sometimes proceeds from the sale of the paper would go to charity. For the Sun on Friday, this is more about boosting circulation with a souvenir edition. For Hockney, it will help to raise awareness of his forthcoming exhibition at Tate Britain, which opens on 9 February. David Hockney's Sun logo in more detail For what it's worth, I think the redesigned logo is terrific. It is true to the essence of the original but takes it in a playful and childish (in the best sense of that word) direction. Hockney was photographed for Friday's edition in his Los Angeles studio by Arthur Edwards, the Sun's celebrated royal photographer. In my view, newspapers should do front page stunts much more often. They generally have a relationship with their readers that is sufficiently deep and trustful for them to get away with it - and they do have the habit of turning particular editions into souvenirs, which can help boost circulation and increase impact on our culture. Indeed the Sun's front page on the birth of Prince George was, to my mind,close to genius,external. Of course, editors have to decide how often is too often.

"Since Beyonce announced she and husband Jay Z are expecting twins, social media has been abuzz with theories about the deeper meaning behind the record-breaking Instagram photo.

Lisa McCray tweeted:""Friend. Do you legit not have stretch marks?

Jay Z and Beyonce already have a daughter, Blue Ivy The Guardian chose to interpret it on a purely artistic level,external, pointing out its resemblance to ""late 15th century Flemish portraiture, when it was popular to depict a subject from a three-quarter angle, often in front of a landscape, and with hands clasped in front"". The background flowers, it said, are derived from ""rococo influences"" as is the photo's ""overall celebration of love and pleasure"". Vanity Fair,externaldescribed the photo as ""high-concept"", mirroring famous historical paintings of ""women of cultural importance,"" including Queen Elizabeth I. Australian online pop hub Junkee hired art historian Kate Roberts to appraise the photo,comparing it to works by the great masters of the past, including Raphael, Botticelli, Reubens and Warhol.,external Meanwhile, the tabloids searched for proof that Beyonce is a member of the Illuminati - the shadowy secret society believed by conspiracy theorists to be the mastermind behind global events. ""Beyonce is supposedly positioned in a pyramid shape - a key symbol for the Illuminati,"",externalsaid The Sun. ""Theories say the presence of a pyramid or triangle represents the top down command structure of the world."" Elle magazine suggested Beyonce's lack of clothing was a response to rumours from 2011,externalwhen she was pregnant with now five-year-old daughter Blue Ivy. It was alleged after an appearance on an Australian talk show that Beyonce's bump was fake. By stripping down to fully exposing her bump in 2017, there can be no doubt that this pregnancy is the real deal. Whatever the deeper meaning behind Beyonce's pregnancy announcement, it has got the world talking. Had she simply posted a shot of an ultrasound or two blue lines on a home pregnancy test kit, it perhaps wouldn't have become today's top headline. So much of the news in 2017 has revolved around political turmoil and shifting global dynamics. Beyonce's abstract and slightly surreal photo has provided some welcome relief, with social media users from across the spectrum briefly uniting under one sentiment - congratulations!

"The world is getting its first look at Donald Trump the Diplomat. He looks a lot like Donald Trump the Candidate, Donald Trump the Businessman and Donald Trump the Reality Television Host. He's brash. He has a temper. He's willing to say impolite things. He can be bullying or ingratiating, depending on his own internal calculations. Such attributes made him must-see television on The Apprentice. It helped him land blockbuster real-estate deals in boom times and stay one step ahead of financial collapse when business went bad. It's an open question whether it will be effective as a way to assert national authority on the world stage. There's no doubt, however, that it represents a sharp break from how US presidents have conducted themselves in the past, with carefully managed foreign interactions that seldom deviate from a prearranged script. Perhaps it's better to say that what the world is getting is its first look at Donald Trump the Un-Diplomat. Multiple media accounts on Wednesday described Mr Trump's recent phone conversations with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, based on reports from senior government officials and leaked transcripts of the communications. Thepresident told,externalAustralia's leader that an agreement the Obama administration had negotiated to admit entry of more than a thousand refugees currently detained in Australia was ""the worst deal ever"" and described his conversation with Mr Turnbull as the ""worst call by far"" among those he had conducted with world leaders that day. Australian PM Malcom Turnbull says his conversation with Donald Trump was candid and frank The discussion, scheduled for an hour, ended after about 25 minutes. In his call with Mr Nieto, Mr Trump reportedly said Mexico ""had not done a good job"" knocking out its ""bad hombres"". An Associated Pressarticle,externalreported that Mr Trump had threatened to send US troops into Mexico, but other media outlets were unable to confirm this or said the remark was made in jest. In both episodes, Mr Trump reportedlytook time,externalto boast about the size of his inauguration crowd - a recurring theme in his public remarks since becoming president. Accounts of the conversations differ dramatically from the official White House readouts, which paint a sterile picture of leaders embracing the ""enduring strength and closeness,external"" of their nation's relationships anddiscussing common interests,external. According to CNN reporter Jim Acosta, however, the reality is far different, as a source told him Mr Trump's conversations ""are turning faces white"" in the White House. A subsequent tweet by Mr Trump condemning the Australian refugee agreement seemed to confirm that the Turnbull conversation was more contentious than the original readout would indicate. The morning after the reporting double-whammy - further evidence that this administration already leaks more than a Swiss-cheese boat - Mr Trump addressed the swirling controversy. ""When you hear about the tough phone calls I'm having, don't worry about it,"" he said, his New York accent a touch thicker than usual. ""They're tough. We have to be tough. It's time we're going to be a little tough, folks. We're taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually. It's not going to happen anymore"" This video can not be played Australia PM Malcolm Turnbull on Trump call: 'Call ended courteously' It's the kind of in-your-face attitude that Mr Trump's supporters have long said they admired and wanted in the White House, although it has left much of the traditional foreign policy establishment stumbling to the fainting couches. ""This kind of behaviour generates a deep uncertainty on the part of other countries about whether they can trust America - and trust in America is the foundation on which much of the current world order is structured,""writes,externalVox's Zach Beauchamp. ""If Trump continues to behave this erratically, the consequences could be, well, unpredictable - and that's scary."" Mr Trump's foreign interactions haven't been all tough talk, however. A few weeks after his surprise election, Mr Trump spoke with Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and, according to that nation's readout of the conversation, the then-president-elect was effusive in his praise. Donald Trump's negotiating strategy is outlined in The Art of the Deal ""President Trump said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif you have a very good reputation,"" the release read. ""Your country is amazing with tremendous opportunities. Pakistanis are one of the most intelligent people. I am ready and willing to play any role that you want me to play to address and find solutions to the outstanding problems."" In his 1987 book, The Art of the Deal, Mr Trump explained what he saw as the keys to good negotiating. One of them was to be nice, but ""fight back hard"" if you think you're being treated unfairly. Another is to never show weakness. ""The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it,"" he writes. ""That makes the other guy smell blood, and you're dead."" Donald Trump the Un-Diplomat seems to be putting those maxims to use early and often in his global interactions - no matter who is on the other end of the line.

"Aman Salman's mobile barely stops ringing these days. He runs a small travel agency in Long Island, New York, catering mostly to clients of Pakistani origin. Phone calls usually mean good business. But since last Friday, when President Trump signed his Executive Order banning travel from seven Muslim-majority countries, most of these calls have been to cancel tickets. Pakistan, a Muslim-majority country, is not on Mr Trump's list. But there is huge concern and anxiety in the community that its inclusion is imminent. ""At least 95% of my Green Card holding clients, who had booked their tickets to Pakistan months in advance, have cancelled it,"" says Mr Salman. He is also getting frantic calls from those already in Pakistan trying to get the earliest possible return dates, even if that means paying stiff charges to change tickets. Mr Trump's order stops the admission of refugees from Syria indefinitely and further bans entry of all citizens from seven countries including Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen. A Customs and Border Protection statement clarifies that the current order doesn't apply to Green Card holders' entry to the United States, but there has been much confusion about the order, and reports of inconsistencies as to how it's being applied at airports. Aman Salman has seen many cancellations The visa ban for this list is in place for 90 days, but administration officials have hinted that it will be reconsidered and possibly expanded to include other countries. The uncertainty has prompted immigration lawyers to advise their Pakistani clients to cancel their travel plans for now and for those already in Pakistan to return immediately. Immigration attorney Rafia Zakaria says Pakistani citizens who are legal permanent residents of US or hold other US non-immigrant visas must take seriously the possibility of an imminent ban on Pakistani citizens as well. ""The text of the order says that further review is taking place, and the outcome of that is not really known to anyone,"" she told the BBC. She noted that White House spokesman Sean Spicer and White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus have both implied that the ban could be expanded. She says if the ban is expanded, the legal challenges will take a long time to be ironed out. Khizr Khan, a Pakistani-American lawyer attacked by Donald Trump spoke against the order in front of Congress on Thursday Mr Trump presented his ""extreme vetting"" plan as a way to crack down on countries that could be a source of terrorism. Anwar Iqbal, the Washington correspondent for Pakistan's leading English newspaper, Dawn, says this has further added to the community's anxiety. ""Pakistan has been on the top of this unspecified list for years and that's a reality we can't overlook,"" says Mr Iqbal, referring to the list of countries where terrorism is a major concern. The San Bernardino attack of 2015, allegedly carried out by a couple of Pakistani origin, has been used to justify the president's executive order. All this has meant sleepless nights for many of Mr Salman's clients. He says one lives in the US with his wife and daughter, but has a mother in Pakistan who is very ill. ""I saw a 45-year-old man crying. If he doesn't go and something happens to his mother, he'll never be able to forgive himself,"" says Mr Salman. ""On the other hand, if he gets stuck in Pakistan there's nobody to look after his wife and child in the US, as he is the sole breadwinner."" This is also the time when many Pakistanis look for highly sought-after bargains combining pilgrimages to holy sites in Saudi Arabia with a trip to home. A family is reunited in Boston's Logan Airport after the father was questioned as a result of the executive order ""An excellent deal from Saudi Airlines for $895 (Â£710) came up last week but there are barely any takers,"" says Mr Salman. Just about an hour's drive from his office is Brooklyn's Coney Island, home to thousands of Pakistani immigrants and aptly named Little Pakistan. Thousands here were deported in the post-9/11 crackdown. Now the rumour mills are in overdrive again. ""We hear that it's going to be worse than 9/11 this time, and unlike then it will be irreversible,"" says Baza Roohi, who works as a tax consultant. There are unsubstantiated talks of midnight raids on Pakistani-run businesses. People are scouring the internet and social media for information. Ms Roohi says this is all most of her clients talk about, with even some US citizens fearing deportation. ""I know of at least one family that owns two houses, and has already put up one for sale,"" she says. They want to make sure that if need be, they can leave in a hurry. Baza Roohi sees a high level of anxiety in her clients ""There are lots of rumours,"" a White House spokesperson admitted to the BBC. But he noted that US officials have no plans to add more countries to the ban, saying there's ""nothing imminent that I'm aware of"". According to the spokesperson, the countries that are currently mentioned in the Executive Order had not been sharing the kind of information US officials need in order to process travel documents of its citizens.  But he believed officials in other countries - such as Afghanistan, Pakistan and Lebanon - were at this point providing the required information. If that changes, he said, these or other countries could be added to the list. Pakistan has been an important non-Nato ally for the United States in the war against terrorism, but the relationship has also been marked by mutual mistrust and acrimonious finger-pointing. There are many in Congress now who favour putting a squeeze on Pakistan because of its alleged support to militant groups who harm US interests in the region. There's also a feeling - expressed by the new Secretary of Defence James Mattis, during his confirmation hearing - that the US needs to stay engaged with the world's only nuclear-armed Islamic country. Some experts point to this as a sign that Pakistan may not be included in the travel ban even if the list is expanded. But for the community in New York, that's hardly reassuring.

" Wednesday 25th January 2017 Most music fans have a treasured memento or two, whether it be the sweaty t-shirt or end-of-show drumstick caught in the crowd, or just the long-treasured ticket stub. But pop idol souvenirs can get a lot stranger - and pricier - than that. If you have the devotion and the cash to spare, almost anything formerly owned by the artist of your choice can be yours. Here are 10 of the strangest music-related objects that have gone under the hammer or sold online in recent years. John Lennon's image as the bad-boy, rebellious Beatle was well-grounded. In his time at Quarry Bank High School in Allerton, Liverpool, the 15-year-old racked up 29 detentions in 10 months between 1955 and 1956, for offences such as ""interruption"", ""impertinence"" and ""silly conduct"". Whatever would the Quarry Bank masters have made of I Am the Walrus? The rap sheet went up for auction at Sotheby's London in 2015, and sold for £2,500. More grimly, in 2011, one of Lennon's extracted teeth went up for sale at Omega Auctions in Warrington. Lennon had originally made a gift of the rotten molar to his housekeeper Dot Jarlett, suggesting she give it to her Beatles fan daughter. It sold for £19,000 to a Canadian dentist. This plaster mask ofDavid Bowie's face, which went on sale in August last year, was used to test prosthetics for the 1983 vampire film The Hunger, in which Bowie starred as an undead cellist alongside Catherine Deneuve and Susan Sarandon. In the film, directed by True Romance and Top Gun maker Tony Scott, Bowie's character, John, undergoes dramatic rapid ageing, hence the need for heavy makeup. The film has a cult following, though critical don Roger Ebert called it ""agonisingly bad"". Nonetheless, the mask sold for £1,800. Empty bottles, sweaty towels, breathed air: there's no celebrity relic someone hasn't tried to sell. Pity poorBritney Spears, who back in 2004 found a piece of gum, apparently chewed by her, for sale online, with bidding reaching over $14,000 (although it has been claimed that the seller bid against himself to hike the price up). It started something of a craze for gum chewed by the 22-year-old singer, with various other sellers popping up claiming they too had a piece. Yes, backgammon's the name… of his latest game. Sorry. One of the world's oldest board games, backgammon surged in popularity in the US in the late-1960s, developing an urbane allure - Hugh Hefner used to hold backgammon nights at the Playboy Mansion. Apparently,Elvis Presleywas a keen player, and his travel board would be brought out on his private plane when flying between concerts. The cost of getting your hands on the King's checkers? A cool $1,024, sold in November 2016. There's a buoyant market for items formerly graced by the presence of the King - bedspreads, Bibles, briefcases. You could even, at the same auction, purchase the very same protector spray that might have kept the splashes off those blue suede shoes. In 2000, while at the peak of his boyband fame with*NSYNC,Justin Timberlakehad breakfast at New York radio station Z-100 as part of the promotional grind. The enterprising hosts put his half-eaten French toast up for sale on an online site. The toast was sold to a Wisconsin fan, Kathy Summers, for $1025. ""I'll probably freeze-dry it, then seal it…then put it on my dresser,"" she toldEntertainment Weekly. So many questions arise, not least how did they post it? The real question, though, is: how could anyone leave French toast half-eaten? Madonna's Blond Ambition tour, documented in the film In Bed With Madonna, is one of pop music's most acclaimed. With sections inspired by Fritz Lang's Metropolis, art deco and Catholic iconography, it spawned many moments of legend, not least Madonna's conically boobed Jean Paul Gaultier basque. What better way to be part of that musical history than to own the very credit card (expired August 1990) with which Madonna may have bought her sausage rolls at service station tour stops? Plus you get an autograph into the bargain! Estimated to sell at $400–$600, this eventually went for $2,560 in November 2016. That'd buy you a lot of travel sweets. Used medicine containers are a strangely lucrative auction lot - an empty bottle of Elvis's prescription medicine went, ghoulishly, for over $8,000 dollars last year. Even more grubbily, you could avail yourself of a squeezed-out tube ofJerry Lee Lewis's nasal ointment, used to treat topical infections, as well as empty bottles of methadone or alprazolam, put up for sale by his ex-wife. Mmmm-mmm-mmm. But he's an actor, I hear you cry. Ah yes, but also a musical performance artist of some renown. From the late-60s,William Shatnerreleased albums of spoken-word, conceptual pop covers, such as an extremely intense, much-parodied take on Dylan's Mr Tambourine Man. And if you've never seen his version of Elton John's Rocket Man, you need to correct that immediately. Anyway, in 2006, Shatner sold his extracted kidney stone for $25,000. When it was removed, it proved to be so big,Shatner said, ""You'd want to wear it on your finger. If you subjected it to extreme heat, it might turn out to be a diamond."" Having persuaded his doctors to return the grisly relic to his care, Shatner decided to auction it to raise funds for a housing charity. The stone was eventually bought by an online casino, who have made a weird name for themselves by buying up odd auction lots including a ball kicked by David Beckham for a missed penalty, a slice of cheese on toast with the face of the Virgin Mary in it and a car formerly owned by the Pope. The country star's long braids are his most instantly recognisable feature. Perhaps, like Samson, his strength lies in them, and if you could possess them, you too could write songs of the calibre ofCrazy. Imagine then, the power in a pair of vintage 1980 braids, cut fromWillie Nelson's head at a party thrown byJohnny CashandJune Carter Cashto celebrateWaylon Jennings's sobriety. That's some powerful country mojo, and the pigtails, sold as part of a lot of items formerly owned by Nelson's outlaw country pal Jennings, went for $37,000 in Phoenix, Arizona in 2014. No, honestly. Before his debut album Back to Bedlam starting really selling,James Blunttold the Guardianin 2014 that he tried to fund a tour by selling everything that wasn't nailed down: ""Eventually there was nothing left to sell except her."" Blunt's sister needed to attend a funeral in Ireland, but with planes on strike and no ferries to be found, was stranded in the UK. Ever the pragmatic ex-officer, he posted her on an online auction site: ""Damsel in distress needs knight in shining armour to get her to this funeral on Saturday. What can anyone do?"" After a bidding frenzy, a man with a helicopter won the right to escort Blunt's sister. And in a truly Richard Curtis-esque ending, the pair are now married with two children, both named, according to Blunt, after types of helicopter. (Chinook? Sikorsky? Westland?

"""Having tuberculosis in the brain is so painful. Sometimes I just wish I could cut off my head and put it to one side."" Johnny Islam, 29, is from Leyton in east London. Although having TB in the brain is rare, the disease itself is not. Once deadly in the Victorian era - when it was known as the white plague - it is often assumed that tuberculosis has long since been eradicated. But there are so many cases in London that the city is known as the TB capital of Western Europe. Having the disease has changed Johnny's life. It could cause long-term damage, or even kill him. ""I'm scared to go outside, I'm scared to do things on my own because I can blackout at any time. ""It can spread to any brain cells, it can damage your memory, and I forget things all the time. ""Everyone is going to die one day. This disease could kill me, anything can happen."" The most recent data on infection rates show parts of London still have higher rates of TB than in some developing countries, such as Iraq, Libya and even Yemen. It is a bacterial infection, which mainly affects the lungs, but can target any part of the body. It is curable in most cases. This video can not be played Tracking tuberculosis on the streets of London TB in the lungs is spread through inhaling tiny droplets containing the bacteria, from the coughs or sneezes of someone infected with it. Johnny's condition is rare and complex, and he's been taking a combination of 12 antibiotic tablets for more than a year. He's involved in video observed treatment - which involves him recording himself taking his medicine on a smartphone, and then sending the recording on a secure server to his health care workers, so they know he's sticking to the treatment. The first-ever trial of this method was carried out by University College London, in collaboration with University College London Hospitals. It saw patients recording themselves taking their medication daily using a dedicated smartphone. They then employ a custom app allowing secure upload to an NHS-approved server, for remote viewing by a trained observer. The trial's been described as a potential game-changer in the fight against tuberculosis in the UK. The preliminary results show more than 80% of patients completed the treatment using the technology, which paves the way for it to be used in the most complicated cases, such as Johnny's. Millions have been invested to try to eliminate TB as a public health problem. There were 5,758 new cases of active TB in the UK, in 2015 - and almost 40% of those were in London. Recently there's been a fall in overall cases, but those involving the most at risk and difficult to treat, such as people who are homeless, abusing drugs or in prison, are rising. Finding active cases is the first challenge - the next is getting them to stick to the long treatment, which involves a minimum of six months on a combination of antibiotics. Patients often stop midway, which can cause a relapse and strains of the bacteria to become resistant to drugs. Experts hope the video-observed treatment might help with this. Dr Alistair Story was involved in the video trial and said that if it ""works for TB, it works for other conditions"". ""With the emergence of drug-resistant strains of bacteria, we think this has an important role to play to prevent the spread of the disease."" Johnny is now nearing the end of his treatment. ""I have so many side-effects from all the medicines I'm taking. I've been losing my hair, and my left leg stops working sometimes. ""It's been difficult to stick to the treatment, but I hope it's worked and I can finally be TB free.""
