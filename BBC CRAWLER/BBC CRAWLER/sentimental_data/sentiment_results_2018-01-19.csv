"Oliver Mears has suspended his studies at Oxford University The case against an Oxford University student who had a rape charge ""hanging over his head"" for two years has been dropped on the eve of his trial. Oliver Mears had been on bail since his arrest on suspicion of rape and sexual assault in July 2015, when he was 17. A judge criticised prosecutors' ""last-minute"" decision to drop the case, made after new evidence emerged last week. Surrey Police admitted its initial investigation into Mr Mears, now 19, had been flawed. The chemistry scholar, from Horley, was attending St Hugh's College but suspended his studies amid investigations into the allegations. He learned this week that prosecutors would offer no evidence against him after a diary which supported his case was uncovered. At Guildford Crown Court, where the case was formally thrown out, Judge Jonathan Black heard the diary ""tips the balance"" in favour of the defendant. Prosecutor Sarah Lindop said it contained previously unseen evidence which was ""not of assistance to the prosecution"". Other ""third-party"" material had also contributed to the decision, she said. Surrey Police said it is now reviewing all of its rape cases ""to ensure that investigations are thorough, timely, effective and compliant with policy and guidelines."" It comes after Scotland Yard said it would review all sex crime investigations where a suspect had been charged, following the collapse of two rape prosecutions in a week. A file was passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in May last year and Mr Mears was charged a month later. The judge criticised ""unnecessary delays"" in the case, which Mr Mears and the complainant had ""hanging over their heads"" for two years. ""Had the investigation been carried out properly in the first instance, [it] would not have led to this position"", he said. Reports had suggested Mr Mears' case was among a number ofrecent high-profile trials dropped over failure to disclose evidence,external. Although there were ""some disclosure matters"", Ms Lindop said, ""this is not a disclosure case per se"". Judge Black demanded the head of the CPS rape and sexual offences unit write to him within 28 days ""with a full explanation of what went wrong"". He would then decide whether any action was required. As Mr Mears' mother left court, she said she was ""delighted"" at the result. Oliver Mears was arrested on suspicion of rape and sexual assault in 2015 By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent Oliver Mears wasn't in court to hear the ""not guilty"" verdicts, but he'll no doubt be immensely relieved - and heartened to know that the judge was critical about how long it had taken to get to that point. The reasons for the delay remain unclear, despite the prosecutor's explanation in court. Cases like this aren't straightforward, but why did it take two years for charges to be brought and a further seven months for evidence to emerge that killed off an already finely-balanced prosecution? This is the fourth time in four weeks that a rape case has collapsed in such circumstances and it is hard to avoid the conclusion that there is something fundamentally wrong with the system. Surrey Police said the CPS had requested the force provide materials from the complainant's digital media on 5 January 2018. These were handed over on 15 January, it added. The force said it ""deeply regrets mistakes made in the efficacy of investigations"". A spokesperson admitted there were flaws in the initial investigation, during which the complainant's digital media went unexamined. Officers did not follow ""what we would consider to be a reasonable line of enquiry"", they added, The force has launched an internal review, but said the case was dropped for ""a number of reasons"", only one of which related to Surrey Police. Mr Mears was studying at St Hugh's College when the allegations were made A CPS spokesman said ""prosecutors were not satisfied there was a realistic prospect of conviction,"" after an evidence review. The CPS offered no evidence against both Liam Allan and Isaac Itiary after the late disclosure of evidence that could have assisted the defendants.

"Stephen Paddock smuggled more than 20 weapons into the hotel overlooking the Las Vegas Strip Police say they do not expect to file charges against the girlfriend of a gunman who killed 58 people in Las Vegas in October. Marilou Danley, girlfriend of gunman Stephen Paddock, had previously been named a person of interest in the case. Sheriff Joe Lombardo told a news conference that police still did not know the motive for the mass shooting. Paddock opened fire on hundreds of concertgoers from a 32nd floor window of the Mandalay Bay hotel. It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. Sheriff Lombardo told reporters that investigators believed Paddock had acted alone but that the FBI was investigating ""a person of interest"" whom he could not identify. He said 851 people attending the music concert on Las Vegas Strip were injured, including 422 who had wounds associated with gunfire. What was Stephen Paddock's motive? Paddock used 'bump-stock' device to shoot faster In a public update to the investigation on Friday, he revealed that Paddock had searched for other potential targets and taken photographs of possible sites. Sheriff Lombardo said Paddock had also searched online for tactics used by police and Swat teams. During the investigation child pornography images had been found on Paddock's laptop computer, he added. ""This report is not going to answer every question or even answer the biggest question as to why he did what he did,"" the sheriff said. After the shooting, officers stormed the hotel room and found Paddock dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He had smuggled 24 weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition into the hotel, concealed in 10 suitcases. Ms Danley, speaking through her lawyer in October, said she had had no idea Paddock was planning violence. She said she had known him as a ""kind, caring, quiet man"".

"Natasha Gordon, 44, was given a four-year jail term at Leicester Crown Court A woman who backed out of a suicide pact, leaving a man to die alone, has been given a four-year jail term. Natasha Gordon, 44, was convicted at Leicester Crown Court in December, two years after Matthew Birkinshaw, 31, was found dead in his car at Rutland Water. She met the postman, from Walsall, West Midlands, on an internet forum where she agreed to be his ""suicide partner"". Gordon, described as a ""suicide advocate"" in court, was found guilty of encouraging Mr Birkinshaw's suicide. Natasha Gordon denied assisting in the death of Matthew Birkinshaw but was found guilty by a jury The court was told that after exchanging messages the pair travelled together to the UK's largest reservoir on 17 December 2015. But Gordon was found by police after leaving Mr Birkinshaw alone in his Fiat Punto, having suffered carbon monoxide poisoning. An officer who attended the scene said Ms Gordon told him Mr Birkinshaw had given her Â£60 to get home but ""asked her not to change his mind"". Matthew Birkinshaw's parents called their son ""thoughtful, sensitive, generous and compassionate"" The court heard Gordon contacted other men about more deals within hours of Mr Birkinshaw's death. Prosecutor Tim Cray said she was ""prepared to say to people she hardly knew"" that taking their own life ""was the right thing to do"". Sentencing judge Mrs Justice Bobbie Cheema-Grubb told Gordon, from Paston, Peterborough, she was ""gripped by self-centredness"" and had no ""settled intention"" to commit suicide herself. ""I have found you misled [Mr Birkinshaw] into believing you were genuine and firmly intent on committing suicide with him, although you were not fully committed."" Matthew Birkinshaw was found dead at Rutland Water in December 2015 Gordon, who has a history of depression and has previously attempted to kill herself, denied the charge and said she had no input into his decision to die. After they met online, Gordon sent a message to Mr Birkinshaw which said: ""I really can't wait to go tomorrow, I hope you do not change your mind."" Mr Birkinshaw then travelled through the night to the defendant's home. Mrs Justice Cheema-Grubb told Gordon: ""He was a stranger to you. You took no trouble to find out anything about him. You introduced the method that he used and advised him on how it was to be deployed. ""He may not have gone through with it if you had not accompanied him."" On 17 December 2015, Ms Gordon contacted her partner from Rutland Water to tell him she was going to kill herself. He then raised the alarm with the police, who found Ms Gordon. It was then later when Ms Gordon disclosed that police should be looking for ""another person at risk"" - Mr Birkinshaw. The court heard that Royal Mail employee Mr Birkinshaw was found locked in the car and a police officer had to break the window with his baton. Mr Birkinshaw, who had been in good health and had a stable girlfriend, was pronounced dead at 19:24 GMT. The police then investigated Gordon and discovered the messages. Mr Birkinshaw's mother, Margaret, said in an emotional statement in court: ""His last words to me were 'Give me a hug mum, I'll be back tomorrow.' ""I've asked myself a million times over the past two years 'Why didn't I ring him? Would it have made a difference if he'd heard my voice?"" In a statement issued after the guilty verdict against Gordon, Mr Birkinshaw's parents urged others who may be struggling to speak to someone that has ""your best interests at heart"".

"Coca-Cola has announced a pledge to recycle a used bottle or can for every one the company sells by 2030. Calling it a ""massive global ambition"" the firm admitted its part in littering the environment and a responsibility to tackle the problem. The company, which markets 500 brands of fizzy drink, juices and water, will also work towards making all of its packaging recyclable worldwide. Greenpeace said Coca-Cola should focus on reducing, not recycling, waste. Coca Cola announced its ""World Without Waste"" campaign by acknowledging that food and drink companies were responsible for much of the rise in litter on streets, beaches and in the oceans worldwide. ""The world has a packaging problem - and, like all companies, we have a responsibility to help solve it,"" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey said in a statement. The firm also said it subscribed to the idea of a ""circular economy"" where resources such as aluminium, plastic and glass are re-used rather than disposed of. As well as the well-known Coke brand, the firm markets dozens of other juices, sodas and teas including Fanta, Schweppes, Smartwater and Appletiser. How plastic changed the world Plastic recycling: Your questions answered Smaller bottles of Coca Cola to cost more ""We believe every package - regardless of where it comes from - has value and life beyond its initial use,"" Mr Quincey said. ""If something can be recycled, it should be recycled. So we want to help people everywhere understand how to do their part."" The firm said it was working to increase the recycled content in the materials it uses to make its drinks bottles, developing plant-based resins and reducing the plastics used in packaging. It will also invest in educating consumers on best recycling practice in their community, the firm said. Greenpeace welcomed Coca-Cola's move to increase the amount of recycled content in plastic bottles from ""a paltry 7%"" to 50% by 2030, the campaign group said it was unambitious compared to a commitment from Coke UK to do that by 2020. However, ina blog,externalaccompanying the announcement, Mr Quincey also defended the use of bottles and packaging more generally. ""It's tempting to romanticise a world without packaging. To assume that if we get rid of plastic bottles and cans that life will be better. For animals, for humans, for our planet,"" he wrote. ""This mistakenly ignores all the good they can do. Modern food and beverage containers help reduce food spoilage and waste. They limit the spread of disease. They can help save lives,"" he wrote. The UK government is considering introducing a deposit scheme for plastic drinks bottles. Coca-Cola's announcement made no mention of deposit schemes but in the past theUK arm of the company has said it would support the ideaas long as the scheme was UK-wide. Tisha Brown, Oceans Campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said Coca-Cola's plan had ""fallen flat"" when it came to cutting down on waste plastic. ""A litter free world is possible - but only if big companies like Coke stop producing ever growing quantities of plastic litter. They need to reduce and reuse as well as recycle,"" said Ms Brown.

"Ministers have backed down in a row over paying higher disability benefits to 164,000 people by saying they will not contest a High Court decision. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said she would not appeal December's judgement over payments to people with mental health conditions. Ministers had sought to limit those suffering psychological distress from claiming higher rates of benefits. Campaigners said this was ""crude and unfair"" and welcomed the U-turn. The government introduced regulations last March stating that people who could not travel independently on the grounds of psychological distress, as opposed to other conditions, were not entitled to the enhanced mobility rate of Personal Independence Payment. Disability benefit changes criticised No 10 defends disability benefit plan Ministers pressed ahead with the proposals despite criticism from an independent tribunal in 2016 but the High Court ruled shortly before Christmas that they were ""blatantly discriminatory"". The government was expected to challenge the ruling, having previously said reversing the changes would cost an extra Â£3.7bn by 2022. But Ms McVey, in one of her first major announcements since joining the cabinet last week, ruled out fresh legal action in a written statement to Parliament. ""My department will now take all steps necessary to implement the judgment in the best interests of our claimants, working closely with disabled people and key stakeholders over the coming months,"" she said, adding that all payments would be backdated to the effective date in each individual claim. ""Although I and my department accept the High Court's judgement, we do not agree with some of the detail contained therein. ""Our intention has always been to deliver the policy intent of the original regulations, as approved by Parliament, and to provide the best support to claimants with mental health conditions."" The Department for Work and Pensions will now go through all affected cases to identify anyone who may be entitled to more as a result of the judgement. All payments will be backdated to the effective date in each individual claim. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams said ministers had been wrong to ""ignore"" the view of an independent tribunal and to try and ""defend the indefensible"". ""Serious questions remain including, how many people have been adversely affected by the government's reckless decision to oppose the tribunal's original judgment?"" she said. ""And how quickly will people with severe mental health conditions receive the support to which they are rightly entitled? This is yet more evidence of the duplicity and disarray of the Tories' social security policies."" Mark Atkinson, chief executive of disability charity Scope, said the original proposals were discriminatory. ""This announcement is a victory for the many disabled people who have been unable to access support they are entitled to. The regulations introduced last March made crude and unfair distinctions between those with physical impairments and mental health conditions,"" he said. Today's announcement is about Personal Independence Payments or PIP, a benefit designed to help cover extra costs incurred when you have a disability. By Nikki Fox, BBC disability news correspondent PIP has two parts, one for help with daily living, the other for mobility. Today's announcement is to do with the latter. To get the standard rate of Â£22 per week a person must score eight points at assessment. Scoring 12 points entitles a person to the enhanced rate of Â£58 per week. Last February, the government introduced regulations that meant people who struggle to ""plan and follow a journey"" because of psychological distress would have got a maximum of 10 points. This made it impossible for them to get the enhanced rate unless they get further points elsewhere in the assessment. Campaigners argued those who could not leave their homes unaccompanied or take public transport incurred extra costs. Following a legal challenge, the High Court found in December that this was ""blatantly discriminatory"" and could not be justified. It has been unclear whether the government would appeal against the decision but Esther McVey has now ruled this out. It means that if a person's condition is deemed severe enough, it's now possible to score 12 points in the assessment and qualify for the enhanced rate of PIP mobility.

"A British-born former land-speed record-holder has died in a helicopter crash in the US state of New Mexico. Charles Burnett III, aged 61,was killed alongside a prominent Zimbabwean politician, Roy Bennett, Mr Bennett's wife Heather, and co-pilots Jamie Coleman Dodd and Paul Cobb. Mr Cobb's daughter Andra, who was Mr Burnett's long-term partner, survived the crash with serious injuries. Mr Burnett, based in Houston, had set a number of records on land and water. His most notable achievement came in August 2009, when he was the driver of a British-built vehicle that achieved an average speed of 139.8mph to smash the world record for steam-powered cars. Before his successful attempt - which took place in California - the record had remained unbroken for 103 years - and Mr Burnett's car was famously nicknamed the ""fastest kettle in the world"". The editor of Guinness World Records, Craig Glenday, said he was ""shocked and saddened"" to hear of Mr Burnett's death, saying he ""played an important role in what was to become a pioneering moment for the British Steam Car team"". ""Charles clearly embodied passion,"" he added. Roy Bennett, who has opposed former Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe, also died in the crash Giving details of the fatal helicopter crash, New Mexico police said they had launched a frantic search when Ms Cobb called the emergency number but could not give her location. They confirmed in a statement that the helicopter's wreckage was found burning on a rancher's property east of the city of Raton.

"This video can not be played Mr Mattis said China and Russia posed a major threat to US security US Defence Secretary James Mattis has said competition between great powers, not terrorism, is now the main focus of America's national security. The US faced ""growing threats from revisionist powers as different as China and Russia"", he said, unveiling the national defence strategy. In an apparent reference to Russia, he warned against ""threaten[ing] America's experiment in democracy"". ""If you challenge us, it will be your longest and worst day,"" he warned. America has been gripped byongoing investigations into alleged collusion between the Trump 2016 election campaign and Russia. Speaking in Washington, Mr Mattis also appealed to Congress to fund the military adequately and refrain from ""indiscriminate and automatic cuts"" to the US federal budget. Trumpâs pragmatic view of troubled world The time when America stopped being great Russia and China are rivals to US - Trump President DonaldTrump is seeking to boost defence spending by 10%, or $54bn (Â£43bn), in his proposed budget plan for this year, and hopes to recoup that sum through deep cuts elsewhere, including to foreign aid. By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent The publication of the Trump administration's new National Defense Strategy signals an important shift in Washington's priorities. For almost two decades - ever since the attacks of 9/11 - America's military focus has been on fighting terrorism, with counter-insurgency campaigns in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. But now there is to be a renewed emphasis on inter-state strategic competition - matching so-called peer competitors like Russia and China. US Defence Secretary James Mattis is right when he says that Washington's competitive military edge is fast eroding. There needs to be investment in a range of new technologies that might provide the edge on a future battlefield. But it is not simply a matter of spending more money. He pointed to the difficulty of passing budgets on Capitol Hill over successive years which, he said, had done more damage to US military readiness than any enemy in the field. This video can not be played US-backed forces may be celebrating, but IS has not been defeated This is the first time the defence policies of the Trump administration have been spelled out in one place. The threats listed are the same as under the Obama administration but the order of priority is different. Formerly, jihadist militant groups like Islamic State or al-Qaeda were the focus but latterly America's former Cold War opponents, Russia and China, have reasserted themselves strategically. ""We face growing threats from revisionist powers as different as China and Russia, nations that seek to create a world consistent with their authoritarian models,"" Mr Mattis said. A summary of the new strategy was published,externalon the defence department's website. The three great nuclear powers have posed a permanent existential threat to each other since Cold War days. This video can not be played Russia invited international journalists to report on their operations in Syria In recent years, however, fears have risen of the once-unthinkable: a direct conventional clash, particularly between Russia and the US in Syria or Ukraine. This video can not be played What will China use their new aircraft carrier for? The new strategy recognises that ""China and Russia in particular have been assiduously working over a number of years to develop their military capabilities to challenge our military advantages"", said Elbridge Colby, US deputy assistant secretary of defence for strategy and force development. ""This strategy really represents a fundamental shift to say, look, we have to get back, in a sense, to the basics of the potential for war and this strategy says the focus will be on prioritising preparedness for war, in particular major power war,"" he added. The national defence strategy provides guidance for the 2019 defence budget. While the US was ""still strong"", the defence secretary said, its competitive edge had ""eroded in every domain of warfare - air, land, sea, space and cyberspace - and is continually eroding"". Appealing to Congress, he said: ""No strategy can survive without predictable funding. As hard as the last 16 years [that is, since the 9/11 attacks] have been, no enemy has harmed the US military more than defence spending caps and sequestration."" Referring tothe current wrangle in the Senate over a bill to fund federal agencies temporarily, he said a shutdown would have an impact on military operations. Aircraft carriers project US military power across the globe ""Our maintenance activities will probably pretty much shut down...over 50%, altogether of my civilian workforce will be furloughed..."" he said. ""We do a lot of intelligence operations around the world and they cost money, those obviously would stop.""

"Peter Morrison had pleaded guilty to careless driving but denied dangerous driving A football agent who killed a traffic officer on the M6 has been jailed for seven years. Peter Morrison, 37, had been speeding and sending phone messages before the crash in Cumbria in February 2016. Adam Gibb, 51, from Penrith, died and Paul Holroyd, 53, from Kirkby Stephen, was left paralysed from the chest down. Morrison, of The Warke in Worsley, Salford, wasconvicted of causing death by dangerous drivingfollowing a trial at Carlisle Crown Court. Sentencing him at Liverpool Crown Court, Mr Justice William Davis said the jail term he was imposing ""does not begin to reflect the true value of the lives you have wrecked"". Morrison was also handed an eight-year driving ban. Adam Gibb's family said he was a ""fantastic dad and a wonderful husband"" At his trial Morrison admitted causing death by careless driving, but denied dangerous driving. Jurors were told he was speeding and sending a string of phone WhatsApp messages minutes before losing control of his Mercedes ML 350 4x4 in ""atrocious"" weather conditions. His vehicle then swerved ""violently"" off the southbound carriageway, across the hard shoulder and rebounded off a rock before ploughing into the two Highways England traffic officers who were overseeing the recovery of two previously-crashed vehicles. During 23 miles he had exchanged 25 phone messages and the last - 96 seconds before the crash - was to Nottingham Forest's Zach Clough containing a link to video footage of a goal the striker had scored. In his police interview, Morrison refused to answer questions about the collision but read from a pre-prepared statement. He said: ""I accept the mobile phone analysis shows I was both sending and receiving messages on my phone prior to the accident. ""However, I do not accept any suggestion that I was distracted at the time of the collision and I do not accept the use of my mobile phone caused or contributed to this tragic accident."" The weather at the time of the crash was described as ""atrocious"" The married father-of-one was a former footballer who played for Bolton Wanderers and Scunthorpe United before his career was cut short by injury. During his trial, jurors heard a number of character references in support of Morrison, including from Queens Park Rangers footballer Nedum Onuoha and the Manchester City and Belgium player Vincent Kompany. Morrison, who was described as ""remorseful"" wrote a letter to the court stating: ""I will punish myself, mentally, for this until the day I die."" Following sentencing, Insp Jo Fawcett of Cumbria Police said: ""Morrison's driving manner showed reckless disregard for the safety of other road users which has resulted in Mr Gibb losing his life and Mr Holroyd suffering horrendous injuries which will impact on the rest of his life. ""Morrison's decision to drive at an inappropriate speed for the road conditions, whilst using a mobile phone no less, have directly led to this tragic outcome.""

"YouTube says Logan Paul's ""punishment must fit the crime"" over a controversial vlog he uploaded onto the platform. Logan was criticised for joking about a dead body he had found ina Japanese forestknown for suicides. Speaking exclusively to Newsbeat, YouTube's chief business officer says the case was ""borderline"". It took 10 days for YouTube to admit the video shouldn't have been published. Although the platform had earlier said it ""prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner."" Logan removed the video two days after it had been put up, but by then it had been viewed more than five million times. ""We were trying to determine the right course of action, which is what took the time. And we decided that the video should come down,"" chief business officer Robert Kyncl told Newsbeat. Screengrab from the video posted by Logan Paul in Japan's Aokigahara forest YouTube was heavily criticised for featuring the video on its front page for 48 hours before doing anything about it. Kyncl says he understands the criticism. ""It was a borderline case in many different ways and it took us a while to work through it. ""We should have responded faster, but sometimes in these borderline cases it takes a bit longer to get to those decisions and that was the case here."" Logan Paul has apologised for the video and thinks that he deserves a second chance. The video was viewed more than five million times before being removed Kyncl doesn't necessarily agree. ""I'm not sure I would say it exactly that way - but I think you always want to make sure the punishment fits the crime. ""This is a very evolving ecosystem - so many times we face new things so we keep on evolving those very rapidly. ""You have to realise that many YouTube stars are young, they are very popular, they have large teams around them and we're all twice their age. ""It's easier and quicker for us to make decisions than it is for them. ""And it is our job to work with our creator community to make sure that they are consistently making the right decisions."" With 400 hours of video uploaded to the website every minute, YouTube has a lot to monitor. ""I think every time you grow larger and larger you always assume more responsibility,"" says Kyncl. ""We take all this very seriously - it's our top priority and it has been for the past year."" Kyncl says without technology YouTube couldn't deal with the volume of videos the site hosts. ""Algorithms have done the job of 180,000 people working 40 hours a week, dealing with controversial content. ""Then our people, whether that's our community vloggers or our employees, work through context which is harder for machines to discern.""

"Kardashian West was told there could be health risks if she got pregnant again Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West have named their new-born daughter, delivered by surrogate on Monday, Chicago West. Kardashian West said that not carrying the child herself was ""so hard"", but that the couple had an instant connection with her. West was raised in the US city Chicago. Kardashian West carried and gave birth to her older children but was advised against getting pregnant again because of possible medical complications. Her daughter North is now four years old and her son Saint is two. But she suffered from pre-eclampsia and placenta accreta on those occasions. Pre-eclampsia is a condition that usually occurs in the second half of pregnancy and can cause serious complications including seizures and death if not monitored and treated. Placenta accreta is when the placenta attaches itself too deeply into the wall of the uterus and remains attached after childbirth. Kardashian West's daughter North was born in 2013 Kardashian West, a reality TV star, said in a post on her app that ""doctors said that it wasn't safe for my, or the baby's, health to carry my own"". The 37-year-old said she and her rapper husband decided to use a ""gestational carrier"", meaning the baby is ""biologically mine and Kanye's"". 'The greatest gift': How I became a surrogate Kim and Kanye welcome third baby Why I wanted to be a surrogate mum She wrote: ""Having a gestational carrier is definitely different, but anyone who says or thinks it's the easy way out is completely wrong. ""People assume it's better because you don't have to deal with the physical changes, pain or complications with delivery, but for me it was so hard to not carry my own child, especially after I carried North and Saint."" Kardashian West's surrogate was discussed on her reality show Keeping up with the Kardashians, but her identity was not revealed. The star said she had a ""great"" relationship with the surrogate, and ""trusted her completely throughout the entire process"". She added: ""I'm so grateful for modern technology and that this is even possible. It's not for everyone, but I absolutely love my gestational carrier and this was the best experience I've ever had. ""Having a gestational carrier was so special for us and she made our dreams of expanding our family come true."" The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star announced that her daughter was born at 12.47am on Monday and weighed 7lb 6oz. Meanwhile, a lawsuit filed by Blac Chyna against Kim Kardashian West and mother Kris Jenner has been ""tentatively"" dropped,according to TMZ,external. Blac Chyna, who has a daughter with Kim's brother Rob, was suing the pair after claiming they stopped the second series of E! show Rob & Chyna from being commissioned. The show documented the birth of their now one-year-old daughter Dream and was not renewed for another series. In December, lawyers for Jenner and the Kardashians filed for a dismissal of the lawsuit against them, which a judge has granted because there was no contract for the show's renewal.

"This video can not be played Bridge designer Ian Firth and engineering expert Dave Parker on whether a bridge is feasible. Downing Street has said there are ""no specific plans"" for a bridge between the UK and France after Boris Johnson floated the idea of a ""fixed link"". The UK foreign secretary reportedly ran the idea past French President Emmanuel Macron at a summit on Thursday. But Downing Street said he had been referring to a panel looking at Anglo-French major projects. Experts said a bridge was technically possible but some critics ridiculed the concept. Thursday's summit with Prime Minister Theresa May at Sandhurst's Royal Military Academy in Berkshire was Emmanuel Macron's first UK visit since becoming French president. UK and France sign Calais migrant treaty Smiling Macron and May pose for selfie The BBC understands Mr Johnson made the comments while discussing other major infrastructure projects around the world, including a bridge in Japan. Mr Johnson said in a tweet,externalthat the UK and France had agreed that a panel of experts should be assigned to look at ""major projects"". A source close to the foreign secretary said he also thought it was ""crazy"" the two countries were only connected by one railway line when they were merely 20 miles apart. Asked about the remarks, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""I haven't seen any plans on that. We are going to have very close ties with France economically, culturally and in areas such as defence and security for many many decades to come. ""What was agreed yesterday (Thursday) and what the foreign secretary tweeted about as well is a panel of experts who will look at major projects together, including infrastructure. And we want to work very closely with our French colleagues on building a shared, prosperous future."" Home Secretary Amber Rudd, on a visit to Crawley, West Sussex, was more forthright: ""I think I'm safe saying that I am not a huge fan of this latest proposal."" A spokesman for the French president confirmed he had had a conversation with Mr Johnson about a bridge and said Mr Macron had told him: ""The issue of access is an important one."" But he denied reports the French president had responded with ""I agree, let's do it"". It is not the first time the idea of a Channel bridge has been raised -transport officials submitted plans for one in 1981.,external The proposals were dismissed as ""impractical"" at the time, as it would make it difficult for ships to navigate the waters. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, bridge designer and former president of the Institution of Structural Engineers Ian Firth said it would be a ""huge undertaking, but absolutely possible"". But the idea was greeted with scepticism on social media. Labour's Emily Thornberrytweeted,externalthat she had assumed it was ""not real"". Â£47bn 'Boris Island' airport proposal was rejected Boris Buses:As mayor of London, Mr Johnson launched a competition in 2008 to design a new London bus to replace the iconic Routemaster. They hit the roads in 2012 but faced criticism over their cost, problems with their hybrid engines and non-opening windows. Transport for London have said they are not buying any more. Emirates Air Line:The Â£60m cable car over the Thames near the O2 Arena opened ahead of the London Olympics in 2012, again during Mr Johnson's tenure as London mayor.  He said it was an ideal way of linking north and south London but itfaced criticism over its cost and limited passenger numbers. Boris Island:Long backed by Mr Johnson as an alternative way of expanding airport provision in south-east England, the Â£47bn plan for an island airport in the Thames Estuary wasrejected as an optionby the commission looking into the issue in 2014. He had argued it could ""reshape the economic geography"" of south-east England. Garden Bridge:A Â£200m plan, backed by Mr Johnson, to build a bridge covered with trees over the River Thames in central Londonwas abandoned last year, having lost the support of his successor as mayor of London, Labour's Sadiq Khan. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke backed Mr Johnson's idea, saying: ""Boris is right. We absolutely must invest in infrastructure to keep trade flowing between Britain and France."" But former UKIP Nigel Farage told the BBC that the idea sounded like ""a big waste of money"". Former Lib Dem leader Sir Nick Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour the idea was ""a masterstroke in diversion"". ""It's all very well talking about a bridge that may or may not be built in decades to come.  The thing that worries me much more is he wants to pull up the drawbridge to the economic relationship which has served us so well over such a long period of time.""

"President Donald Trump has called off a trip to his Florida golf club this weekend until a deal can be struck The US government is approaching a federal shutdown after the Senate failed to agree on a new budget. It was unclear which way the vote would go as the midnight deadline approached, with Republicans and Democrats split on key issues. Despite last minute bipartisan meetings, the bill to fund the government until 16 February did not receive the required 60 votes. The last US shutdown happened in 2013 and lasted for 16 days. The House of Representatives voted 230-197 on Thursday night to extend funding until next month, but the measure failed to pass the Senate. Many government offices will close unless a compromise is found before the midnight deadline. If the shutdown goes ahead essential services will still run. That includes national security, post, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity production. National parks and monuments could face closure, which provoked an angry public reaction during the last shutdown. In the hours before the vote, President Donald Trump sounded pessimistic, tweeting that it was ""not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border"". He had invited Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, to the White House for last-ditch talks but they failed to find sufficient common ground. Emerging about an hour later, Mr Schumer told reporters ""some progress"" had been made, but a ""good number of disagreements"" remained, including a difference in opinion regarding the Democrats' desire to extend talks for another five days.

A sticking point has been the deportation threat hanging over more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children The main bone of contention has been Democrats' demands for more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children to be protected from deportation. These ""Dreamers"", as they are known, were granted temporary legal status under a programme established by former President Barack Obama. In September, Mr Trump announced he was ending the programme and allowing Congress until March to come up with a replacement. This video can not be played ""America is the only country I've known"" says this Dreamer The Republican president and congressional conservatives have been using the issue as a bargaining chip in an attempt to wring concessions from Democrats. Mr Trump wants funding for tough new border controls, including his proposed US-Mexico wall. Republicans have added to the bill a sweetener in the form of a six-year extension to a health insurance programme for children in lower-income families. They are essentially daring Democrats to vote against a measure that has been a longstanding liberal priority. But Democrats say they want this programme extended permanently. The legislative negotiations went up in flames last week after Mr Trump allegedly complainedthe US was letting in immigrants from certain ""shithole countries"". This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown The blame game is already in full swing with neither party wishing to be held accountable for closing the government as midterm elections loom in November. This would be the first shutdown while one party is in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, which could be politically embarrassing for Republicans. A new Washington Post-ABC poll,externalsuggests that by a 20-point margin more Americans blame President Trump and his party for the imbroglio, rather than Democrats. But a shutdown would also be problematic for 10 Democratic senators who are up for re-election this year in states won by Mr Trump. They would face voters this autumn amid a hail of attack ads claiming they closed the US government to help illegal immigrants. Be careful what you wish for, Mr Trump In a late-night speech on the Senate floor, top Republican Mitch McConnell accused Democrats of trying to ""hold the entire country hostage"". Mindful of the risks, Democrats have shifted their messaging in recent days to say their opposition is about much more than just immigration. Democrats hope to make it instead about the president and Republicans' ability to govern. Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen tweeted of Mr Trump: ""This man doesn't comprehend work ethic, the office of President, or duty to the country. He understands golf, ice cream, and Big Macs!"" US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said that over 50% of his department would not go to work, and some maintenance, training and intelligence operations would come to a halt. ""We do a lot of intelligence operations around the world and they cost money, these obviously would stop,"" Mr Mattis said when asked about the impending shutdown, ""it's got a huge morale impact.""

"YouTube says Logan Paul's ""punishment must fit the crime"" over a controversial vlog he uploaded onto the platform. Logan was criticised for joking about a dead body he had found ina Japanese forestknown for suicides. Speaking exclusively to Newsbeat, YouTube's chief business officer says the case was ""borderline"". It took 10 days for YouTube to admit the video shouldn't have been published. Although the platform had earlier said it ""prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner."" Logan removed the video two days after it had been put up, but by then it had been viewed more than five million times. ""We were trying to determine the right course of action, which is what took the time. And we decided that the video should come down,"" chief business officer Robert Kyncl told Newsbeat. Screengrab from the video posted by Logan Paul in Japan's Aokigahara forest YouTube was heavily criticised for featuring the video on its front page for 48 hours before doing anything about it. Kyncl says he understands the criticism. ""It was a borderline case in many different ways and it took us a while to work through it. ""We should have responded faster, but sometimes in these borderline cases it takes a bit longer to get to those decisions and that was the case here."" Logan Paul has apologised for the video and thinks that he deserves a second chance. The video was viewed more than five million times before being removed Kyncl doesn't necessarily agree. ""I'm not sure I would say it exactly that way - but I think you always want to make sure the punishment fits the crime. ""This is a very evolving ecosystem - so many times we face new things so we keep on evolving those very rapidly. ""You have to realise that many YouTube stars are young, they are very popular, they have large teams around them and we're all twice their age. ""It's easier and quicker for us to make decisions than it is for them. ""And it is our job to work with our creator community to make sure that they are consistently making the right decisions."" With 400 hours of video uploaded to the website every minute, YouTube has a lot to monitor. ""I think every time you grow larger and larger you always assume more responsibility,"" says Kyncl. ""We take all this very seriously - it's our top priority and it has been for the past year."" Kyncl says without technology YouTube couldn't deal with the volume of videos the site hosts. ""Algorithms have done the job of 180,000 people working 40 hours a week, dealing with controversial content. ""Then our people, whether that's our community vloggers or our employees, work through context which is harder for machines to discern.""

"Michael Douglas has said the claims are ""a complete lie"" A former employee of Michael Douglas has described how she says she was sexually harassed by the actor - more than a week after he issued a pre-emptive denial of the claims. Author and journalist Susan Braudy said Douglas's alleged treatment left her feeling ""humiliated"". Her claims include that he performed a sex act in front of her. The Hollywood star responded by saying: ""This is a complete lie, fabrication, no truth in it whatsoever."" His statement came 10 days beforeBraudy's allegations were published in The Hollywood Reporter,external. Douglas explained he ""felt the need to get ahead"" of the situation and share his concerns about the ""nightmare"" scenario. Braudy worked for Douglas's company Stonebridge Productions in the late 1980s. She claims he used sexual language in front of her, including openly discussing extra-marital affairs, while she was running the firm's New York office. Braudy also alleges that Douglas commented about her body, which made her then wear loose, dark clothing. She alleged he masturbated in front of her during a one-on-one script meeting in his apartment in 1989 and that she rushed out, feeling humiliated. ""I realised he thought he could do anything he wanted because he was so much more powerful than I was,"" she said, adding that she ran home and vowed to never be alone with him again. She finished working for him later that year. Susan Braudy said the #MeToo movement had helped her to come forward Douglas,who originally spoke to Deadline,external, said: ""I pride myself on my reputation in this business, not to mention the long history of my father and everything else. ""I don't have skeletons in my closet, or anyone else who's coming out or saying this. I'm bewildered why, after 32 years, this is coming out, now."" He also claimed there is no evidence against him and he feared that such accusations could set back the #MeToo movement that has grown in the wake of the Hollywood sexual harassment scandal. Douglas said: ""Being accused, without a chance [to defend yourself] in court. To not even really have the information in front of you, to be able to argue or defend yourself. ""There is no due process, no chance of seeing evidence in front of me from my accuser. It worries me."" Braudy told The Hollywood Reporter she was not surprised by the way Douglas had issued his denial. She claimed the manner in which he did so was ""part of the problem, as is his pretext of victimisation"". She added: ""These are some reasons why so many women don't come forward with their stories - Lord knows it's taken 30 years and a movement for me to gather my courage.""

"Matt is a 28-year-old nurse but he's decided to leave the profession, less than four years after qualifying. He's not alone.Figures given to the BBCfrom NHS Digital show that there are now more leavers than joiners to the profession. Nurse leaders said it was a ""dangerous and downward spiral"", but NHS bosses said the problem was being tackled. Matt has written a letter to his patients about why he's had to give up. ""To my patients. ""As a nurse, one of the joys of my job is working with a wide variety of patients, like yourselves. ""I enjoy talking to you all, talking to your relatives, getting to know you and hearing your stories. ""Meeting you on day one, when you come onto the ward, when you might be very poorly and feeling rubbish. ""When I make you feel better with the treatment I've given you, the goal of getting you to walk out feeling like a different person - it's so rewarding. ""Seeing that positive impact that I've had, on yourselves and your families, that is one of the big things that I'll really miss. ""The decision I have made was not an easy one, as my love for nursing and caring for people is difficult to put into words. ""However, I feel with the current situation of the NHS, now is the time to leave before the situation becomes any worse. ""It was after two weeks signed off with depression that discussions started between myself and my wife. ""We talked about how a change needs to be made and that the focus within the NHS is purely financial rather than the safety of patients and staff. ""With more and more cuts to budgets, all hospital staff, not just nurses, are being asked to pick up more and more responsibility. ""And this is without any prospect of recognition in the form of removing the pay cap for nurses. ""Coming into work every day filled me with dread. ""This was because I had to risk my job and personal reputation due to poor hospital trust management. ""Throughout my training and working within the NHS, every single nurse I have worked with would always go that extra mile to ensure the highest level of patient care is given. ""Often this meant working extra hours, staying late or working shifts. ""Unfortunately, this extra demand, from personal experience is both physically and mentally draining. ""It is with regret, and I am really sorry to you all, that I have to leave the NHS in the current situation that it is in. ""I do feel like I am abandoning you slightly, but I feel it is a change that needs to be made for people higher up, such as Jeremy Hunt, who need to see the scale that this problem is. ""But hopefully, one day, I will be able to return once the problem is sorted and continue to help build your futures as well as my own. ""Kind regards, Matt.""

Millennials may look back fondly to the heady days of the ultimate 20-something Manhattan lifestyle enjoyed by our favourite flatmates - Monica, Ross, Chandler, Joey, Rachel and Phoebe. But nearly a quarter of a century - yikes! - since it began, a new generation of fans are discovering the hit show for the first time on Netflix. And some of them are clearly finding it a bit uncomfortable. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Freelance writer James Baldock,who wrote about the Friends issue in Metro,external, told BBC News the backlash against Friends ""was inevitable"".

Writer Rebecca Reid toldBBC Radio 5 liveshe ""couldn't believe how badly it has aged"". ""The homophobia is staggering - the punchline of every joke about Ross is that his ex-wife is a lesbian, as if that's some failing of his and that it's hilarious that she's a lesbian. Will & Grace returned to TV screens last year ""The sexism's pretty rampant as well... [and] it's the whitest show in the whole world."" She did acknowledge, however, that ""she did sort of love it"". ""It's really dangerous to start looking at stuff that was written a long time ago through the lens of what we do now.""

More recent shows have also split opinion, such as Will & Grace. The show, which debuted in 1998 and was about the lives of a straight woman and her gay best friend, was groundbreaking at a time when you rarely saw gay characters on TV. But the sitcom, whichrecently returned to our TV screens, was alsocriticised for stereotyping.,external Fawlty Towers is still hugely popular Fawlty Towers - the 1970s sitcom was based in a rundown hotel in Torquay and starred John Cleese as Basil Fawlty. One of the show's best-known scenes featured Basil's argument with a group of German guests, during which he stresses: ""Don't mention the war!"" It wasrecently namedthe best British sitcom of all time in a survey of comedians and comedy writers and actors. In 2013, the BBC removed a scene from a re-run of an episode in which one of the characters, Major Gowen (Ballard Berkeley), made derogatory marks about the Indian cricket team. Love Thy Neighbour - this 70s series saw the main black character, Bill Reynolds, called racist names. Reynolds was played by Rudolph Walker, who became the first black actor to have a major part on prime-time television in the UK. He went on to play Patrick Trueman in EastEnders. It Ain't Half Hot Mum was based on the real experiences of co-creator Jimmy Perry with the Royal Artillery in Burma.Michael Bates, who played bearer Rangi Ram, was not ""blacked up"" but wore ""a light tan"", according to Perry,external, who also said telling fictional soldiers that they were ""a bunch of poofs"" was what Sergeant Majors did in the 1940s. It hasn't been shown since the 1990s. Baldock said: ""The issue is that there are a good many classic programmes that embody values and employ stereotypes that are no longer tolerated in our society [like] It Ain't Half Hot Mum - a programme I watched as a child, without ever once wondering why Michael Bates was covered in make-up. ""People get very twitchy about this now, and with good reason, but that's not in itself [a reason] to 'censor' these programmes - if anything they stand as decent historical archives explaining what the world was like. He added: ""Homophobia, racism and misogyny are not and have never been acceptable [but] if it's 20 years old, why on earth are you surprised if it's different? If it makes you uncomfortable, why on earth are you watching it?"" The Daily Star's TV critic, Mike Ward, agrees. Friends is now running on Netflix He told the BBC his reaction to the criticism of Friends was ""sigh and despair"". ""If you take it at face value and apply modern day sensibilities to it and look at it as someone who went out to make it in 2018, you would be shocked. ""We have to be grown up about this, we have to look at perspective and look at the context in which it was made. ""It's fine to say it's uncomfortable by today's standards but if you're not careful you look at the world from an insular, narrow perspective."" Ward says ""we're in such a sensitive era now"" with comedy. ""Friends has been on Comedy Central for ages, it's not as if someone's just found it and put it out there. I don't think it's caused any major harm. And the characters - by and large we were laughing at their ridiculousness. They're not role models."" Ward adds Fawlty Towers is one of his favourite shows. ""I'm not thinking, 'Wow, I'm laughing at it because it's racist - it's a long, long time ago, it's a different age. I'd like to think we're smart enough not to have to be protected as if things have never been different. ""And there's a bit of arrogance - thinking we're so perfect now. Not that I endorse the old attitudes, but I suspect if you fast forward 50 years into the future you could put people in front of the TV now and people will cringe as we do.""

"Ten months ago, thirty-something Jessica was eager to get pregnant. A series of relationships had failed so she tried a radically new approach - she posted an advert online. The outcome turned out to be far better than she had hoped. ""Safe, bareback babymaking,"" the advert read. ""I'm in my 30s & have given up on Messrs Right & Wrong. I want a baby."" The request was posted on Craigslist, a website better known for second-hand goods. The potential father needed to be over 5ft 9in, under 40 and prepared to take an STD test. He would also be required to have ""a few days of frequent sex"". Jessica makes no apology for her businesslike approach. ""Our grandparents didn't spend years and years cohabiting and watching boxsets,"" she says. ""Starting a family was very much the goal of their endeavour."" She'd also watched many of her friends start families after falling ""madly in love"", only to split up later in a cloud of angry recriminations. ""I decided I could sacrifice romantic fulfilment as long as my child had two parents who loved and cared for them,"" she says. She posted her advert on Craigslist while on a bus from her home in the suburbs into central London - and by the time she arrived at Oxford Street, she already had a number of replies. She set up a meeting with the most promising one that very evening. Jessica spoke to theEmma Barnett Showon BBC 5 live You canlisten again here(start at 38 minutes 50 seconds) A year earlier, Jessica had been in a long-term relationship with David. Like her, he wanted children... but he was in no rush. ""He was aimless. He wanted to wait until he felt better about his life and his career. You just think, 'Come on!'"" Jessica says. She had wanted children since she turned 30 and was envious of friends who were starting families. She was also shaken by a visit to her aunt in hospital. Her aunt didn't have children, and Jessica believed she had been ignored by doctors as there had been no-one to insist on better care. ""I thought there was a risk of me ending up in a similar situation if I had no kids of my own. They can act as insurance for when you get older."" She ended her relationship with David in March 2016 and almost immediately started dating her colleague, Scott. He was keen to have a baby, but after six months of trying they had nothing to show for it. So they went to a GP, who suggested blood tests - and while Jessica's results were clear, Scott's revealed a range of fertility issues. ""He didn't react well to the news and basically fell apart. I didn't feel I had the ability to support him through it,"" Jessica says. ""Also I didn't really want to go through IVF."" They split up after a make-or-break Christmas holiday in 2016. Jessica then spoke to a gynaecologist, who suggested artificial insemination using donor sperm. Jessica wanted her child to have a caring father, so she wasn't keen on the idea, but she discussed it with a friend anyway. ""She asked, 'Why would you spend Â£700 for sperm when you could go down to Yates's [wine bar] and find someone who would gladly give you it for free?'"" Jessica says. ""But I didn't want to go to a pub and have unprotected sex with someone who'd had no STD checks. I also didn't want to entrap someone into parenthood."" However, this prompted her to post an advert on a co-parenting website. Scrolling through the potential fathers, she came across quite a few married gay couples, but feared she'd lose out as one among three parents. ""I was worried a 50-50 split would soon become 70-30 in their favour,"" she says. She then started chatting to a single man on the website, until an insurmountable barrier got in the way - Brexit. ""He voted to leave Europe and I'm very much for remain,"" Jessica says. ""I said, 'I'm not really sure we can parent like this.'"" Jessica quit the website, which charged a monthly fee, and considered dating apps. But as a teacher she didn't want to post a photograph of herself. Then she thought about Craigslist. ""I didn't want to use a dating website or Tinder in case a student saw a picture of me. Plus I knew Craigslist got a lot of traffic and was free to use,"" she says. She typed out her advert on the bus to Oxford Street last March, and posted it in the personals section. ""I don't use turkey basters when cooking and am not using one at conception,"" one line read. ""God, it sounds completely crazy looking back,"" Jessica says. She didn't set many parameters for the potential father of her child, only height, age and sexual health. ""I just wanted to meet a good person with shared values,"" she says. She received a flurry of replies, including the obligatory slew of penis pictures. A number of men wrote claiming they had helped several women, which turned Jessica off. ""The last thing I needed was for my child to end up at a party and snog their sibling without knowing,"" Jessica says. Another young man wrote to say he was desperate for a baby after his previous partner had a miscarriage. Jessica felt he was too vulnerable. Then she received an email from Ross. ""He was 33 and also lived in London. He said he'd had some disastrous relationships but he loved being an uncle and wanted children of his own,"" Jessica says. They agreed to meet for drinks that evening. This video can not be played Jessica (voiced by an actress) tells Emma Barnett about her first meeting with Ross ""I thought he was much better-looking in person than the photo he sent,"" she says. They discovered they were of different faiths but agreed they wanted a ""London approach"" to religion. ""We agreed there was one God who loved pretty much everybody and we would want a child to be comfortable with people of any faith or no faith."" Jessica and Ross kissed at the end of their first meeting. ""I felt very comfortable around him,"" she says. A few days later they had dinner and arranged to have STD checks. After their fourth date they decided to have sex, to see if they were physically compatible. ""It was really good,"" Jessica says. ""We decided to start trying for a baby, knowing it could take a while."" But within weeks Jessica was holding a positive pregnancy test. She had conceived during her very next cycle. ""I found out I was pregnant about six weeks after I'd posted the advert,"" Jessica says. ""That was a bit of a surprise. It definitely wasn't what I had expected."" There hadn't even been time for Ross to get a sperm count. They didn't have a written contract but agreed they wouldn't sleep with anyone else. ""I didn't want to label what my relationship with Ross was,"" Jessica says. ""I was delighted I was pregnant but I was wary that might make me think I was in love with him."" Why don't I want to have sex with the man I love? Hollie McNish: The things new mothers aren't always told Why I chose to donate my eggs Ross was very involved during the pregnancy and accompanied Jessica to hospital appointments. It wasn't all plain sailing, though. They clashed about who got to keep the original ultrasound pictures and whether to spend money finding out the sex of the baby early. However, this led Jessica to an unexpected discovery. She had advertised for a father for her baby rather than a partner, but the quarrels made her realise that she actually had feelings for Ross. ""I realised being angry with him made me sad, as I did love him. ""But I was concerned that perhaps he was caring and attentive just because I was carrying his baby."" The couple told their parents Jessica was expecting a baby after the pregnancy had lasted 12 weeks, but didn't reveal how they had met. ""Our families get on well. It may be because there was a child involved but everyone was very accepting and tolerant of each other,"" Jessica says. Jessica had been living alone and Ross moved in two months before their baby was due. She had a Caesarean after her baby was found to be in a breech position, and spent a week recovering in hospital. ""Ross slept on a sleeping bag on the floor next to me the whole time. There was another dad there but he lasted one night before he said it was too uncomfortable and went home."" Having a newborn baby has left Jessica and Ross ""bone-achingly tired"". However, Jessica thinks that if anything their relationship has got stronger. ""We're coping and getting through it - maybe it's because we don't have the energy to argue!"" Jessica is on maternity leave and Ross can work some days from home. It means they share a lot of the parenting duties. ""It's great, when there is a particularly icky nappy, being able to hand the baby over to dad and say, 'This is yours,'"" Jessica says. The couple have now been together just under a year and parents for two months. They are still discovering new things about each other. ""Like the other day in a text conversation I found out he liked Billie Holiday,"" Jessica says. ""It's great when we get time together and we always have a meal when he gets back from work. We enjoy being together and it makes it easier raising a child."" They have already discussed having another. Jessica says she is pleased she went down an unconventional route to starting a family. ""I don't regret the advert,"" she says. ""I don't think you can get what you want by sitting there patiently and waiting for it to land in your lap.""

"A survey found it would cost Â£14,500 to repair the roof A rogue trader used gaffer tape to repair a leaky roof in a Â£6,000 botch job, a court heard. Jobie Newland convinced a Cambridge woman she needed urgent repairs to a flat roof after she had called him to get her gutters fixed in December 2015. She noticed leaking after the work was done, which continued despite Mr Newland and a labourer returning twice. Mr Newland, 28, of Malvern Road, Grays, Essex, admitted fraud and was given a nine-week suspended prison sentence. At Peterborough Magistrates' Court he was also ordered to do 120 hours unpaid work and pay Â£2,000 compensation. The woman had asked JKJ Property Services to fix her gutters in December 2015 A Trading Standards survey found the roof would have cost Â£14,500 to repair and the work ""was not carried out in accordance to the invoice"". When the woman rang Mr Newland for a third time to fix her leak she was unable to get hold of him so called in another roofer who showed her pictures of its condition. Cambridgeshire and Peterborough's head of Trading Standards, Peter Gell, urged people ""to be aware of rogue traders"".

"Pope Francis has angered victims of clerical sex abuse with his comments Pope Francis has triggered anger in Chile after accusing victims of a paedophile priest of slander. Francis said there was ""no proof"" for their claims that abuse by Father Fernando Karadima had been covered up by another man, Bishop Juan Barros. ""There is not one single piece of proof against him (Bishop Barros). It is all slander. Is that clear?"" the Pope said. One Karadima victim said the Pope's earlier plea for forgiveness over clerical sex abuse was ""empty"". The Pope made his comments on Thursday before celebrating Mass outside the city of Iquique in northern Chile. ""The day someone brings me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will talk,"" the Pope told journalists. The Catholic Church suffered a body blow in Chile in 2010 when Father Karadima was publicly accused of molesting several teenaged boys in the capital, Santiago, starting in the 1980s. In 2011 the Vatican found him guilty of abusing teenage boys and sentenced him to a lifetime of  ""penance and prayer"". He never faced criminal prosecution in Chile as too much time had passed, butthe judge who heard victims' testimony in a year-long investigation described them as ""truthful and reliable"". Why Pope's trip to Chile is a challenge Protesters challenge Pope on Church sex abuse Chile churches attacked before Pope visit Juan Carlos Cruz, one of the accusers, says Bishop Barros was present when Father Karadima - then the bishop's mentor - kissed and groped him and another boy. While Bishop Barros has not been accused of abuse, the Pope has been criticised for appointing him bishop of Osorno in 2015.Barros's installation ceremony had to be cut short over protests in the cathedral. Mr Cruz was one of the bishop's accusers who was quick to condemn the Pope's stance. ""As if I could have taken a selfie or photo while Karadima abused me and others with Juan Barros standing next to him watching everything,"" he tweeted. ""These people are absolutely crazy, and @Pontifex (the Pope's Twitter handle) is talking about reparation to the victims. Nothing has changed, and his plea for forgiveness is empty."" Bishop of Osorno, Juan Barros, denies allegations he covered up his mentor's abuse of boys Another Barros accuser, James Hamilton, told a news conference the response revealed an ""unknown face"" of the pontiff. ""What the Pope has done today is offensive and painful, and not only against us, but against everyone seeking to end the abuses,"" he said. Analysis by James Reynolds in Rome Pope Francis began his trip with an uncompromising message: ""It is right to ask for forgiveness and to make every effort to support the victims [of abuse committed by priests]."" This makes his subsequent dismissal of claims made against Bishop Juan Barros all the more difficult for victims to understand. At the heart of this issue lies the Pope's decision to offer his consistent support to the bishop. In 2015, despite opposition in Chile, Francis appointed Juan Barros as the Bishop of Osorno. The Pope was then recorded telling visitors to the Vatican that there was not a shred of evidence that the bishop had covered up crimes committed by a fellow priest. On his trip to Chile, Francis repeated this blunt defence of Juan Barros. In legal terms, the burden of proof does not lie with the Pope or his bishop to prove the bishop's innocence. But a papacy is also judged in other ways. Some will wonder why the Pope does not offer a more detailed explanation as to exactly why he chooses to believe and defend a bishop against the cover-up allegations made by victims in Chile. The controversy comes at a time when questions are being asked about the Vatican's efforts to tackle clerical sexual abuse. In 2014, the Pope set up a high-profile commission to advise him. But the two commission members who were themselves survivors of clerical abuse resigned in protest at an apparent lack of progress. At the end of 2017, the commission's term formally expired. Its exact future is unclear. Another senior Catholic figure in Chile, Bishop Alejandro Goic of Rancagua, criticised Bishop Barros's continuing role in the Church, telling T13 radio:  ""It left me with a bitter taste that a brother of mine occupied a leading role [in the abuse scandal] that was not good."" He added: ""The victims are the priority, they should be the main concern of the Church."" The state co-ordinator for the Pope's visit to Chile, Benito Baranda, told Radio Cooperativa that Bishop Barros ""should have stopped being a bishop a long time ago"" and that his presence was damaging the Church. Writing in La Tercera newspaper, journalist Ascanio Cavallo said the Pope's stance could ""multiply the wrath"" of those who want to see the bishop expelled from his post, but added: ""There is no longer any doubt: the Pope supports his bishop. The Pope travelled to Peru after leaving Chile Earlier in his Chile trip, Francis had met victims of sexual abuse by priests in the country.He cried with them and said he felt ""pain and shame"" over the scandal. The US-based NGO Bishop Accountability says almost 80 members of Catholic clergy have been accused of child sex abuse in Chile since 2000. Pope Francis arrived in Peru late on Thursdayfor a three-day visit which will conclude his two-nation South America trip.

"This video can not be played Cancer blood test shows promise but more research is needed, says Prof Richard Marais Scientists have taken a step towards one of the biggest goals in medicine - a universal blood test for cancer. A team at Johns Hopkins University has trialled a method that detects eight common forms of the disease. Their vision is an annual test designed to catch cancer early and save lives. UK experts said it was ""enormously exciting"". However, one said more work was needed to assess the test's effectiveness at detecting early-stage cancers. Tumours release tiny traces of their mutated DNA and proteins they make into the bloodstream. 'Exciting' blood test spots cancer a year early Blood tests spot ovarian cancer early Prostate cancer blood test 'helps target treatment' The CancerSEEK test looks for mutations in 16 genes that regularly arise in cancer and eight proteins that are often released. It was trialled on 1,005 patients with cancers in the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, oesophagus, colon, lung or breast that had not yet spread to other tissues. Overall, the test found 70% of the cancers. Dr Cristian Tomasetti, from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told the BBC: ""This field of early detection is critical. ""I think this can have an enormous impact on cancer mortality."" The earlier a cancer is found, the greater the chance of being able to treat it. Five of the eight cancers investigated have no screening programmes for early detection. In some cases, the test also provided information about the tissue-of-origin of the cancer - but not all. Pancreatic cancer has so few symptoms and is detected so late thatfour in five patients die in the year they are diagnosed,external. Finding tumours when they could still be surgically removed would be ""a night and day difference"" for survival, said Dr Tomasetti. CancerSEEK is now being trialled in people who have not been diagnosed with cancer, which will be the real test of its usefulness. The hope is it can complement other screening tools such as mammograms for breast cancer and colonoscopies for colorectal cancer. Dr Tomasetti said: ""We envision a blood test we could use once a year."" The CancerSEEK test, reported in the journalScience,external, is novel because it hunts for both the mutated DNA and the proteins. Increasing the number of mutations and proteins being analysed would allow it to test for a wider range of cancers. Dr Gert Attard, team leader in the Centre for Evolution and Cancer at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, and consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, told the BBC: ""This is of massive potential. Breast cancer can be detected by the new test ""I'm enormously excited. This is the Holy Grail - a blood test to diagnose cancer without all the other procedures like scans or colonoscopy."" He said ""we're very close"" to using blood tests to screen for cancer as ""we have the technology"". But he cautioned there was still uncertainty about what to do when a cancer was diagnosed. In some cases, the treatment may be worse than living with a cancer that is not immediately life-threatening. Men can already have slow growing prostate cancers closely monitored rather than treated. ""When we detect cancer in a different way, we can't take for granted that everyone will need treatment,"" Dr Attard said. Prof Richard Marais, from Cancer Research UK, said it would take time to prove that it worked as an early diagnosis for cancer - at least five to six years. ""Detecting cancer early, before the disease has spread is one of the most powerful ways to improve cancer survival and this interesting research is a step towards being able to do this earlier than is currently possible."" Paul Pharoah, professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Cambridge, said more work was needed to assess how the test performs when cancers are less advanced. He said: ""Demonstrating that a test can detect advanced cancers does not mean that the test will be useful in detecting early stage symptomatic cancer, much less pre-symptomatic cancer.  The sensitivity for the stage 1 cancers in the study was only 40%."" And Dr Mangesh Thorat from the Centre for Cancer Prevention, Queen Mary University of London, said it looked promising ""but with several caveats"" ""A significant amount of further research is needed before we can even contemplate how this might play out in screening settings,"" he said. ""This is only a case-control study, and therefore needs further evaluation in large cohorts more representative of general population where such screening might be introduced."" The cost of CancerSEEK is less than $500 (Â£360) per patient, which is around the same price as a colonoscopy. Follow James ontwitter,external.

"Coca-Cola has announced a pledge to recycle a used bottle or can for every one the company sells by 2030. Calling it a ""massive global ambition"" the firm admitted its part in littering the environment and a responsibility to tackle the problem. The company, which markets 500 brands of fizzy drink, juices and water, will also work towards making all of its packaging recyclable worldwide. Greenpeace said Coca-Cola should focus on reducing, not recycling, waste. Coca Cola announced its ""World Without Waste"" campaign by acknowledging that food and drink companies were responsible for much of the rise in litter on streets, beaches and in the oceans worldwide. ""The world has a packaging problem - and, like all companies, we have a responsibility to help solve it,"" Coca-Cola chief executive James Quincey said in a statement. The firm also said it subscribed to the idea of a ""circular economy"" where resources such as aluminium, plastic and glass are re-used rather than disposed of. As well as the well-known Coke brand, the firm markets dozens of other juices, sodas and teas including Fanta, Schweppes, Smartwater and Appletiser. How plastic changed the world Plastic recycling: Your questions answered Smaller bottles of Coca Cola to cost more ""We believe every package - regardless of where it comes from - has value and life beyond its initial use,"" Mr Quincey said. ""If something can be recycled, it should be recycled. So we want to help people everywhere understand how to do their part."" The firm said it was working to increase the recycled content in the materials it uses to make its drinks bottles, developing plant-based resins and reducing the plastics used in packaging. It will also invest in educating consumers on best recycling practice in their community, the firm said. Greenpeace welcomed Coca-Cola's move to increase the amount of recycled content in plastic bottles from ""a paltry 7%"" to 50% by 2030, the campaign group said it was unambitious compared to a commitment from Coke UK to do that by 2020. However, ina blog,externalaccompanying the announcement, Mr Quincey also defended the use of bottles and packaging more generally. ""It's tempting to romanticise a world without packaging. To assume that if we get rid of plastic bottles and cans that life will be better. For animals, for humans, for our planet,"" he wrote. ""This mistakenly ignores all the good they can do. Modern food and beverage containers help reduce food spoilage and waste. They limit the spread of disease. They can help save lives,"" he wrote. The UK government is considering introducing a deposit scheme for plastic drinks bottles. Coca-Cola's announcement made no mention of deposit schemes but in the past theUK arm of the company has said it would support the ideaas long as the scheme was UK-wide. Tisha Brown, Oceans Campaigner for Greenpeace UK, said Coca-Cola's plan had ""fallen flat"" when it came to cutting down on waste plastic. ""A litter free world is possible - but only if big companies like Coke stop producing ever growing quantities of plastic litter. They need to reduce and reuse as well as recycle,"" said Ms Brown.

"President Donald Trump has called off a trip to his Florida golf club this weekend until a deal can be struck The US government is approaching a federal shutdown after the Senate failed to agree on a new budget. It was unclear which way the vote would go as the midnight deadline approached, with Republicans and Democrats split on key issues. Despite last minute bipartisan meetings, the bill to fund the government until 16 February did not receive the required 60 votes. The last US shutdown happened in 2013 and lasted for 16 days. The House of Representatives voted 230-197 on Thursday night to extend funding until next month, but the measure failed to pass the Senate. Many government offices will close unless a compromise is found before the midnight deadline. If the shutdown goes ahead essential services will still run. That includes national security, post, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity production. National parks and monuments could face closure, which provoked an angry public reaction during the last shutdown. In the hours before the vote, President Donald Trump sounded pessimistic, tweeting that it was ""not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border"". He had invited Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer, a fellow New Yorker, to the White House for last-ditch talks but they failed to find sufficient common ground. Emerging about an hour later, Mr Schumer told reporters ""some progress"" had been made, but a ""good number of disagreements"" remained, including a difference in opinion regarding the Democrats' desire to extend talks for another five days.

A sticking point has been the deportation threat hanging over more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children The main bone of contention has been Democrats' demands for more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children to be protected from deportation. These ""Dreamers"", as they are known, were granted temporary legal status under a programme established by former President Barack Obama. In September, Mr Trump announced he was ending the programme and allowing Congress until March to come up with a replacement. This video can not be played ""America is the only country I've known"" says this Dreamer The Republican president and congressional conservatives have been using the issue as a bargaining chip in an attempt to wring concessions from Democrats. Mr Trump wants funding for tough new border controls, including his proposed US-Mexico wall. Republicans have added to the bill a sweetener in the form of a six-year extension to a health insurance programme for children in lower-income families. They are essentially daring Democrats to vote against a measure that has been a longstanding liberal priority. But Democrats say they want this programme extended permanently. The legislative negotiations went up in flames last week after Mr Trump allegedly complainedthe US was letting in immigrants from certain ""shithole countries"". This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown The blame game is already in full swing with neither party wishing to be held accountable for closing the government as midterm elections loom in November. This would be the first shutdown while one party is in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, which could be politically embarrassing for Republicans. A new Washington Post-ABC poll,externalsuggests that by a 20-point margin more Americans blame President Trump and his party for the imbroglio, rather than Democrats. But a shutdown would also be problematic for 10 Democratic senators who are up for re-election this year in states won by Mr Trump. They would face voters this autumn amid a hail of attack ads claiming they closed the US government to help illegal immigrants. Be careful what you wish for, Mr Trump In a late-night speech on the Senate floor, top Republican Mitch McConnell accused Democrats of trying to ""hold the entire country hostage"". Mindful of the risks, Democrats have shifted their messaging in recent days to say their opposition is about much more than just immigration. Democrats hope to make it instead about the president and Republicans' ability to govern. Tennessee Democrat Steve Cohen tweeted of Mr Trump: ""This man doesn't comprehend work ethic, the office of President, or duty to the country. He understands golf, ice cream, and Big Macs!"" US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said that over 50% of his department would not go to work, and some maintenance, training and intelligence operations would come to a halt. ""We do a lot of intelligence operations around the world and they cost money, these obviously would stop,"" Mr Mattis said when asked about the impending shutdown, ""it's got a huge morale impact.""

"A British-born former land-speed record-holder has died in a helicopter crash in the US state of New Mexico. Charles Burnett III, aged 61,was killed alongside a prominent Zimbabwean politician, Roy Bennett, Mr Bennett's wife Heather, and co-pilots Jamie Coleman Dodd and Paul Cobb. Mr Cobb's daughter Andra, who was Mr Burnett's long-term partner, survived the crash with serious injuries. Mr Burnett, based in Houston, had set a number of records on land and water. His most notable achievement came in August 2009, when he was the driver of a British-built vehicle that achieved an average speed of 139.8mph to smash the world record for steam-powered cars. Before his successful attempt - which took place in California - the record had remained unbroken for 103 years - and Mr Burnett's car was famously nicknamed the ""fastest kettle in the world"". The editor of Guinness World Records, Craig Glenday, said he was ""shocked and saddened"" to hear of Mr Burnett's death, saying he ""played an important role in what was to become a pioneering moment for the British Steam Car team"". ""Charles clearly embodied passion,"" he added. Roy Bennett, who has opposed former Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe, also died in the crash Giving details of the fatal helicopter crash, New Mexico police said they had launched a frantic search when Ms Cobb called the emergency number but could not give her location. They confirmed in a statement that the helicopter's wreckage was found burning on a rancher's property east of the city of Raton.

"The inquest into the death of Cranberries singer Dolores O'Riordan has been adjourned while the coroner awaits the results of ""various tests"". The inquest, at Westminster Coroner's Court, has been adjourned until 3 April. The singerdied suddenly on 15 January aged 46. The Irish musician, originally from Limerick, led the band to international success in the 90s with singles including Linger and Zombie. Dolores O'Riordan performing on stage in 1994 Coroner's officer Stephen Earl said: ""This lady was staying at a hotel in central London when she was found unresponsive in her room. ""The London Ambulance Service was contacted and verified her death at the scene. ""Subsequently the Met Police attended and theydetermined the death to be non-suspicious."" He added that a post-mortem examination had been carried out and the court is ""awaiting results of various tests that have been commissioned"". Dolores O'Riordan: Voice of a rebel The tragedy that inspired Zombie Asia's enduring love for The Cranberries A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said earlier this week that the police were called to a hotel in Park Lane at 09:05 GMT on Monday, where ""a woman in her mid-40s"" was pronounced dead at the scene. The parish priest from her home town Friarstown in Limerick said her funeral would take place in Ireland. ""The plan is for her to be buried here at home. When that will be will depend on when her body is released,"" he said. The Cranberries shot to international fame with their 1993 debut album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? and went on to sell over 40 million records worldwide. The singer had been keen to return to the stage In 2017 the band announced a tour including dates in Europe, the UK and the US. However, in May - shortly into the European tour - the group had to cancel the remainder of the European dates as a result of O'Riordan's health issues. The official Cranberries website cited ""medical reasons associated with a back problem"" that prevented O'Riordan from performing. But just before Christmas, the singer posted on Facebook saying she was ""feeling good"" and had done her ""first bit of gigging in months"", leading fans to believe she would soon be on tour again.

"Malware in messaging apps has been stealing data from activists, lawyers and military personnel A security bug that has infected thousands of smartphones has been uncovered by campaign group the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF). Working with mobile security firm Lookout, researchers discovered that malware in fake messaging designed to look like WhatsApp and Signal had stolen gigabytes of data. Targets included military personnel, activists, journalists and lawyers. Researchers say they traced the malware to a Lebanese government building. The threat, dubbed Dark Caracal by the researchers, looks as if it could come from a nation state and appears to use shared infrastructure linked to other nation-state hackers,the report said.,external The malware takes advantage of known exploits and targets mainly Android phones. Data was traced back to a server in a building belonging to the Lebanese General Security Directorate in Beirut, according to researchers. ""Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the GDGS is associated with or directly supporting the actors behind Dark Caracal,"" the report said. ""People in the US, Canada, Germany, Lebanon, and France have been hit by Dark Caracal. Targets include military personnel, activists, journalists, and lawyers, and the types of stolen data range from call records and audio recordings to documents and photos,"" said EFF director of cybersecurity Eva Galperin. ""This is a very large, global campaign, focused on mobile devices. Mobile is the future of spying, because phones are full of so much data about a person's day-to-day life."" Mike Murray, vice-president of security intelligence at Lookout said: ""Dark Caracal is part of a trend we've seen mounting over the past year whereby traditional advanced persistent threat actors are moving toward using mobile as a primary target platform."" In a statement published on the Lookout blog, Google said it was confident that the infected apps were not downloaded from its Play Store. ""Google has identified the apps associated with this actor, none of the apps were on the Google Play Store. Google Play Protect has been updated to protect user devices from these apps and is in the process of removing them from all affected devices."" The researchers believe Dark Caracal has been operating since 2012 but it has been hard to track because of the diversity of seemingly unrelated espionage campaigns originating from the same domain names. Over the years Dark Caracal's work has been repeatedly misattributed to other cybercrime groups, the researchers said. In November, Afghanistan moved to ban WhatsApp and Telegram as a way to stop insurgent groups from using encrypted messaging. And in December, Iran moved to restrict use of the apps after a series of anti-establishment protests. Use of an app that can steal data would give nation states much more information than simply banning them, said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey. ""It is always hard to prove that a nation state is involved. During the Cold War, countries made use of mercenaries and that's what we are seeing online now."" He said it was unclear where the infected apps had been downloaded from. ""Google is saying that they were not downloaded from there but it is difficult to know where else they came from. It may be that people are getting suckered into something that looks like an official site. People need to be careful what they are downloading.""

"YouTube says Logan Paul's ""punishment must fit the crime"" over a controversial vlog he uploaded onto the platform. Logan was criticised for joking about a dead body he had found ina Japanese forestknown for suicides. Speaking exclusively to Newsbeat, YouTube's chief business officer says the case was ""borderline"". It took 10 days for YouTube to admit the video shouldn't have been published. Although the platform had earlier said it ""prohibits violent or gory content posted in a shocking, sensational or disrespectful manner."" Logan removed the video two days after it had been put up, but by then it had been viewed more than five million times. ""We were trying to determine the right course of action, which is what took the time. And we decided that the video should come down,"" chief business officer Robert Kyncl told Newsbeat. Screengrab from the video posted by Logan Paul in Japan's Aokigahara forest YouTube was heavily criticised for featuring the video on its front page for 48 hours before doing anything about it. Kyncl says he understands the criticism. ""It was a borderline case in many different ways and it took us a while to work through it. ""We should have responded faster, but sometimes in these borderline cases it takes a bit longer to get to those decisions and that was the case here."" Logan Paul has apologised for the video and thinks that he deserves a second chance. The video was viewed more than five million times before being removed Kyncl doesn't necessarily agree. ""I'm not sure I would say it exactly that way - but I think you always want to make sure the punishment fits the crime. ""This is a very evolving ecosystem - so many times we face new things so we keep on evolving those very rapidly. ""You have to realise that many YouTube stars are young, they are very popular, they have large teams around them and we're all twice their age.

On her first day as opposition leader, Ms Ardern was controversially asked by a TV talk show host whether she had made ""a choice between having babies and having a career"". Ms Ardern replied that such a question was ""totally unacceptable in 2017"". ""It is a woman's decision about when they choose to have children and it should not predetermine whether or not they are given a job or have job opportunities,"" she said.

"Asda and Aldi are to ban the sale of energy drinks to children under 16 from early March. The move comes after Waitroseannounced that customers buying drinks after 5 March could be asked to show ID. Asda has become the first of the ""big four"" supermarkets to announce an age limit, which will apply to 84 high-caffeine drinks, also from 5 March. Aldi will apply it to soft drinks containing 150mg of caffeine per litre from 1 March. The move follows calls by campaigners for a complete ban on energy drinks, and it comes weeks after MP Maria Caulfieldasked Prime Minister Theresa May to consider a UK-wide ban. Both retailers cited the growing concerns about the effect of energy drinks on young people as a key motive in introducing the ban. Oliver King, Aldi's managing director of corporate responsibility, said: ""We are introducing this age restriction in response to growing concern about the consumption of energy drinks among young people."" Asda's chief customer officer Andrew Murray said the retailer was working hard to ""ensure we get the balance right between offering choice and doing the right thing"". He added: ""We have listened to our customers and want to take a leading position in this area to support parents and teachers in limiting young people's access to high caffeine drinks."" The NASUWT teaching union, which called forschools to ban energy drinks from their premisesin December 2017, said they were pleased with Asda and Aldi's decision. General secretary Chris Keates said: ""We hope this will continue the momentum for our campaign to see concerted action to regulate sales [of energy drinks]."" She added: ""The very high levels of caffeine and sugar these drinks contain impact adversely on pupil behaviour in schools and teachers are left to deal with the fallout. ""There is a chronic lack of awareness about the effects and long-term health impacts of these drinks which many pupils and parents think are just another soft drink."" Celebrity chefJamie Oliver is also among those who have campaigned for age restrictionsto prevent young children drinking energy drinks excessively. He responded enthusiastically to Asda and Aldi's decisions, saying they ""have done the right thing"" and urging other supermarkets to follow. Allow Twitter content?

"Adolescence now lasts from the ages of 10 to 24, although it used to be thought to end at 19, scientists say. Young people continuing their education for longer, as well as delayed marriage and parenthood, has pushed back popular perceptions of when adulthood begins. Changing the definition is vital to ensure laws stay appropriate, they write in an opinion piece in theLancet Child & Adolescent Health,externaljournal. But another expert warns doing so risks ""further infantilising young people"". Puberty is considered to start when the part of the brain known as the hypothalamus starts releasing a hormone that activates the body's pituitary and gonadal glands. This used to happen around the age of 14 but has dropped with improved health and nutrition in much of the developed world to around the age of 10. As a consequence, in industrialised countries such as the UK the average age for a girl's first menstruation has dropped by four years in the past 150 years. Half of all females now have their period by 12 or 13 years of age. There are also biological arguments for why the definition of adolescence should be extended, including that the body continues to develop. For example, the brain continues to mature beyond the age of 20, working faster and more efficiently. And many people's wisdom teeth don't come through until the age of 25. Young people are also getting married and having children later. According to theOffice of National Statistics,external, the average age for a man to enter their first marriage in 2013 was 32.5 years and 30.6 years for women across England and Wales. This represented an increase of almost eight years since 1973. Lead author Prof Susan Sawyer, director of the centre for adolescent health at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, writes: ""Although many adult legal privileges start at age 18 years, the adoption of adult roles and responsibilities generally occurs later."" She says delayed partnering, parenting and economic independence means the ""semi-dependency"" that characterises adolescence has expanded. This social change, she says, needs to inform policy, such as by extending youth support services until the age of 25. ""Age definitions are always arbitrary"", she writes, but ""our current definition of adolescence is overly restricted"". ""The ages of 10-24 years are a better fit with the development of adolescents nowadays."" Prof Russell Viner, president-elect of the Royal College of Paediatrics & Child Health, said: ""In the UK, the average age for leaving home is now around 25 years for both men and women."" He supports extending the definition to cover adolescence up until the age of 24 and says a number of UK services already take this into account. He said: ""Statutory provision in England in terms of social care for care leavers and children with special educational needs now goes up to 24 years,"" as does provision of services for people with cystic fibrosis. But Dr Jan Macvarish, a parenting sociologist at the University of Kent, says there is a danger in extending our concept of adolescence. ""Older children and young people are shaped far more significantly by society's expectations of them than by their intrinsic biological growth,"" she said. ""There is nothing inevitably infantilising about spending your early 20s in higher education or experimenting in the world of work."" And we should not risk ""pathologising their desire for independence"". ""Society should maintain the highest possible expectations of the next generation,"" Dr Macvarish said. Prof Viner disagrees with Dr Macvarish's criticism and says broadening adolescence can be seen as ""empowering young people by recognising their differences"". ""As long as we do this from a position of recognising young people's strengths and the potential of their development, rather than being focused on the problems of the adolescent period.""

"Help offered by the banks to firms left high and dry by Carillion's collapse is no more than a ""sticking plaster"" solution, industry representatives say. Business Secretary Greg Clark has said support from a government-led task force and the banks will ""maximise continuity"" for small businesses. But Mike Cherry from the Federation of Small Businesses said it was unlikely to be enough for most contractors. Up to 30,000 smaller firms may be owed money by Carillion. Carillion, which operated projects from cleaning prisons to building roads, went into liquidation on Monday with about Â£1.5bn of debt. The construction giant directly employed 20,000 workers in the UK, and much of its work was contracted out to smaller operators, many of whom are waiting to see if they will paid for work completed in recent weeks and months. Six charts that explain what happened 'I've got a fiver left to my name' How do companies win government contracts? Three banks have said they will provide Â£225m to provide ""tailored support"" for small business customers, including capital repayment holidays on loans, help with fees and increases in overdraft limits. But Mr Cherry said the support did not go far enough. ""It is only going to be a sticking plaster to help those who are viable to continue in business and recover in time,"" he told the BBC. ""We all need to understand that it is very unlikely - as in any administration or liquidation - that those who have already invoiced Carillion up to the announcement on Monday are going to get anything out of this at all."" Business Secretary Greg Clark told the BBC that the question of whether firms would receive money owed for work they had completed on contract for Carillion ""was a question for the Official Receiver"". Build UK which represents workers in the construction industry, estimates that up to 30,000 businesses are owed money by the collapsed construction firm. However Mr Clark declined to confirm the number. ""There's an exercise going on, quite rightly constructively, to make sure that all of the contractors are identified, that they are given the assistance from the banks which has been very important, but also since most of these contracts were profitable, that they can be re-assigned and they can continue."" Mr Lee says the government is ""woefully failing"" people working on public projects Josh Lee, joint founder of Ashby-De-La-Zouch-based Larc Construction says Carillion's collapse has wiped out everything he's ever worked for. He has already laid off 15 of his 20 staff and says he has been left in limbo waiting to see whether any of the Â£200,000 the firm is owed by Carillion will be forthcoming. He says the banks' offer of support to businesses like his is ""not very useful"" since it effectively extends lending which he doesn't want on his business' books. ""It's digging us deeper in the hole. We need helping out of the hole,"" he says. Larc Construction has been working on the Midland Metropolitan Hospital in Birmingham. The firm was told to stop work on Monday and has had to leave equipment on site even though they are paying Â£14,000 a week to hire it. Mr Lee, a 30-year-old former soldier, says the firm hasn't been paid for the work done in November, December and January. The business, which was operating on a Â£1.5m turnover last year, is now looking for new contracts. ""The government is woefully failing people like me who were working on public projects,"" he told the BBC.

"The inquest into the death of Cranberries singer Dolores O'Riordan has been adjourned while the coroner awaits the results of ""various tests"". The inquest, at Westminster Coroner's Court, has been adjourned until 3 April. The singerdied suddenly on 15 January aged 46. The Irish musician, originally from Limerick, led the band to international success in the 90s with singles including Linger and Zombie. Dolores O'Riordan performing on stage in 1994 Coroner's officer Stephen Earl said: ""This lady was staying at a hotel in central London when she was found unresponsive in her room. ""The London Ambulance Service was contacted and verified her death at the scene. ""Subsequently the Met Police attended and theydetermined the death to be non-suspicious."" He added that a post-mortem examination had been carried out and the court is ""awaiting results of various tests that have been commissioned"". Dolores O'Riordan: Voice of a rebel The tragedy that inspired Zombie Asia's enduring love for The Cranberries A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said earlier this week that the police were called to a hotel in Park Lane at 09:05 GMT on Monday, where ""a woman in her mid-40s"" was pronounced dead at the scene. The parish priest from her home town Friarstown in Limerick said her funeral would take place in Ireland. ""The plan is for her to be buried here at home. When that will be will depend on when her body is released,"" he said. The Cranberries shot to international fame with their 1993 debut album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? and went on to sell over 40 million records worldwide. The singer had been keen to return to the stage In 2017 the band announced a tour including dates in Europe, the UK and the US. However, in May - shortly into the European tour - the group had to cancel the remainder of the European dates as a result of O'Riordan's health issues. The official Cranberries website cited ""medical reasons associated with a back problem"" that prevented O'Riordan from performing. But just before Christmas, the singer posted on Facebook saying she was ""feeling good"" and had done her ""first bit of gigging in months"", leading fans to believe she would soon be on tour again.

"Many girls in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Colombia and Indonesia aspired to be a doctor Young people in developing countries often have more aspirational career ambitions than boys in the UK, an international survey suggests. While boys in the UK aimed to be footballers or YouTube stars, their counterparts in Uganda and Zambia wanted to be doctors or teachers. The findings are from asurvey of 20,000 children,externalby the Education and Employers careers charity. The results are to be presented to business leaders at Davos next week. The study asked primary school children, aged seven to 11, in 20 countries to draw pictures of the jobs they wanted to have when they grew up. The careers charity said the results showed how much gender stereotypes were established from an early age. In the UK, girls were much less likely to want to become engineers or scientists. Teaching was one of the most sought after jobs in many countries But jobs such as nurse, dancer and hairdresser were among their top 10 ambitions. And boys were more likely to want to have jobs such as airline pilot and mechanic. Girls' top choices were more focused on academic success - with jobs such as teacher, vet and doctor among the most popular. By contrast, boys seemed to be much more influenced by popular culture, with jobs such as sportsman, working in social media or the police. In terms of social mobility, the charity said the survey showed young people needed to be introduced to different types of careers at an early age. Girls in more deprived schools were more likely to want to be shop workers and beauty therapists, while better-off boys wanted to be managers and lawyers. Boys were more likely to want to be scientists and engineers Outside of the UK, the drawings often showed high aspirations despite hardship. In Uganda and the Philippines, girls most want to be teachers. In Pakistan, Bangladesh, Colombia and Indonesia they want to be doctors. In China, the most popular career ambition for boys is a scientist. In China, being a chef was named as a popular job But across both the UK and international findings, there was a huge mismatch between the reality of the jobs market and the expectations of young people. And the charity said this misalignment remained a problem for older pupils, with a lack of advice available about what skills were really going to be in demand. ""Careers counselling in secondary schools comes far too late,"" said the OECD's education director, Andreas Schleicher. ""It is clear from the drawings that children arrive in school with strong assumptions based on their own day-to-day experiences,"" said Mr Schleicher. Vets were a popular choice for a job, particularly for girls ""The findings have implications for all of us seeking to improve social mobility,"" said David Cruickshank, global chairman of Deloitte and chair of trustees for Education and Employers. ""Children's career aspirations are most influenced by who they know,"" he said. Anne Lyons, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, said it showed how hard it was for young people to ""break the mould"" of their families' expectations. Nick Chambers, chief executive of Education and Employers, said it showed the need for children in primary school to hear about the ""vast range of career options open to them and are not ruling things out at an early age"".

"Shares in floor coverings specialist Carpetright have plunged 40% after it warned that full-year profits would be much less than expected. It blamed the profit alert on a ""sharp deterioration"" in UK trade, with sales in the key post-Christmas period ""significantly behind expectations"". Carpetright now expects profits to be between Â£2m and Â£6m,external, compared with analysts' estimates of about Â£14m. In the 11 weeks to 13 January, like-for-like sales fell 3.6% in the UK. With official data released on Friday confirming 2017 as the weakest year for UK retail since 2013, Carpetright's profit alert will add to concerns that consumers plan to rein in spending this year. The company's fortunes are closely tied to the strength of the UK housing market. Matt Walton: senior retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Carpetright's profit warning is the latest indication that big-ticket retailers had a tough end to 2017, after Multiyork and Feather & Black fell into administration."" In Carpetright's core flooring business, like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of store openings and closures - have fallen 7.1% since Christmas. The company has more than 400 stores across the UK and also has more than 100 outlets outside the UK, in Belgium, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland, making it the biggest floor covering chain in Europe. Carpetright chief executive Wilf Walsh said: ""We have seen a significant deterioration in UK trading during the important post-Christmas trading period. ""While average transaction values were up year-on-year, the number of customer transactions since Christmas were sharply down."" In December, Carpetright had said it expected profits to be at the ""bottom end"" of expectations amid a ""volatile and unpredictable"" consumer market. Neil Wilson from ETX Capital, said: ""Profits warnings rarely come alone and so it has proved with Carpetright's shocker today. As we noted in December, the guidance appeared like wishful thinking and so it turned out to be the case. ""Again it's the same old story as with other brands that have failed to adapt to changing consumer trends."" Carpetright's figures weakened shares in some other retailers, with DFS Furniture down 3.8% and home improvement chain Kingfisher 3% lower at midday.

"This video can not be played David Turpin (R) and his wife Louise Turpin (L) deny charges of torture The parents accused of holding their 13 children in shackles at a California home have pleaded not guilty. David Turpin, 56, and Louise Turpin, 49, are facing charges of torture, abuse and false imprisonment. They were arrested after one daughter escaped from their home, where police later found some siblings chained to beds and severely malnourished. The couple appeared in court hours after prosecutors detailed the horrific abuse allegations against them. Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said the couple had allegedly punished their children by tying them up - first using ropes and later chaining them to their beds with padlocks. He said the alleged punishments would last weeks or months, and intensified over time. The 'happy family' charged with torture Prosecutors said circumstantial evidence showed the children were not released from their chains to go to the toilet. The teenager who escaped and alerted police to the house where her siblings were held captive had been hatching a plan to leave for two years, Mr Hestrin added. He detailed some of the gruesome allegations against the parents at a news conference on Thursday. The children were accustomed to frequent beatings, including strangulation They were only allowed one shower a year The children would stay awake all night until going to sleep at four or five in the morning and slept during the day They were not allowed to play with any toys but many were found inside the house in their original packaging If the children washed their hands above the wrist they were subjected to punishments, allegedly accused of ""playing with water"" The Turpin parents allowed their children to eat only one meal a day but the parents would sometimes buy food, like pumpkin pies, and place it where the children could see it but not eat it They have never seen a dentist and haven't visited a doctor in over four years The children lack basic knowledge of life, and did not know who a police officer was This video can not be played Shackled siblings: What we know about their lives James Cook, BBC News, Riverside, California This case has sent waves of revulsion across the US and beyond, and the small courtroom was packed as the defendants appeared. David and Louise Turpin were smartly dressed. They occasionally glanced at each other across a table weighed down by a copy of the California penal code and a sheaf of paper related to the case against them. A lawyer sat between them. Mr Turpin, with a distinctive mop of grey hair, was chained around the waist, his stomach protruding from beneath the metal links. His wife's mouth was turned down in a glum expression. The couple spoke only briefly and softly to confirm that they understood and accepted procedural details relating to their next hearing. The charges they deny are among the most serious any parent could face: amounting to a grievous betrayal of their own children, a betrayal which prosecutors allege went on for years, if not decades. The siblings themselves are said to be doing well but at least some of them have almost certainly suffered irreparable damage, both physical and mental from their ordeal. The children, who are aged between two and 29 , have been treated in hospital since being freed on Monday. The two-year-old was of normal weight but the other children were severely malnourished, authorities said. The 12-year-old weighed as much as an average seven-year-old and the 29-year-old weighed only 82lb (37kg). Several of the children have cognitive impairment and ""neuropathy, which is nerve damage, as a result of this extreme and prolonged physical abuse"", Mr Hestrin said. District Attorney Mike Hestrin said the couple chained their children as a form of punishment Though little is known about their education, some of the children were able to read and write.Mr Turpin also registered a private school in their California home, known as Sandcastle Day School. Police have obtained hundreds of journals that the children were allowed to write in and are looking through them for evidence. Before moving to California, the family lived in Texas. At one point, the parents allegedly lived in a different house from their children and would drop off food from time to time, officials said. If found guilty of the dozens of charges against them, the couple face 94 years to life in prison, Mr Hestrin added. Mr Turpin also faces one count of ""lewd act on a child under 14 years of age"". Can anyone open a school at home in California? The 13 children were found in an emaciated state in their filthy, foul-smelling house, police revealed earlier. Officers had at first thought all the children were minors but later realised some were frail and malnourished adults, they said. Mr Hestrin said that when officers arrived, three of the couple's children were chained to their beds. 12 counts of torture 1 count against David Turpin of a lewd act on a child 7 counts of abuse against a dependent adult 6 counts of child abuse/neglect 12 counts of false imprisonment Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"UK retail sales fell by 1.5% in December compared with November, the biggest monthly fall since the EU referendum, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,externalmany shoppers had shifted spending to November to take advantage of Black Friday offers. It comes as Carpetright and clothing chain Bonmarche were the latest retailers to report a tough Christmas. A squeeze on consumer spending also led to a difficult December for UK shops. Debenhams, Marks and Spencer, House of Fraser, and Mothercare were among the other High Street retailers which reported a decline in sales. Inflation has been outstripping increases in wages, denting the spending power of shoppers. Carpetright shares crash on profit warning Inflation rate falls back to 3% Christmas shopping: The winners and losers For 2017 as a whole, the quantity bought increased by 1.9%, which was the lowest annual growth since 2013. This picture was underlined on Friday when trading updates from Carpetright and clothing chain Bonmarche unsettled investors enough to prompt big share price falls. Carpetright issued a profit warning amid a ""sharp deterioration"" in UK trade, sending its shares down by almost a half. Bonmarche shares sank by a quarter after it said like-for-like sales at its stores dropped nearly 10% in the last three months of 2017. It's always tricky looking at one month's set of retail figures. Although December saw a bigger than expected dip than the previous month, it's been clear for some time that the pattern of Christmas spending is changing. Black Friday has been hugely disruptive, bringing forward consumer spending that would otherwise have taken place in the traditional month of December. So that's had a knock-on effect on today's figures. The British Retail Consortium's recent figures posted a bit of month-on-month growth but for a clearer sense of the underlying trend, you need to look at retail sales over a longer period. Perhaps the most interesting statistic in today's data is the slowing growth between the fourth quarter of 2017 and the previous one. In other words, a disappointing end to a tough year for retailers. The ONS said that the trend towards online spending was continuing, and that almost one in five pounds was now spent online. It also predicted that retail sales would contribute almost nothing to economic growth in the last three months of 2017. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit, said: ""The data add to signs that rising prices and stubbornly weak pay growth continue to erode consumer spending power and will act as a drag on the economy in 2018."" The 1.5% monthly decline in retail sales volume in December was the biggest since June 2016, according to the ONS. Ben Brettell, senior economist, at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said that year-on-year retail sales rose by 1.4% in December, but that was lower than the 3% jump predicted by analysts. ""But there could be some light at the end of the tunnel,"" he added, amid signs that wage growth is picking up and inflation may have peaked.

"Doctors have spotted cancer coming back up to a year before normal scans in an ""exciting"" discovery. The UK team was able to scour the blood for signs of cancer while it was just a tiny cluster of cells invisible to X-ray or CT scans. It should allow doctors to hit the tumour earlier and increase the chances of a cure. They also have new ideas for drugs after finding how unstable DNA fuels rampant cancer development. The research project was on lung cancer, but the processes studied are so fundamental that they should apply across all cancer types. Lung cancer kills more people than any other type of tumour and the point of the study is to track how it can ""evolve"" into a killer that spreads through the body. In order to test for cancer coming back, doctors need to know what to look for. In the trial, funded by Cancer Research UK, samples were taken from the lung tumour when it was removed during surgery. A team at the Francis Crick Institute, in London, then analysed the tumour's defective DNA to build up a genetic fingerprint of each patient's cancer. Then blood tests were taken every three months after the surgery to see if tiny traces of cancer DNA re-emerged. The results, outlinedin the journal Nature,external, showed cancer recurrence could be detected up to a year before any other method available to medicine. The tumours are thought to have a volume of just 0.3 cubic millimetres when the blood test catches them. Dr Christopher Abbosh, from the UCL Cancer Institute, said: ""We can identify patients to treat even if they have no clinical signs of disease, and also monitor how well therapies are working. ""This represents new hope for combating lung cancer relapse following surgery, which occurs in up to half of all patients."" So far, it has been an early warning system for 13 out of 14 patients whose illness recurred, as well as giving others an all-clear. In theory, it should be easier to kill the cancer while it is still tiny rather than after it has grown and become visible again. However, this needs testing. Prof Charles Swanton, from the Francis Crick Institute, told the BBC: ""We can now set up clinical trials to ask the fundamental question - if you treat people's disease when there's no evidence of cancer on a CT scan or a chest X-ray can we increase the cure rate? ""We hope that by treating the disease when there are very few cells in the body that we'll be able to increase the chance of curing a patient."" Janet Maitland, 65, from London, is one of the patients taking part in the trial. She has watched lung cancer take the life of her husband and was diagnosed herself last year. She told the BBC: ""It was my worst nightmare getting lung cancer, and it was like my worse nightmare came true, so I was devastated and terrified."" But she had the cancer removed and now doctors say she has a 75% chance of being cancer-free in five years. ""It's like going from terror to joy, from thinking that I was never going to get better to feeling like a miracle's been acted,"" she said. And taking part in a trial that should improve the chances for patients in the future is a huge comfort for her. ""I feel very privileged,"" she added. The blood test is actually the second breakthrough in the massive project to deepen understanding of lung cancer. A bigger analysis, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed the key factor - genetic instability - that predicted whether the cancer would return. Multiple samples from 100 patients containing 4.5 trillion base pairs of DNA were analysed. DNA is packaged up into sets of chromosomes containing thousands of genetic instructions. The team at the Francis Crick Institute showed tumours with more ""chromosomal chaos"" - the ability to readily reshuffle large amounts of their DNA to alter thousands of genetic instructions - were those most likely to come back. Prof Charles Swanton, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: ""You've got a system in place where a cancer cell can alter its behaviour very rapidly by gaining or losing whole chromosomes or parts of chromosomes. ""It is evolution on steroids."" That allows the tumour to develop resistance to drugs, the ability to hide from the immune system or the skills to move to other tissues in the body. The first implication of the research is for drug development - by understanding the key role of chromosomal instability, scientists can find ways to stop it. Prof Swanton told me: ""I hope we'll be able to generate new approaches to limit it and bring evolution back from the brink, perhaps reduce the evolutionary capacity of tumours and hopefully stop them adapting. ""It's exciting on multiple levels."" The scientists say they are only scratching the surface of what can be achieved by analysing the DNA of cancers.

"Blood tests could help target precision drugs at the right people with cancer Scientists have developed a blood test that could pick out which men with advanced prostate cancer would benefit from a new drug treatment. The test detects cancer DNA in the blood, helping doctors check whether precision drugs are working. Cancer Research UK said the test could ""greatly improve survival"". But larger studies involving more men needed to take place to confirm if doctors could rely on the test, the charity said. Blood samples from 49 men with advanced prostate cancer were collected by researchers, as part of the phase II clinical trial of a drug called olaparib. This type of precision drug is seen as the future of cancer medicine but because it is a targeted treatment, the drug does not work for everyone. Researchers from The Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust said the test could help target treatment better and also reduce its side effects. They used it to identify men who were not responding to the treatment in four to eight weeks and also to pick up signs that the cancer was evolving and becoming resistant to the drugs. Prof Johann de Bono, consultant medical oncologist at the two organisations, said: ""From these findings, we were able to develop a powerful, three-in-one test that could in future be used to help doctors select treatment, check whether it is working and monitor the cancer in the longer term."" He added: ""Not only could the test have a major impact on treatment of prostate cancer, but it could also be adapted to open up the possibility of precision medicine to patients with other types of cancer."" Dr Aine McCarthy, senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said the blood test was an ""exciting"" development. ""The test has the potential to greatly improve survival for the disease by ensuring patients get the right treatment for them at the right time and that they aren't being given a treatment that's no longer working,"" she said. ""Further studies involving a larger group of men will confirm if doctors should use this test when treating patients with advanced prostate cancer."" Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Over 46,000 men are diagnosed with the disease every year in the UK. Dr Matthew Hobbs, from Prostate Cancer UK, said: ""The results from this study and others like it are crucial as they give an important understanding of the factors that drive certain prostate cancers, or make them vulnerable to specific treatments.""

"Caroline Presho took part in the trial and believes the blood test would be an enormous benefit to women A blood test every four months could help women at high-risk of ovarian cancer find tumours early, say doctors. There is currently no screening programme for the disease, so high-risk women are advised to have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed. In the trial on 4,348 women, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, cancers were detected earlier, when they should be easier to treat. However, it is not yet clear if the regular blood test would save lives. Breast and ovarian cancer runs in Caroline Presho's family. The 43-year-old, from Hertfordshire, has inherited a genetic flaw called BRCA2. ""I'm a bit of a rubbish mutant,"" she told the BBC News website. ""I say it's like the X-Men, but I have the ability to develop cancer."" NHS Choices: Ovarian cancer,external Ms Presho was advised to have surgery to reduce risk, but having the ovaries and tubes removed starts the menopause. She said: ""I was always going to have surgery, but the screening allowed me to finish having my family, and I didn't want to go through the menopause at 35. ""It's very young and starting that early has a detrimental effect on cognitive function, bone and heart health."" Without screening, the only other option would be to keep an eye out for symptoms including: feeling constantly bloated a swollen stomach discomfort in the stomach or pelvic area feeling full quickly when eating, or loss of appetite needing to urinate more often or more urgently than normal About two in every 100 women will develop ovarian cancer at some point in their life. But the study focused on women, like Caroline, who faced a greater than one-in-10 chance. The trial, at 42 centres across the UK, monitored levels of a chemical called CA125 in women's blood. Three times a year, doctors tracked changes in the levels of CA125, which is produced by ovarian tissue, to see if levels became elevated - a sign of cancer. The women also had annual scans, and surgery if doctors thought cancer was likely. Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide, with about 240,000 cases each year During three years of screening and the year after the last test, 19 cancers were detected. Ten of them were at an early stage. In the five years after that, 18 more ovarian cancers were detected. But now only one of them was at an early stage. The key principle of all cancer treatment is the earlier the tumour is found, the better the chances are of survival. And screening was finding them earlier. However, the study has not been running for long enough to know if the screening saves lives. While screening does detect cancer, tumours are far less likely to develop in the first place if women have surgery. Prof Usha Menon, one of the researchers and a professor of gynaecological cancer from UCL, said: ""What we're trying to do is get women to have surgery. But she told the BBC News website: ""From my point of view, women really struggle with this issue of menopause, and it seems like four-monthly screening is better than symptom awareness. ""The screening definitely picks up less advanced disease, but we cannot say for sure if we're saving lives."" Previous trials haveproduced insufficient evidencefor mass screening of all women. And in the US, the Food and Drug Administrationrecently recommended,external""against using currently offered tests to screen for ovarian cancer"", including ones looking at CA125. One potential issue is having a blood test could put women off surgery. ""This is what everyone's worried about,"" says Prof Menon. However, she pointed out there was already an issue with women delaying surgery. She wants UK health officials to review screening and all other advice to high-risk women. Caroline Presho had her fourth and last child - ""I know I'm a lunatic,"" she says - in the same year as she eventually had surgery. She told the BBC: ""I think it's a very exciting prospect to have screening. ""You're told to have children before 35, but you might not have settled down or found a partner. ""It's just so stressful to feel like you've got a deadline and the only option is surgery, I think it would be an enormous benefit."" About 3% of women are in the high-risk category like Caroline. Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of The Eve Appeal, which part-funded the trial, said: ""This research gives women hope and confidence that there is an evidence-based approach to screening if they decide to delay risk-reducing surgery."" Annwen Jones, the chief executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said: ""An effective screening programme for women at high risk of ovarian cancer due to family history would potentially have a major impact on mortality and survival from this disease. ""[But] it is still uncertain whether detecting ovarian cancer by screening increases the chance of a woman surviving the disease overall. ""Women at a higher risk of ovarian cancer still need to weigh up the risks and benefits of surveillance versus preventative surgery."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

"Passengers say flight staff briefed them on emergency procedures A Malaysia Airlines flight was forced to divert to central Australia after a technical issue left the aircraft ""shuddering"", passengers say. Flight MH122 was travelling from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday when it turned back not far from Broome, in Australia's north-west. The plane, carrying 224 people, landed safely at Alice Springs Airport at 17:48 local time (06:48 GMT). There had been ""a loud bang"" from the left hand engine, the airline said. ""This was followed by a warning indicator which appeared on the electronic aircraft monitoring system,"" the company said in a statement. ""The captain then requested for the cabin crew to prepare for a normal landing."" Passengers on board said the plane had been shaking and making loud noises. Earlier, Malaysia Airlines identified the problem only as ""a technical fault on one of the aircraft's engines"" - but said the plane's safety was not compromised at any point. Passenger Sanjeev Pandev said the plane, which was an Airbus A330-300, appeared to have a problem about four hours into the flight. ""It was shaking and vibrating and the noise was getting louder and louder"" he told the BBC. ""Some people were praying and people had tears in their eyes. It was a really terrifying moment."" He said passengers were taken through emergency procedures by staff, some of whom appeared ""nervous and terrified themselves"". Malaysia Airlines, however, said there was ""no chaos reported in the cabin"". The plane was forced to land at Alice Springs Airport Another passenger praised the pilot for landing safely.

Prof Graham Braithwaite, an expert in aviation safety at Cranfield University, said it is possible one of the engine's blades was damaged. ""You've got a very large fan that is spinning in a jet engine like this,"" he said. ""Some of these blades are spinning around, and some are fixed."" ""If one of these comes off, it'll make a thumping great noise - then you've got this fan spinning around unevenly."" Such damage can be caused by many things - including a manufacturing defect, or a piece of debris or a bird being sucked into the engine. But the danger to passengers is small, since ""the engines will generally cope with this sort of stuff"", he said. Modern jet engines are also so reliable that planes can fly safely on one engine for an extended period of time. ""The likelihood of a mechanical engine failure is so remote that the chances of another happening on the other engine is extremely unusual,"" Prof Braithwaite said. Malaysia Airlines said safety remained its top priority. The group's CEO, Izham Ismail, apologised to customers for ""the anxiety experienced."" ""I thank all crew onboard for managing the situation by the book and in the calmest way possible,"" he said. Passengers were being accommodated at nearby hotels before boarding a new flight on Friday, he added. In June,an AirAsia X flight bound for Kuala Lumpur was also forced to turn backto Australia after an engine problem left it shaking. AirAsia X did not give details about the technical issue behind the incident, but said the safety of passengers was its ""utmost priority"".

The UK foreign secretary reportedly ran the idea past French President Emmanuel Macron at a summit on Thursday. But Downing Street said he had been referring to a panel looking at Anglo-French major projects. Experts said a bridge was technically possible but some critics ridiculed the concept. Thursday's summit with Prime Minister Theresa May at Sandhurst's Royal Military Academy in Berkshire was Emmanuel Macron's first UK visit since becoming French president.

A source close to the foreign secretary said he also thought it was ""crazy"" the two countries were only connected by one railway line when they were merely 20 miles apart. Asked about the remarks, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""I haven't seen any plans on that. We are going to have very close ties with France economically, culturally and in areas such as defence and security for many many decades to come. ""What was agreed yesterday (Thursday) and what the foreign secretary tweeted about as well is a panel of experts who will look at major projects together, including infrastructure. And we want to work very closely with our French colleagues on building a shared, prosperous future."" Home Secretary Amber Rudd, on a visit to Crawley, West Sussex, was more forthright: ""I think I'm safe saying that I am not a huge fan of this latest proposal."" A spokesman for the French president confirmed he had had a conversation with Mr Johnson about a bridge and said Mr Macron had told him: ""The issue of access is an important one."" But he denied reports the French president had responded with ""I agree, let's do it"". It is not the first time the idea of a Channel bridge has been raised -transport officials submitted plans for one in 1981.,external The proposals were dismissed as ""impractical"" at the time, as it would make it difficult for ships to navigate the waters. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, bridge designer and former president of the Institution of Structural Engineers Ian Firth said it would be a ""huge undertaking, but absolutely possible"". But the idea was greeted with scepticism on social media. Labour's Emily Thornberrytweeted,externalthat she had assumed it was ""not real"". Â£47bn 'Boris Island' airport proposal was rejected Boris Buses:As mayor of London, Mr Johnson launched a competition in 2008 to design a new London bus to replace the iconic Routemaster. They hit the roads in 2012 but faced criticism over their cost, problems with their hybrid engines and non-opening windows. Transport for London have said they are not buying any more. Emirates Air Line:The Â£60m cable car over the Thames near the O2 Arena opened ahead of the London Olympics in 2012, again during Mr Johnson's tenure as London mayor.  He said it was an ideal way of linking north and south London but itfaced criticism over its cost and limited passenger numbers. Boris Island:Long backed by Mr Johnson as an alternative way of expanding airport provision in south-east England, the Â£47bn plan for an island airport in the Thames Estuary wasrejected as an optionby the commission looking into the issue in 2014. He had argued it could ""reshape the economic geography"" of south-east England. Garden Bridge:A Â£200m plan, backed by Mr Johnson, to build a bridge covered with trees over the River Thames in central Londonwas abandoned last year, having lost the support of his successor as mayor of London, Labour's Sadiq Khan. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke backed Mr Johnson's idea, saying: ""Boris is right. We absolutely must invest in infrastructure to keep trade flowing between Britain and France."" But former UKIP Nigel Farage told the BBC that the idea sounded like ""a big waste of money"". Former Lib Dem leader Sir Nick Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour the idea was ""a masterstroke in diversion"". ""It's all very well talking about a bridge that may or may not be built in decades to come.  The thing that worries me much more is he wants to pull up the drawbridge to the economic relationship which has served us so well over such a long period of time."" Conservative MP Mark Pritchard was not a fan of the idea, tweeting it was ""a bridge too far"": Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Which? says the plans could lead to ""mass closures"" of ATMs Plans to shake-up the UK's ATM network may leave many remote areas with little or no access to cash, consumer group Which? has warned. Link - which manages the network - says there are too many cash machines in places where they are not needed. Which? said it could lead to ""mass closures"" of free-to-use machines. According to the consumer group, more than 200 communities in Britain already have poor ATM provision, or no cash machines at all. It said 123 postcode districts did not appear to contain a single ATM, making many consumers reliant on access in nearby villages or towns. Link says the number of free-to-use ATMs has grown markedly Examples include: Postcode district PE32 in Norfolk (which has a population of 15,300) TA7 in Somerset (14,980) TN27 in Kent (12,400) NR16 in Norfolk (11,950) and YO13 in North Yorkshire (10,110). Gareth Shaw of Which? said: ""Link's proposals could place a strain on communities across the UK that are already struggling to access the cash they need following mass [High Street] bank closures. ""The financial regulator must intervene to avoid this situation getting worse."" He said that those hit hardest would not be busy high streets, but ATMs in rural communities. Link says it wants to lower its fees to card issuers by 20% over the next four years, from 25p to 20p per transaction. This would make it less profitable to run an ATM in many areas. However, it says there are too many cash machines in places where they are not needed, with around 80% located within 300 metres of other ATMs. It said the number of free-to-use machines had rocketed from 36,400 in 2007 to 54,950 last year. John Howells, chief executive at Link, said: ""The UK has one of the largest free-to-use ATM networks anywhere in the world, and the number of free ATMs is at an all-time high and rising. ""We welcome the research produced by Which? and will review all of the areas that it has identified and take action if there is inadequate free ATM provision."" He said the organisation would protect free-to-use ATMs that are a kilometre or more from the next nearest free cash machine. It plans to extend its Financial Inclusion Programme, which subsidises ATMs in less affluent and rural communities.

"The inquest into the death of Cranberries singer Dolores O'Riordan has been adjourned while the coroner awaits the results of ""various tests"". The inquest, at Westminster Coroner's Court, has been adjourned until 3 April. The singerdied suddenly on 15 January aged 46. The Irish musician, originally from Limerick, led the band to international success in the 90s with singles including Linger and Zombie. Dolores O'Riordan performing on stage in 1994 Coroner's officer Stephen Earl said: ""This lady was staying at a hotel in central London when she was found unresponsive in her room. ""The London Ambulance Service was contacted and verified her death at the scene. ""Subsequently the Met Police attended and theydetermined the death to be non-suspicious."" He added that a post-mortem examination had been carried out and the court is ""awaiting results of various tests that have been commissioned"". Dolores O'Riordan: Voice of a rebel The tragedy that inspired Zombie Asia's enduring love for The Cranberries A Metropolitan Police spokesperson said earlier this week that the police were called to a hotel in Park Lane at 09:05 GMT on Monday, where ""a woman in her mid-40s"" was pronounced dead at the scene. The parish priest from her home town Friarstown in Limerick said her funeral would take place in Ireland. ""The plan is for her to be buried here at home. When that will be will depend on when her body is released,"" he said. The Cranberries shot to international fame with their 1993 debut album Everybody Else Is Doing It, So Why Can't We? and went on to sell over 40 million records worldwide. The singer had been keen to return to the stage In 2017 the band announced a tour including dates in Europe, the UK and the US. However, in May - shortly into the European tour - the group had to cancel the remainder of the European dates as a result of O'Riordan's health issues. The official Cranberries website cited ""medical reasons associated with a back problem"" that prevented O'Riordan from performing. But just before Christmas, the singer posted on Facebook saying she was ""feeling good"" and had done her ""first bit of gigging in months"", leading fans to believe she would soon be on tour again.

"Poor care at Liverpool jail means mentally ill prisoners are put at substantial risk, says a healthcare review Severely ill inmates at Liverpool prison often wait days to be seen due to poor mental healthcare and a lack of staff, a senior psychiatrist has said. In a letter seen by BBC News, Dr Andrew Forrester, a consultant at Lancashire Care, told the trust the shortfall was causing a ""substantial clinical risk"". Separately, a review of the prison published on Friday said conditions were the worst inspectors had seen. HM Prison and Probation Service said there had been ""a failure on our part."" Lancashire Care, which runs healthcare at the prison, said it had spent significant sums on staffing. However, in a statement the trust added that it had found it impossible to recruit enough staff. In his analysis of healthcare at the prison, carried out for Lancashire Care, Dr Forrester said there was a ""gross under-supply of psychiatry"". While highlighting the shortage of staff, the consultant in forensic psychiatry said: ""There are major deficits in the areas of clinical psychology, social work and occupational therapy."" The lack of a system to properly process patients meant that ""acutely mentally ill patients who are admitted to the inpatient unit often wait for many days to be seen, potentially compromising their safety"", he added. Details of his analysis - dated 20 December and released to the BBC under Freedom of Information rules - come to light two months afterthe BBC reported patients at the prison were dying because of healthcare errors. What went wrong for 'Britain's worst jail'? Since 2011, there have been 17 suicides at Liverpool prison, including three in 2017 - one of the highest totals for England according to the Howard League for Penal Reform. Dr Forrester, who has given evidence to Parliamentary committees on mental health provision in prisons, concluded that while he had worked in many ""difficult"" prisons, including Belmarsh and Wandsworth in London, ""the arrangements I have encountered at HMP Liverpool and their apparent resistance to remediation, are more concerning than in any other place where I have ever worked"". His assessment was written weeks after inspectors from HM Inspectorate of Prisons visited the crumbling Victorian prison. This video can not be played Peter Clarke, Chief inspector of prisons, criticises management of prisons ""at all levels"" In their review, which is published on Friday,but which was leaked to the BBC last month,inspectors found the jail, which houses around 1,100 inmates, was infested with rats and cockroaches. The prison authorities, and the broader prison service, are severely criticised in their review for allowing ""squalid"" conditions to develop at the prison. Dr Forrester's analysis is contained in a tranche of documents seen by the BBC. Other details from the papers demonstrate a fractured and dysfunctional relationship between Lancashire Care and the prison leadership, including: In July, a medic urged the trust to close the healthcare unit because of the refusal of the prison to provide officers to protect healthcare staff during medication rounds. In lieu of staff, the prison suggested nurses wear body cameras, a recommendation rejected by the trust. Healthcare staff were regularly overruled by prison authorities on which men were placed in the inpatient unit, with some sent there despite having no healthcare needs. This meant the unit was often unable to take prisoners who genuinely needed to be there. Maintenance problems with the contractor, Amey, meant the healthcare unit was regularly described as posing an infection risk, because of broken sinks, damaged cells and deeply embedded grime. Lancashire Care is leaving its contract when it expires in March and the BBC understands no other healthcare provider has bid to replace it. In its statement, Lancashire Care said: ""Whilst the level of psychiatry input in Liverpool prison is below the Royal College requirements, it is comparable to their prisons in the north-west [of England]. ""However, the experience of some clinicians would suggest that compared to the south, it is low."" On its difficulty staffing the unit, the trust said it ""had exhausted all available options to mitigate this"". ""Lancashire Care has been proactive in trying to recruit staff to the prison and has spent an additional significant amount of money on agency staff; this is not clinically or financially sustainable."" Speaking on the Today programme, the head of HM Prison and Probation Service, Michael Spurr, said the system had been under pressure, but acknowledged that the service ""should have acted much earlier"". He added: ""I absolutely accept that that was a failure on our part, but it is in the context of a system that has been under a lot of pressure for a number of years."" The Ministry of Justice said HMP Liverpool had hired a ""significant"" number of new officers and that the prison was ""now fully staffed"". A Ministry spokesman added that a joint health and social care improvement board was set up in November to oversee the healthcare action plan for the jail and is ""urgently looking at how to improve the running of healthcare services"".

"The Nancy Glen TT100 in Loch Fyne in June 2015 A major search for two fishermen missing after their boat capsized in Loch Fyne in Argyll and Bute has been scaled back. The alarm was raised by a third man who was pulled from the water by the crew of a passing boat on Thursday evening. Despite efforts of those on scene to keep it afloat, the 40ft Nancy Glenn TT100 fishing vessel sank. Lifeboats, a coastguard helicopter and rescue teams, as well as local boats, have been searching for the men. The operation has now been scaled back and further efforts will resume in the morning. Searches continued on Friday after the boat sank north of Tarbert Julie-Anne Wood, head of maritime operations for HM Coastguard, said: ""Sadly we have been unable to locate the two missing fishermen. ""Our thoughts are with all those involved."" Insp Julie McLeish added: ""We are in regular contact with the missing men's families. ""It is a very distressing time for them and the local community as a whole. ""The search will continue until dark tonight and will resume again at first light tomorrow."" The Marine Accident Investigations Branch has started an investigation. Tighnabruaich, Arran and Campbeltown RNLI Lifeboats were sent to the sea loch, alongside the HM Coastguard Prestwick helicopter and Coastguard Rescue Teams from Tarbert, Kames, Inverary and Crinan. Jonathan Hart, coastguard area commander, said the searches covered a significant area On Thursday evening, a remotely-operated underwater vehicle was used to investigate the fishing vessel on the sea floor. However, the operation was hampered by poor visibility. Campbeltown RNLI Lifeboat was out all night on Thursday searching for the missing men. It is understood the entire Tarbert fishing fleet has also been helping with the search efforts. A spokesman for Tarbert and North Kintyre Churches said: ""This is a close-knit fishing community and everyone is absolutely devastated by what has happened. ""The Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland are working closely with Matthew Ramsay of the Fishermen's Mission in Argyll to support the community and the emergency services personnel involved in the search operation. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this heart breaking incident."" The rescued fisherman was taken to Mid Argyll Hospital in Lochgilphead The man pulled from the water was transferred to Mid Argyll Community Hospital in Lochgilphead, where staff describe his condition as stable. Police and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) are carrying out a joint investigation to establish what caused the incident.

The Marine Accident Investigations Branch has started an investigation. Tighnabruaich, Arran and Campbeltown RNLI Lifeboats were sent to the sea loch, alongside the HM Coastguard Prestwick helicopter and Coastguard Rescue Teams from Tarbert, Kames, Inverary and Crinan. Jonathan Hart, coastguard area commander, said the searches covered a significant area On Thursday evening, a remotely-operated underwater vehicle was used to investigate the fishing vessel on the sea floor. However, the operation was hampered by poor visibility. Campbeltown RNLI Lifeboat was out all night on Thursday searching for the missing men. It is understood the entire Tarbert fishing fleet has also been helping with the search efforts. A spokesman for Tarbert and North Kintyre Churches said: ""This is a close-knit fishing community and everyone is absolutely devastated by what has happened. ""The Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland are working closely with Matthew Ramsay of the Fishermen's Mission in Argyll to support the community and the emergency services personnel involved in the search operation. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this heart breaking incident."" The rescued fisherman was taken to Mid Argyll Hospital in Lochgilphead The man pulled from the water was transferred to Mid Argyll Community Hospital in Lochgilphead, where staff describe his condition as stable. Police and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) are carrying out a joint investigation to establish what caused the incident. Earlier Jonathan Hart, area commander for the coastguard, told BBC Scotland: ""I have been to see each of the families in the local area and I have given them my reassurance that we are doing everything we can to recover their families.""

"The car hit people and crashed through tables and chairs of a cafe, eyewitnesses say A car has ploughed into crowds on a promenade near Rio de Janeiro's famous Copacabana beach in Brazil, killing a baby and injuring at least 15 people. Live television pictures showed victims lying on the sand and pavement, receiving emergency medical treatment. The badly damaged car came to a stop on the beach. The driver, who was detained, had an epileptic fit at the wheel, and drugs to treat the condition were found by police in the vehicle, reports say. Eyewitnesses were quoted by Globo News network as saying the car went over a bicycle path and across the promenade, hitting people and crashing through the tables and chairs of a cafe. A police official was quoted by the AFP news agency as confirming the accident was not a terrorist attack. An investigation is continuing. The promenade of Copacabana's crescent-shaped beach is popular with Rio residents and tourists.

"This video can not be played Bridge designer Ian Firth and engineering expert Dave Parker on whether a bridge is feasible. Downing Street has said there are ""no specific plans"" for a bridge between the UK and France after Boris Johnson floated the idea of a ""fixed link"". The UK foreign secretary reportedly ran the idea past French President Emmanuel Macron at a summit on Thursday. But Downing Street said he had been referring to a panel looking at Anglo-French major projects. Experts said a bridge was technically possible but some critics ridiculed the concept. Thursday's summit with Prime Minister Theresa May at Sandhurst's Royal Military Academy in Berkshire was Emmanuel Macron's first UK visit since becoming French president. UK and France sign Calais migrant treaty Smiling Macron and May pose for selfie The BBC understands Mr Johnson made the comments while discussing other major infrastructure projects around the world, including a bridge in Japan. Mr Johnson said in a tweet,externalthat the UK and France had agreed that a panel of experts should be assigned to look at ""major projects"". A source close to the foreign secretary said he also thought it was ""crazy"" the two countries were only connected by one railway line when they were merely 20 miles apart. Asked about the remarks, the prime minister's spokesman said: ""I haven't seen any plans on that. We are going to have very close ties with France economically, culturally and in areas such as defence and security for many many decades to come. ""What was agreed yesterday (Thursday) and what the foreign secretary tweeted about as well is a panel of experts who will look at major projects together, including infrastructure. And we want to work very closely with our French colleagues on building a shared, prosperous future."" Home Secretary Amber Rudd, on a visit to Crawley, West Sussex, was more forthright: ""I think I'm safe saying that I am not a huge fan of this latest proposal."" A spokesman for the French president confirmed he had had a conversation with Mr Johnson about a bridge and said Mr Macron had told him: ""The issue of access is an important one."" But he denied reports the French president had responded with ""I agree, let's do it"". It is not the first time the idea of a Channel bridge has been raised -transport officials submitted plans for one in 1981.,external The proposals were dismissed as ""impractical"" at the time, as it would make it difficult for ships to navigate the waters. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, bridge designer and former president of the Institution of Structural Engineers Ian Firth said it would be a ""huge undertaking, but absolutely possible"". But the idea was greeted with scepticism on social media. Labour's Emily Thornberrytweeted,externalthat she had assumed it was ""not real"". Â£47bn 'Boris Island' airport proposal was rejected Boris Buses:As mayor of London, Mr Johnson launched a competition in 2008 to design a new London bus to replace the iconic Routemaster. They hit the roads in 2012 but faced criticism over their cost, problems with their hybrid engines and non-opening windows. Transport for London have said they are not buying any more. Emirates Air Line:The Â£60m cable car over the Thames near the O2 Arena opened ahead of the London Olympics in 2012, again during Mr Johnson's tenure as London mayor.  He said it was an ideal way of linking north and south London but itfaced criticism over its cost and limited passenger numbers. Boris Island:Long backed by Mr Johnson as an alternative way of expanding airport provision in south-east England, the Â£47bn plan for an island airport in the Thames Estuary wasrejected as an optionby the commission looking into the issue in 2014. He had argued it could ""reshape the economic geography"" of south-east England. Garden Bridge:A Â£200m plan, backed by Mr Johnson, to build a bridge covered with trees over the River Thames in central Londonwas abandoned last year, having lost the support of his successor as mayor of London, Labour's Sadiq Khan. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke backed Mr Johnson's idea, saying: ""Boris is right. We absolutely must invest in infrastructure to keep trade flowing between Britain and France."" But former UKIP Nigel Farage told the BBC that the idea sounded like ""a big waste of money"". Former Lib Dem leader Sir Nick Clegg told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour the idea was ""a masterstroke in diversion"". ""It's all very well talking about a bridge that may or may not be built in decades to come.  The thing that worries me much more is he wants to pull up the drawbridge to the economic relationship which has served us so well over such a long period of time."" Conservative MP Mark Pritchard was not a fan of the idea, tweeting it was ""a bridge too far"": Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"GÃ¼iÃ±as are considered pests by some people as they can steal chickens It's the smallest cat in the Americas, occupying the smallest area of land. Listed as vulnerable to extinction, the gÃ¼iÃ±a wildcat of Chile has lost much of its natural home as forests are chopped down or converted to farmland. And, like many carnivores, it's at risk from human persecution over fears it might kill livestock. However, new research shows the animal is able to survive near human settlements on agricultural land. Its biggest threat is being squeezed out when land is broken up into smaller areas, say conservationists. The guiÃ±a is known variously as the little tiger cat, little spotted cat or Chilean cat. About half the size of the domestic cat, it is one of the most threatened cat species in South America. GÃ¼iÃ±a wildcat spotted on a camera-trap The wildcat lives only in central and southern Chile and in a narrow strip of Argentina. According to the IUCN, there are only about 10,000 individuals left in the wild. Its natural habitat is rainforest, but it has also been seen in pine or eucalyptus plantations or close to agricultural areas. Research led by the University of Kent, UK, found that habitat fragmentation, and the subdivision of large farms into smaller ones, are the biggest threats facing the animal. ""This is because there is a higher risk of human interaction and persecution in areas where there are more farms; a greater pressure on natural resources through increased timber extraction and livestock grazing; and even competition for food from domestic animals kept as pets,"" said Dr NicolÃ¡s GÃ¡lvez, who is now a lecturer at the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile. More than two-thirds of Chile's temperate rainforests have been lost over 25 years. However, through a series of questionnaires, camera-trap data and remote-sensed images the researchers found that the gÃ¼iÃ±a is remarkably adaptable to forest loss. They say large, intensive agricultural areas are actually suitable for the gÃ¼iÃ±a and should not be dismissed as poor quality habitat. The wildcat is found primarily in central and southern Chile This is because there are often unfarmed areas that provide refuge, food resources and suitable conditions for rearing young, they say. Another threat is illegal killing by humans. The cat is viewed negatively in rural areas over fears it will kill chickens. Questionnaires showed that 10% of rural inhabitants had killed a gÃ¼iÃ±a over the last decade. ""This suggests that persecution is much less of a threat to their survival than the subdivision of farms,"" said Prof Zoe Davies, from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE) at the University of Kent. Theresearch,externalpublished in theJournal of Applied Ecology,externalprovides a clearer picture of how habitat loss, land fragmentation and human interactions together affect the survival of a species such as the wildcat. The approach could be used to help with conservation efforts for small to medium-sized carnivores in other parts of the world. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"It is unclear if there are enough votes in the Senate to back this stopgap funding measure The House of Representatives has passed a bill to fund government operations until 16 February - the first move in efforts to avert a government shutdown. The bill must now be voted on by the Senate, where it faces an uncertain future. The Republicans do not have enough votes. Backing from at least some Democrats is needed to pass the bill ahead of the Friday midnight deadline. The last US shutdown happened in 2013 and lasted for 16 days. Why might US government shut down - again? A vote is now expected in the Senate at some point in the next 24 hours, but it is unclear exactly when it will take place. Republican leaders - who need some support from the Democrats - also face resistance from their rank-and-file conservatives, who are demanding more military spending, among other things. This so-called stopgap spending measure would keep federal agencies funded only until 16 February. The US government is already operating on its third temporary funding extension since this fiscal year began last October. Democrats are demanding help for ""Dreamers"", more than 700,000 immigrants who entered the US illegally as children. Liberals were in uproar when Mr Trump last year ordered the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, which shielded Dreamers from deportation, to end this March. In order to convince Democratic lawmakers to back their budget bill, Republicans are offering a six-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program (Chip), which benefits lower-income families. The president caused a minor muddle on Thursday morning when he tweeted: ""CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!"" In May last year, Mr Trump tweeted that the country needed ""a good shutdown"" The president's posting appeared to contradict Republican lawmakers' legislative strategy. A White House spokesperson was forced to issue a clarification later clarifying that Mr Trump did actually support the House measure. Allow Twitter content?

Arriving at the Pentagon for a visit, the president told reporters the government ""could very well"" shut down. Another conservative lawmaker vented his frustration with Mr Trump. ""We don't have a reliable partner at the White House to negotiate with,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina,according to the Washington Post,external. Anthony Zurcher, BBCNews,Washington On Wednesday, the Republican Party appeared to have a plan to avoid a government shutdown or, at the very least, put Democrats in a tricky spot. The strategy, crafted by the party's congressional leadership, was to pass a bill that would receive enough Republican support to overcome unified Democratic resistance in the House and then jam Senate Democrats into either grudgingly voting for the bill or forcing a politically fraught shutdown over protections for undocumented immigrants. Enter Donald Trump, tweets a-blazing. The president rejected a key piece of the party's stopgap legislation, a long-term extension of a children's health-insurance programme. Instead of possibly luring enough Democratic support to ease passage or forcing them to vote against a popular anti-poverty measure, Mr Trump threw sand into the gears and left the White House scrambling to walk back his tweet. This could test just how much influence the president, with his morning tweets and contradictory public statements, has to shape the legislative process. Perhaps successful negotiations will grind on despite his actions. Or maybe the political machinery will freeze and a shutdown will commence. Either way, and for no clear reason, the president has risked alienating congressional friends and emboldening his adversaries. Read Anthony's full takeaway For Republicans, this would be the first government shutdown ever to occur when one party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell emailed fellow Republicans on Thursday imploring them to vote in unison so they can blame Democrats. Neither party wants to be held responsible for a federal shutdown with US midterms elections approaching in November. Any backlash could also be problematic for 10 Democratic senators who are up for re-election this autumn in states that Mr Trump won in 2016. Mr Trump warned on Thursday that the consequences would be ""devastating"". But essential services would still run. That includes national security, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation, electricity production and the military. National parks and monuments could face closure, which provoked an angry public reaction during the last shutdown. The Washington Post reports the Trump administration is making contingency plans to keep the parks running if no deal is reached. Visa and passport processing could also be delayed.

"Passengers say flight staff briefed them on emergency procedures A Malaysia Airlines flight was forced to divert to central Australia after a technical issue left the aircraft ""shuddering"", passengers say. Flight MH122 was travelling from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur on Thursday when it turned back not far from Broome, in Australia's north-west. The plane, carrying 224 people, landed safely at Alice Springs Airport at 17:48 local time (06:48 GMT). There had been ""a loud bang"" from the left hand engine, the airline said. ""This was followed by a warning indicator which appeared on the electronic aircraft monitoring system,"" the company said in a statement. ""The captain then requested for the cabin crew to prepare for a normal landing."" Passengers on board said the plane had been shaking and making loud noises. Earlier, Malaysia Airlines identified the problem only as ""a technical fault on one of the aircraft's engines"" - but said the plane's safety was not compromised at any point. Passenger Sanjeev Pandev said the plane, which was an Airbus A330-300, appeared to have a problem about four hours into the flight. ""It was shaking and vibrating and the noise was getting louder and louder"" he told the BBC. ""Some people were praying and people had tears in their eyes. It was a really terrifying moment."" He said passengers were taken through emergency procedures by staff, some of whom appeared ""nervous and terrified themselves"". Malaysia Airlines, however, said there was ""no chaos reported in the cabin"". The plane was forced to land at Alice Springs Airport Another passenger praised the pilot for landing safely.

Prof Graham Braithwaite, an expert in aviation safety at Cranfield University, said it is possible one of the engine's blades was damaged. ""You've got a very large fan that is spinning in a jet engine like this,"" he said. ""Some of these blades are spinning around, and some are fixed."" ""If one of these comes off, it'll make a thumping great noise - then you've got this fan spinning around unevenly."" Such damage can be caused by many things - including a manufacturing defect, or a piece of debris or a bird being sucked into the engine. But the danger to passengers is small, since ""the engines will generally cope with this sort of stuff"", he said. Modern jet engines are also so reliable that planes can fly safely on one engine for an extended period of time. ""The likelihood of a mechanical engine failure is so remote that the chances of another happening on the other engine is extremely unusual,"" Prof Braithwaite said. Malaysia Airlines said safety remained its top priority. The group's CEO, Izham Ismail, apologised to customers for ""the anxiety experienced."" ""I thank all crew onboard for managing the situation by the book and in the calmest way possible,"" he said. Passengers were being accommodated at nearby hotels before boarding a new flight on Friday, he added. In June,an AirAsia X flight bound for Kuala Lumpur was also forced to turn backto Australia after an engine problem left it shaking. AirAsia X did not give details about the technical issue behind the incident, but said the safety of passengers was its ""utmost priority"".

Liberals were in uproar when Mr Trump last year ordered the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, which shielded Dreamers from deportation, to end this March. In order to convince Democratic lawmakers to back their budget bill, Republicans are offering a six-year extension of the Children's Health Insurance Program (Chip), which benefits lower-income families. The president caused a minor muddle on Thursday morning when he tweeted: ""CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension!"" In May last year, Mr Trump tweeted that the country needed ""a good shutdown"" The president's posting appeared to contradict Republican lawmakers' legislative strategy. A White House spokesperson was forced to issue a clarification later clarifying that Mr Trump did actually support the House measure. Allow Twitter content?

Arriving at the Pentagon for a visit, the president told reporters the government ""could very well"" shut down. Another conservative lawmaker vented his frustration with Mr Trump. ""We don't have a reliable partner at the White House to negotiate with,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina,according to the Washington Post,external. Anthony Zurcher, BBCNews,Washington On Wednesday, the Republican Party appeared to have a plan to avoid a government shutdown or, at the very least, put Democrats in a tricky spot. The strategy, crafted by the party's congressional leadership, was to pass a bill that would receive enough Republican support to overcome unified Democratic resistance in the House and then jam Senate Democrats into either grudgingly voting for the bill or forcing a politically fraught shutdown over protections for undocumented immigrants. Enter Donald Trump, tweets a-blazing. The president rejected a key piece of the party's stopgap legislation, a long-term extension of a children's health-insurance programme. Instead of possibly luring enough Democratic support to ease passage or forcing them to vote against a popular anti-poverty measure, Mr Trump threw sand into the gears and left the White House scrambling to walk back his tweet. This could test just how much influence the president, with his morning tweets and contradictory public statements, has to shape the legislative process. Perhaps successful negotiations will grind on despite his actions. Or maybe the political machinery will freeze and a shutdown will commence. Either way, and for no clear reason, the president has risked alienating congressional friends and emboldening his adversaries. Read Anthony's full takeaway For Republicans, this would be the first government shutdown ever to occur when one party controls both chambers of Congress and the White House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell emailed fellow Republicans on Thursday imploring them to vote in unison so they can blame Democrats. Neither party wants to be held responsible for a federal shutdown with US midterms elections approaching in November. Any backlash could also be problematic for 10 Democratic senators who are up for re-election this autumn in states that Mr Trump won in 2016. Mr Trump warned on Thursday that the consequences would be ""devastating"". But essential services would still run. That includes national security, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation, electricity production and the military. National parks and monuments could face closure, which provoked an angry public reaction during the last shutdown. The Washington Post reports the Trump administration is making contingency plans to keep the parks running if no deal is reached. Visa and passport processing could also be delayed.

"GÃ¼iÃ±as are considered pests by some people as they can steal chickens It's the smallest cat in the Americas, occupying the smallest area of land. Listed as vulnerable to extinction, the gÃ¼iÃ±a wildcat of Chile has lost much of its natural home as forests are chopped down or converted to farmland. And, like many carnivores, it's at risk from human persecution over fears it might kill livestock. However, new research shows the animal is able to survive near human settlements on agricultural land. Its biggest threat is being squeezed out when land is broken up into smaller areas, say conservationists. The guiÃ±a is known variously as the little tiger cat, little spotted cat or Chilean cat. About half the size of the domestic cat, it is one of the most threatened cat species in South America. GÃ¼iÃ±a wildcat spotted on a camera-trap The wildcat lives only in central and southern Chile and in a narrow strip of Argentina. According to the IUCN, there are only about 10,000 individuals left in the wild. Its natural habitat is rainforest, but it has also been seen in pine or eucalyptus plantations or close to agricultural areas. Research led by the University of Kent, UK, found that habitat fragmentation, and the subdivision of large farms into smaller ones, are the biggest threats facing the animal. ""This is because there is a higher risk of human interaction and persecution in areas where there are more farms; a greater pressure on natural resources through increased timber extraction and livestock grazing; and even competition for food from domestic animals kept as pets,"" said Dr NicolÃ¡s GÃ¡lvez, who is now a lecturer at the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile. More than two-thirds of Chile's temperate rainforests have been lost over 25 years. However, through a series of questionnaires, camera-trap data and remote-sensed images the researchers found that the gÃ¼iÃ±a is remarkably adaptable to forest loss. They say large, intensive agricultural areas are actually suitable for the gÃ¼iÃ±a and should not be dismissed as poor quality habitat. The wildcat is found primarily in central and southern Chile This is because there are often unfarmed areas that provide refuge, food resources and suitable conditions for rearing young, they say. Another threat is illegal killing by humans. The cat is viewed negatively in rural areas over fears it will kill chickens. Questionnaires showed that 10% of rural inhabitants had killed a gÃ¼iÃ±a over the last decade. ""This suggests that persecution is much less of a threat to their survival than the subdivision of farms,"" said Prof Zoe Davies, from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE) at the University of Kent. Theresearch,externalpublished in theJournal of Applied Ecology,externalprovides a clearer picture of how habitat loss, land fragmentation and human interactions together affect the survival of a species such as the wildcat. The approach could be used to help with conservation efforts for small to medium-sized carnivores in other parts of the world. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"The car hit people and crashed through tables and chairs of a cafe, eyewitnesses say A car has ploughed into crowds on a promenade near Rio de Janeiro's famous Copacabana beach in Brazil, killing a baby and injuring at least 15 people. Live television pictures showed victims lying on the sand and pavement, receiving emergency medical treatment. The badly damaged car came to a stop on the beach. The driver, who was detained, had an epileptic fit at the wheel, and drugs to treat the condition were found by police in the vehicle, reports say. Eyewitnesses were quoted by Globo News network as saying the car went over a bicycle path and across the promenade, hitting people and crashing through the tables and chairs of a cafe. A police official was quoted by the AFP news agency as confirming the accident was not a terrorist attack. An investigation is continuing. The promenade of Copacabana's crescent-shaped beach is popular with Rio residents and tourists.

"This video can not be played President Macron: ""I respect Brexit although I regret it"" France and the UK have signed a treaty to speed up the processing of migrants in Calais, French President Emmanuel Macron announced on his first UK visit. After talks with UK PM Theresa May at Sandhurst military academy, he said the treaty would offer a ""more humane approach"" and be ""more efficient"". But he suggested France would not bow to UK demands to include financial services in any post-Brexit trade deal. Mrs May praised the ""uniquely close relationship"" between the two nations. She said both leaders remained committed to the ""Le Touquet"" border agreement in Calais - the UK has announced an extra Â£44.5m to be spent on beefing up Channel border security. John Pienaar: Why getting on well with France matters Smiling Macron and May pose for selfie What now for UK-France security relations? Mr Macron said the Sandhurst Treaty signed on Thursday - the first joint treaty on the Calais border in 15 years - would ""enable us to improve the relationship and the management of the joint border"" and reduce the time taken to process migrants. It would mean the time taken to process migrants hoping to come to the UK from Calais, would be reduced from six months to one month for adults and 25 days for children. It ""will enable us both to have a more humane approach to these people and to be more efficient"" while also encouraging trade through the Channel ports, said the president. Mrs May said it was in Britain's national interest, as well as France's, to commit more resources to Calais security and stressed the two countries' joint commitments to defence and security measures. She said a combined joint expeditionary force would be ready to deploy up to 10,000 troops ""quickly and effectively to face any threat"" by 2020. Bayeux Tapestry to be displayed in UK In depth: The meteoric rise of Macron And the prime minister said a multi-million pound deal to build 36 A380 passenger aircraft for Emirates Airlines had been signed by Airbus, which has plants in France and the UK. She also confirmed thatthe Bayeux Tapestry will come to the UK in 2022- a gesture President Macron said he hoped would ""open a new chapter when it comes to our cultural co-operation and scientific co-operation"". ""We are making a new tapestry together,"" he said. This video can not be played Bayeux Tapestry explained... by kids The summit between Mrs May and Mr Macron, at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Berkshire, also featured the first meeting of the heads of Britain and France's five intelligence agencies, and is being attended by British cabinet ministers and their French counterparts. And with Brexit very much on the agenda for both nations, Mr Macron said that the history between the two countries could not be ""impacted by changes in institutions"". Challenged about his opposition to including financial services in any EU-UK free trade agreement, he said: ""I am here neither to punish nor to reward. I want to make sure that the single market is preserved because that is very much the heart of the EU."" He said if the UK wanted access to the single market, including financial services, ""be my guest. But it means that you need to contribute to the budget and acknowledge European jurisdiction"". Mrs May said she recognised that there would be ""a different relationship in future"" but added: ""I think the City of London will continue to be a major global financial centre. That is an advantage not just for the UK, it's actually good for Europe and good for the global financial system."" Meanwhile Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has hinted at the prospect of a second crossing for the English Channel -tweeting,external: ""Our economic success depends on good infrastructure and good connections. Should the Channel Tunnel be just a first step?"" A source close to the foreign secretary told the BBC that Mr Johnson had suggested to President Macron that a new ""fixed link"" between UK and France was needed. Other commitments include the deployment of three RAF Chinook helicopters in Mali, where French forces are fighting Islamist militants, and France sending more troops to reinforce a British contingent in Estonia on Nato's border with Russia. Downing Street said the RAF Chinooks would offer a ""niche capability"", providing logistical support for the French operation in Mali, but that Britain would not be committing combat troops. During last year's French election campaign, Mr Macron said he wanted to renegotiate or scrap the 2003 Le Touquet agreement, which established French border controls in Britain and UK controls in Calais. The agreement means undocumented migrants barred from entering the UK stay in France - many in makeshift camps. Up to 700 migrants are in the area, despite the camp known as the ""Jungle"" having been dismantled in 2016. The UK government is already thought to have spent more than Â£100m on security in the area over the past three years, and officials said the number of illegal attempts to enter the UK fell from 80,000 in 2015 to just over 30,000 last year. Other ""juxtaposed"" border controls are in operation at Eurostar stations in France and Belgium. By James Robbins, BBC diplomatic correspondent Britain and France carry much the same weight in global affairs. Both sit at the world's most exclusive tables of power - the Security Council and the G7 - and the sizes of their populations and economies are broadly similar too. But while President Macron commands France, including his parliament, after last year's stunning electoral successes - the same cannot be said of Theresa May. Sharp disagreements over the UK border with France are difficult to resolve. Mrs May has conceded extra money for border security in Calais - and has separately offered Chinook helicopters to move French troops more safely over Mali. Mr Macron, meanwhile, has offered the loan of the Bayeux tapestry. But Brexit still threatens to overshadow all this bonhomie. When it comes to Europe, these two countries are pulling in radically different directions.

"Failure to deliver the UK's aircraft carrier and jet programme on budget will put other defence projects at risk, ministers have been warned. A Public Accounts Committee report said defence budgets are ""very strained"". The programme - two aircraft carriers, F-35 Lightning II jets and a new radar system - leaves the Ministry of Defence ""financially exposed,"" MPs said. The MoD said that it was committed to keeping costs down. It said in a statement: ""This is a crucial investment that will revolutionise our ability to defend our nation as we face intensifying threats."" The approved cost for both carriers is Â£6.212bn, according to the MoD, which added that the carriers would have an expected service life of up to 50 years and be used for both humanitarian relief and war-fighting, representing ""tremendous"" value for money. But it's not just the cost of the two aircraft carriers that concerns MPs, said the BBC's defence correspondent Jonathan Beale, but the new jets that will fly off them and the other warships needed to protect them. The availability of ships to protect the carriers may also limit how they can be used and there are still technical and cost challenges for the new F-35 jets, he added. May hails 'strong' UK-France security links Williamson succeeds Fallon as defence secretary Warning of Tory revolt over military cuts The committee's chairwoman Meg Hillier said keeping the project, known as Carrier Strike, on budget will be ""no easy task"" due to ""uncertainty over some costs and the potentially negative impact of foreign exchange rates"". ""We will be keeping a close eye on this programme and will expect the Department to keep us abreast of developments,"" she added. The fluctuating value of the pound has affected the cost of the jets as they are being bought from US-based Lockheed Martin. While the pound has rallied, its value remains lower than before the Brexit vote in 2016. Labour's shadow defence secretary, Nia Giffith, said the government must ""urgently address the issue and ""ensure that the Carrier programme is adequately funded going forward"". The committee's warning adds to existing pressure on the MoD from former ministers and military leaders, as well as Conservative backbenchers, not to make other cuts to armed forces budgets. The committee also said the government must ensure the new jets and carriers can be upgraded with future technology, so they are ""future proof"" and ""value for money"". The government unveiled the first of the new class of aircraft carrier, the Â£3.1bn HMS Queen Elizabeth, in 2017.It later reported leaksduring its first sea trial.

"Blood tests could help target precision drugs at the right people with cancer Scientists have developed a blood test that could pick out which men with advanced prostate cancer would benefit from a new drug treatment. The test detects cancer DNA in the blood, helping doctors check whether precision drugs are working. Cancer Research UK said the test could ""greatly improve survival"". But larger studies involving more men needed to take place to confirm if doctors could rely on the test, the charity said. Blood samples from 49 men with advanced prostate cancer were collected by researchers, as part of the phase II clinical trial of a drug called olaparib. This type of precision drug is seen as the future of cancer medicine but because it is a targeted treatment, the drug does not work for everyone. Researchers from The Institute of Cancer Research and the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust said the test could help target treatment better and also reduce its side effects. They used it to identify men who were not responding to the treatment in four to eight weeks and also to pick up signs that the cancer was evolving and becoming resistant to the drugs. Prof Johann de Bono, consultant medical oncologist at the two organisations, said: ""From these findings, we were able to develop a powerful, three-in-one test that could in future be used to help doctors select treatment, check whether it is working and monitor the cancer in the longer term."" He added: ""Not only could the test have a major impact on treatment of prostate cancer, but it could also be adapted to open up the possibility of precision medicine to patients with other types of cancer."" Dr Aine McCarthy, senior science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said the blood test was an ""exciting"" development. ""The test has the potential to greatly improve survival for the disease by ensuring patients get the right treatment for them at the right time and that they aren't being given a treatment that's no longer working,"" she said. ""Further studies involving a larger group of men will confirm if doctors should use this test when treating patients with advanced prostate cancer."" Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men. Over 46,000 men are diagnosed with the disease every year in the UK. Dr Matthew Hobbs, from Prostate Cancer UK, said: ""The results from this study and others like it are crucial as they give an important understanding of the factors that drive certain prostate cancers, or make them vulnerable to specific treatments.""

"Caroline Presho took part in the trial and believes the blood test would be an enormous benefit to women A blood test every four months could help women at high-risk of ovarian cancer find tumours early, say doctors. There is currently no screening programme for the disease, so high-risk women are advised to have their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed. In the trial on 4,348 women, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, cancers were detected earlier, when they should be easier to treat. However, it is not yet clear if the regular blood test would save lives. Breast and ovarian cancer runs in Caroline Presho's family. The 43-year-old, from Hertfordshire, has inherited a genetic flaw called BRCA2. ""I'm a bit of a rubbish mutant,"" she told the BBC News website. ""I say it's like the X-Men, but I have the ability to develop cancer."" NHS Choices: Ovarian cancer,external Ms Presho was advised to have surgery to reduce risk, but having the ovaries and tubes removed starts the menopause. She said: ""I was always going to have surgery, but the screening allowed me to finish having my family, and I didn't want to go through the menopause at 35. ""It's very young and starting that early has a detrimental effect on cognitive function, bone and heart health."" Without screening, the only other option would be to keep an eye out for symptoms including: feeling constantly bloated a swollen stomach discomfort in the stomach or pelvic area feeling full quickly when eating, or loss of appetite needing to urinate more often or more urgently than normal About two in every 100 women will develop ovarian cancer at some point in their life. But the study focused on women, like Caroline, who faced a greater than one-in-10 chance. The trial, at 42 centres across the UK, monitored levels of a chemical called CA125 in women's blood. Three times a year, doctors tracked changes in the levels of CA125, which is produced by ovarian tissue, to see if levels became elevated - a sign of cancer. The women also had annual scans, and surgery if doctors thought cancer was likely. Ovarian cancer is the seventh most common cancer in women worldwide, with about 240,000 cases each year During three years of screening and the year after the last test, 19 cancers were detected. Ten of them were at an early stage. In the five years after that, 18 more ovarian cancers were detected. But now only one of them was at an early stage. The key principle of all cancer treatment is the earlier the tumour is found, the better the chances are of survival. And screening was finding them earlier. However, the study has not been running for long enough to know if the screening saves lives. While screening does detect cancer, tumours are far less likely to develop in the first place if women have surgery. Prof Usha Menon, one of the researchers and a professor of gynaecological cancer from UCL, said: ""What we're trying to do is get women to have surgery. But she told the BBC News website: ""From my point of view, women really struggle with this issue of menopause, and it seems like four-monthly screening is better than symptom awareness. ""The screening definitely picks up less advanced disease, but we cannot say for sure if we're saving lives."" Previous trials haveproduced insufficient evidencefor mass screening of all women. And in the US, the Food and Drug Administrationrecently recommended,external""against using currently offered tests to screen for ovarian cancer"", including ones looking at CA125. One potential issue is having a blood test could put women off surgery. ""This is what everyone's worried about,"" says Prof Menon. However, she pointed out there was already an issue with women delaying surgery. She wants UK health officials to review screening and all other advice to high-risk women. Caroline Presho had her fourth and last child - ""I know I'm a lunatic,"" she says - in the same year as she eventually had surgery. She told the BBC: ""I think it's a very exciting prospect to have screening. ""You're told to have children before 35, but you might not have settled down or found a partner. ""It's just so stressful to feel like you've got a deadline and the only option is surgery, I think it would be an enormous benefit."" About 3% of women are in the high-risk category like Caroline. Athena Lamnisos, the chief executive of The Eve Appeal, which part-funded the trial, said: ""This research gives women hope and confidence that there is an evidence-based approach to screening if they decide to delay risk-reducing surgery."" Annwen Jones, the chief executive of Target Ovarian Cancer, said: ""An effective screening programme for women at high risk of ovarian cancer due to family history would potentially have a major impact on mortality and survival from this disease. ""[But] it is still uncertain whether detecting ovarian cancer by screening increases the chance of a woman surviving the disease overall.

"This video can not be played David Turpin (R) and his wife Louise Turpin (L) deny charges of torture The parents accused of holding their 13 children in shackles at a California home have pleaded not guilty. David Turpin, 56, and Louise Turpin, 49, are facing charges of torture, abuse and false imprisonment. They were arrested after one daughter escaped from their home, where police later found some siblings chained to beds and severely malnourished. The couple appeared in court hours after prosecutors detailed the horrific abuse allegations against them. Riverside County District Attorney Mike Hestrin said the couple had allegedly punished their children by tying them up - first using ropes and later chaining them to their beds with padlocks. He said the alleged punishments would last weeks or months, and intensified over time. The 'happy family' charged with torture Prosecutors said circumstantial evidence showed the children were not released from their chains to go to the toilet. The teenager who escaped and alerted police to the house where her siblings were held captive had been hatching a plan to leave for two years, Mr Hestrin added. He detailed some of the gruesome allegations against the parents at a news conference on Thursday. The children were accustomed to frequent beatings, including strangulation They were only allowed one shower a year The children would stay awake all night until going to sleep at four or five in the morning and slept during the day They were not allowed to play with any toys but many were found inside the house in their original packaging If the children washed their hands above the wrist they were subjected to punishments, allegedly accused of ""playing with water"" The Turpin parents allowed their children to eat only one meal a day but the parents would sometimes buy food, like pumpkin pies, and place it where the children could see it but not eat it They have never seen a dentist and haven't visited a doctor in over four years The children lack basic knowledge of life, and did not know who a police officer was This video can not be played Shackled siblings: What we know about their lives James Cook, BBC News, Riverside, California This case has sent waves of revulsion across the US and beyond, and the small courtroom was packed as the defendants appeared. David and Louise Turpin were smartly dressed. They occasionally glanced at each other across a table weighed down by a copy of the California penal code and a sheaf of paper related to the case against them. A lawyer sat between them. Mr Turpin, with a distinctive mop of grey hair, was chained around the waist, his stomach protruding from beneath the metal links. His wife's mouth was turned down in a glum expression. The couple spoke only briefly and softly to confirm that they understood and accepted procedural details relating to their next hearing. The charges they deny are among the most serious any parent could face: amounting to a grievous betrayal of their own children, a betrayal which prosecutors allege went on for years, if not decades. The siblings themselves are said to be doing well but at least some of them have almost certainly suffered irreparable damage, both physical and mental from their ordeal. The children, who are aged between two and 29 , have been treated in hospital since being freed on Monday. The two-year-old was of normal weight but the other children were severely malnourished, authorities said. The 12-year-old weighed as much as an average seven-year-old and the 29-year-old weighed only 82lb (37kg). Several of the children have cognitive impairment and ""neuropathy, which is nerve damage, as a result of this extreme and prolonged physical abuse"", Mr Hestrin said. District Attorney Mike Hestrin said the couple chained their children as a form of punishment Though little is known about their education, some of the children were able to read and write.Mr Turpin also registered a private school in their California home, known as Sandcastle Day School. Police have obtained hundreds of journals that the children were allowed to write in and are looking through them for evidence. Before moving to California, the family lived in Texas. At one point, the parents allegedly lived in a different house from their children and would drop off food from time to time, officials said. If found guilty of the dozens of charges against them, the couple face 94 years to life in prison, Mr Hestrin added. Mr Turpin also faces one count of ""lewd act on a child under 14 years of age"". Can anyone open a school at home in California? The 13 children were found in an emaciated state in their filthy, foul-smelling house, police revealed earlier. Officers had at first thought all the children were minors but later realised some were frail and malnourished adults, they said. Mr Hestrin said that when officers arrived, three of the couple's children were chained to their beds. 12 counts of torture 1 count against David Turpin of a lewd act on a child 7 counts of abuse against a dependent adult 6 counts of child abuse/neglect 12 counts of false imprisonment Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

"Could France be the bridge between the UK and the EU? Prime ministers and presidents must sometimes get sick of summits. The salutes, the handshakes and kisses - President Macron is, after all, French - and the inevitable communiquÃ©s about the close and cherished relationship with this or that country. The novelty must, surely, wear off after the first dozen times or so. But here at Sandhurst military academy, as we wait for President Macron and his entourage, it feels as though this UK-French gathering matters more than most. Deals will be struck on border control and military co-operation here, but the importance of this summit exceeds the sum of its parts. Extra Â£44m for Calais border security Frank Gardner: What now for security ties? Bayeux Tapestry to be displayed in UK Border co-operation at Calais matters to both countries, obviously. So does security. Britain and France are Europe's two foremost military powers, both have suffered appalling terrorist outrages and both share a commitment to fighting Islamist jihadism wherever it is found. It almost seems odd that the heads of the British and French intelligence and security services have not met at the same table before now. The practical co-operation under discussion and being pledged here matters too. President Macron was greeted by the PM at Sandhurst Forty four million pounds to beef up the Channel border doesn't sound like much as a proportion of public spending, and it isn't. But the fences and CCTV improvements and the rest will make a difference and demonstrate Britain's commitment to pulling its weight as Mr Macron insists. French demands for wider British support for the regional economy won't be settled here. Goodwill can only be expected to stretch so far. Likewise, the military co-operation is more than purely symbolic. Three British Chinook helicopters is not a huge commitment but it adds a heavy lifting capacity the French lack in Mali, in their long-running confrontation with Islamist fighters. And yet there is much more at stake than the items on Thursday's agenda. The 11th Century Bayeux Tapestry portrays the invasion of England by William the Conqueror in 1066. France and its president, arguably the most politically secure leader in the EU just now, will be crucial to Britain's prospects of getting a decent deal from the European Union on Brexit. Whatever that deal looks like - and as things stand, the final shape of Brexit is a matter of pure guesswork - the UK's relationship with France will be important in determining Britain's clout as a global player. France may like the idea of acting as a bridge between the EU and the UK. In much the same way Theresa May suggested Britain could act as a link between Europe and the USA - before the ""Special Relationship"" began to stutter somewhat. So getting on well with France - Britain's great rival and closest neighbour for time out of mind - matters more now than it has since before the UK joined what was then the European Common Market in 1973. Oh, and whatever the longer term significance of this summit, we do get to see the Bayeux Tapestry without having to go abroad.

"Poor care at Liverpool jail means mentally ill prisoners are put at substantial risk, says a healthcare review Severely ill inmates at Liverpool prison often wait days to be seen due to poor mental healthcare and a lack of staff, a senior psychiatrist has said. In a letter seen by BBC News, Dr Andrew Forrester, a consultant at Lancashire Care, told the trust the shortfall was causing a ""substantial clinical risk"". Separately, a review of the prison published on Friday said conditions were the worst inspectors had seen. HM Prison and Probation Service said there had been ""a failure on our part."" Lancashire Care, which runs healthcare at the prison, said it had spent significant sums on staffing. However, in a statement the trust added that it had found it impossible to recruit enough staff. In his analysis of healthcare at the prison, carried out for Lancashire Care, Dr Forrester said there was a ""gross under-supply of psychiatry"". While highlighting the shortage of staff, the consultant in forensic psychiatry said: ""There are major deficits in the areas of clinical psychology, social work and occupational therapy."" The lack of a system to properly process patients meant that ""acutely mentally ill patients who are admitted to the inpatient unit often wait for many days to be seen, potentially compromising their safety"", he added. Details of his analysis - dated 20 December and released to the BBC under Freedom of Information rules - come to light two months afterthe BBC reported patients at the prison were dying because of healthcare errors. What went wrong for 'Britain's worst jail'? Since 2011, there have been 17 suicides at Liverpool prison, including three in 2017 - one of the highest totals for England according to the Howard League for Penal Reform. Dr Forrester, who has given evidence to Parliamentary committees on mental health provision in prisons, concluded that while he had worked in many ""difficult"" prisons, including Belmarsh and Wandsworth in London, ""the arrangements I have encountered at HMP Liverpool and their apparent resistance to remediation, are more concerning than in any other place where I have ever worked"". His assessment was written weeks after inspectors from HM Inspectorate of Prisons visited the crumbling Victorian prison. This video can not be played Peter Clarke, Chief inspector of prisons, criticises management of prisons ""at all levels"" In their review, which is published on Friday,but which was leaked to the BBC last month,inspectors found the jail, which houses around 1,100 inmates, was infested with rats and cockroaches. The prison authorities, and the broader prison service, are severely criticised in their review for allowing ""squalid"" conditions to develop at the prison. Dr Forrester's analysis is contained in a tranche of documents seen by the BBC. Other details from the papers demonstrate a fractured and dysfunctional relationship between Lancashire Care and the prison leadership, including: In July, a medic urged the trust to close the healthcare unit because of the refusal of the prison to provide officers to protect healthcare staff during medication rounds. In lieu of staff, the prison suggested nurses wear body cameras, a recommendation rejected by the trust. Healthcare staff were regularly overruled by prison authorities on which men were placed in the inpatient unit, with some sent there despite having no healthcare needs. This meant the unit was often unable to take prisoners who genuinely needed to be there. Maintenance problems with the contractor, Amey, meant the healthcare unit was regularly described as posing an infection risk, because of broken sinks, damaged cells and deeply embedded grime. Lancashire Care is leaving its contract when it expires in March and the BBC understands no other healthcare provider has bid to replace it. In its statement, Lancashire Care said: ""Whilst the level of psychiatry input in Liverpool prison is below the Royal College requirements, it is comparable to their prisons in the north-west [of England]. ""However, the experience of some clinicians would suggest that compared to the south, it is low."" On its difficulty staffing the unit, the trust said it ""had exhausted all available options to mitigate this"". ""Lancashire Care has been proactive in trying to recruit staff to the prison and has spent an additional significant amount of money on agency staff; this is not clinically or financially sustainable."" Speaking on the Today programme, the head of HM Prison and Probation Service, Michael Spurr, said the system had been under pressure, but acknowledged that the service ""should have acted much earlier"". He added: ""I absolutely accept that that was a failure on our part, but it is in the context of a system that has been under a lot of pressure for a number of years."" The Ministry of Justice said HMP Liverpool had hired a ""significant"" number of new officers and that the prison was ""now fully staffed"". A Ministry spokesman added that a joint health and social care improvement board was set up in November to oversee the healthcare action plan for the jail and is ""urgently looking at how to improve the running of healthcare services"".

"The Nancy Glen TT100 in Loch Fyne in June 2015 A major search for two fishermen missing after their boat capsized in Loch Fyne in Argyll and Bute has been scaled back. The alarm was raised by a third man who was pulled from the water by the crew of a passing boat on Thursday evening. Despite efforts of those on scene to keep it afloat, the 40ft Nancy Glenn TT100 fishing vessel sank. Lifeboats, a coastguard helicopter and rescue teams, as well as local boats, have been searching for the men. The operation has now been scaled back and further efforts will resume in the morning. Searches continued on Friday after the boat sank north of Tarbert Julie-Anne Wood, head of maritime operations for HM Coastguard, said: ""Sadly we have been unable to locate the two missing fishermen. ""Our thoughts are with all those involved."" Insp Julie McLeish added: ""We are in regular contact with the missing men's families. ""It is a very distressing time for them and the local community as a whole. ""The search will continue until dark tonight and will resume again at first light tomorrow."" The Marine Accident Investigations Branch has started an investigation. Tighnabruaich, Arran and Campbeltown RNLI Lifeboats were sent to the sea loch, alongside the HM Coastguard Prestwick helicopter and Coastguard Rescue Teams from Tarbert, Kames, Inverary and Crinan. Jonathan Hart, coastguard area commander, said the searches covered a significant area On Thursday evening, a remotely-operated underwater vehicle was used to investigate the fishing vessel on the sea floor. However, the operation was hampered by poor visibility. Campbeltown RNLI Lifeboat was out all night on Thursday searching for the missing men. It is understood the entire Tarbert fishing fleet has also been helping with the search efforts. A spokesman for Tarbert and North Kintyre Churches said: ""This is a close-knit fishing community and everyone is absolutely devastated by what has happened. ""The Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland are working closely with Matthew Ramsay of the Fishermen's Mission in Argyll to support the community and the emergency services personnel involved in the search operation. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this heart breaking incident."" The rescued fisherman was taken to Mid Argyll Hospital in Lochgilphead The man pulled from the water was transferred to Mid Argyll Community Hospital in Lochgilphead, where staff describe his condition as stable. Police and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) are carrying out a joint investigation to establish what caused the incident. Earlier Jonathan Hart, area commander for the coastguard, told BBC Scotland: ""I have been to see each of the families in the local area and I have given them my reassurance that we are doing everything we can to recover their families.""

"Theatre director John Barton, a co-founder of the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), has died aged 89. Working with the company since its beginnings in 1960, Barton directed more than 50 works - some adapted by him from the texts of Greek drama. He was ""a Shakespeare genius"", RSC artistic director Gregory Doran said. Actor Sir Patrick Stewart said ""the names William Shakespeare and John Barton will be for me forever united"". Sir Patrick, who worked with Barton on The Merchant of Venice, said that no one in his career ""had the impact John had"". Paying tribute to a ""mentor and friend"", Doran said Barton was ""one of the greatest influences in the acting of Shakespeare of the last century"". Generations of actors had been and still were influenced by Barton's series of Shakespeare workshops, Doran said. Doran recalled directing Malory's Morte d'Arthur, when Barton joined him for sessions ""in which he delivered whole sections of the book from memory, including, most wonderfully, the list of a hundred knights"". Barton's acclaimed productions include the War of the Roses, Twelfth Night, The Hollow Crown and The Greeks. Judi Dench, Jeremy Irons, Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen are among the actors to have worked with him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Cancer blood test shows promise but more research is needed, says Prof Richard Marais Scientists have taken a step towards one of the biggest goals in medicine - a universal blood test for cancer. A team at Johns Hopkins University has trialled a method that detects eight common forms of the disease. Their vision is an annual test designed to catch cancer early and save lives. UK experts said it was ""enormously exciting"". However, one said more work was needed to assess the test's effectiveness at detecting early-stage cancers. Tumours release tiny traces of their mutated DNA and proteins they make into the bloodstream. 'Exciting' blood test spots cancer a year early Blood tests spot ovarian cancer early Prostate cancer blood test 'helps target treatment' The CancerSEEK test looks for mutations in 16 genes that regularly arise in cancer and eight proteins that are often released. It was trialled on 1,005 patients with cancers in the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, oesophagus, colon, lung or breast that had not yet spread to other tissues. Overall, the test found 70% of the cancers. Dr Cristian Tomasetti, from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told the BBC: ""This field of early detection is critical. ""I think this can have an enormous impact on cancer mortality."" The earlier a cancer is found, the greater the chance of being able to treat it. Five of the eight cancers investigated have no screening programmes for early detection. In some cases, the test also provided information about the tissue-of-origin of the cancer - but not all. Pancreatic cancer has so few symptoms and is detected so late thatfour in five patients die in the year they are diagnosed,external. Finding tumours when they could still be surgically removed would be ""a night and day difference"" for survival, said Dr Tomasetti. CancerSEEK is now being trialled in people who have not been diagnosed with cancer, which will be the real test of its usefulness. The hope is it can complement other screening tools such as mammograms for breast cancer and colonoscopies for colorectal cancer. Dr Tomasetti said: ""We envision a blood test we could use once a year."" The CancerSEEK test, reported in the journalScience,external, is novel because it hunts for both the mutated DNA and the proteins. Increasing the number of mutations and proteins being analysed would allow it to test for a wider range of cancers. Dr Gert Attard, team leader in the Centre for Evolution and Cancer at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, and consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, told the BBC: ""This is of massive potential. Breast cancer can be detected by the new test ""I'm enormously excited. This is the Holy Grail - a blood test to diagnose cancer without all the other procedures like scans or colonoscopy."" He said ""we're very close"" to using blood tests to screen for cancer as ""we have the technology"". But he cautioned there was still uncertainty about what to do when a cancer was diagnosed. In some cases, the treatment may be worse than living with a cancer that is not immediately life-threatening. Men can already have slow growing prostate cancers closely monitored rather than treated. ""When we detect cancer in a different way, we can't take for granted that everyone will need treatment,"" Dr Attard said. Prof Richard Marais, from Cancer Research UK, said it would take time to prove that it worked as an early diagnosis for cancer - at least five to six years. ""Detecting cancer early, before the disease has spread is one of the most powerful ways to improve cancer survival and this interesting research is a step towards being able to do this earlier than is currently possible."" Paul Pharoah, professor of cancer epidemiology at the University of Cambridge, said more work was needed to assess how the test performs when cancers are less advanced. He said: ""Demonstrating that a test can detect advanced cancers does not mean that the test will be useful in detecting early stage symptomatic cancer, much less pre-symptomatic cancer.  The sensitivity for the stage 1 cancers in the study was only 40%."" And Dr Mangesh Thorat from the Centre for Cancer Prevention, Queen Mary University of London, said it looked promising ""but with several caveats"" ""A significant amount of further research is needed before we can even contemplate how this might play out in screening settings,"" he said. ""This is only a case-control study, and therefore needs further evaluation in large cohorts more representative of general population where such screening might be introduced."" The cost of CancerSEEK is less than $500 (Â£360) per patient, which is around the same price as a colonoscopy. Follow James ontwitter,external.

"This video can not be played Hurricane-strength gusts of up to 140km/h (90mph) caused transport chaos Eight people including two firefighters have been killed in storm-related accidents as hurricane-strength winds tear across northern Europe. Both firefighters were helping with clean-up efforts in Germany when they died. Many of those killed, in the Netherlands and in Germany, were hit by falling trees and debris. One died in a collision when his van was blown on to the other side of the road. The storm has now crossed to Poland. Facing gusts of up to 140km/h (90mph), Germany's train operator Deutsche Bahn cancelled all long-distance services for the rest of Thursday. Many regional services were also cancelled. Flights at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam - one of the busiest in Europe - were briefly suspended and two of its three departure halls were closed after roof plates were blown off the terminal building. In pictures: Storm rips through Europe People arriving at Schiphol told reporters they had experienced rough landings with some passengers around them throwing up. The storm, called Friederike in Germany, crossed the country from west to east before reaching Poland. This video can not be played As the storm heads eastward it will mix with snowfall, says the BBC Weather Centre's Sarah Keith-Lucas It caused high winds in the UK on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, bringing down trees and knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes. Meteorologists in Germany - where 65,000 homes are reportedly without power - warned people to stay indoors, and many schools are closed. Deutsche Bahn had already suspended rail traffic,externalin North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), neighbouring Rhineland-Palatinate state and Lower Saxony, when it announced a Germany-wide suspension of long-distance trains. Any regional trains still running have cut their speed because of the strong winds. A spokesman said it was the ""right decision"" due to the risk of trees falling on overhead wires and on tracks. Many domestic flights have also been cancelled. An emergency siren wailed in the city of Duisburg,external, warning residents that they should stay indoors, German news website WDR reported. Fierce winds blew this lorry's tarpaulin off on the motorway in Germany Twitter users posted photos of trucks and trees blown over by the gales. Many trees came down on railway lines. Police temporarily closed the centre of Almere, a Dutch city with about 200,000 residents lying just east of Amsterdam. They tweeted an alert warning people to stay at home because of risk from the storm. These cyclists in Rotterdam gave up trying to pedal through the storm A national transport website, VID, reported that at least 17 trucks had been blown over by the strong winds. The Dutch Railways (NS) and operator ProRail said overhead power lines had been damaged by the wind, as well as some railway tracks. An alert on the NS website said that ""at most, only a few trains"" would run throughout the evening.

"Manmade climate change is now dwarfing the influence of natural trends on the climate, scientists say. Last year was the second or third hottest year on record - after 2016 and on a par with 2015, the data shows. But those two years were affected by El NiÃ±o - the natural phenomenon centred on the tropical Pacific Ocean which works to boost temperatures worldwide. Take out this natural variability and 2017 would probably have been the warmest year yet, the researchers say. The acting director of theUK Met Office,external, Prof Peter Stott, told BBC News: ""It's extraordinary that temperatures in 2017 have been so high when there's no El NiÃ±o. In fact, weâve been going into cooler La NiÃ±a conditions. ""Last year was substantially warmer than 1998 which had a very big El NiÃ±o. ""It shows clearly that the biggest natural influence on the climate is being dwarfed by human activities â predominantly COâ emissions."" What is climate change? Record year for US natural disasters Coral reefs head for 'knock-out punch' El NiÃ±o sees higher sea-surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific which boosts warmth worldwide Figures were published on Thursday by the worldâs three main agencies monitoring global temperatures: the UK Met Office and the two US organisations - theUS space agency (Nasa),externalandNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa),external. Their datasets are compiled from many thousands of temperature measurements taken across the globe, from all continents and all oceans. Temperatures for 2017 and 2015 are virtually identical. Nasa rates 2017 the second hottest year, and Noaa and the Met Office judge it to be the third hottest since records began in 1850. The Met OfficeHadCRUT4 global temperature series,externalshows that 2017 was 0.99C (Â±0.1C) above ""pre-industrial"" levels â thatâs taken as the average over the period 1850-1900. It was 0.38 (Â±0.1C) above the 1981-2010 average. The Exeter-based agency calculates that the El NiÃ±o event spanning 2015-2016 contributed around 0.2C to the annual average for 2016. But that influence was gone by 2017. Nasa has done an additional statistical analysis that corrects its dataset for the effects of El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a - to smooth out the ""lumps and bumps"" these patterns introduce into the long-term trend. When this is done, 2017 becomes the warmest year on record. Nasa's Dr Gavin Schmidt said this ""idealised scenario"" underscored the central message: ""The warmth that we're seeing, and the trends that we're seeing, are independent of this variation in the Pacific and while the ins and outs of any particular year are affected by it - it's the long-term trend that's really pushing these numbers up."" Nasa says it is possible statistically to remove the natural warming and cooling effects that come from El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a. When this smoothing is done (red line), 2017 comes out warmer than any previous year. The grey columns denote major volcanic eruptions that ordinarily depress the warming trend. The World Meteorological Organization Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said the long-term temperature trend was far more important than the ranking of individual years. ""That trend is an upward one,"" he said. âSeventeen of the 18 warmest years on record have all been during this century, and the degree of warming during the past three years has been exceptional. âArctic warmth has been especially pronounced and this will have profound and long-lasting repercussions on sea levels, and on weather patterns in other parts of the world.â Prof Tim Osborn from the University of East Anglia said climate models were now accurately predicting which places would warm fastest. He explained: âWeâre seeing greater warming over land and in the Arctic regions, and less warming in the sub-polar oceans. âThese are what we expect from our understanding of climate physics, and this is what we observe.â He said uncertainties arising from incomplete global coverage of weather stations had been included in the calculations. Last year was notable for some very extreme weather events, says Noaa Commenting on the figures, Bob Ward, from the Grantham Institute at the London School of Economics, pointed out that this year governments were due to start assessing the gap between their collective ambitions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the goals of the Paris climate agreement, to stabilise temperature rise below 2C, and as close to 1.5 as possible. âThe record temperature should focus the minds of world leaders, including President Trump, on the scale and urgency of the risks that people, rich and poor, face around the world from climate change,"" he said. Earlier this week, a study in the journal Nature concluded that climate change needed urgently to be tackled, but forecast that apocalyptic predictions of a temperature rise of 6C by 2100 would not come about. Prof Richard Allan from the University of Reading said: âRather than warming being inconsequential or catastrophic, as some have suggested, we can be sure societies are facing a dangerous temperature rise, but one which we still have time to fix. âThe conclusions confirm that human-caused climate change is a serious concern. âBut if we act now with sustained and substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, societies will still be able to avoid much of the most dangerous climate change predicted by computer simulations.â Other temperature analyses exist apart from the ""big three"", but these all tell broadly the same narrative.

"The Nancy Glen TT100 in Loch Fyne in June 2015 A major search for two fishermen missing after their boat capsized in Loch Fyne in Argyll and Bute has been scaled back. The alarm was raised by a third man who was pulled from the water by the crew of a passing boat on Thursday evening. Despite efforts of those on scene to keep it afloat, the 40ft Nancy Glenn TT100 fishing vessel sank. Lifeboats, a coastguard helicopter and rescue teams, as well as local boats, have been searching for the men. The operation has now been scaled back and further efforts will resume in the morning. Searches continued on Friday after the boat sank north of Tarbert Julie-Anne Wood, head of maritime operations for HM Coastguard, said: ""Sadly we have been unable to locate the two missing fishermen. ""Our thoughts are with all those involved."" Insp Julie McLeish added: ""We are in regular contact with the missing men's families. ""It is a very distressing time for them and the local community as a whole. ""The search will continue until dark tonight and will resume again at first light tomorrow."" The Marine Accident Investigations Branch has started an investigation. Tighnabruaich, Arran and Campbeltown RNLI Lifeboats were sent to the sea loch, alongside the HM Coastguard Prestwick helicopter and Coastguard Rescue Teams from Tarbert, Kames, Inverary and Crinan. Jonathan Hart, coastguard area commander, said the searches covered a significant area On Thursday evening, a remotely-operated underwater vehicle was used to investigate the fishing vessel on the sea floor. However, the operation was hampered by poor visibility. Campbeltown RNLI Lifeboat was out all night on Thursday searching for the missing men. It is understood the entire Tarbert fishing fleet has also been helping with the search efforts. A spokesman for Tarbert and North Kintyre Churches said: ""This is a close-knit fishing community and everyone is absolutely devastated by what has happened. ""The Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland are working closely with Matthew Ramsay of the Fishermen's Mission in Argyll to support the community and the emergency services personnel involved in the search operation. ""Our thoughts and prayers go out to everyone affected by this heart breaking incident."" The rescued fisherman was taken to Mid Argyll Hospital in Lochgilphead The man pulled from the water was transferred to Mid Argyll Community Hospital in Lochgilphead, where staff describe his condition as stable. Police and the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) are carrying out a joint investigation to establish what caused the incident.

"Amelia Blake, from Loughborough, was found dead in a flat in Sydney The family of a British backpacker who was found dead in Sydney have said they are ""deeply shocked"" by her death. The body of Amelia Blake, 22, who is from Loughborough, Leicestershire, was discovered in a flat in the suburb of Newtown on Friday. A man aged in his 30s was also found dead inside, New South Wales Police said. Ms Blake's family said the ""much loved daughter and sister"" would be ""truly missed by all who knew her"". Local media in Australia reported that Ms Blake was the victim of a suspected murder-suicide. New South Wales Police said they were continuing to investigate and would not yet comment on how the pair died. No other suspects were being sought, a police spokeswoman added. In a statement issued by the Foreign Office, Ms Blake's family said: ""We are deeply shocked and saddened by the sudden passing of our much loved daughter and sister Amelia, who will be truly missed by all who knew her. ""We would like to thank everyone for the love and support shown to our family.

"Several committee members say they received tins similar to these MPs investigating food safety breaches at chicken supplier 2 Sisters Food Group have revealed they rejected Christmas gifts sent from its boss. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee said festive packages of biscuits were sent to several members. Its chairman said the unsolicited gifts were ""inappropriate"" and they had been returned or given to local food banks. 2 Sisters disputed the amount and said it was a ""goodwill gesture"", which they send to many external stakeholders. The committee held a month-long inquiry into the food group's actions after an undercover report from the Guardian and ITV Newsclaimed workers at its West Bromwich sitewere changing the slaughter dates to extend the shelf life of meat. In September, the Food Standards Agency and supermarkets Aldi, Lidl, Sainsbury's and Marks & Spencer alsoannounced they would investigate the allegations. 2 Sisters is one of the UK's largest chicken suppliers but also provides biscuits, ready meals and frozen pizzas. Over the Christmas period, several committee members received care packages with a mixture of Fox's and other tins of biscuits. Labour's Paul Flynn, who sits on the committee, said the package contained ""around Â£100 worth"". But 2 Sisters says the total cost of the gift was nearer Â£20. There are 11 members in this committee They are made up of Conservatives, Labour, SNP and DUP MPs Its role is to examine the finances, administration and policy of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and its associated public bodies The committee can open inquiries into environmental and agricultural subjects which can last several months and call upon witnesses Last year,it published a report on food waste,externaldescribing it as a ""scandal"" and a ""disaster"" MPs are required to declare any gifts, benefits and hospitality over a value of Â£300. Chairman Neil Parish, a Conservative MP. said members had found the actions of Ranjit Singh Boparan, 2 Sisters' chief executive, ""very disappointing"". ""Sending gifts to committee members at a time when we are trying to rebuild trust in the poultry industry is most unhelpful. ""Mr Boparan should instead concentrate on restoring confidence in our poultry supply chains, and we are keen to work with him to do so."" He wrote to the 2 Sisters chief executive asking him to ""avoid similar gestures,externalin future"". A 2 Sisters Food Group spokesman said: ""Each gift was around eight packets of Fox's and Own Brand Biscuits, in addition to two tins or boxes of Fox's biscuits. ""The business sends these out every year as a goodwill gesture at Christmas to hundreds of external stakeholders. ""We have responded formally to Neil Parish on the above.""
