"Five years ago, China's most charismatic politician, Bo Xilai, was toppled from power. His disgrace allowed his great rival, Xi Jinping, to dominate the political stage in a way unseen in China since the days of Chairman Mao.

"When Kyzer Gayle died in 2005 he was little over a year old. But it would be 10 years before the authorities knew about his death and longer still before they discovered what had happened to the boy from north London. When asked about the whereabouts of her son, Victoria Gayle, 32, told different tales to different people. Friends and family heard that the boy - Kyzer Gayle - was with his dad. A London man who believed himself to be the child's father thought Gayle had custody. Some official agencies were informed that Kyzer had been fathered by a traveller who took him away at a young age. But the stories were false. Kyzer died in 2005 when he was 13-15 months old and his mother hid the fact for more than a decade. Despite asking Gayle questions, no-one had tested the truth of her replies by establishing where her son really was. A police investigation was triggered only by the accidental death of Gayle's two-year-old daughter, Ava, in 2015. Medical treatment was sought when Ava became ill, but her condition deteriorated and she died. A subsequent inquest - recording a verdict of accident - determined that she had swallowed a tiny battery, causing fatal internal injuries. Kyzer Gayle was born in Northwick Park Hospital in February 2004 Following the tragedy, local investigators in Barnet, north London reviewed what was known about Kyzer. Finding themselves unable to account for the child, the case was referred to Scotland Yard. Beyond 2004, the year of his birth, there appeared to be no record of Kyzer being seen by anyone in authority. No attendance at school. No GP visits. No registrations with public bodies. Inquiries revealed that some people who had met Kyzer as an infant were under the impression that he lived with his father in north London. Police traced the man, but he had not seen Kyzer for more than a decade. He said that following a brief relationship with Gayle in 2003, she later made contact to say he had fathered a son called Kyzer. He told detectives he then had occasional contact with the child until, on one occasion when Gayle brought Kyzer to his home, she left and did not return.  The man said he cared for the child for about five months until Gayle suddenly reappeared and demanded Kyzer back, which he felt he had to accept. He never saw the boy again. Other witnesses described seeing a baby fitting Kyzer's description at Gayle's north London flat. These are thought to be among the last sightings of the boy. Gayle has been described as a hoarder and the child was said to have been seen in a buggy in a junk-filled room. Pen Mehmet, Victoria Gayle's former neighbour, reported her concerns to the authorities Pen Mehmet, a former neighbour, told the BBC that Gayle was a ""compulsive liar"" whose flat was so packed with rubbish that ""I couldn't tell you where her kitchen was"". She said Gayle had claimed in recent years that Kyzer ""lives with his dad"" and ""that was the best way because that's how the dad wanted it"". Ms Mehmet says she became so troubled by elements of Gayle's behaviour that she reported her concerns to the authorities. During contact with Gayle, some official agencies did ask about her son's whereabouts. She told them the boy's father was a member of the traveller community and had taken responsibility for Kyzer at a young age. The claim appears to have been accepted and no-one ever sought out the boy. A photograph of the shed where the baby was found, taken after the police had removed the body When Gayle was later evicted from her home, she stored some of her possessions in the garden shed of her mother and step-father who lived nearby, which was where detectives eventually found Kyzer's remains. Lead investigator Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh told the BBC: ""Within the shed we found a box. Within the box was what can best be described as a cocoon of gaffer tape, which concealed a cut-down buggy and in there was the clothed skeletal remains of the child we believe to be Kyzer."" A bandage had been applied to the entire length of one leg. Gayle's mother and step-father denied knowing what had been stored on their property. Before the discovery, Gayle had repeated to detectives the story about Kyzer's traveller father taking him away. Once his remains had been found, she admitted the story was untrue. But she denied harming Kyzer and claimed she had simply found him dead in his cot one morning - to which her reaction had been shock followed by denial. She said that recent internet searches for sulphuric acid had nothing to do with attempts to cover up the death. Gayle said that, until the eviction, Kyzer's body had been kept in her home and she had covered up what happened because she was afraid of being judged and blamed for it. The passage of time means that experts have been unable to establish a cause of death, although there was evidence of malnutrition and arrested growth. Tests showed the north London man who looked after Kyzer for several months was actually not his father, although detectives eventually identified someone who was. Victoria Gayle outside Kingston Crown Court in December last year At Kingston Crown Court last December, Victoria Gayle pleaded guilty to preventing Kyzer's lawful burial. She denied charges of perjury and perverting the course of justice, which have been left to lie on file. She has been sentenced to 21 months in prison with the judge criticising Gayle's ""web of lies"" and saying the the full truth of her son's ""sad and short life"" will never be known. A serious case review is investigating potential failings by Barnet Council and other official bodies. In a statement, the council said: ""The death of any child is tragic and we are working with Barnet Safeguarding Children's Board to provide information for their serious case review and to establish any learning from our involvement with the family."" The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has also opened an inquiry - currently on hold pending the serious case review - into potential police deficiencies. An IPCC spokesperson said it was ""a complex case spanning more than a decade, and we now know the family of the child had significant contact, not just with the police, but also with other agencies"". Noel McHugh led the investigation that discovered the child's remains Detectives are still making inquiries and Det Ch Insp McHugh told the BBC he was appealing for people to come forward who knew Gayle around 2004, when Kyzer was born. Police are also particularly interested in the period between 2007 and 2013, and are asking Gayle's former partners if she had any pregnancies or births police do not know about. Jon Brown, from children's charity the NSPCC, says he finds it ""deeply disturbing"" that a child can ""go missing for a decade"". He told the BBC there were ""a number of significant and important questions that are going to need to be addressed by the serious case review and by the IPCC investigation"". Pen Mehmet, Gayle's former neighbour, agrees and says she is angry and bewildered that Kyzer's death could go unnoticed for so long. ""I think it's absolutely disgusting because this child's been missing and nobody knew. ""How can nobody know? I don't understand, how can nobody know?""

"George Osborne is a history buff at heart. A student of modern history in his undergraduate days at Oxford, his is that cast of mind with a tendency to see himself as the inheritor of distant traditions. When I had a cup of tea with him in No 11 a couple of years ago, he spent the first seven or eight minutes talking about the provenance of the grand portraits in his room, and the figures depicted. I got the message pretty clearly. Here was a historic figure, he seemed to imply, who felt he had no judge so fair or firm as posterity. ""He's fascinated by history,"" the Tory MP and historian Keith Simpsontold the Financial Times,externala few years ago. ""He looks at different historical institutions and mechanisms which may have lapsed and sees whether they can be given new life."" Like the mechanism by which being an MP is very much a part-time job, perhaps. Osborne will need to mobilise all his knowledge of history when defending the decision to mix two full-time jobs - that of an MP and a newspaper editor - with each other, let alone with his four days a month at BlackRock, the asset manager, for which he gets an annual figure of Â£650,000 - what most people earn in around a quarter of a century. Many journalists, including Winston Churchill, have gone on to be politicians The fact is, he has no journalistic credentials whatsoever. Most people who edit newspapers will have spent years crafting headlines, sub-editing copy, designing pages, planning stories, and above all reporting. Osborne has never done any of that, and will need to grasp some basic skills very quickly if he is to keep Standard staff on-side. Of course, there is a long tradition of journalists becoming politicians, from Churchill and Horatio Bottomley to Nigel Lawson, Ed Balls, Yvette Cooper, Michael Gove, Ruth Davidson, Benito Mussolini (who edited two socialist papers) and the fictional Jim Hacker. Fewer have tended to go the other way. Bill Deedes was an editor of a newspaper (the Daily Telegraph) and a cabinet member, though not at the same time. Boris Johnson, who in ancient history was thought of as Osborne's main rival for the Tory crown, was editor of the Spectator while MP for Henley. And, long before he entered politics, Michael Foot was editor of the Standard at 28. Evgeny Lebedev, the 36-year-old who is now Osborne's boss, is fond of Evelyn Waugh and 20th Century literature generally (full disclosure: I was for several years Lebedev's adviser, and then his editor at the Independent). I imagine Lebedev will like the idea of reviving quaint, romantic 20th Century ideas about the relationship between politics and newspapers. The Standard's owner, Evgeny Lebedev But Osborne's constituents have daily concerns that are more rooted in 21st Century Britain. He has a huge majority, but together with his four days a month at BlackRock - which is about a fifth of a full-time job in itself - he won't have much time for parliamentary representation. Frankly, I can't see this arrangement lasting. Perhaps forthcoming boundary changes to the constituency will concentrate his mind - and that of his electorate. Tatton has a population of around 85,000, which intriguingly is almost exactly a tenth of the Standard's readership. The latter are his new constituency. What kind of editor will he be for them? Osborne flirted with journalism before entering politics. Years agohe was interviewed for a job,externalon the Economist, the publication whose world view he most closely adheres to, by Gideon Rachman, now the Financial Times' brilliant foreign affairs commentator. He didn't get the job, despite having grown up on the same street as Rachman, and having the same first name (Gideon) and alma mater (St Paul's). There is a strong resemblance between the politics of the Standard, which backed the Remain camp and Zac Goldsmith's mayoral campaign, and Osborne's: globalist in outlook, metropolitan rather than provincial, socially liberal, unashamedly in favour of capitalism, and reliably Tory. The Evening Standard has a circulation of 850,000 In the past, Osborne has also spoken at length about his faintly bohemian upbringing. His interest in the arts, particularly theatre, is genuine. Naturally he will sharpen the paper's political edge, and his appointment serves up the truly delicious prospect of several assaults, under varying degrees of disguise, on the prime minister who so unceremoniously dispatched him to the back benches. Ultimately he will be judged not just on the paper he produces, but on whether together with the commercial team at ESI Media he can reinvent the company. Heavily reliant, like Metro, on print display advertising which is disappearing at the rate of around 20% a year across the industry, ESI Media - which houses the Standard, Independent, and TV station London Live - needs to be re-engineered, perhaps with events, data and ticketing to the fore. Among his key lieutenants beyond the editorial floor will be Manish Malhotra, the former finance director who now runs the company, and Jon O'Donnell, the managing director for commercial whose ad team is outperforming the rest of the market. Osborne was one of 30 applicants, 10 of whom were interviewed, and four of whom were shortlisted. In four meetings in central London with Lebedev, he sought and received reassurance about the proprietor's willingness to invest in the paper and its website. George Osborne addresses staff at the Evening Standard He can take heart from the fact that the Independent, which is now digital-only (I was the last editor of the print edition) is now humming commercially, well ahead of budget and set to make a multi-million pound profit this year. Unimaginable even three years ago, the Independent is currently the financial powerhouse within ESI Media, of which TV channel London Live is the other component. The Independent is co-owned by Justin Byam Shaw, who is also the chairman of the Standard and attended two of the four meetings between Lebedev and Osborne. Relative to the rest of Fleet Street, Osborne won't have much in the way of an editorial budget, and the need to raise revenues means sponsored content and native advertising of a sort that journalists instinctively resist may creep further into his pages. Then again, doing more with less - or austerity - was the ethos that defined his contribution to political history. Not in this for the money, because he will be paid substantially less than his predecessor, the Austerity Chancellor has just been reborn as the Austerity Editor. What his constituents make of that we're about to find out.

"The claim:The government is spending record amounts on education in England. Reality Check verdict:The absolute amount of money in the pot for schools in England is at record levels but once you factor in rising pupil numbers, inflation and running costs, schools will have to cut approximately 8% from budgets by 2020. Theresa May said at Prime Minister's Questions that spending on education is at its highest level, something she has insisted on a number of occasions. She was talking about England, because education is a devolved matter and is funded separately in the other UK nations. But head teachers in England have been raising the alarm about growing holes in their budgets. When the prime minister talks about record amounts of funding going into education, she is referring to the Dedicated Schools Grant, which is the whole block of money going to schools in England. This stands at Â£40bn this year. It is true that this is the biggest pot in cash terms, but, of course, how generous the pot is depends on how many pupils there are in the system. There was a baby boom in the early 2000s, which has been hitting primary schools for several years and is now moving up through the secondary system. Between 2009 and 2016, the school system expanded to take in an extra 470,000 pupils. The Department for Education says that between 2016 and 2025 there will be a further increase in the state school system, up from about 7.4 million pupils to about 8.1 million. So looking at how much is being spent per pupil is a more meaningful figure. David Cameron in 2015 committed to freezing school spending per pupil in cash terms. TheInstitute for Fiscal Studies,external(IFS) warned that this would result in an 8% real-terms cut in school spending per pupil due to inflation and the rising cost of wages, pensions and National Insurance contributions. This amounts to the biggest fall in spending on each pupil in 30 years. TheNational Audit Office,externalestimates that schools will have to make Â£3bn worth of cuts as a result of these factors. The government is consulting on a new funding formula, which it says will be a fairer way of allocating the cash to schools around the country. Under current plans, almost 11,000 schools stand to gain and around 9,000 will lose funding. How the funding formula could work Every pupil would get a basic amount, rising to Â£4,312 for a GCSE student A pupil eligible for free school meals (FSM) would get an extra Â£2,160 An extra Â£810 per pupil in the most deprived areas An extra Â£1,550 for pupils with low prior attainment An extra Â£1,385 for speaking English as an additional language (EAL) The following types of schools would get extra funding: 1.4% for schools outside London with high numbers of pupils living in disadvantaged areas, regardless of whether they get FSM 2.8% for schools with the highest proportion of pupils with low prior attainment 1.3% for small, rural schools 5.3% for primary schools in sparsely populated communities These are averages - some schools may get more or less This model is what the Department for Education wants every school to move towards eventually but, for the first two years, transitional protections are in place meaning no school can lose more than 3% of their funding. This means that the best-funded schools under the current system will still get more than Â£4,312 basic funding per Year 11 pupil for the two year period because of these protections. For now, one pupil might attract more funding than another with the same characteristics in terms of deprivation, attainment and so on in another part of the country. The idea is that, eventually, two pupils with the same characteristics will attract the same amount of funding no matter what school they attend. It's fair to say the majority of the schools at the very bottom of the pile are in urban areas and the biggest winners are mostly in rural areas. The top 30 winners are almost all in Cumbria, Shropshire and Cornwall, while 13 of the bottom 30 are in London or Birmingham. Other losers are in Coventry, Rotherham and Wakefield. However, it's not quite as simple as urban loses, rural wins. There is a chunk of losers in the funding formula in Lincolnshire, for example, while some London schools are gaining too because of  the changes in the way the government assesses need. But analysis from independent think tank theEducation Policy Institute,externalsuggests the gains made by some schools will be wiped out by the overall cuts they will need to make to keep up with rising cost pressures. It's also worth pointing out that the schools budget, which is for five to 16-year-olds, is distinct from overall education spending. Mrs May claims spending on education is at record levels in absolute terms. In fact, while schools have done well in terms of funding per pupil in the longer term - it will be at least 70% higher in real terms in 2020 than it was in 1990 - the IFS says spending on pupils in sixth forms and further education will be no higher in 2020 than it was 30 years previously.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""I am up for continued discussion."" Delegates at the SNP conference in Aberdeen are being told today Scotland will have another referendum. The party faithful are being promised by the leadership that they will not be denied a vote on independence. But is that a promise their leaders can keep? The SNP firmly believe they have the moral authority to call another referendum. But it is the UK government who have the legal authority to decide when or if there is another referendum. Scotland 'will have its referendum', says SNP's Robertson Theresa May says ""now is not the time"" for fresh vote Sturgeon 'determined' to have second vote Indyref2: Your questions answered So what are Nicola Sturgeon's options now? I've just asked her what she will do if Theresa May refuses to discuss the possibility of another vote. The First Minister says she is convinced the PM's position is not sustainable, that she cannot continue to deny Scotland a vote without incurring major political damage and possibly even strengthening the case for independence. For the SNP this argument about who has the right to decide when or if Scotland can have another referendum is an example of why Scotland should leave the UK. It allows them to make the case that Scotland is once more being dictated to by Westminster and says that shows why independence would be a better option. Just saying no might be a politically risky path for the Prime Minister but if she sticks to that position what can the Scottish government do? They can demand negotiations over when a referendum could take place. But they can't enter discussions with someone who won't speak to them. There is the option of holding a referendum without the authority from the UK government. That would have no legal standing and it could be challenged in the courts. But it could also demonstrate the strength of feeling in Scotland. Theresa May has said ""now is not the time"" for Nicola Sturgeon to call for an independence referendum Ms Sturgeon will not yet discuss that possibility, saying she is concentrating on the vote in the Scottish Parliament next week and then making a formal request to Theresa May to give the authority for another vote. Speaking to me today, Ms Sturgeon indicated she might be prepared to discuss the timing of another vote with Mrs May. The Scottish government want a referendum between Autumn 2018 and Spring 2019. It looks like they would be prepared to negotiate a different, later, date. However, it is not yet clear that the UK government are prepared to talk about a date. The PM did say ""now is not the time"" for another referendum. She didn't say never. So, will she talk about holding a vote in the future? That seems to be the question today.

"Zara Larsson's hits include Lush Life, Never Forget You and Ain't My Fault In Sweden, she's been a star since she was 10 - but Zara Larsson has her eyes set on global domination. Aged just 19, the star has racked up seven hits in the last 14 months, including the tropical pop smashLush Life,external, which spent more than a year on the charts. Along the way, she's collaborated withTinie Tempah,externaland sung theofficial anthem of Euro 2016,external, but the highlight of her year was supporting Beyonce at Wembley Stadium. ""It was the best show on a tour I've ever seen. Wembley's such an incredible stadium. It's definitely one of the stadiums I want to stand on and have my own tour, one day."" Although she's already scored a number one single and album in her home country, Zara is starting from scratch in the UK - and releases her debut album,So Good,external, this week. Outgoing and dynamic, she talked the BBC through her career to date. Here's everything you need to know (and a few things you probably didn't) about Sweden's latest pop sensation. The star first revealed her condition in 2015 Writing on herSwedish-language website,externaltwo years ago, the 19-year-old revealed she frequently has episodes of sleep paralysis. ""Oh my God, it's scary!"" she tells the BBC. ""Basically, you wake up and you literally cannot move. Your brain is active, but your body is not yet awake. ""It's weird. It lasts half a minute maybe - but it kind of feels like you're trapped there for half an hour. ""I get it a lot when I'm stressed out, or when I have a lot of things going on."" But Zara says there's an upside, too. Often, as she falls asleep, she's overcome by a sense of tremendous wellbeing (to paraphrase a certain Blur song). ""It's like a wave comes over me. Energy is just vibrating through your body and it's awesome."" In 2008, Zara entered Talang Sverige - Sweden's version of Britain's Got Talent - mainly because there was no age restriction, unlike X Factor or Swedish Idol. Singing a heavily-accented, but vocally powerful, version of Celine Dion'sMy Heart Will Go On,external, she won the contest, and its 500,000 krona (Â£42,600) prize. ""I sounded like a little guinea pig!"" she laughs. But, incredibly, the contest led to nothing. ""Nobody really wanted to sign me, which I was devastated about,"" she says. ""I was like, 'oh my gosh, my career's over and it hasn't even started yet!' ""I didn't really want to do anything with Nickelodeon or Disney, so I just went back to school."" The break may have saved her. Rather than becoming a novelty act, washed up before she was a teenager, Zara re-emerged as a bona fide pop artist on her 15th birthday, with an EP that turned people's heads. ""When I released the first song, a lot of the people didn't even recognise me,"" she says. ""And the people that did were like, 'Oh my gosh, it's her!' ""So in Sweden, the talent show is like super-irrelevant. And that's great because usually it's very hard to wipe off that kind of Got Talent stain. ""It just stays on you - but it didn't for me."" This video can not be played Zara Larsson plays 'So Good' or 'So Bad' ...As we discovered when we played a game of ""So Good or So Bad?"" with Zara (watch above) When Zara released Lush Life in January last year, a lot of people thought it was Rihanna's comeback single. ""I don't know where it comes from but even my mom is like, 'You sound like Rihanna,'"" says the singer. ""I was very confused because I'd never really listened to her until pretty recently. It's not a bad comparison to have but I'm never going to be Rihanna, and I'm not trying to be. From the moment Zara fired up her Instagram,pulled a condom over her leg,externaland called out guys who ""think they're too big to wear protection"", it was clear Zara wouldn't be sticking to the record company script. Since then, she's voiced her support for Kesha - who is suing famed record producer Dr Luke for alleged sexual assault - and engaged in a war of words with R&B star Chris Brown, calling him ""a sexist, homophobic, transphobic trash"". ""That's who I am,"" says the star. ""I don't really have a 'vision' of who I want people to see me as. ""I just post whatever I feel like."" Zara and her father in earlier times... Larsson was born in Stockholm at the tail end of the 1990s, moving to the suburbs when her younger sister Hanna was born. She was always singing - showing off to her parents' dinner-party guests; and serenading ""ladies on the subway, when I was like three"". But she didn't come from a musical family. Far from it.

"Will the president and the German chancellor find common ground? The world's most powerful man is about to meet one of its most influential women. A snowstorm forced the cancellation of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's planned visit to Washington on Tuesday. The forecast for Friday's meeting is much brighter - meteorologically, at least. But with the exception of their ability to effect profound change upon the western world, President Donald Trump and Angela Merkel have little in common. He is flamboyant, impetuous and prone to rhetoric which sets alarm bells ringing in Berlin. She is reserved, pragmatic and lingers over decisions. He lambasted her open door refugee policy. She opposed his travel ban. Up in the air: the chancellor's first flight failed to get off the ground because of a snowstorm in the US But the relationship they strike is likely to have lasting consequences for the future of Europe - and beyond. Mrs Merkel, who is said to have been studying Mr Trump's speeches and evenan old interview with Playboy magazine,external, appears to have concluded that the way to the president's heart is through business. She is taking the chief executives of BMW and Siemens and the manufacturer Schaeffer along with her. BMW's Harald Krueger (L) and Joe Kaeser, CEO of Siemens, are part of the chancellor's White House delegation Together they are expected to reinforce the mutual benefits of the transatlantic economic relationship. They are expected to emphasise that 810,000 people are directly employed by German companies in the US. The chancellor and chief executives will need to talk tough. President Trump has already hinted at higher import taxes for countries such as Germany that have a trade surplus over America. ""I think she made one very catastrophic mistake and that was taking all of these illegals. Nobody even knows where they come from. So I think she made a catastrophic mistake, very bad mistake,""Donald Trump, 16 January 2017, The Times ""I told you @Time Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favourite. They picked person who is ruining Germany,""Donald Trump tweet, 9 December 2015 ""Germany and America are bound by their values: democracy, freedom, the respect for the law and the dignity of human beings, independent of their origin, skin colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or political position. On the basis of these values I offer the future president of the United States, Donald Trump, close co-operation,""Angela Merkel, 9 November 2016 This video can not be played Trump meets Merkel: The biggest difference between US and Germany More on Trump and Merkel: Merkel rejects Trump adviser euro claim Merkel's 'catastrophic mistake' on immigrants Germany shivers in icy blast from US For talks that will last all of two hours there is a lot on the agenda. Nato, the Middle East and international terror, for a start. Germany's defence spending is currently 1.23% of GDP, but Mrs Merkel is expected to reassure President Trump of its existing commitment to increase that gradually to Nato's 2% target. And there's a lot to disagree on. On climate change, German will insist on the importance of cutting greenhouse gas emissions, while Mr Trump's support for theParis climate dealis unclear. Germany is also seeking a unified response to Russia's actions in eastern Ukraine and a commitment to sanctions if the terms of the Minsk ceasefire agreement are not met. The first European leader to meet President Trump was UK Prime Minister Theresa May Expectations in Berlin are not high. It is unlikely that the Merkel-Trump pairing will replicate the warm and trusting political alliance between the chancellor and President Obama, which survived the revelation that the Americans had listened in to Mrs Merkel's phone calls. It is also election year for the chancellor. Donald Trump is deeply unpopular among Germans. A recent poll for the national broadcaster found that trust in the US under his administration had fallen to a new low and was on a par with Vladimir Putin's Russia. Angela Merkel needs to walk a diplomatic tightrope. She has to build a working relationship with Mr Trump without appearing to sacrifice her own values or disappoint those keen to cast her as the West's last defender of those democratic ideals. She has already reminded Mr Trump of his obligation to common values and explained the Geneva Conventions to him. Mrs Merkel has made it clear that she is still in instruction mode, stating her intention to explain to Mr Trump ""that for us nationality and membership of the EU are two sides of the same coin"". Theresa May was the first EU leader to meet with America's new president, who supports the UK's decision to leave the union. Mrs Merkel will be keen to emphasise the importance she attaches to holding the fragile European project together. This may be billed as a getting-to-know-you visit, and as Angela Merkel put it: ""It's better to talk with than about someone."" But governments around the world will be watching closely for clues as to how America's relationship with Germany and with Europe is likely to evolve. And what that means for the wider world.

"Manchester United are hoping to reach the 24 May final at Stockholm's Friends Arena - where Swedish striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic is having a statue erected in his honour Manchester United will face Belgian league leaders Anderlecht in the Europa League quarter-finals. United, considered the favourites by many bookmakers, are the only British team left in Europe's secondary club competition. Jose Mourinho's team edged past Russians FC Rostov witha 2-1 aggregate winin the last 16. French side Lyon play Besiktas, Dutch giants Ajax meet German team Schalke, while Celta Vigo face Belgium's Genk. The first legs are set to take place on Thursday, 13 April and the return games will follow a week later. Anderlecht (Bel) v Manchester United (Eng) Celta Vigo (Spa) v Genk (Bel) Ajax (Ned) v Schalke (Ger) Lyon (Fra) v Besiktas (Tur) Champions League draw: Leicester to face Atletico Madrid Manchester United have lost only two of their six previous meetings with Anderlecht - which includes a club-record 10-0 win in their first European fixture. The Red Devils, under legendary manager Matt Busby, thrashed the Belgians in the European Cup preliminary round second leg in September 1956. The sides last met in the 2000-01 Champions League first group stage - Andy Cole's hat-trick helping United to a 5-1 win at Old Trafford before they lost 2-1 in Belgium. Anderlecht, who are Belgium's most successful team with 33 domestic titles, finished as Pro League runners-up in 2016. They finished top of the league at the end of the regular season last weekend, two points clear of Club Brugge before the end-of-season play-offs.

"George Osborne's appointment as Editor of the London Evening Standard is a remarkable move that will dazzle the worlds of politics and media. The former Chancellor will continue as MP for Tatton for the foreseeable futurewhile taking the top chair at London's afternoon paper,as I exclusively revealed on Friday. He starts in mid-May and replaces Sarah Sands, who is joining the BBC as editor of Radio 4's flagship morning news programme Today in June. Osborne has spoken to Standard staff in the newsroom. He will not be in charge of the Standard's website. David Tomchak, former head of digital at No 10, was appointed digital director of editorial earlier this month and will report to Zach Leonard, managing director for digital across ESI Media, which houses the Standard, The Independent, and TV station London Live. It marks a sudden return to the fray for Osborne, who was summarily dismissed from cabinet by Prime Minister Theresa May last summer. Like May, Osborne backed the Remain campaign in the Brexit referendum. Unlike May, he was central to its ultimately doomed strategy, despite having doubts about whether the referendum should have been called in the first place. Since last summer he has spoken strongly in parliament on the subject of Aleppo's destruction, and repeatedly resisted suggestions that he should begin his memoirs. The former chancellor is paid Â£650,000 a year for four days' work a month at the asset management company BlackRock But he has also been in the headlines for less flattering reasons. Having signed up to the Washington Speakers Bureau, Osborne has capitalised on his high stock to earn fees such as Â£81,174 and Â£60,578 for speeches to JP Morgan. In total he earned Â£786,450 from 15 speeches in 2016. More controversially, the former chancellor, still only 45, signed a deal with BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, worth Â£650,000 a year for just four days work a month. That revelation was made public on Budget day, causing some to suggest that he had lost none of his expertise in media management. At BlackRock he will work with Rupert Harrison, his closest adviser while in No 11. Osborne flirted with a career in journalism before becoming, together with David Cameron, the outstanding Tory adviser of his generation, rising to shadow chancellor at 33. His latest job is undoubtedly a tremendous coup for the newspaper, whose staff will be galvanised by the appointment of such a high-profile figure. It also appears to be a notable win for Evgeny Lebedev, the owner of ESI Media, who was my boss when I was editor of the Independent. After buying a majority stake in the Standard from Daily Mail owner Lord Rothermere in 2009, when it was threatening to lose Â£25m or more, Lebedev made it a free product and transformed its fortunes, turning a profit a few years ago. In the year to September 2015, the Standard recorded a pre-tax profit of Â£3.4m on revenues of Â£71.3m. But while this is refreshing news for the Standard - which has a circulation of between 850,000 and 900,000, a readership of around double that, and unrivalled influence in the capital because of its monopoly position among afternoon commuters - it is a further blow for his constituents in Tatton. This time last year, their MP was the chancellor of the Exchequer, a strong contender to be future prime minister, and in prime position to champion his Northern Powerhouse initiative. The appointment is a coup for the paper's owner, Evgeny Lebedev Now he is a backbench MP who has a new and more exciting job - quite aside from his four days a month at BlackRock. Though an advisory committee in the civil service has not yet objected to this appointment - a decision is pending - many of his constituents will. The Standard is an afternoon paper, which means that the daily edition is sent to the printers at 11:00 GMT. Osborne will get into the office around 05:00 GMT, work until midday, and then balance his other duties thereafter. But aside from persuading constituents he is still available to them, he faces a huge challenge in keeping the Standard profitable. As a free paper, with no cover price to raise, the Standard generates the vast majority of its revenues through print display advertising - a market that is in structural decline to the tune of around 20% annually. Though standard.co.uk is growing, virtually all newspapers are finding digital advertising is growing far more slowly than print advertising is falling. Aside from this monumental structural threat, the sharp rise in the cost of newsprint as a result of the fall in the pound after Brexit has damaged the balance sheet of almost all newspapers. Simple mathematics dictates that, even if it significantly outperforms the rest of the display advertising market (as it is currently doing), the Standard will struggle to maintain profitability. Mr Osborne will work at the Standard from 05:00 GMT to midday Therefore Osborne's task will be as much commercial as editorial: finding fresh revenue streams, perhaps through ticketing, data, and above all events in London. With a roster of high-level international contacts, including in the world of finance, he is uniquely well placed to deliver that. Indeed I suspect he sees this as an attraction to his job. But it will require a considerable time commitment beyond his hours in the office. Another challenge, which I know he will relish, is picking fights with the government - particularly on the issue of Brexit. To be seen as a Tory lackey, or someone who held back from sharp attacks on former colleagues and friends because he didn't want to damage his still simmering political ambitions, would be fatal for his journalistic integrity. Having dispatched him to the back-benches in a rather brutal manner, Mrs May could soon find that the pages of the Standard are a vehicle for vengeance. Osborne is nothing if not mischievous. He has long had a reputation as one of the hardest-working people in Westminster. He will need to work harder than ever in his new capacity and outline a clear editorial strategy for the paper. The sheer thrill and power of being an Editor, and the chance to make things happen in his native city, will at least initially help to carry him and his staff. Lebedev has long argued there's life in print yet. After this - the most interesting, unexpected and bold appointment of an editor in living memory - who could doubt him?

"A barber who listens - Tom Chapman wants men to open up Torquay barber Tom Chapman wants to let everyone know it's OK to talk to him - about anything. Since losing a good friend to suicide, he has made it his mission to help men in a similar frame of mind by encouraging them to come to his shop and open up about their emotional and mental health. ""Men have a fear of being seen to be weak and that's why they don't open up but they get nothing but support when they do. ""It's like there's a stigma we've built up inside ourselves,"" he says. He set up the Lions Barber Collective, which started with a book to raise money and has now snowballed into a national campaign to increase awareness of men's mental health. Barbers around the country are being trained to recognise signs of depression and suicidal tendencies, listen to clients' mental health issues and advise them on the best places to go for support. If Tom is worried about someone, he will ask important questions like, 'Are you suicidal?' and 'Have you tried to take your own life?'"". At his barbershop, next to the football stadium in Torquay, men are directed to the Samaritans, Mind and suicide prevention charity Papyrus, and made aware of local free counselling. Tom knows he can't turn every barber into a counsellor, but he does want men to know that barbershops are a safe place to talk. The collective is now training hairdressing students to adopt their approach and there are plans to develop an app. And the efforts appear to be working. Just the other day a bearded, tattooed biker gang leader came by to chat. ""We saved three lives in Torquay last year,"" Tom says, proudly. Quads bikes enable the Brighton and Hove seafront team to get to people in crisis quickly In Brighton and Hove, the eight miles of coastline can be a treacherous place and Roger De Casanove and his seafront team are usually the first to identify someone in distress. Equipped with quad bikes and a patrol vehicle, complete with basic medical kit, they can be anywhere on the seafront in less than eight minutes - much faster than an ambulance. Roger has done the job for just a year but admits he has been ""astounded"" by how much of his time is spent preventing and dealing with suicides. ""Seeing someone in a state of hopelessness and despair is very hard. ""But, for me, it is being able to provide a service that can make a real difference to people in crisis,"" he says. The seafront officers, who are responsible for everyone's safety along the coastline, have been trained specifically to respond quickly in these kinds of situations. Quad bikes and surfboards are often used to rescue vulnerable people off Brighton and Hove Working with a team of 30 lifeguards who are posted along the beach, they try to stop people from harming themselves in the sea, saving lives using equipment such as surfboards and tubes. Sometimes it means working closely with other emergency services such as the police, coastguard and the NHS. On other occasions it may just mean offering support and advising people where to go next for professional help. A local charity, Grassroots Suicide Prevention, trained up the seafront team on how to be alert to people at risk of suicide, how to prevent and intervene in suicide attempts and how to handle self-harm. None of it is easy to handle, Roger says, but the response is much more co-ordinated than it used to be. A&E departments can now call the seafront team direct if they are worried about someone who has just left their care. This means they will try to engage with people who seem vulnerable before they get into danger. Last year, 12 vulnerable people were rescued from the water along the seafront and many more were helped to address mental health problems. TheHouse of Commons health committee says,externalthe current rate of suicide is unacceptable and may not be an accurate reflection of the true scale of loss of life. Suicide is the main cause of death in young people under 35 - more than 1,600 take their own lives every year, three-quarters of them young men. Councils were given the responsibility of developing local suicide action plans in 2012 and now 95% of local authorities have one. Like Brighton's seafront team, projects involving barbers in Torbay and a rural support network for farmers in Lincolnshire have been a huge success. But MPs say there is more that can be done in other areas. The health committee wants to see: people who are not usually in contact with health services and those who are vulnerable being reached by the plans all patients discharged from inpatient mental health care followed up within three days better recording of suicides to work out the best ways of preventing them happening Rural support networks target farmers, who have one of the highest suicide rates in the UK Farmers are often hard-to-reach groups who can be vulnerable to mental health issues, says Alison Twiddy, project manager at the charity Lincolnshire Rural Support Network. She says the nature of the job can mean people are isolated both geographically and from communities - and sometimes a stoic spirit means they don't always reach out for help. It may also be getting harder and more complicated to run small businesses with more legislation and paperwork involved, she says. But it is not easy to get away from the business for a break when you have made it your home. All these things and many more factors contribute to the reasons famers have one of the highest suicide rates in the UK. To help, the charity has set up health checks in farmers' markets. While nurses, employed by the NHS, do blood pressure and blood sugar tests, they ask how the farmers are doing - whether they are sleeping well and whether there are any troubles on the farm or with family, for example. During health checks, farmers are also asked about their worries Alison says because the health checks have become part of the community and the nurses ask questions informally, people sometimes open up and tell them about their struggles. Sometimes farmers are concerned about how to keep a farm going or whether the land will be passed on. Others, for example, feel overwhelmingly guilty about no longer wanting to farm when the land has been in their families for countless generations. For some people a combination of worries can just be too much to bear. If the charity is concerned about any farmers or their families, it can suggest they get in contact with their GPs or other services. But it also has a host of volunteers who can help with practical advice. There are land agents, solicitors and accountants who sometimes volunteer for the charity and offer advice to help people get back on track. Alison says: ""Most of our work is around a farm table. We try to get the right volunteers involved and try to get some solutions.""

Osborne will get into the office around 05:00 GMT, work until midday, and then balance his other duties thereafter. But aside from persuading constituents he is still available to them, he faces a huge challenge in keeping the Standard profitable. As a free paper, with no cover price to raise, the Standard generates the vast majority of its revenues through print display advertising - a market that is in structural decline to the tune of around 20% annually. Though standard.co.uk is growing, virtually all newspapers are finding digital advertising is growing far more slowly than print advertising is falling. Aside from this monumental structural threat, the sharp rise in the cost of newsprint as a result of the fall in the pound after Brexit has damaged the balance sheet of almost all newspapers. Simple mathematics dictates that, even if it significantly outperforms the rest of the display advertising market (as it is currently doing), the Standard will struggle to maintain profitability. Mr Osborne will work at the Standard from 05:00 GMT to midday Therefore Osborne's task will be as much commercial as editorial: finding fresh revenue streams, perhaps through ticketing, data, and above all events in London. With a roster of high-level international contacts, including in the world of finance, he is uniquely well placed to deliver that. Indeed I suspect he sees this as an attraction to his job. But it will require a considerable time commitment beyond his hours in the office. Another challenge, which I know he will relish, is picking fights with the government - particularly on the issue of Brexit. To be seen as a Tory lackey, or someone who held back from sharp attacks on former colleagues and friends because he didn't want to damage his still simmering political ambitions, would be fatal for his journalistic integrity. Having dispatched him to the back-benches in a rather brutal manner, Mrs May could soon find that the pages of the Standard are a vehicle for vengeance. Osborne is nothing if not mischievous. He has long had a reputation as one of the hardest-working people in Westminster. He will need to work harder than ever in his new capacity and outline a clear editorial strategy for the paper. The sheer thrill and power of being an Editor, and the chance to make things happen in his native city, will at least initially help to carry him and his staff. Lebedev has long argued there's life in print yet. After this - the most interesting, unexpected and bold appointment of an editor in living memory - who could doubt him?

"Nadine started life as a robotic receptionist but Professor Nadia Thalmann believes she can be developed into a carer The receptionist at the Institute of Media Innovation, at Singapore's Nanyang Technological University, is a smiling brunette called Nadine. From a distance, nothing about her appearance seems unusual. It's only on closer inspection that doubts set in. Yes - she's a robot. Nadine is an ""intelligent"" robot capable of autonomous behaviour. For a machine, her looks and behaviour are remarkably natural. She can recognise people and human emotions, and make associations using her knowledge database - her ""thoughts"", so to speak. At IMI, they are still fine-tuning her receptionist skills. But soon, Nadine might be your grandma's nurse. Research into the use of robots as carers or nurses is growing. It's not hard to see why. The global population is ageing, putting strain on healthcare systems. Although many 80-year-olds may only need a friend to chat to, or someone to keep an eye out in case they fall, increasingly the elderly are suffering serious ailments, such as dementia. Friendships like that between Frank Langella's character and his robot carer in the film Robot and Frank could be a thing of the future How can we provide quality care to address this array of needs? Many experts think an answer could be robots. Nadine is being developed by a team led by Prof Nadia Thalmann. They have been working on virtual human research for years; Nadine has existed for three. ""She has human-like capacity to recognise people, emotions, and at the same time to remember them,"" says Prof Thalmann. Nadine will automatically adapt to the person and situation she deals with, making her ideally suited to looking after the elderly, Prof Thalmann says. The robot can monitor a patient's wellbeing, call for help in an emergency, chat, read stories or play games. ""The humanoid is never tired or bored,"" says Prof Thalmann. ""It will just do what it is dedicated for."" Nadine isn't perfect, though. She has trouble understanding accents, and her hand co-ordination isn't the best. But Prof Thalmann says robots could be caring for the elderly within 10 years. US technology giant IBM is also busy with robo-nurse research, in partnership with Rice University, in Houston, Texas. They have created the IBM Multi-Purpose Eldercare Robot Assistant (Mera). IBM Research's Aging in Place Environment room Mera can monitor a patient's heart and breathing by analysing video of their face. It can also see if the patient has fallen, and pass information to carers. However, not everyone is ready for a robot carer, acknowledges Susann Keohane, IBM global research leader for the strategic initiative on aging. This view is backed by research by Gartner, which found ""resistance"" to the use of humanoid robots in elderly care. People were not comfortable with the idea of their parents being cared for by robots, despite evidence it offers value for money, says Kanae Maita, principal analyst in personal technologies innovation at Gartner Research. Amid this scepticism, IBM believes its Internet of Things (IoT) research may prove more immediately valuable. The firm is studying how sensors and IoT can identify changes in physical conditions or anomalies in a person's environment. By recording atmospheric readings - such as carbon dioxide - in a patient's room, carers could understand a person's habits, such as when they eat lunch, or take a walk, without invading their private space. Carers could spot changes remotely and respond accordingly. Ms Keohane says: ""There's a real opportunity to create new innovative solutions, including the use of robotics and the Internet of Things, that will help people extend their independence, and enrich their quality of life."" While widespread use of humanoids may be a long way off, robo-pets are already in use across the world. Robotic Paro seal trials with dementia patients have had positive results Developed in Japan, Paro is a therapeutic baby seal that has been shown to reduce the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia. The seals respond to touch and are designed to make eye contact. About 5,000 are in use. Clinical trials with dementia patients, conducted by Dr Sandra Petersen's team at the University of Texas at Tyler, found Paro improved symptoms such as depression, anxiety and stress. The need for symptom-related medication reduced by a third. In some cases the results were even more remarkable. Dr Petersen says: ""Some patients that were non-verbal began speaking again - first to the seal, then to others about the seal."" There are drawbacks to robo-pets, Dr Petersen admits - notably the cost. A Paro costs about $5,000 (Â£4,000). There is also a reluctance by some in the medical profession to adopt non-pharmacological therapies. Nonetheless, Dr Petersen believes the Paro may have a role in many health-related settings, as the seal's artificial intelligence allows it be programmed to adapt to a variety of behaviours. ""I think the Paro may have a role in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, in neurocognitive rehabilitation with stroke patients, and with pain management or palliative care patients,"" she says. ""Autism-spectrum children may benefit from interaction with the seal."" Inevitably, there are downsides to robotic solutions. One issue, says Prof Sethu Vijayakumar, director of Edinburgh University's Centre for Robotics, is whether the spread of humanoid carers could lead to the increasing isolation of the elderly. Nadine's robotic hand is remarkably life-like ""We have to ask: are [robots] isolating people more, or really helping people?"" Prof Vijayakumar says. The use of robotics also raises concerns about personal data issues, he says. ""The quality and personalisation of [robotic] services are directly proportionate to the amount of data you're willing to release to the system. Your data becomes a type of currency for access to better services. ""It's an interesting ethical trade-off. A very sensitive area."" Doubts aside, Prof Vijayakumar says the growth of robo-care is inevitable. ""Demographics being the way it is, we will see significant use of robotics in dealing with the problems of old age.""

" It's the summer of 2000 in a resort on the south coast of England, and a well-dressed Chinese woman in her early 40s is trying to buy a balloon. Not a party balloon for the kids - a giant helium balloon like the one right in front of her, carrying holidaymakers 400ft up into the air. “It was right in the middle of Bournemouth, by the end of the pier in the lower garden, and Gu Kailai just turned up one day and asked to see whoever was in charge,” says Giles Hall, the balloon's owner. She said, 'I want one of these things in my town in China.' We thought it was a joke. She was draped in jewellery and expensive clothes so we knew she was wealthy but we didn't quite understand what the situation was.” It wasn't a joke. For Hall, this pier-end conversation was the beginning of a two-year effort to satisfy Gu, and he quickly discovered his client was hot-tempered and suspicious. Gu Kailai on a Bournemouth balloon ride “We'd have these huge arguments on the phone and she'd say, 'You're threatening me, you're threatening me!' And I'd say, 'I'm not threatening you I'm just telling you the facts!' And one got the distinct impression that if one pushed her too far she could really be dangerous,” he says. To help with this bizarre business deal, Gu brought in a British middleman who spoke Chinese - Neil Heywood. Neil Heywood One of his tasks, Hall says, was to get the balloon through customs without paying import duties. “He'd pick us up in a car with a shoebox in the back seat that would have £50,000 ($62,000), which he called his funny money - hisbunga bunga money he used to call it for getting things he wanted. It was all very dubious behaviour! “I used to ask him, 'Where did this come from?' And he just used to tap the side of his nose.” The balloon was bound for a city called Dalian, which is where Gu and Heywood had first met, several years earlier. Dalian's stony beach is peopled by hunched figures with steel claw hammers. Through rocks and slime, they dig for worms and sell them, wriggling in plastic cups, to fishermen. In the 1990s, few people outside China had heard of this gritty port city - next stop North Korea. It was an unlikely destination for a young British expat with an expensive education. Tall and elegant - white linen suits in summer and tweeds in winter - Neil Heywood must have stood out amid the rusting factories and crumbling Soviet-style tower blocks. He started as an English teacher, learned Chinese, found a local wife, and re-invented himself as a business consultant. I spent weeks interviewing people and no-one could tell me exactly why he was there. Former British diplomat Kerry Brown, who met Heywood once on a trip to the city, describes it as “puzzling”. There weren't many British business people in provincial China back then, he says, and all of them seemed to have a strange back story. Neil Heywood's back story may have included a relationship with British intelligence - several sources have told me, off the record, that he worked as an informant. However it's not clear when that relationship began, and British officials refuse to comment. But more on this later. Here I'm going to come clean. Despite months of trying and hundreds of interview requests all over the world, there are many things we don't know about this story. There are no heroes in it, only villains and victims. And it's a descent into the dark heart of Chinese elite politics... which is dangerous. Most people who know the story from the inside are dead, in jail or unwilling to talk. There is a good source, though, when it comes to Gu Kailai's back story - her friend and former colleague, Larry Cheng. The expensively dressed woman buying a helium balloon in Bournemouth hadn't always been able to count on wealth and comfort, he says. She started life privileged, for sure - her father had been an army general - but then came the chaos and terror of Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution and, like so many of the Chinese elite, her parents were thrown into jail. “She was reduced to being a beggar. When her parents were in prison, she was begging outside,” says Cheng. “She did manual labour, she worked as a butcher. She didn't have much schooling but she taught herself and then used her connections to get into Peking University.” Peking University is the Oxford of China, so Gu was not just a survivor, she was a striver. And after Mao's death her family was back in favour. She'd got the education. She started her own law firm. Also on the checklist - the husband. At the top level Chinese politics and business are a man's game, so an ambitious woman needs a powerful husband. When they fell in love he was already married. But the wife was no match for Gu - remembered by Cheng as petite, elegant and very persuasive, a woman who drew a lot of attention wherever she went. The lovers pushed through the divorce, against the wife's protests, and got married. Back then they lived in a small room without a toilet, Cheng remembers, with a curtain to separate the bed from the table and chairs. Even the Chinese elite lived humbly in the 1980s. But China was about to hit the big time and so were the newlyweds. By the 1990s, Gu's husband was China's most up-and-coming politician and serving as mayor in Dalian, the city where  Heywood was trying to carve out a career as a business consultant. The mayor's name? Bo Xilai. Bo Xilai Heywood's friend James Richards, once a diplomat in China then a businessman, remembers hearing a story about the young British expat going on a cycle ride and bumping into Bo Xilai - a chance meeting that was the start of a lasting relationship. “There was goodwill between him and that family,” Richards says. “And China being China I'd be surprised if he wasn't able to ask them to lend a hand here and there with the different businesses he was involved with.” The discreet lending of a hand is what Chinese politicians and business people do for each other all the time. The politician has the power to grant things like permits and land rights, and the businessman has the money. But they can't be seen to trade. They need intermediaries. This is the kind of role in which Heywood excelled, notes the Bournemouth balloon man, Giles Hall. “Neil Heywood had put himself out to any company that wanted to deal in China. He could 'smooth the way', that's how it was put,"" says Hall. And he was good at it, Hall says, because he knew the right people. So let's take stock. There's a young Englishman on the make. There is money to be made. There is a fairy-tale first couple who've now had a son - a dynasty in the making. We're heading for a happy ending, right? Dalian's seafront can be a lonely place in winter. The Ferris wheel silent, the haunted house empty, go-kart announcements on an endless loop. Gu's life was not the fairy tale that it seemed. Because behind all the communist pieties about humble living and public service, Chinese politics was back to what it had always been over the centuries - a game of power and sex. Gu Kailai told Larry Cheng that Bo was unfaithful. “Every day she felt sad and lonely. She even tried to kill herself because the man she loved was having affairs,” he says. “She had a scar on her wrist from a knife. She was trying to scare Bo. She was in such low spirits, so she took sleeping pills and tranquillisers. She drank a lot, too."" And like discarded empresses and concubines throughout imperial history, Gu started to look elsewhere for love. Chinese literature even has an expression for women in her situation - the red apricot. “She was a red apricot leaning over the palace wall and down toward the street. In the beginning, I think Kailai was the typical wailing woman in the palace, then she leaned out to the street. She lost all principle. If any man was useful to her, she might take him as a lover. Her personal life was a mess,” says Cheng. In Dalian many people told me - off the record - about the long list of lovers. In 1999 Gu turned her back on her loveless marriage. From then on, she and her husband would be a partnership in public only. Restless in the confines of provincial party politics, she made it her goal to turn her son into a member of the global elite. And where better to learn the English of the ruling class than in England? Through her contacts she found a language school in Bournemouth and rented a top-floor apartment in the resort. It was in a grey concrete block opposite an Italian restaurant called Valentino's. Owner Giuseppe Flacchi says she visited the restaurant often, but never smiled and always seemed very busy. Gu did her business round the red checked tablecloth. Moving money out of China through tax havens and into property in the West, with the help of a shifting cast of intermediaries, including Heywood. Valentino's restaurant, Bournemouth It's what many elite families were doing - getting their kids and money out of China. So Gu wasn't the exception. She was the rule. And it all made a big impression on Giles Hall. “We used to have meals in the Italian restaurant with Gu Kailai and Neil Heywood and she would often lose her temper. She'd say things like 'Have you transferred that money to New York to X? She needs that $14m!'” says Hall. “And I remember thinking '$14m!' and I looked at my secretary and she couldn't believe it either! And he'd say: 'No, I'll do it next week.' And she flew off the handle and shot out of the restaurant.” Where was the $14m coming from? Gu didn't have a job any more and her husband, the mayor, was - officially - earning about $18,000 (£15,000) a year. But for those in power, there's no shortage of money in China. One thing Gu needed money for was her new project - getting her son an expensive education at one of the grandest British private schools, Harrow. She asked Giles Hall if he would add £240,000 ($290,000) to his company's invoice for a helium balloon and then give her the money to pay the school fees, but he refused. I said, 'I can't take a quarter of million pounds out of the company to pay school fees and get cash back. Not an option.' That is when we first saw the animosity she had, the steely look in her eyes. “She threatened all of us and said, 'My friend is the police chief in Dalian and if you ever come to China again I'll throw you in jail and you'll never see the light of day.' I had protection for some while because she got very, very threatening."" Giles Hall isn't the only person in Bournemouth who has lurid stories about Gu's money laundering - boxes full of cash, private jets, threats - though most are scared to speak on the record. There were occasionally tensions between Gu and Heywood, Hall noted. He got a sense that Gu didn't fully trust her British business fixer to transfer funds, and not to keep something back for himself. “I think he had got greedy,"" Hall says. And don't forget the story of the red apricot. In Bournemouth Gu went on having affairs with those who proved useful. We don't know whether that included Heywood. But their relationship was certainly intense. “He always said to us, 'If she ever does anything to me, I'll have her throat cut,'"" says Hall. ""He was a great threat because he knew everything that went on. Knew all the shenanigans, the way money was shifted around, bank accounts - knew everything."" Bo Xilai always stood out. Tall and handsome, as a young man he never seemed to stop smiling. “Bo Xilai was the biggest figure in my class,” says Gu Jian, who shared a desk with him for three years at journalism college in Beijing. He remembers the day they met - the first day of term in 1979 - and so does one of their old teachers, an American, Stephen Mackinnon. “He was tall, gawky, very simply dressed, kind of bony - he had a big head,” Mackinnon recalls. “And he was always kind of smiling. Eager to take on the world.” Bo with his friend Gu Jian, 1979 Like Gu Kailai, Bo was a member of the communist aristocracy, his father Bo Yibo a hero of the civil war that brought the communists to power. But during the Cultural Revolution Chairman Mao threw Bo Yibo in jail. Bo Xilai's mother committed suicide and he himself lost a decade shovelling coal. Then Mao died, China woke up, and Bo could start planning a political career. Aged 30 he finally got to university. “They dressed like workers... very ordinary, in beat-up clothes. We were living in dorms. It was pretty simple - not fancy, that's for sure,” says Mackinnon. Mackinnon remembers how Bo became a hero for his classmates when he turned up to a picnic with two cases of beer, then in short supply but still available in Zhongnanhai, the closed compound where top leaders live and work. Bo lived like other students during the week. But his dad was now out of jail and back at the top table, so come the weekend he returned to that high-walled, secretive compound for the elite. Sometimes he took his classmate, Gu Jian, who marvelled at their satellite dish. He'd never seen one before, or been in a house showing foreign broadcasts on six TV screens. Only a few years earlier, under Chairman Mao, even listening to foreign radio could have got you executed. But the perks didn't stop at satellite TV. Sex was also part of this life of entitlement. At this point Bo was already married - to his first wife. But being married never stopped him from playing the field - and a reputation for sleeping around didn't go down well with the communist old guard, to say nothing of his wife and her powerful family. One day Bo  called Gu Jian complaining of a fever and asked him to visit him in Zhongnanhai. As Gu Jian walked into Bo's house, the guard outside told him to persuade his friend to stop having affairs. I said to Bo, 'If you want to be a politician, don't do this, you mustn't do this. If you want to have affairs, go be a businessman, and no-one will care, but don't be a politician.' He didn't say anything, but carried on.” Bo was on to his second wife - Gu Kailai - by the time he got his first big job, as mayor of Dalian, in 1994. He was a mayor like no other. He turned a rust-belt port into a green and modern city. He built museums, five-star hotels, parks and squares. He was more like an emperor than a mayor, and his old teacher Stephen Mackinnon came to the emperor's court to see what all the fuss was about. “He said you've got to do three great things to make your city noticed,” Mackinnon remembers. “You want to have green everywhere. You want to have China's best football team. And the other thing is fashion shows.” Fashion shows? Bo used government money to set up a modelling school filled with gorgeous young women, and then put on fashion shows to prove to his visitors just how beautiful Dalian was. Not just the greenery and the museums but the women too. “He surrounded himself with beautiful women. If you weren't beautiful you couldn't work for him,” says his wife's friend and former colleague, Larry Cheng. “He stayed late at work and hardly ever went home. His office lights were always on even in the middle of the night. The people of Dalian thought he was working so hard and said they had a great mayor. But he was probably up to something with those beautiful women.” I've talked to several government people in Dalian who say Gu did a good job of scaring off at least one rival. They also say there were young models who simply disappeared. I couldn't get to the bottom of these rumours. But this is China. If you control a city, you control the police, the courts and the media. You can make people appear... and you can make them disappear. One man who has first-hand experience of this is Dalian businessman Zhang Yongxiang. One moment Bo wanted Zhang's help in taking down one of his enemies, the next he had become an enemy himself, finding out what it meant to incur the mayor's displeasure. He says Bo set up a team of interrogators, who tortured his family, forcing them to endure nine days and nights of interrogation without sleep. Sixteen members of the family were detained, and police were hunting for more. “My cousin was on the train from Dalian to Shanghai to take my sister-in-law to hospital. On the way back, he somehow fell off the train and was killed,” says Zhang. “The police said he jumped. But I don't believe them. Did they beat him to death? Did they shoot him dead? The police owe us answers.” And until they get those answers, the family refuses to bury the body. They've been waiting 15 years. That's the dark side of Bo Xilai's Dalian. None of it was visible to the public. As far as they were concerned they had a perfect mayor and he had a perfect wife. Charming, good-looking… one Western businessman who worked in Dalian in those days compares them to JFK and Jackie Kennedy. Though their marriage was by now a sham, husband and wife still kept up appearances for the sake of the power and the money. But Dalian was never going to provide enough of either. Bo had his sights on the Chinese leadership and by 2004, he was playing for China on the international stage. He'd been promoted to minister of commerce - a job that put him across the negotiating table from European trade commissioner Peter Mandelson. “Power exuded from him. It surrounded him. When you were dealing with him you felt you were dealing with the main man,” Mandelson remembers. The two men were trying to hammer out a crucial deal on textiles, and this story tells you everything you need to know about Bo the operator. “At first Bo was completely unhelpful. No, no, no and no were the answers I got,” says Mandelson. Then suddenly, when he was at a meeting in Cairo, he got a call to say Bo would see him in Shanghai in 48 hours. Mandelson hurried to Shanghai - changing planes, struggling to prepare for the meeting, but relieved that Bo was at last prepared to talk. “He'd lined up 100 officials down one side of a table in the state guest house in Shanghai,” says Mandelson. “I arrived with three men and a dog as my team.” The negotiations went on for 12 hours, during which Mandelson and his colleagues were given very little to eat or drink. The Chinese team were all being handed large vitamin C tablets, he says, but these were not offered to the Europeans. Finally an agreement was reached, and a huge press conference was held to announce the result at four o'clock in the morning. “I think Bo knew exactly what he was going to end up doing,” says Mandelson. “He knew what sort of agreement he would eventually embrace. I was kept completely in the dark until the last moment when finally he did the business.” The timing was great. A big national leadership change was coming up and Bo hoped to make it to the very top - the standing committee of the Communist Party politburo, where a handful of men make all the key decisions. Backing him was his father, a revered and still immensely powerful party elder. Seriously elder - 98. And then, just when Bo needed him most, the old man died. Chinese politics is all about the patriarch, the clan, the tribe. The loss of his father left Bo exposed. Gu Kailai and Bo Xilai at his father's funeral There were so many people he had crossed. His jilted first wife and her powerful family, the communist old guard who were scandalised by his sex life, and many more. He drove his juniors hard, he undermined his seniors. And then there were his political rivals - the men who were also fighting for a place at that top table. These enemies now united against him. He was posted to Chongqing, a city 1,000 miles from Beijing and notorious for its gangsters, gambling and vendettas. But Bo's biggest problem in Chongqing would not be the crime gangs and their political backers but the woman at his side - his wife, Gu Kailai. In November 2011, four years after the move to Chongqing, and more than a decade after their balloon-buying days in Bournemouth, Gu summoned Neil Heywood from his home in Beijing to Chongqing. Before Heywood left, he had dinner with his old friend, James Richards, who noticed that he was becoming increasingly disenchanted “with the natural entitlement to privilege and power that he found among these people”. “He certainly found the atmosphere of distrust, suspicion, back-stabbing increasingly oppressive. My last meeting with him, I remember coming away thinking he did seem quite unhappy and depressed and anxious,” Richards says. He said nothing about fear of being attacked or murdered but I came away with a sense of his unease about his situation in China. And I think at that point he would have probably wished to leave China in the near future.” Heywood didn't leave China. On 13 November 2011 he boarded a flight to Chongqing. Sitting next to him was Gu Kailai's loyal servant - a man who knew what was about to happen in the Lucky Holiday Hotel. Bo Xilai didn't want to be out in the sticks. If he couldn't hog the spotlight in Beijing, then he was going to bring that spotlight with him. His old teacher, Stephen Mackinnon, was struck by his one-time student's refusal to keep his head down and accept political defeat. “When he went to Chongqinq he's going to make a splash and go for it and really grandstand or do dramatic things,” Mackinnon says. “He must have known it was risky. He felt he'd been marginalised and they were putting him out to pasture, so what the hell!” The whole of China looked on spellbound as Bo did something no-one had dared to do since Mao. He went above the Communist Party machine and spoke directly to the public. He dusted off the propaganda campaigns of early communist China. He had Chongqing singing Mao's songs at mass rallies - 100,000 people amid a sea of red flags. Disgusted by the corruption that had flourished under previous leaders, the public loved it. But it wasn't just political theatre that Bo brought to Chongqing. He also started improving people's lives - building roads, fixing street lamps, cleaning the city. He raised salaries and improved healthcare. For this he needed money and one way he got it was to ""arrest rich people, call them criminals, and confiscate their assets"", says Li Zhuang, a high-flying lawyer who represented some of the targets. ""Apartments, villas, office buildings, cars, bank deposits - everything would be confiscated. For a small crime boss tens of millions. For a big crime boss it could be more than 100 million... overnight.” Bo arrested thousands and executed powerful people. Again, the public loved it. But in China, no politician can go after the rich and well-connected without the support of the chief of police. For this role, Bo had found the perfect partner, a man both ruthless and daring - Wang Lijun. Wang arrived at crime scenes brandishing weapons and surrounded by TV cameras. He even had his own show - Iron-Blooded Police Spirit - which dramatised his life fighting crime.And it gets weirder. Wang Lijun attended executions, sources tell me, supervised the harvesting of prisoners' organs and even conducted his own post-mortem examinations. Wang Lijun “Wang and Bo were very similar. Both of them liked to do things on an epic scale, they liked to make headlines. Put them together and it was an explosive mix,” says Li Zhuang. Both of them were crazy. And the atmosphere they created was frenzied, intense... it was insane. Chongqing was a police kingdom.” In China, the police like their headquarters to look intimidating. But even by Chinese standards, Chongqing's is massive. Wang didn't just work in it, he lived in it. He was paranoid. He thought people were out to get him and so, his staff say, his secretary had to taste every plate of food he ate, even down to sipping his cups of tea to make sure they weren't poisoned. A paranoid narcissist living in a fortress and blurring the line between fact and fiction.The people of Chongqing will not forget Wang Lijun quickly. Chongqing's riot police in training Lawyer Li Zhuang has even better reasons to remember him than most, because the police chief turned up in person to arrest him on the tarmac at Chongqing airport - surrounded, of course, by TV cameras and with a film-ready script. “The scene was so over-the-top, loads of police cars surrounding the plane, riot police in helmets and camouflage, armed with submachine guns. I asked, 'Why the big show? Is it Obama's state visit or are you capturing Osama Bin Laden?' “We were surrounded by a huge scrum of reporters. He wanted to show his authority on camera. He was in a trench coat, hands in his pockets. He said: 'Li Zhuang, we meet again.'” Li Zhuang was jailed for 548 days - a year and a half. He says he thought he would die in Chongqing, and that Bo and Wang would rule China. Gu and Wang Ruling China was certainly Bo's ambition. He had been on the 25-man politburo since 2007, but to go even higher he needed to do more than lock up gangsters and their lawyers. He had to take the fight to his political enemies in Beijing. With a loyal police chief by his side, Bo thought he was a match for them. But in room 1605 of the Lucky Holiday Hotel, someone miscalculated. On 13 November 2011 Neil Heywood was murdered. Three days later a fax from the local police arrived at the British consulate in Chongqing. It said a 41-year-old UK citizen had died of excessive alcohol consumption. Gu Kailai had moved to Chongqing to play the part of the politician's wife. But in the frenzied climate of that city she had become ever more isolated and paranoid. Heywood told his friend James Richards that Gu thought she and her husband had been poisoned and were going to die, making her “depressed and angry and vindictive”. And at some point, the fragile trust between Gu and Heywood had broken down completely. “From what Neil said, the estrangement was very clear and definite. And I think it was painful to Neil,” says Richards. The prospect of somehow resolving the issues between them was probably what led Heywood to travel to Chongqing, he says. Villa number 16 of the Lucky Holiday Hotel is at the end of a cul-de-sac, surrounded by vegetation - a secluded and lonely corner of this government-run hotel complex on an isolated hillside. On the day I visit, security guards are very agitated. They don't want me here. Before long three are surrounding me, and others are watching from a balcony. Amid the shouting, I cannot get a word in edgeways. “PLEASE Go! Go! Go! Go, go go go. Out! OK?” shrieks one. The manager tells me to put my questions about Neil Heywood's death - to Neil Heywood. “How can I talk to Neil Heywood when he's dead?” I ask. He laughs and tells me to go to hell to look for Neil Heywood there. Five weeks after the death, a memorial service was held at a church on the banks of the River Thames in London. There was no body to bury. It had been cremated - without a post-mortem - two days after the British consulate had been notified of the death. And the cause of death was unclear. While the fax from the police to the British consulate had given the cause of death as “excessive alcohol consumption” Heywood's family had been told that he died of a heart attack. James Richards did not believe either story. Heywood was 41, slim, and did not look like someone who would have a heart attack, he says. Nor was he a great drinker. “When I heard that he'd died in Chongqing, and further that his body had been cremated soon after his death, my suspicions grew,” Richards says. “To the point where if I'd been asked to place a bet one way or the other, I'd have said I believed he was likely to have been murdered.” Back in Chongqing, it was business as usual. Police chief Wang Lijun had done his job - forensic evidence had conveniently disappeared, the body had been cremated and officers silenced. No problem. But then something went very wrong between the politician, his wife and his police chief. Twelve weeks after the murder, Wang was running for his life. On 6 February, the man who normally loved the limelight got into his car under cover of darkness. Disguised as an old woman, he drove 320km (200 miles) to the nearest US consulate, in Chengdu, and begged for protection. He told an astonishing story. Wang Lijun told the Americans that Gu Kailai had murdered Neil Heywood - and that Bo Xilai was now out to murder him. US diplomats found themselves thrust into the middle of a Chinese political drama, their consulate practically under siege. Growing numbers of armed police cordoned off the streets around the building, some loyal to Bo, others to his political enemies in Beijing. Both wanted control of Wang and his explosive story. The decision about what to do with the would-be defector was a delicate one for US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. Wang did not meet the conditions for asylum, she said later, noting that he had a record of “corruption, of thuggishness, brutality” in his role as an “enforcer” for Bo. The Americans chose to give Wang to Beijing, and he disappeared into detention. Everything now began to unravel for Bo and Gu. Bo was removed from his post as party boss of Chongqing, while on 10 April came a sensational double blow. Bo was suspended from the politburo, and simultaneously Gu was arrested on suspicion of involvement in the murder of Neil Heywood. It was China's biggest political crisis since the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989, laying bare a savage struggle at the top of the Communist Party. Three spectacular show trials followed. First in the dock, in August 2012, was Gu. She was charged with murder, and made a full confession. From her testimony, and that of her assistant, this is the picture that emerges from the evening of Heywood's death. A car takes him from the airport, along Chongqing's new highways and up a winding mountain road to the Lucky Holiday Hotel villa complex. Heywood and Gu have dinner, and in his room they share a nightcap. Heywood gets drunk, staggers to the bathroom, and slips over in his own vomit. Gu calls in her assistant who's been waiting outside the bedroom door - the same person who accompanied Heywood from Beijing. Together, they drag Neil Heywood on to the bed. He begs for water. Gu drips poison into his mouth. She waits until she can no longer feel Neil Heywood's pulse. And then she scatters pills around the room to make it look like an overdose. And as she leaves she hangs the “Do Not Disturb” sign on the door. The trial lasted a mere seven hours and foreign reporters weren't allowed in. All we've got to go on is an account released by the court - and it's worth pointing out that in China the Communist Party controls the courts. Everything that happens is decided in advance to suit those in power. “This case has been like a huge stone weighing on me for more than half a year. What a nightmare,” Gu said in her testimony. She committed murder, she told the court, to protect her only child, Guagua, because his life was under threat from… Neil Heywood. Guagua's life had been mapped for greatness. He was born into a political dynasty - the Bo family - at a time when China was fast becoming a world power. He started life among the Chinese elite, but his mother had bigger plans, which is why she took him, at the age of 12, to the UK. Guagua made an unfavourable impression on Giles Hall, the Bournemouth balloon operator, who met him often during business meetings with Gu. Gu, Bo and their son Guagua “The child was very hard to like, I have to tell you. He was described by Neil Heywood as an 'arrogant prick'. Which he was,” Hall says. “He wouldn't look you in the eye, he wouldn't shake your hand. He'd be rude to his mother in her company with you. Everybody who was around him was treated as subservient.” Guagua was always asking for more pocket money, Hall says, so Gu would give him £500 - which Heywood would pay out in £50 notes - just to keep him quiet. It was Heywood who helped arrange for Guagua to go to Harrow, his old school. After Harrow, Guagua went to Oxford University, where he gained a reputation as a party animal, and was kicked out of his college for a year for falling behind in his studies. But he just spent the time in a five-star hotel a few hundred yards down the road and was eventually allowed to return to sit his final exams. Then he was off to study public policy at Harvard. Throughout this period, with Guagua's parents thousands of miles away, Heywood remained someone he could turn to. Whether or not he continued to regard him as an “arrogant prick”, on the surface their relationship was cordial. So what evidence was there for Gu's claim that Heywood was threatening Guagua? It all came back to the money. In the transcripts of the trials, Gu admits that Heywood helped her hide assets abroad - money that was moved secretly into property in the West, and paid for Guagua's lifestyle and education. But when she finally sought to sever their financial relationship, he demanded a payment of $2m (£1.4m). The court was shown an email in which he threatened to “destroy” Guagua if he didn't get it. So she killed him. Initially she and the police chief had discussed framing him as a drugs smuggler and killing him in a staged shoot-out at the airport. Only later did she turn to poison. “I had to fight to the death to stop the madness of Heywood,” as she put it. But it was her own madness that she had to prove in order to avoid the death penalty. The official account detailed her insomnia, depression and paranoia. It cast her as a deranged, drug-dependent mother driven to murder a man she believed threatened her son. It worked. She was found guilty of poisoning Heywood but she got off with a suspended death sentence, later reduced to life in prison. Case closed? Perhaps not. Former British diplomat and Chinese politics expert Kerry Brown was left with many questions. He asks what people would think in the reverse case - if a Chinese citizen had been murdered in a hotel, by the wife of a British cabinet member. “I mean would anyone accept the story that was eventually told? The one day of testimony... I felt it was hard to say that was an exhaustive process,” he says. British Foreign Secretary William Hague had described the death as one that “needs to be investigated on its own terms, without political considerations”. But Brown says the British government failed to ask tough questions, and to get a complete record from the Chinese of what happened. Or if they did, it wasn't made public. Conspiracy theories abound. Some think Bo ordered the murder. Others blame the police chief. There are even some who say the woman in court was not Gu but a body double. And there are those who argue that Heywood was murdered because he was an informant for British intelligence. Of course, this factor was never mentioned in court. It wasn't in the Communist Party's interest to reveal that one of its top families had been penetrated by foreign spies. It's a matter of public record that Heywood occasionally worked for a consultancy firm called Hakluyt, founded by former British spies. I also spoke to a number of people who said, off the record, that Heywood regularly passed information to British intelligence officers. Sir Richard Ottaway, who was chair of Parliament's foreign affairs committee when the spy reports surfaced, was told by the Foreign Office that officials had carried on an “informal relationship” with Neil Heywood, and “had taken information”. “I think it would have been pretty dilatory for MI6 not to have had contact with him and perhaps a drink after work to pick his brains about what was going on,” Ottaway says. I wanted to ask the UK government directly about this relationship. And about why, when the British consulate in Chongqing learned of the death in the Lucky Holiday Hotel, there was no demand for a post-mortem of a British government informant - not to mention a 41-year-old moderate drinker who died from over-drinking, as the Chongqing authorities had originally claimed. But the UK government declined to talk to me. Bo Xilai went on trial in August 2013. It was an electrifying moment in the normally sanitised politics of China. He was not accused of Neil Heywood's murder, or even with covering it up. The charge sheet - bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power - was the standard one used against a Communist Party boss. It was a classic Chinese political takedown. Every detail was carefully planned. The 6ft-tall Bo stood in the dock flanked by even taller guards, clearly chosen in an effort to make him look small. But Bo appeared as confident as ever. His former police chief, the gun-toting narcissist Wang Lijun, who had fled to the Americans disguised as an old woman, was the star witness, called to the stand to betray his old boss. He described a dramatic confrontation that took place 11 weeks after the murder. “Bo punched me. My mouth was bleeding, there was liquid dripping out of my ear. “I told him calmly that he needed to face facts. He picked up a glass and smashed it on the floor, and said he could not accept it.” Again, foreign journalists were not allowed in, so these words come from a partial transcript released by the court. Bo wasn't angry about the murder or the cover-up. He was angry because his once loyal police chief had kept forensic evidence pinning the murder on his wife, and a tape of a conversation with Gu secretly recorded the day after the crime. But assaulting Wang was Bo's fatal mistake, the trigger that prompted him to run to the Americans in fear of his life. Without this mistake the world would know nothing of Neil Heywood's murder, the Communist Party not choosing to wash its dirtiest linen in public. The attempt to defect was a huge risk for Wang to take - one that could easily have got him killed. So why did he do it? It's time to turn to Bo's enemies. Neil Heywood's murder took place at a critical moment. Xi Jinping was due to become Communist Party leader and Bo was again fighting for a place at the top table, the politburo standing committee. If he had made it, he might have outshone Xi - a man he had grown up with at the very top of the party. His longstanding rival. “At the elite level they all live together, eat together, they do everything together. There are linkages we wouldn't normally expect. It's like a massive sort of gentleman's club. Like a really, really big family,” says Chinese politics expert Kerry Brown. Bo was better-looking, a more charismatic politician from a more powerful family. From the outside, the obvious winner. But success in Chinese politics has always been about finding your rival's weak points. Here Xi outplayed Bo. The murder in the Lucky Holiday Hotel became Bo's weak point. “Xi Jinping, his supporters and those who hated Bo Xilai crafted this case together,” says journalist Ho Pin, who wrote a book about the murder. I think it's a big conspiracy. It's mainly because of the power struggle in the top leadership in China.” It was “fantastic good fortune” for Xi Jinping to have this tremendously popular politician removed, says Brown. “Bo Xilai, if he'd still been around, would have been a powerful personality to look at - how amazing that he just got removed in this very big way. This may mean Xi is a lucky politician - that's possible - or it may mean that the whole thing was manipulated.” None of this came out in court. The prosecution carefully avoided asking this key question: why had Wang Lijun suddenly confronted his boss with evidence of Gu's guilt, more than two months after Neil Heywood's murder? The most likely explanation is that Bo's enemies were leaning on Wang. They'd already arrested some of his former officers. Wang was afraid he was next and asked his boss for protection - but Bo refused. “Wang Lijun was Bo's dog, following wherever he goes. He was born to be a subordinate,” says lawyer Li Zhuang. Bo didn't have time for the problems of his dog. He was in the fight of his life for a place at that top table. But the pressure kept coming on Wang. Give up Bo or else. The best dirt he had on his boss was the murder - a murder he had himself covered up. Any evidence against his boss would also incriminate him. So Wang went back to Bo for protection. But instead of offering protection, Bo punched him for his impertinence. Bo now knew that Wang had evidence that would destroy him and knew his enemies were closing in. “Bo would have Wang Lijun killed and cover up the murder,” says Li Zhuang. “Then he'd hold a memorial and publicly mourn him, saying his police chief made the ultimate sacrifice on the front line of the gang crackdown. Bo is a fantastic player.” But Wang escaped. It would take 18 months to construct the case that would finally destroy Bo. Because he provided the crucial evidence Wang got off with a mere 15 years. Bo was sentenced to life in prison. According to James Richards, the Heywood scandal “altered the course of Chinese history”. It gave Xi Jinping the perfect opportunity to remove a rival from the party hierarchy and to purge those around Bo Xilai who might also have challenged his growing power. Officially Xi is now “the core of the party leadership”. Unofficially the “chairman of everything”. This concentration of power and prestige would have been much harder to achieve with Bo competing for the limelight. Xi has used his good luck to enforce “a repressive regime”, Richards notes, while showing “an almost obsessive desire to control everything – society, media, information - which could threaten the party"". My colleagues and I were under surveillance for months as we investigated this story. People whose experience I respect warned me it was dangerous. When I went to Chongqing to look for insiders who could tell me about the fall of Bo, only one person - in a city of 30 million - was prepared to talk. We were followed, our phone calls were bugged, and the Communist Party propaganda officials got to everyone, even to my one and only interviewee, before I did. I knocked at his iron-clad door and was met by silence. When the party's enforcers have done their job of intimidation, this what you get. People are rightly scared. Xi's information control may extend even to the UK, if James Richards's experience is anything to go by. As godfather to one of Neil Heywood's children, Richards tried in vain to get compensation for the family, and had a folder on his computer containing hundreds of emails. It was labelled ""Chongqing incident”. He'd always taken it for granted that telephone conversations or emails sent to China from the UK might be intercepted, but he hadn't foreseen that his hard disk was at risk. And yet, one day, when he switched his computer on, the Chongqing folder had gone. Welcome to Xi Jinping's China Bringing down Bo Xilai and others allowed Xi Jinping to present himself as a decent man cleaning up corruption in a decadent party. But Xi has a past too. And as we've seen, the real story is more complicated. You could go so far as to ask, did Gu Kailai even do it - or was she framed? Don't expect the story to change as long as Xi is in power. But afterwards? Anything is possible. China is a country where verdicts can be reversed, and where “one truth is replaced by another”, as James Richards puts it. In the communist state it is the past that is unpredictable.” A case in point: Bo Xilai sits today in the same prison that once held his father, and when the political wind changed 40 years ago his father was released and reinstated at the top. The Bos are a dynasty. And the next generation is not behind bars. Good-time Guagua will be 30 this year. He has recently graduated from Columbia Law School and is lying low in Canada, but law school friend Timothy Kim says Guagua has not forgotten who he is. “He plays it kind of coy. But it seems like he wants to go back at some point to China, and be engaged on some level in either policy or politics,”  Kim says. “After everything happened with his family he made a shift in his life and became a lot more reserved. He's a little bit more serious about what he wants with his career.” Kim draws attention to Guagua's Facebook page. “It's very sparse but his profile picture is an old photo of him and his father. I thought that was telling about his general thoughts about his family and his feelings towards what happened - and perhaps where he'd like to be in the future.” Built with Shorthand",Positive,0.99999917
"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan lifted a pint of Guinness at the annual Friends of Ireland luncheon in Washington, DC. But the symbolic act may have backfired due to the look of the beer in the glass. ""First Mike Pence says 'top of the morning', then Paul Ryan holds up this appalling pint, grave missteps by the US,"" wroteIrish journalist Naomi O'Leary,external. The toast came at the end of a speech on Ryan's Irish roots. ""Ireland may be a small island, but look at all she has given us. Her light floods the world. To America, she is, as General Washington himself said, 'friend of my country in my country's most friendless day.' "" Ryan raised the glass - with a thin layer of foam inches away from the top of the rim - as a gestures of friendship during the annual luncheon, which has occurred since 1983. US President Donald Trump and Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny were also in attendance. ""To what our forefathers have started, and our children will continue. May the light always shine upon them. Slainte,"" he said. On Twitter, pint purists ignored his warm words, and instead focused on his poor pour. ""In a subtle yet cavalier act of diplomacy, Enda has given Paul Ryan the worst pint of Guinness imaginable,"" wrote IrishmanConor O'Neill,external. ""Just how long has that pint been sat there? I can barely look...""wrote Neil Wilson,external, campaigns director for Conservatives for Liberty. ""The tremendous amount of real estate at the top of that pint, probably pulled an hour before,"" lamented Boston-based music critic Emily Reily. And some couldn't help draw comparisons to the frothy pint Barack Obama enjoyed on a trip to Ireland in 2011. But the bottom line remains: Ryan was drinking a beer at lunch while many Americans - and Irish - were still stuck at their desks.

"Bhanwari Devi is a grassroots government worker Bhanwari Devi is an unlikely heroine. Nearly a quarter of a century after the illiterate, low-caste woman was allegedly gang-raped by her high-caste neighbours in the western Indian state of Rajasthan, she refuses to give up her fight for justice. It was her case that resulted in the Indian Supreme Court formulating guidelines to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace, but her attackers remain free, cleared of rape charges by the trial court while her appeal has been heard just once in the high court over the past 22 years. In the interim, two of the accused have died. The attack took place on 22 September 1992 and with the passage of so much time, Bhanwari Devi, now 56, no longer remembers the days and dates clearly, but the memory of the assault is still vivid in her mind. ""It was dusk. My husband and I were working in our fields when they started beating him up with sticks. There were five of them,"" she told me when I visited her at home in Bhateri village, 50km (about 30 miles) from the state capital, Jaipur. She ran to help her husband, pleading with the men to show some mercy, but two of the attackers pinned him down, while the remaining three took turns to rape her. Pioneering Indians is part of the India Direct series. It looks back at men and women  who have helped shape modern India. Other stories from the series: The making of India's only man in space What made these grannies go nude in public? The attackers were Gujjars, the affluent and dominant caste group in the village. Bhanwari Devi and her husband, Mohan Lal Prajapat, are from the low-caste potter community, Kumhar. The men were angry with her for trying to prevent a nine-month-old Gujjar girl's wedding a few months earlier. Bhanwari Devi had worked as a saathin (friend) for the state government's Women's Development Programme (WDP) since 1985, says Jaipur-based women's rights activist Prof Renuka Pamecha. Bhanwari Devi was assaulted in front of her husband Mohan Lal Prajapat Bhanwari Devi shows off her work register Her job involved going door-to-door in the village, campaigning against social ills - she would tell women about hygiene, family planning, the benefits of sending their daughters to school, and she would discourage female foeticide, infanticide, dowry and child marriages. Rajasthan has a huge tradition of child marriages and thousands of children, many just months old, are married off every year. Bhanwari Devi herself was a child bride - she told me she had been married when she was five or six and her husband was eight or nine. Her campaign against child marriage was not an attempt to challenge patriarchy or fight the feudal mindset, but she was just doing her job. And she knew that meddling in the affairs of the Gujjars could invite a backlash, says Dr Pritam Pal, who headed the WDP's training programme and worked very closely with Bhanwari Devi. But, Bhanwari Devi says, she had no choice in the matter. Massive protests were held in Jaipur with thousands marching through the city streets, demanding justice for Bhanwari Devi Many women's rights activists in Rajasthan have worked tirelessly for years to help Bhanwari Devi ""I told the officials that these people were dangerous and that they would come after me. But they said we had to stop all child marriages and a policeman was sent to stop the wedding. But he came, ate wedding sweets, and left."" The family accused her of humiliating them, and still managed to marry off the baby the next day - then seething with anger, they came after Bhanwari Devi. In India's conservative society, even now victims of rape often hesitate to talk about their ordeal because of the shame and stigma associated with sexual crimes. Twenty-five years ago, the situation was worse. ""But Bhanwari Devi is nothing if not a fighter,"" says Dr Pal. When she went public with her complaint, she was accused of lying. Her attackers denied rape and said there had only been a quarrel. A rally was held in Jaipur on 15 December 1995 to protest against the acquittal of the rape accused When Bhanwari Devi (centre) went public with her complaint, she was accused of lying Dr Pal says the police treated her with derision, didn't take her complaint seriously and botched up the investigation. Her medical test was conducted 52 hours later when it should have been done within 24 hours, her scratches and bruises were not recorded, her complaints of physical discomfort were ignored. After local newspapers reported Bhanwari Devi's plight and protests by women's activists, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), India's federal police. The five accused were finally arrested more than a year after the crime, and were charged with harassment, assault, conspiracy and gang rape. While denying them bail in December 1993, Rajasthan high court Judge NM Tibrewal wrote in his order: ""I am convinced that Bhanwari Devi was gang-raped in revenge for attempting to stop the marriage of [one of the accused] Ramkaran's daughter, a minor."" The judgement acquitting the accused men caused immense outrage in India and globally Things, however, went downhill for Bhanwari Devi from there. Over the course of the trial, judges were inexplicably changed five times and, in November 1995, the accused were acquitted of rape - instead, they were found guilty of lesser offences like assault and conspiracy and were all given just nine months in jail. ""It was a dubious judgement,"" says Bharat of the Jaipur-based NGO Vishakha, one of the groups fighting to get justice for her. He cites some of the ""bizarre reasons"" the judge gave while clearing the accused of rape: The village head cannot rape Men of different castes cannot participate in gang rape Elder men of 60-70 years cannot rape A man cannot rape in front of a relative - this was with reference to two of the men, an uncle and nephew A member of the higher caste cannot rape a lower caste women because of reasons of purity Bhanwari Devi's husband couldn't have quietly watched his wife being gang-raped The judgement caused immense outrage in India and globally. Massive protests were held in Jaipur with thousands marching through the city streets, demanding justice. Congress party MP from Rajasthan Girija Vyas called the decision ""politically motivated"". Mohini Giri, who was then head of the Indian government's National Commission for Women, said the court order ""ignored principles of justice"" and wrote a letter to the chief justice appealing to him to ""intervene"". Dr Pritam Pal described Bhanwari Devi as a fighter The state government, which seemed reluctant to appeal against the order, finally challenged it in the Rajasthan high court, but only one hearing has been held in 22 years. Prof Pamecha says justice has remained elusive for Bhanwari Devi, but she is the reason why millions of Indian women are now legally protected against sexual harassment in the workplace. ""The state authorities had refused to help her, saying as her employer, they were not responsible since she was assaulted in her fields. We said the government must take responsibility since the attack on her was because of her work."" So a group of activists from Jaipur and Delhi-based organisations filed a public interest petition in the Supreme Court, demanding that ""workplaces must be made safe for women and that it should be the responsibility of the employer to protect women employee at every step"". Bhanwari Devi's plight was covered by the local media In 1997, the top court came out withVishakha Guidelines,external, laying down norms to protect women from sexual harassment in workplaces. ""It was a revolutionary judgement based on the fundamental rights of women. And the guidelines later became the basis for a 2013 law passed by the Indian parliament to prevent sexual harassment of women at the workplace,"" says Prof Pamecha. ""Bhanwari Devi had no direct role in this law, but she was the catalyst for this, she was the main factor,"" she adds. ""Bhanwari is a very brave woman,"" says Dr Pal. ""The couple were ostracised by the villagers who refused to sell them milk or buy their clay pots. Even their families boycotted them. ""She didn't even get invited to family weddings. But I have never seen a moment when she said she wouldn't fight. She has always wanted justice."" She continues to live in the same village as her attackers Over the years, she has won several awards for her exceptional courage, most recently being recognised by the Delhi Commission for Women on 8 March. But she continues to live in the same village, still carrying on her work as a saathin, still hoping for justice. I ask her and her husband if they ever feel afraid? ""Not for a minute,"" she answers fiercely. ""Didn't you just walk into my house when you came here today? Would I leave my doors unlocked if I was afraid?"" she asks.

" Ten exciting new works have just been added toTen Pieces, the BBC scheme that opens up music to new generations of listeners. This year’s ten are for the 2017/18 academic year, but represent a fantastically diverse mix of genres for everyone to wrap their ears around. There’s one thing that many of the pieces have in common: Hollywood can’t keep its hands off them! Can you identify the blockbusters that borrowed these big-hitting classical tunes? “Flight of the Valkyries” features inApocalypse Now, the Francis Ford Coppola film set during the Vietnam War. We hear it blaring from helicopter speakers as American soldiers attack a Vietmanese village from the air. Sibelius’ Finlandia is quoted throughoutDie Hard 2: Die Harder. Its famously brassy opening is the only thing more bulletproof than Bruce Willis’ overalls. Bach’s Toccata and Fugue in D minor sets the sombre tone for 1975 cult classicRollerball– a film set in a “not too distant future” in which global corporations vie for supremacy via an ultraviolent sport played on rollerskates. In early 2001, Queen B took a break from working on Destiny’s Child’s third album to play the lead inCarmen: A Hip Hopera. The cast also included Mos Def, Rah Digga, Wyclef Jean and Mekhi Phifer. An oppressive-sounding electronic arrangement of “In the Hall of the Mountain King” features inThe Social Network, during the sequence where Mark Zuckerberg’s rivals, the Winkelvoss twins, are striving for glory as college rowers. John Williams’s scores for theStars Warsfilms are littered with references to The Planets – perhaps nowhere more so than in Darth Vader’s Imperial March, which first appears inEpisode V – The Empire Strikes Back. It’s hard to escape the connection with Holst’s “Mars”: not only do the pieces share similar openings, they’re even in the same key. The Lark Ascending featured inMan on Wire. This BAFTA- and Oscar-winning documentary focused on Philippe Petit, the French high-wire artist who in 1974 successfully walked a tightrope stretched between the Twin Towers of New York’s World Trade Centre. It’sMad Max: Fury Road, the fourth film in the Mad Max franchise. We hear it in a scene where the terrifying Bullet Farmer (AKA Major Kalashnikov: scary by name and nature) attacks the goodies’ Rig by night. We also hear it at greater length inthe theatrical teaser trailer. RememberThe Last of the Mohicans? We hear echoes of ""O Fortuna"" in the scene where Daniel Day Lewis and chums are ambushed as they ride through a seemingly deserted clearing. It’s not one for the faint-hearted. A whole generation of people will forever associate Dvořák’s beautiful tune with carbs, thanks to Ridley Scott and his famous""Boy on a Bike"" advert for Hovis, which features a baker's boy freewheeling down the hill of a Yorkshire town after making his deliveries. Ridley Scott shot the ad in 1973 in the same decade he directed The Duellists and Alien. That’s where the similarities end. 1. Henry Purcell: Abdelazer – Rondeau2.

"The 1992 England team before they beat Wales 24-0 at Twickenham to secure back-to-back Grand Slams Six Nations: Ireland v England Venue:Aviva Stadium, DublinDate:18 MarchKick-off:17:00 GMT Coverage:Live on Radio 5 live and on the BBC Sport website. The current England side will eclipse the 1992 team if they match their achievement of back-to-back Grand Slams, says ex-captain Will Carling. Eddie Jones' team face Ireland on Saturday seeking a second Grand Slam in a row - a feat last achieved by England during the Five Nations 25 years ago. Carling, who captained England in both 1991 and 1992, said it would be an ""exceptional"" achievement. ""We are just left in the wake,"" he toldBBC 5 live's Six Nations preview show. ""They went to Australia and won 3-0, never achieved before by England. ""They've then put together back-to-back Grand Slams and a world-record run. It would be a massive achievement."" This video can not be played 1992 v 2017: Carling selects combined XV England thrashed Scotland 61-21on Sunday to retain their Six Nations title and equal New Zealand's world record of 18 consecutive Test wins. Victory in Dublin would mean they become the first team to secure back-to-back Grand Slams in the Six Nations era. Only three England sides have won consecutive Grand Slams, and all occurred before the introduction of Italy in 2000. France were the last side to accomplish the feat in 1998. Carling, who won 72 caps - 59 as captain - is surprised it has taken England so long to stand on the cusp of making history. ""I think I'm disappointed in how few Grand Slams England have won in the past 10-15 years,"" he said. ""Look at the resources England have, the number of players and the financial clout. England should do better. ""Don't expect us to do it on an annual basis but we should be doing it a few times a decade."" The 51-year-old does believe, however, that Jones' team are capable of surpassing the 2003 World Cup winners as England's best. ""It's all out there in front of them and there are not many teams that have the chance to better Martin Johnson's,"" he said. ""They could. It's about delivering.""

"Zara Larsson's hits include Lush Life, Never Forget You and Ain't My Fault In Sweden, she's been a star since she was 10 - but Zara Larsson has her eyes set on global domination. Aged just 19, the star has racked up seven hits in the last 14 months, including the tropical pop smashLush Life,external, which spent more than a year on the charts. Along the way, she's collaborated withTinie Tempah,externaland sung theofficial anthem of Euro 2016,external, but the highlight of her year was supporting Beyonce at Wembley Stadium. ""It was the best show on a tour I've ever seen. Wembley's such an incredible stadium. It's definitely one of the stadiums I want to stand on and have my own tour, one day."" Although she's already scored a number one single and album in her home country, Zara is starting from scratch in the UK - and releases her debut album,So Good,external, this week. Outgoing and dynamic, she talked the BBC through her career to date. Here's everything you need to know (and a few things you probably didn't) about Sweden's latest pop sensation. The star first revealed her condition in 2015 Writing on herSwedish-language website,externaltwo years ago, the 19-year-old revealed she frequently has episodes of sleep paralysis. ""Oh my God, it's scary!"" she tells the BBC. ""Basically, you wake up and you literally cannot move. Your brain is active, but your body is not yet awake. ""It's weird. It lasts half a minute maybe - but it kind of feels like you're trapped there for half an hour. ""I get it a lot when I'm stressed out, or when I have a lot of things going on."" But Zara says there's an upside, too. Often, as she falls asleep, she's overcome by a sense of tremendous wellbeing (to paraphrase a certain Blur song). ""It's like a wave comes over me. Energy is just vibrating through your body and it's awesome."" In 2008, Zara entered Talang Sverige - Sweden's version of Britain's Got Talent - mainly because there was no age restriction, unlike X Factor or Swedish Idol. Singing a heavily-accented, but vocally powerful, version of Celine Dion'sMy Heart Will Go On,external, she won the contest, and its 500,000 krona (Â£42,600) prize. ""I sounded like a little guinea pig!"" she laughs. But, incredibly, the contest led to nothing. ""Nobody really wanted to sign me, which I was devastated about,"" she says. ""I was like, 'oh my gosh, my career's over and it hasn't even started yet!' ""I didn't really want to do anything with Nickelodeon or Disney, so I just went back to school."" The break may have saved her. Rather than becoming a novelty act, washed up before she was a teenager, Zara re-emerged as a bona fide pop artist on her 15th birthday, with an EP that turned people's heads. ""When I released the first song, a lot of the people didn't even recognise me,"" she says. ""And the people that did were like, 'Oh my gosh, it's her!' ""So in Sweden, the talent show is like super-irrelevant. And that's great because usually it's very hard to wipe off that kind of Got Talent stain. ""It just stays on you - but it didn't for me."" This video can not be played Zara Larsson plays 'So Good' or 'So Bad' ...As we discovered when we played a game of ""So Good or So Bad?"" with Zara (watch above) When Zara released Lush Life in January last year, a lot of people thought it was Rihanna's comeback single. ""I don't know where it comes from but even my mom is like, 'You sound like Rihanna,'"" says the singer. ""I was very confused because I'd never really listened to her until pretty recently. It's not a bad comparison to have but I'm never going to be Rihanna, and I'm not trying to be. From the moment Zara fired up her Instagram,pulled a condom over her leg,externaland called out guys who ""think they're too big to wear protection"", it was clear Zara wouldn't be sticking to the record company script. Since then, she's voiced her support for Kesha - who is suing famed record producer Dr Luke for alleged sexual assault - and engaged in a war of words with R&B star Chris Brown, calling him ""a sexist, homophobic, transphobic trash"". ""That's who I am,"" says the star. ""I don't really have a 'vision' of who I want people to see me as. ""I just post whatever I feel like."" Zara and her father in earlier times... Larsson was born in Stockholm at the tail end of the 1990s, moving to the suburbs when her younger sister Hanna was born. She was always singing - showing off to her parents' dinner-party guests; and serenading ""ladies on the subway, when I was like three"". But she didn't come from a musical family. Far from it. ""My dad was a military man, working in Navy intelligence,"" she says, ""so I know he can keep secrets, definitely."" While the exact nature of his job remains classified, Larsson swears he was the model parent. ""He's great and he's funny. You can ask him whatever and he always has the answer. Even if he doesn't, he will never admit it. So we had a lot of debates and discussions. That's the reason why I'm interested in everything. ""Now he's actually studying again - he wants to be a professor in war science."" Potential boyfriends beware. Zara's breakout hit in the UK wasNever Forget You,external- a duet with British producer MNEK that was written in just two hours. ""We work really well together,"" she marvels. ""It's just no question marks. I feel very relaxed and honest and open with him. "" They collaborated again onAin't My Fault,external, a sassy, sexy club track that became Zara's fifth top 20 hit, late last year. ""We wrote it in five minutes,"" says Zara, ""Originally, it was about me stealing someone else's man. I was saying, 'It ain't my fault that you're not cute enough for him.'"" But after submitting the song to her record label, the singer had second thoughts. ""I was just like, 'Wait, hold up, I can't sing this'. It just didn't feel right. It felt like I'd broken the girl code, and I didn't want to do that."" As a child, Zara attended the Royal Swedish Ballet School. ""I was very flexible,"" she says. ""It really taught me a lot about discipline and how to use my body. But these days I'm about as flexible as aâ¦ erm, a safe!"" In fact, she's so out of shape that a brief session with her personal trainer ended in disaster. ""I ran 200 metres and my trainer said, 'That was a great job, you ran pretty fast'. ""I said, 'I know!' so he told me to do it a second time. And when I came back, I threw up."" Zara met her idol in 2014 - and promptly burst into tears ""I'm on my way to becoming a true performer,""the star wrote,externalshortly after singing Lush Life on The Voice UK last year. So, does she not consider herself a fully-qualified pop phenomenon yet? ""You're never finished,"" she says. ""My inspiration for performing is Beyonce. I don't think Beyonce  ever wakes up and thinks, 'Oh great I'm Beyonce, I'm just going to chill today.' ""She wants to be better, she wants to do bigger things and she wants to keep on evolving. ""That's what makes her great, and that's what I want to do."" Zara Larsson's album, So Good, is out now on Epic Records; as is her collaboration with Clean Bandit, Symphony. She also plays the Isle of Wight Festival in June. Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.
