"A majority of people on both sides of the Irish border believes Northern Ireland will have left the UK within 25 years, a poll suggests. Most respondents said they thought NI would still be part of the UK in 10 years time, but not in 25 years. In NI, 49% of people said if there was a border poll today they would vote to remain in the UK, with 43% backing a united Ireland and 8% undecided. The poll was commissioned by BBC NI's Spotlight programme. In the Republic of Ireland, where a vote would have to be held in parallel with any border poll in Northern Ireland, 51%  said they would vote for a United Ireland, 27% would vote for Northern Ireland to stay in the UK and 22% were not sure. You can watch a discussion exploring the issues raised and delving further into the results of the cross-border opinion poll on theBBC News NI websiteand the BBC iPlayer When asked if they thought NI woud be part of the UK in 10 years, 55% in NI and 59% in the Republic of Ireland said they thought it would be. But when asked if this would be the case in 25 years, 51% of people in NI and 54% in the Republic said NI would have left the UK. The poll also suggested that only 40% of people in Northern Ireland sawits formation 100 years agoas a cause for celebration. Most people on both sides of the Irish border believed there was a potential for a return to political violence in Northern Ireland, according to the poll. The poll was carried out over the Easter period when clashes were taking place in a number of areas across Northern Ireland, sparked by loyalist anger over the Northern Ireland trade protocol and the Police Service of Northern Ireland's handling of a republican funeral during the pandemic. Of those surveyed in Northern Ireland, 76% agreed with the proposition that ""the dispute over Northern Ireland's status remains unresolved and there is still a potential for violence in the future"". In the Republic, an even higher proportion, 87%, echoed that view. A total of 48% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters they want the controversial trade protocol introduced as part of the UK's EU Withdrawal Agreement scrapped, in line with demands from the DUP and other unionist parties, while 46% wanted the protocol to be retained. Unionists have claimed the protocol, which requires checks on goods moving across the Irish Sea from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, threatens the constitutional integrity of the UK. Interviewed for the Spotlight programme, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin insisted the protocol was not tearing the UK apart, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was working to ""sandpaper"" away what he described as the ""ludicrous barriers"" to trade across the Irish Sea. This video can not be played Boris Johnson pledges to end ""ludicrous barriers"" Between Great Britain and Northern Ireland In the Republic, a majority of those surveyed supported the Irish government's defence of the trade protocol, with 74% saying it should not be scrapped. Although within Northern Ireland a larger number of people rejected the trade protocol than backed it, the poll also provided an indication that a majority wants to retain some form of economic link with the EU. Some 56% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters that they wanted their assembly members (MLAs) to vote to stay within the EU Single Market when the matter is put to a vote at Stormont in three years' time. Only 38% indicated they wanted to leave the EU Single Market. In Northern Ireland 37% of people surveyed told the pollsters they would like to see a border poll within the next five years, whilst a further 29% want it to happen at some point after that. However the prime minister told the Spotlight programme that he cannot see any Northern Ireland secretary considering a border poll for a ""very, very long time to come"". The prime minister told BBC Northern Ireland that as ""a proud unionist"" he views the centenary of Northern Ireland's formation as a cause for celebration. However only 40% of the people surveyed agreed with the proposition that ""the formation of Northern Ireland 100 years ago was an achievement which should be celebrated"", while 45% disagreed with the statement. Outright celebration of the centenary turned out to be the least popular of five options included in the survey. In Northern Ireland, 48% agreed that the partition of Ireland and the creation of a land border 100 years ago was ""a negative development which should be regretted"". A total of 50% wanted to concentrate on current challenges such as the Covid pandemic rather than the centenary, whilst 61% backed marking Northern Ireland's formation in a neutral manner acknowledging the differing opinions on the subject. The same proportion, 61%, agreed with the statement ""Northern Ireland's history is not just about constitutional politics and the centenary should provide an opportunity to showcase its sporting, business, scientific and cultural achievements"". In the Republic, celebrating the formation of Northern Ireland was even more unpopular with just 12% agreeing with the proposition. The most popular options were marking this year's centenary in a neutral manner, which was favoured by 74% of those surveyed and regretting partition - a view 71% agreed with. The poll commissioned by BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme was carried out by the NI Pollsters LucidTalk and the Irish polling firm Ireland Thinks. In Northern Ireland polling was carried out online between 5 and 7 April and 2,845 responses were used for the analysis. In the Republic of Ireland polling took place between 6 and 9 April and 1,088 responses were analysed. A small amount of fieldwork was carried out in the Republic of Ireland on 10 April. The margin of error is +/- 2.5%. The results from a number of other questions in the survey regarding what should happen to the Irish flag, national anthem, the Stormont Executive and the health service in the event of a United Ireland will be released on BBC Northern Ireland's political programme The View on Thursday night.

"Spies are using fake profiles to steal classified information, according to the counter-intelligence agency MI5 At least 10,000 UK nationals have been approached by fake profiles linked to hostile states, on the professional social network LinkedIn, over the past five years, according to MI5. It warned users who had accepted such connection requests might have then been lured into sharing secrets. ""Malicious profiles"" are being used on ""an industrial scale"", the security agency's chief, Ken McCallum, said. A campaign has been launched to educate government workers about the threat. The effort - Think Before You Link - warns foreign spies are targeting those with access to sensitive information. The awareness campaign includes guides, posters and a video One concern is the victims' colleagues, in turn, become more willing to accept follow-up requests - because it looks as if they share a mutual acquaintance. MI5 did not specifically name LinkedIn but BBC News has learned the Microsoft-owned service is indeed the platform involved. The 10,000-plus figure includes staff in virtually every government departments as well as key industries, who might be offered speaking or business and travel opportunities that could lead to attempts to recruit them to provide confidential information. And it is thought a large number of those approached engaged initially with the profiles that contacted them online. ""No-one is immune to being socially manipulated into wrongdoing through these approaches,"" the guidance given to government staff says. LinkedInhas said it welcomes the initiative,external. The campaign, run by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, which reports to MI5, asks government staff to focus on ""the four Rs"": recognising malicious profiles realising the potential threat reporting suspicious profiles to a security manager removing the profiles ""Since the start of the pandemic, many of us have been working remotely and having to spend more time at home on our personal devices,"" government chief security officer Dominic Fortescue said. ""As a result, staff have become more vulnerable to malicious approaches from hostile security services and criminal organisations on social media."" The US and other countries have launched similar campaigns. Former CIA officer Kevin Mallory was sentenced to 20 years in prison, after being convicted of giving secrets to China following an approach on LinkedIn. And the UK's move is also being backed by the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

"Dubai's Princess Latifa before her escape attempt in 2018 The UN has called for the United Arab Emirates to provide ""concrete"" proof that Princess Latifa Al Maktoum, the daughter of Dubai's ruler reportedly being held in detention, is alive. In a statement issued in Geneva on Tuesday, UN human rights experts also said she should be released ""urgently"".

They asked for ""independent verification of the conditions under which she is being held, and for her immediate release"". ""The statement issued by the Emirates authorities' merely indicating that she was being 'cared for at home' is not sufficient at this stage,"" the statement said. It added: ""We are alarmed that, following the public release in February of footage in which Sheikha Latifa reported being deprived of her liberty against her will, and the subsequent official request for further information on her situation, no concrete information has been provided by the authorities.""

"This video can not be played Watch the moment Derek Chauvin learnt his fate A US jury has found a former police officer guilty of murder over the death of African-American George Floyd on a Minneapolis street last year. Derek Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. The widely watched footage sparked worldwide protests against racism and excessive use of force by police. Chauvin was found guilty on three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. His bail was immediately revoked and he was placed in custody. Sentencing is likely to happen in two months, and Chauvin could spend decades in jail. In Minnesota, second-degree murder carries a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison. Third-degree murder is punishable by up to 25 years in prison. Second-degree manslaughter is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Chauvin is expected to appeal against the verdict. The murder that drove America to the brink 'This is monumental. This is historic' Five key moments from the trial Police officers have rarely been convicted - if they are charged at all - for deaths that occur in custody, and the verdict in this trial has been widely seen as an indication of how the US legal system will treat such cases in future. Three other officers are due to face trial later this year on aiding-and-abetting charges. The 12-member jury took less than a day to reach their verdict, which followed a highly-charged, three-week trial that left Minneapolis on edge. Several hundred people cheered outside the court as the verdict was announced. The Floyd family's lawyer, Ben Crump, said it marked a ""turning point in history"" for the US. This video can not be played Relief and tears in a hair salon: 'Finally we can breathe' ""Painfully earned justice has finally arrived,"" he tweeted. ""[It] sends a clear message on the need for accountability of law enforcement."" The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris called the Floyd family after the verdict.  Mr Biden was heard saying that ""at least now there is some justice"". This video can not be played Biden on Chauvin verdict: 'Our work isn't done' In nationally televised remarks shortly afterwards, Mr Biden said: ""Systemic racism is a stain on the whole nation's soul."" Meanwhile, Ms Harris urged lawmakers to pass the George Floyd bill aimed at reforming policing in the US. The Minneapolis police federation, a not-for-profit organisation representing police, said they respected the jury's decision. ""We also want to reach out to the community and still express our deep remorse for their pain, as we feel it every day as well. There are no winners in this case,"" the federation said. According to reports, one of the most likely avenues of appeal is the huge publicity given to the case, with the defence team arguing that this might have influenced the jury. Also, Presiding Judge Peter Cahill said on Monday that public comments by Democrat Congresswoman Maxine Waters could be grounds for an appeal. Over the weekend, Ms Waters had urged protesters to ""stay on the street"" and ""get more confrontational"" if Chauvin was acquitted. On hearing the verdict, people were screaming and cheering, and a little girl in a pink coat held up a tiny fist, in jubilation. ""It's a good day in Minneapolis,"" says 21-year-old Kenneth Nwachi. ""It's a blessing."" Activists say justice has been done, and they will feel as though a weight has been lifted from their shoulders. Their relief is shared by many in the city, a place that has been on edge for months. It is a landmark case for police use of force against black people, and the verdict marks a significant break with the past. Few officers are charged with manslaughter or murder, and fewer still are convicted. But protesters say the calls for justice for George Floyd do not stop after this verdict. The 46-year-old bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store in South Minneapolis on the evening of 25 May 2020. A shop assistant believed he had used a counterfeit $20 note and called the police after Mr Floyd refused to give the cigarettes back. When police arrived, they ordered Mr Floyd out of his parked car and handcuffed him. A struggle ensued when officers tried to put a screaming Mr Floyd in their squad car. They wrestled him to the ground and pinned him under their weight. Security was ramped up in Minneapolis ahead of the verdict Chauvin pressed his knee into the back of Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes, as the suspect and several bystanders pleaded for his life. As he was being restrained, Mr Floyd said more than 20 times that he could not breathe, pleading for his mother and begging ""please, please, please"". When the ambulance arrived, Mr Floyd was motionless. He was pronounced dead about an hour later. During Chauvin's trial, the jury heard from 45 witnesses and saw several hours of video footage. Some of the most powerful testimony came from eyewitnesses. Several broke down in tears as they watched graphic footage of the incident and described feeling ""helpless"" as events unfolded. Mr Floyd's girlfriend of three years and his younger sibling also took the stand. Expert witnesses on behalf of the state testified that Mr Floyd died from a lack of oxygen due to the manner of restraint employed by Chauvin and his colleagues. Chauvin himself chose not to testify, invoking his right to not incriminate himself with his responses. Manslaughter is when someone unintentionally causes another person's death. In second-degree murder, the act that led to someone's death could have been intentional or unintentional. The maximum sentence for this charge is 40 years in prison. Third-degree murder means that an individual has acted in a way that endangered one or more people, ending in death. Twelve jurors were tasked with deciding if Chauvin would face time in jail or be acquitted. The jury remained anonymous and unseen throughout the trial, but its demographics skewed younger, more white and more female. After both sides presented closing arguments on Monday, the jury was isolated in a hotel with no outside contact so they could deliberate on a verdict, a process known as sequestration. Jurors had to agree on a unanimous verdict and were told they could not return home until they had made their decision. The moment Chauvin learnt his fate.

"Chelsea fans protested against their involvement in the European Super League outside Stamford Bridge All six Premier League teams involved in the European Super League (ESL) have now withdrawn from the competition. Manchester City were the first club to pull out after Chelsea had signalled their intent to do so by preparing documentation to withdraw. The other four sides - Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham - have all now followed suit. Italian side Inter Milan are also set to withdraw as they no longer wish to be involved with the project. BBC Sport understands bosses at the Serie A club are preparing for their exit following Tuesday night's dramatic developments. How football's volatile 48 hours unfolded The 12-team Super League, set up by the seven afore-mentioned teams and Spain's Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid and Italy's AC Milan and Juventus wasannounced on Sundayto widespread condemnation. ""Despite the announced departure of the English clubs, forced to take such decisions due to the pressure put on them, we are convinced our proposal is fully aligned with European law and regulations,"" the ESL said on Wednesday, adding it was ""convinced that the current status quo of European football needs to change"". In an interview with Italian newspaper la Repubblica, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli said the remaining clubs will ""press ahead"" and the project still had ""a 100% chance of being a success""., ""Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is insisting on the idea of keeping the group together to push for change,"" says Spanish football expert Guillem Balague.

Liverpool said their involvement in the proposed breakaway league ""has been discontinued"". Manchester United said they had ""listened carefully to the reaction from our fans, the UK government and other key stakeholders"" in making their decision to not take part. Arsenal apologised in an open letter to their fans and said they had ""made a mistake"", adding they were withdrawing after listening to them and the ""wider football community"".

""The important thing now is that we move on, rebuild the unity that the game enjoyed before this and move forward together.""

In a statement, the European Super League said: ""Given the current circumstances we shall reconsider the most appropriate steps to reshape the project, always having in mind our goals of offering fans the best experience possible while enhancing solidarity payments for the entire football community."" English football's 'big six' were part of a group that announced plans to form the breakaway league, which they hoped to establish as a new midweek competition. It was condemned by fans, football authorities and government ministers in the UK and across Europe by Uefa and league associations. Around 1,000 fans gathered outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge groundbefore their game against Brighton on Tuesdayto protest at their club's involvement. Chelsea legend Petr Cech pleaded with fans to disperse outside the ground before their match against Brighton Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who was involved in the Super League discussions, hasannounced he will step downfrom his role at the end of 2021. Leading players at some of the six clubs signalled their disapproval of the planned breakaway league. Liverpool captainJordan Henderson said on social media,externalhis side's ""collective position"" is they do not want the Super League to take place. ""We don't like it and we don't want it to happen,"" read a message that was also posted by many fellow Liverpool players. After City confirmed their withdrawal, England winger Raheem Sterling posted: ""Ok bye."" Uefa had hoped to stave off the threat of a European Super League with a new 36-team Champions League, which wasagreed on Monday. In announcing their proposals for a Super League that would eventually comprise of 20 teams, the 12-club group said the Champions League reforms did not go far enough. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, who was named as the ESL's chairman, said the competitionwas set up ""to save football""because young people are ""no longer interested"" in the game because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". None of the Spanish and Italian sides have yet released a statement after the six Premier League teams pulled out. TheArsenalboard said they did not intend to ""cause such distress"" and that they joined the Super League because they ""did not want to be left behind"" and wanted to ensure the club's future.

"Tory MP Johnny Mercer says he was ""forced"" to resign as a defence minister over the treatment of veterans who served in Northern Ireland. No 10 confirmed his exit on Tuesday - ahead of the Overseas Operations Bill returning to the Commons on Wednesday. The new law is designed to protect veterans from unfounded prosecutions. But British soldiers who served in Northern Ireland will be excluded from the bill. Mr Mercer called that a ""red line"" for him staying in government. In response, Boris Johnson said the government was ""committed to doing more over the coming months, including for those who have served in Northern Ireland"". Military prosecution bill to exclude NI veterans Row over Tory pledge to protect NI veterans A No 10 spokesperson said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had ""accepted"" Mr Mercer's resignation and thanked him for his service as a minister. But posting a resignation letter on Twitter immediately afterwards, Mr Mercer said he had been ""relieved of my responsibilities in government"". The MP - who is a former Army captain - wrote that the government had ""abandoned people in a way I simply cannot reconcile"" in allowing ""endless investigations"" into historic killings to continue. He added: ""Veterans are being sectioned, drinking themselves to death and dying well before their time, simply because the UK government cannot find the moral strength or courage we asked of them in bringing peace to Northern Ireland in finding a political solution to stop these appalling injustices."" Plans were announced last year by the government torestrict the number of Troubles killings which could be fully investigatedunder a new approach where ""new, compelling evidence"" would be required. But the Overseas Operations Bill would go further for other veterans, such as those who served in Iraq or Afghanistan, proposing a five-year limit on criminal prosecutions. Six former soldiers who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles are currently facing prosecution. In 2019, the Public Prosecution Service in Northern Ireland said of 32 ""legacy cases"" it had ruled on since 2012, 17 related to republicans, eight to loyalists, and five were connected to the Army. In his letter, Mr Mercer said ""no discernible efforts have been made"" to introduce similar legislation to cover Northern Ireland veterans, despite previous pledges, adding: ""I can see no prospect of this changing."" Boris Johnson says the Overseas Operations Bill will address ""vexatious"" claims against veterans The Tory MP said he was ""deeply proud of my predecessors who served in Northern Ireland"", adding they were ""not second-class veterans"" and deserved ""the protection of the Overseas Operations Bill like everyone else"". No 10 later shared a letter from the PM to Mr Mercer, thanking him for ""highlighting the importance of legislating to protect our Armed Forces against vexatious and repeated claims"". Mr Johnson wrote: ""The conclusion of the enactment of the Overseas Operations Bill is a crucial part of that, addressing veterans who have served overseas. ""But we are committed to doing more over the coming months, including for those who have served in Northern Ireland."" While the government has not moved on Mr Mercer's calls, it has changed course over another contentious part of the bill, ahead of the debate on Wednesday. The law had come under fierce criticism by human rights groups, former military commanders and lawyers for including a ""presumption against prosecution"" after the five-year time frame for the most serious of crimes - namely torture, genocide and crimes against humanity. Labour's Lord Roberts brought an amendment to the bill in the House of Lords to ensure the rule does not apply for those actions, which won the support of peers. And now, ahead of the debate, the Ministry of Justice has conceded to the amendment, promising to exclude torture, genocide and crimes against humanity from the rule. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Defence said: ""Whilst we maintain nothing in this bill prevents those accused of breaking the law from being prosecuted, we have listened to concerns, and in order to send a powerful message to the international community, amendments will be made to the Overseas Operations Bill."" However, the department confirmed it would seek to overturn three other amendments agreed by peers earlier this month.

"The president told reporters on Tuesday: ""I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict"" US President Joe Biden has said he is praying for the ""right verdict"" in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis ex-policeman accused of killing George Floyd last year. Mr Biden, who spoke to Mr Floyd's family on Monday, implied he felt the evidence was ""overwhelming"". His comments came as the jury meets for a second day to consider its verdict. Mr Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. He is on trial for charges including second-degree murder and has pleaded not guilty. The footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on African-American Mr Floyd's neck sparked global protests against racism. Cities around the US are bracing for renewed protests regardless of the verdict. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the president spoke to Mr Floyd's family on Monday to ""check in with them and also share that the family was in his prayers"". ""The jury is sequestered... he certainly is not looking to influence [the trial],"" she added. Three Americans assess the trial Five key moments from the proceedings Key questions answered about the case Mr Biden spoke in more detail about the call at the White House on Tuesday. ""I can only imagine the pressure and anxiety they are feeling,"" he said of the family. ""I waited until the jury was sequestered and I called [them],"" he said. ""They're calling for peace... no matter what that verdict is."" ""I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict,"" Mr Biden added. ""I think it's overwhelming in my view."" Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Floyd's younger brother confirmed that he had spoken to the president. ""[Mr Biden] knows how it is to lose a family member, and he knows the process of what we're going through,"" Philonise Floyd told NBC News. ""He was just letting us know that he was praying for us."" Mr Biden lost his first wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident in 1972. In 2015, his son Beau died of brain cancer at the age of 46. This afternoon I asked Press Secretary Jen Psaki what Biden saw as his responsibility, as president, at the conclusion of the trial. She said this is an ""extremely painful moment"" for people ""who are tired of seeing one person after another lose their life at the hands of law enforcement"". ""He's aware of that,"" she added, ""and the need for reform."" That may be the case, but Biden just positioned himself into the middle of a social and political tinder-box just a day after the presiding judge in the trial warned politicians to ""stop talking about the case"" and that their failure to do so was ""abhorrent"". That tinder-box could explode depending on the outcome of the trial, and Biden will be judged on how he handles the resulting fallout. By effectively taking sides, his ability to serve as a leader for this divided nation may prove all the more challenging. The jury has retired to consider testimony from 45 witnesses, including doctors, use-of-force experts, police officers, bystanders and people who were close to Mr Floyd. Mr Chauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge - second-degree murder. Security has been ramped up in Minneapolis ahead of the verdict A conviction on any of the counts against him will require the jury to return a unanimous verdict. A single juror holding out would result in a mistrial, but the state could then try Mr Chauvin again. Of the 12 jurors, six are white, four are black and two are multiracial. Seven are women and five are men. On Monday, the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, requested security assistance from the states of Ohio and Nebraska ahead of the verdict. The prosecution and defence made their closing statements on Monday following a trial that lasted three weeks Mr Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson argued that his client did what any ""reasonable police officer"" would have done after finding himself in a ""dynamic"" and ""fluid"" situation involving a large man scuffling with three officers. This video can not be played Watch: The three key arguments used by Chauvin's defence The defence has sought to show that drugs may have caused Mr Floyd's death. Mr Nelson argued that Mr Floyd's drug use was ""significant"" because the body reacts to opioid use, specifically in the case of someone who had been diagnosed with hypertension and high blood pressure. The lawyer also argued that his client was unlikely to have intentionally violated use-of-force rules as he would have been aware that the whole interaction was being recorded. Prosecutors have tried to prove Mr Chauvin's use of force resulted in Mr Floyd's death. Prosecutor Steve Schleicher urged jurors to ""use your common sense. Believe your eyes. What you saw, you saw,"" referring to the video showing Mr Chauvin kneeling on Mr Floyd. ""This wasn't policing; this was murder,"" he added. This video can not be played Watch: How the prosecution made its case against Derek Chauvin Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell had the final word on Monday. He said the matter was ""so simple that a child can understand it"". ""In fact, a child did understand it, when the nine-year-old girl said, 'Get off of him,'"" Mr Blackwell said, referring to a young onlooker who objected. ""That's how simple it was. 'Get off of him.' Common sense.""

"Scotland's unemployment rate from December 2020 to February 2021 remained at 4.4%. The Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) said the employment rate, for those aged 16 to 64, over the same period was 74.6%. This was up 0.2% on the previous quarter. There were 2.567 million people aged 16-64 in employment between December and February, while 120,000 in that age range were unemployed. UK jobs market 'remains subdued' Number of Scots seeking work falls by 4,000 Jobless crisis shows signs of easing Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""The latest figures suggest that the jobs market has been broadly stable in recent months after the major shock of last spring."" UK-wide, the unemployment rate fell to 4.9%. According to the ONS, some 1.67 million people were unemployed between December and February. That is down 50,000 on the previous quarter but still 311,000 higher than a year ago. It said young people continued to bear the brunt of the crisis, amid large-scale job losses in sectors such as hospitality and retail. People under 25 accounted for more than half of the payroll jobs lost in the year to March, it said - some 436,000 positions. Niamh Welsh has struggled to find work since losing her job earlier this year Niamh Welsh, who lives in Paisley, is a student but prior to the pandemic had been working part time in retail. She was furloughed, then lost her job earlier this year and has struggled to find other work. ""I've been working since I was about 13, doing paper rounds, and then I properly started working when I was about 15 years old, so I've been working for the last eight years or so,"" she says. ""So I would have thought it would have been a little bit easier, but just with the situation it's quite hard to find places that are taking on staff, as most places have been laying off staff or cutting down hours. ""Even all the supermarkets, which I have experience of, barely any of them have any positions at all."" Niamh is due to graduate this summer and had hoped to work and save money in order to return to education. ""This year I was planning to make some money but that's tricky if I can't find a job. ""I want to stay here but I've got a flat to pay for, bills to pay, food, all that stuff, but I also want to be able to save."" Stuart McIntyre, head of research at the Fraser of Allander economic institute, said the latest data suggested some ""worrying trends"" were emerging. He said: ""The number of young people who are unemployed has jumped by 15,500 over the last year, with the youth unemployment rate rising from 8.3% to 13.5%. ""The closure of large parts of the hospitality and retail economy through the pandemic, sectors where many young people find work, is clearly feeding through."" Dr McIntyre also said the north east of Scotland continued to experience a much larger decline in payroll employment than elsewhere in Scotland, as a result of the combined effect of the downturn in oil and gas and wider effects of the pandemic. He added: ""Coupled with the recent announcement of the closure of John Lewis in Aberdeen, it is clear that this is one part of the Scottish economy that is facing particularly acute challenges."" Unprecedented measures to avoid a rise in unemployment, including the furlough scheme, have kept down the number of people looking for jobs at only 4.4% of the Scottish adult workforce. That's the same in December to February as in the preceding autumn months and below the UK figure, which fell slightly. The number in work was up, but remained below the UK rate, and the claimant count was little changed at 212,000 people, depending on benefits linked to unemployment or low pay. That figure nearly doubled at the start of the pandemic. The number of Scots in payrolled jobs dropped by 73,000 in the year to last month. Less robust figures from the ONS suggest job vacancies across the UK rose in March and that may have accelerated this month.

"This video can not be played Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by has died of his injuries following clashes with rebels in the north of the country at the weekend, the army has said. The announcement came a day after provisional election results projected he would win a sixth term in office. The government and parliament have been dissolved. A curfew has also been imposed and the borders have been shut. DÃ©by, 68, spent more than three decades in power and was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. An army officer by training, he came to power in 1990 through an armed uprising. He was a long-time ally of France and other Western powers in the battle against jihadist groups in the Sahel region of Africa. DÃ©by ""breathed his last defending the sovereign nation on the battlefield"", an army general said on state TV on Tuesday. He had gone to the front line, several hundred kilometres north of the capital, N'Djamena, at the weekend to visit troops battling rebels belonging to a group calling itself Fact (the Front for Change and Concord in Chad). A state funeral is due to take place on Friday. Reaction to DÃ©byâs death Chad's future rocked by president's battlefield death Idriss DÃ©by - the end of Chad's 'Great Survivor' A quick guide to Chad A military council led by DÃ©by's son, a 37-year-old four star general, will govern for the next 18 months. Mahamat Idriss DÃ©by Itno will lead the council, but ""free and democratic"" elections will be held once the transition period is over, the army said in its statement. He later issued a statement naming the 14 other generals who will make up the new governing body. A BBC Monitoring journalist tweeted a copy of the notice: Allow Twitter content?

Experts have told the BBC and other broadcasters that the move is unconstitutional, and that the speaker of parliament should take over when a sitting president dies before organising elections. Ahead of the election on 11 April, DÃ©by campaigned on a platform of bringing peace and security to the region. Provisional results showed he had 80% of the vote. But there had been growing unhappiness over his government's management of Chad's oil resources. Idriss DÃ©by was known as that rare thing - a true warrior president. The former rebel and trained pilot was the opposite of an armchair general. For 30 years, he clung to power in Chad - a vast nation that straddles the Sahara and is surrounded by some of the continent's most protracted conflicts. And DÃ©by had a hand in every one of them - from Darfur to Libya, Mali, Nigeria and the Central African Republic. His troops were among the most battle-hardened on the planet. Domestically, he had become an increasingly autocratic figure. His latest election victory saw him claim nearly 80% of the vote. It is unclear if the poor, feuding, brittle state he leaves behind can manage a smooth transition. And there are wider concerns too. For years, President DÃ©by was the West's indispensable ally in the war against Islamist militants - in Mali, Niger and beyond. His death leaves a vacuum that many may now fight to fill. In a statement, the French presidency described Mr DÃ©by as a ""brave friend"" and said it affirmed its attachment to the stability of Chad. Over the years, France has deployed troops and fighter jets to push back Mr DÃ©by's opponents. Chadian forces are considered to be the most effective of the Western-backed ""G5"" countries fighting Islamist militants in the Sahel region. And it has often proved to be the more stable country in a region that includes Libya, Sudan and the Central African Republic - where armed groups roam freely and trade in weapons and lucrative resources that fuel conflict, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga. Founded in 2016 by disillusioned former army officers, the rebel Fact group accuses President DÃ©by of repression in the run-up to the election. They built up their base in Libya in the Tibesti mountains, which straddle northern Chad and part of southern Libya. On election day, the group mounted an attack on a border post and gradually advanced on N'Djamena. The latest clashes began on Saturday. The army says that 300 insurgents were killed and 150 captured. Five government soldiers were killed and 36 injured, it says. The figures could not immediately be verified. Some foreign embassies in the capital have urged their staff to leave. A former BBC journalist in N'Djamena says the situation there seemed relatively calm: ""The news is filtering through to people, but the city is calm and people are just shocked to hear that actually, because many people didn't even know that he [President DÃ©by] was wounded or that he was at the frontline,"" said Mahamat Adamou. ""In the street in downtown, there are armoured vehicles that are posted at key road junctions. Of course, there is a sense of 'What is going to happen?'. But not more than that."" N'Djamena has come under rebel attack before and there was panic in the city on Monday, with parents taking their children home from school, when tanks were deployed along the main roads. 1) It is named after Lake Chad. This is the second-largest lake in Africa, but has shrunk by 90% since the 1960s. Its basin covers parts of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, and is a water source for between 20 million and 30 million people. 2) The Sahara Desert roughly covers one third of the country. Much of the north is desert and home to a mere 1% of Chad's population. The south has large expanses of wooded savannahs and woodlands. 3) Remains of a seven-million-year-old human-like creature - or hominid - known as ""Toumai"" were unearthed in 2001. Its discoverers argued that Toumai was the oldest hominid known to science. 4) Chad became an oil-producing nation in 2003, with the completion of a $4bn (Â£2.87bn) pipeline linking its oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast. The industry has been plagued by allegations of corruption. 5) Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for most people - cotton is grown in the south, and exported to Europe and the US.

The page was written by Ella Wills, Katie Wright, David Walker, Alex Kleiderman, Joseph Lee, Penny Spiller and Richard Morris, and edited by Marie Jackson. Pubs in Wales and Scotland will start serving customers alcohol outdoors again in the coming days, it was confirmed on Tuesday We're going to bring our live coverage of the Covid pandemic to an end shortly. But first, here's are some of the main UK stories we've been covering today: Here is a
round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories we have been covering around the world: The 22-year-old organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate in Nottingham city centre A 22-year-old man has been fined Â£10,000 for organisinga 90-person illegal partyin Nottinghamshire, England. Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape. The organiser's fine will be reduced to half if paid within two weeks, and if it is not paid, he will face a court appearance, the force said. A man who has helped bury dozens of Muslims who died with Covid-19 in one of England's worst-affected towns has spoken about the daily pressures of his role. Imran Patel, who is a volunteer at Blackburn Muslim Burial Society, has helped with 340 interments in the last 12 months, of which 200 were for people who had died with coronavirus. This video can not be played Reality Check There are currently not enough vaccines for India's vast population As we reported earlier, India haspledged to offer alladults over the age of 18a coronavirus vaccine from 1 May in a bid to stem a
severe second wave of the virus. However, domestic vaccine makers are struggling to meet
demand both at home and globally. The government has offered financial assistance to two
vaccine makers - the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech - and halted
large exports of vaccines in a bid to help boost local production. But will it be enough?Read more about the situation here. Yogita LimayeBBC India correspondent Many families are losing loved ones to the coronavirus More than 99% of all intensive care beds are full in Indiaâs
capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral
rituals as crematoriums and graveyards are running out of manpower and space. In smaller towns the situation is even worse. A sharp surge
in cases and deaths is being reported from many parts of India. Some areas are
now in lockdown. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about
decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the
Joint Biosecurity Centre, the JBC, they look at the issue and will make their
determination based on what they think we need to doâ. Asked about yesterdayâs decision to put India on the red list
he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here. Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that

"The president told reporters on Tuesday: ""I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict"" US President Joe Biden has said he is praying for the ""right verdict"" in the trial of Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis ex-policeman accused of killing George Floyd last year. Mr Biden, who spoke to Mr Floyd's family on Monday, implied he felt the evidence was ""overwhelming"". His comments came as the jury meets for a second day to consider its verdict. Mr Chauvin, 45, was filmed kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes during his arrest last May. He is on trial for charges including second-degree murder and has pleaded not guilty. The footage of Mr Chauvin, who is white, with his knee on African-American Mr Floyd's neck sparked global protests against racism. Cities around the US are bracing for renewed protests regardless of the verdict. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the president spoke to Mr Floyd's family on Monday to ""check in with them and also share that the family was in his prayers"". ""The jury is sequestered... he certainly is not looking to influence [the trial],"" she added. Three Americans assess the trial Five key moments from the proceedings Key questions answered about the case Mr Biden spoke in more detail about the call at the White House on Tuesday. ""I can only imagine the pressure and anxiety they are feeling,"" he said of the family. ""I waited until the jury was sequestered and I called [them],"" he said. ""They're calling for peace... no matter what that verdict is."" ""I'm praying the verdict is the right verdict,"" Mr Biden added. ""I think it's overwhelming in my view."" Earlier on Tuesday, Mr Floyd's younger brother confirmed that he had spoken to the president. ""[Mr Biden] knows how it is to lose a family member, and he knows the process of what we're going through,"" Philonise Floyd told NBC News. ""He was just letting us know that he was praying for us."" Mr Biden lost his first wife, Neilia, and baby daughter, Naomi, in a car accident in 1972. In 2015, his son Beau died of brain cancer at the age of 46. This afternoon I asked Press Secretary Jen Psaki what Biden saw as his responsibility, as president, at the conclusion of the trial. She said this is an ""extremely painful moment"" for people ""who are tired of seeing one person after another lose their life at the hands of law enforcement"". ""He's aware of that,"" she added, ""and the need for reform."" That may be the case, but Biden just positioned himself into the middle of a social and political tinder-box just a day after the presiding judge in the trial warned politicians to ""stop talking about the case"" and that their failure to do so was ""abhorrent"". That tinder-box could explode depending on the outcome of the trial, and Biden will be judged on how he handles the resulting fallout. By effectively taking sides, his ability to serve as a leader for this divided nation may prove all the more challenging. The jury has retired to consider testimony from 45 witnesses, including doctors, use-of-force experts, police officers, bystanders and people who were close to Mr Floyd. Mr Chauvin is charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. He faces up to 40 years in prison if convicted of the most serious charge - second-degree murder. Security has been ramped up in Minneapolis ahead of the verdict A conviction on any of the counts against him will require the jury to return a unanimous verdict. A single juror holding out would result in a mistrial, but the state could then try Mr Chauvin again. Of the 12 jurors, six are white, four are black and two are multiracial. Seven are women and five are men. On Monday, the governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, requested security assistance from the states of Ohio and Nebraska ahead of the verdict. The prosecution and defence made their closing statements on Monday following a trial that lasted three weeks Mr Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson argued that his client did what any ""reasonable police officer"" would have done after finding himself in a ""dynamic"" and ""fluid"" situation involving a large man scuffling with three officers. This video can not be played Watch: The three key arguments used by Chauvin's defence The defence has sought to show that drugs may have caused Mr Floyd's death. Mr Nelson argued that Mr Floyd's drug use was ""significant"" because the body reacts to opioid use, specifically in the case of someone who had been diagnosed with hypertension and high blood pressure. The lawyer also argued that his client was unlikely to have intentionally violated use-of-force rules as he would have been aware that the whole interaction was being recorded. Prosecutors have tried to prove Mr Chauvin's use of force resulted in Mr Floyd's death. Prosecutor Steve Schleicher urged jurors to ""use your common sense. Believe your eyes.

"Dr Michael Watt worked at the Royal Victoria Hospital as a neurologist Almost 20% of patients seen by neurology consultant Dr Michael Watt were given a wrong diagnosis, a report has found. A review of 927 of Dr Watt's high-risk patients found 181 people received a diagnosis described as ""not secure"", Health Minister Robin Swann said. He was speaking as the Belfast Trust announced the recall of a further 209 neurology patients seen and discharged by Dr Watt between 1996 and 2012. This is the third such recall. Dr Watt was at the centre of Northern Ireland'sbiggest patient recalllinked to his work at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital. Mr Swann said he had met patients and families affected by the recall in October last year. ""While this report is statistical in nature, it deals with individuals, their families and their experiences,"" he said. ""I know that many will have had their confidence in our health service shaken and I remain committed to helping restore it."" Mr Swann ""unreservedly apologised"" to those patients who have been affected. ""I also want to acknowledge that in announcing a further recall, more patients will be affected,"" he said. ""It is deeply regrettable that this experience should happen to any of our patients and it is even more so when I consider the total number of patients involved."" In May 2018, the Belfast Trust recalled 2,500 patients for review after concerns were raised about the clinical work carried out by Dr Watt. This was followed by a further 1,044 patients who were recalled in November 2018. The RQIA regulatory body is also conducting a review into patient deaths. An independent inquiry was elevated to a statutory public inquiry late last year but has yet to start hearing evidence. Those affected by this latest recall were seen and discharged between 1996, when Dr Watt began his career, and 2012 and who are taking certain prescribed medications for specific neurological conditions. The Belfast Trust said those affected would have received a letter asking them to set up a telephone review to ascertain whether the medication is appropriate for their condition. Extra clinics have been set up to facilitate face-to-face interviews where necessary. Belfast Trust chief executive Dr Cathy Jack said she was ""truly sorry"" over the further recall. ""I absolutely understand that this will cause worry and anxiety to a number of people and their families and I am deeply sorry for that,"" she said. ""I also accept this next stage may be very difficult for those patients who have already been reviewed and whose diagnoses may have been changed as a result of our two previous recalls. ""Again, I want to express the trust's sincere regret for all the hurt and pain caused over the last number of years and for the harm that has undoubtedly been done. ""It is absolutely imperative that we put right any past wrongs and while this is painful, it is vital we assure ourselves that former patients, now discharged and who are taking very specific medication, are taking it for the correct reasons."" Neurologist Watt no longer Belfast Trust employee Neurology inquiry concerns not unique, says chair Ulster Independent Clinic and Hillsborough Private Clinic are recalling 57 and 10 former patients respectively. Separately, the trust also reviewed case notes of 66 patients who had a blood patch procedure under the care of Dr Watt and who did not have a clinical review as part of the recall process. It found that for 45 patients there was no clinical evidence to support that a blood patch was required. And, for 46 patients the care was unsatisfactory and fell below the standard expected by the trust. ""We are deeply sorry for this and for the undue hurt these patients experienced,"" the trust added. Colm Gildernew, who chairs the health scrutiny committee at Stormont. described it as a scandal that has caused immense distress. ""The neurology inquiry has revealed again more examples of a lack of transparency, deficits in governance arrangements and accountability within the health service,"" he said. The Sinn FÃ©in assembly member asked what lessons had been learned? Meanwhile DUP assembly member Pam Cameron, deputy chair of the committee, asked about a timetable and scale of resource for financial redress for those entitled to compensation. Mr Swann could not provide a definitive date but added: ""Redress payments will be paid because this is a failure of our systems that has to be corrected.""

"Scotland's unemployment rate from December 2020 to February 2021 remained at 4.4%. The Office for National Statistics,external(ONS) said the employment rate, for those aged 16 to 64, over the same period was 74.6%. This was up 0.2% on the previous quarter. There were 2.567 million people aged 16-64 in employment between December and February, while 120,000 in that age range were unemployed. UK jobs market 'remains subdued' Number of Scots seeking work falls by 4,000 Jobless crisis shows signs of easing Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""The latest figures suggest that the jobs market has been broadly stable in recent months after the major shock of last spring."" UK-wide, the unemployment rate fell to 4.9%. According to the ONS, some 1.67 million people were unemployed between December and February. That is down 50,000 on the previous quarter but still 311,000 higher than a year ago. It said young people continued to bear the brunt of the crisis, amid large-scale job losses in sectors such as hospitality and retail. People under 25 accounted for more than half of the payroll jobs lost in the year to March, it said - some 436,000 positions. Niamh Welsh has struggled to find work since losing her job earlier this year Niamh Welsh, who lives in Paisley, is a student but prior to the pandemic had been working part time in retail. She was furloughed, then lost her job earlier this year and has struggled to find other work. ""I've been working since I was about 13, doing paper rounds, and then I properly started working when I was about 15 years old, so I've been working for the last eight years or so,"" she says. ""So I would have thought it would have been a little bit easier, but just with the situation it's quite hard to find places that are taking on staff, as most places have been laying off staff or cutting down hours. ""Even all the supermarkets, which I have experience of, barely any of them have any positions at all."" Niamh is due to graduate this summer and had hoped to work and save money in order to return to education. ""This year I was planning to make some money but that's tricky if I can't find a job. ""I want to stay here but I've got a flat to pay for, bills to pay, food, all that stuff, but I also want to be able to save."" Stuart McIntyre, head of research at the Fraser of Allander economic institute, said the latest data suggested some ""worrying trends"" were emerging. He said: ""The number of young people who are unemployed has jumped by 15,500 over the last year, with the youth unemployment rate rising from 8.3% to 13.5%. ""The closure of large parts of the hospitality and retail economy through the pandemic, sectors where many young people find work, is clearly feeding through."" Dr McIntyre also said the north east of Scotland continued to experience a much larger decline in payroll employment than elsewhere in Scotland, as a result of the combined effect of the downturn in oil and gas and wider effects of the pandemic. He added: ""Coupled with the recent announcement of the closure of John Lewis in Aberdeen, it is clear that this is one part of the Scottish economy that is facing particularly acute challenges."" Unprecedented measures to avoid a rise in unemployment, including the furlough scheme, have kept down the number of people looking for jobs at only 4.4% of the Scottish adult workforce. That's the same in December to February as in the preceding autumn months and below the UK figure, which fell slightly. The number in work was up, but remained below the UK rate, and the claimant count was little changed at 212,000 people, depending on benefits linked to unemployment or low pay. That figure nearly doubled at the start of the pandemic. The number of Scots in payrolled jobs dropped by 73,000 in the year to last month. Less robust figures from the ONS suggest job vacancies across the UK rose in March and that may have accelerated this month.

"Fans protested against the proposed league outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium on Tuesday Plans for a European Super League offend ""the basic principles of competition"", Boris Johnson has said. Describing the proposal as a ""cartel"", the prime minister said he would use legislation to block it if needed. The 12 founding members of the league faced a fierce backlash after unveiling proposals for a breakaway tournament, in which they would be permanent members and not face relegation. But Real Madrid insisted they were doing it to ""save football"". Latest reaction to the European Super League Why Super League makes financial sense for top clubs Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new league? Asked about the proposed league at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said: ""I think it's not in the interests of fans, it's not in the interests of football. ""How can it be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel that stops clubs competing against each other, playing against each other properly, with all the hope and excitement that gives to the fans up and down the country?"" ""These clubs, these names, originate from famous towns and cities in our country,"" he added. ""I don't think that it is right that they should be somehow dislocated from their home towns, home cities, taken and turned into international brands and commodities that just circulate the planet, propelled by the billions of banks, without any reference to fans and to those who have loved them all their lives."" Asked what legislative measures the government might use, the prime minister said: ""What we want to do first of all is back the FA, back the Premier League and hope that we can thwart this proposal before it goes very much further."" Earlier, the prime minister met with FA and Premier League officials, as well as fans' representatives. Following the meeting,No 10 said Mr Johnson would take ""whatever action necessary"" to stop the plans. The prime minister's official spokesman said among the measures under consideration were preventing players of the clubs involved getting work visas and the withdrawal of police funding for match days. Six English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - have signed up to the league. They would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan. The competition would have 20 teams and another five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition. Matches would take place midweek in an attempt to have more matches between the big-name clubs and rival the existing Champions League. The plans revealed on Sunday that the 12 founding football clubs would be permanent members and never face relegation. Critics say the new league could supplant the existing Champions League and disrupt the current football ""pyramid"" that sees teams rise or fall on merit. Read morehere. Real Madrid's president Florentino Perezhas defended the decision to create the new league, saying it was taken in part because ""young people are no longer interested"" in the game. He told a Spanish TV show: ""Audiences are decreasing and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt."" The president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, has warned that players for teams in the ESL would be ""banned from the World Cup and the Euros"". But in a letter to Uefa and Fifa, seen by the BBC, lawyers for the ESL say they have filed injunctions to prevent player and club bans, saying they consider such actions to be ""unlawful"". An insider at the ESL said they had prepared themselves for a huge backlash, and thought they were on firm legal ground with respect to competition law. ""I think in the cold light of day, they are looking at this and the reality is dawning that this is happening and it's perfectly legal,"" they told the BBC. A Spanish court has temporarily blocked any attempt by Uefa or Fifa to ban clubs or players from leagues or competitions, in an interim ruling to prevent any bans before the legal basis of them can be tested. ESL insiders said ""this looks aggressive but we had to take defensive action in the face of threats from Uefa and Fifa - our hope is we can ultimately resolve this in negotiations"". This video can not be played Alan Shearer says the proposed European Super League is ""plain and simply wrong"" The 14 Premier League clubs not participating in the new venture ""unanimously and vigorously"" rejected the plans for the competition and are ""considering all actions available to prevent it from progressing"". In a statement on Tuesday, they called on the founding members of the ESL to ""cease their involvement immediately"". There have been protests by fans across the country against the proposed league, including outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground on Tuesday. Gianni Infantino, president of the world football's governing body Fifa, also said he ""strongly disapproves of the plans"". ""If some elect to go their own way, they must live with the consequences of their choice. They are responsible for their choice completely,"" he said. ""This means you are either in or you are out. You cannot be half in and half out,"" he said. This video can not be played 'Football is meant to be on merit' - fans react to European Super League proposals The proposed league has united MPs from every party against it. Suggestions from MPs on action the government could take include governance reform, changes to competition law, changes to taxpayer support for clubs and border controls on arrivals into the UK. UK watchdog the Competition and Markets Authority said it would be ""carefully considering any competition aspects of these proposals"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he thought the ""threat of legislation will have an effect"" but the government needed to act quickly. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called for ""real action"" from the government, suggesting a new law requiring owners to ballot season ticket holders before committing clubs to newly formed competitions.

"Chelsea fans protested against their involvement in the European Super League outside Stamford Bridge All six Premier League teams involved in the European Super League (ESL) have now withdrawn from the competition. Manchester City were the first club to pull out after Chelsea had signalled their intent to do so by preparing documentation to withdraw. The other four sides - Arsenal, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham - have all now followed suit. Italian side Inter Milan are also set to withdraw as they no longer wish to be involved with the project. BBC Sport understands bosses at the Serie A club are preparing for their exit following Tuesday night's dramatic developments. How football's volatile 48 hours unfolded The 12-team Super League, set up by the seven afore-mentioned teams and Spain's Atletico Madrid, Barcelona and Real Madrid and Italy's AC Milan and Juventus wasannounced on Sundayto widespread condemnation. ""Despite the announced departure of the English clubs, forced to take such decisions due to the pressure put on them, we are convinced our proposal is fully aligned with European law and regulations,"" the ESL said on Wednesday, adding it was ""convinced that the current status quo of European football needs to change"". In an interview with Italian newspaper la Repubblica, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli said the remaining clubs will ""press ahead"" and the project still had ""a 100% chance of being a success""., ""Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is insisting on the idea of keeping the group together to push for change,"" says Spanish football expert Guillem Balague.

In a statement, the European Super League said: ""Given the current circumstances we shall reconsider the most appropriate steps to reshape the project, always having in mind our goals of offering fans the best experience possible while enhancing solidarity payments for the entire football community."" English football's 'big six' were part of a group that announced plans to form the breakaway league, which they hoped to establish as a new midweek competition. It was condemned by fans, football authorities and government ministers in the UK and across Europe by Uefa and league associations. Around 1,000 fans gathered outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge groundbefore their game against Brighton on Tuesdayto protest at their club's involvement. Chelsea legend Petr Cech pleaded with fans to disperse outside the ground before their match against Brighton Manchester United executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, who was involved in the Super League discussions, hasannounced he will step downfrom his role at the end of 2021. Leading players at some of the six clubs signalled their disapproval of the planned breakaway league. Liverpool captainJordan Henderson said on social media,externalhis side's ""collective position"" is they do not want the Super League to take place. ""We don't like it and we don't want it to happen,"" read a message that was also posted by many fellow Liverpool players. After City confirmed their withdrawal, England winger Raheem Sterling posted: ""Ok bye."" Uefa had hoped to stave off the threat of a European Super League with a new 36-team Champions League, which wasagreed on Monday. In announcing their proposals for a Super League that would eventually comprise of 20 teams, the 12-club group said the Champions League reforms did not go far enough. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, who was named as the ESL's chairman, said the competitionwas set up ""to save football""because young people are ""no longer interested"" in the game because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". None of the Spanish and Italian sides have yet released a statement after the six Premier League teams pulled out. TheArsenalboard said they did not intend to ""cause such distress"" and that they joined the Super League because they ""did not want to be left behind"" and wanted to ensure the club's future.

"Plans for a new football European Super League (ESL) have collapsed, following the withdrawal of most of the teams involved. The decision follows a massive backlash against the league, which had the support of some of the world's biggest clubs. Six English Premier League teams had signed up to the ESL - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. They joined AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid as founder members. The idea was for the clubs to remain in their national leagues, but also to play each other in a new midweek European competition, which would have rivalled the Champions League. The ESL would have had 20 teams, of which 15 founding members would be permanent and never face relegation. Five other sides would qualify each year. All six English Premier League clubs dropped out of the project on Tuesday night. They have now been followed by Atletico Madrid in Spain and Italian team Inter Milan. One of the chief movers behind the ESL, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, has now admitted that the ESL is not likely to go ahead. ""I remain convinced of the beauty of that project,"" he said. ""But evidently no, I don't think that project is now still up and running."" ESL 'cannot now proceed' How football's volatile 72 hours unfolded With 15 teams in the ESL not facing qualification or relegation, critics said it would have devalued the game because it was unfair and uncompetitive. For instance, Arsenal have not qualified for the Champions League since the 2016-17 season, but they would have been guaranteed a place - regardless of how they performed in the domestic league. However, a future winner of the Premier League would not necessarily have qualified for the ESL if they were not a permanent member. If this were the case, that team would miss out on millions of pounds in revenue. The ESL attracted widespread criticism from pundits, players, MPs and most football bodies not involved. Fans of the clubs involved held several protests outside their grounds. Chelsea fans protest against plans for a European Super League ahead of the club's game against Brighton It appears they were taken aback by the strength of criticism. Arsenal apologised in an open letter to their fans and said they had ""made a mistake"", adding they were withdrawing after listening to supporters and the ""wider football community"". Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the club regretted the ""anxiety and upset"" caused by the proposal. Manchester United said they had ""listened carefully to the reaction from our fans, the UK government and other key stakeholders,"" in making their decision. Real Madrid president Florentino Perezhad claimed it would ""save football"", at a time when young people are ""no longer interested"" because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". The founding clubs were promised a share of a â¬3.5bn (Â£3bn) grant, provided by investment bank JP Morgan. Most are in considerable debt,made worse by the Covid pandemic, due to disrupted fixtures and a lack of spectators. Big clubs also have superstar players with multi-million pound salaries. If they could guarantee taking part in a major European football competition every year, they would have become more valuable and stable businesses. Super League makes financial sense for top clubs The 20-team league would have been split into two groups of 10, playing each other at home and away. The top three in each group would have qualified for the quarter-finals, with the fourth and fifth-placed teams competing in a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots. It would then have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League, with a final in May. The president of Uefa (the Union of European Football Associations), Aleksander Ceferin, had warned that participating clubs could be banned from European competition, and their players prevented from appearing at the Euros and the World Cup. Mr Ceferin welcomed the English clubs' reversal, saying, ""the important thing now is that we move on, rebuild the unity that the game enjoyed before this, and move forward together"".

"This video can not be played European Super League chairman, Florentino Perez: ""We want to save football"" The European Super League was created ""to save football"", says Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. Real are one of the 12 European clubs who have signed up to the breakaway league and intend to establish a new midweek competition. Perez said the move had been made because young people are ""no longer interested in football"" because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". ""Whenever there is change, there are always people who oppose it,"" he said. Fifa boss 'strongly disapproves' of ESL plans as Everton criticise clubs for 'preposterous arrogance' This video can not be played Alan Shearer says the proposed European Super League is ""plain and simply wrong"" The English 'big six' of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham haveagreed to join the new league. The move has been criticised by football authorities and government ministers in the UK and widely condemned across Europe by Uefa and leagues associations. Prime Minister Boris Johnson willhold a meetingwith football's governing bodies on Tuesday to discuss the move, while the 14 Premier League clubs not included in the plans are also scheduled to meet. Perez said that the top teams were losing money and that big-name matches would help increase their revenue. ""We are doing this to save football at this critical moment,"" Perez told Spanish TV show El Chiringuito de Jugones. ""If we continue with the Champions League there is less and less interest and then it's over. ""The new format which starts in 2024 is absurd. In 2024, we are all dead."" Plans for a revamped 36-team Champions League, starting in 2024, wereconfirmed by Uefa on Monday. He added: ""In the '50s, it was a similar situation. Uefa and Fifa went against the new European Cup, but that competition changed football."" 'Bonfire of greed' - How Europe has reacted European Super League Q&A - What happens next? AC Milan chief executive Ivan Gazidis said the ESL would be ""a new, exciting chapter for the game"" and that it will ""provide value and support"" across European football. ""We're confident that this new competition will capture the imagination of billions of soccer fans all over the world,"" he said. Gazidis also said the club wants to continue to play in Serie A, which he said ""will remain the most important weekend competition in Italy"". Juventus manager Andrea Pirlo came out in support of the ESL and the club's owner Andrea Agnelli, who quit as European Club Association (ECA) chairman after signing the Turin club up to the new competition. ""He explained this project to us, he gave us great confidence, but the most important thing he told us is that we have to continue with our work,"" Pirlo said. Perez said the move had been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to matches being played behind closed doors. He claimed 40% of young people are not interested in football and Real have lost 400m euros (Â£344m) because of the impact of the pandemic. ""When you don't have any income other than from television, you have to find a solution to make more attractive matches that fans all over the world can watch with all of the big clubs,"" said Perez. ""Young people are no longer interested in football. They have other platforms on which to distract themselves. ""We could get back some of the money we lost because of the pandemic. We have to raise more money organising more competitive games."" A YouGov poll of 1,730 football fans in the UK found 79% opposed the idea of a Super League. Among fans aged between 18 and 24, 71% were found to be against it with only 19% of respondents saying they were in favour of the competition. Only 7% said they strongly supported the creation of the ESL. However, critics say the move is being driven purely by money, would destroy domestic leagues and is against the integrity of the sport. Former England captain Alan Shearer said he hoped the English clubs would consider the reaction of their fans, which has been overwhelmingly negative. ""Clubs talk about being a family and how fans are the soul of the club,"" Shearer told BBC Breakfast. ""Well, let's see what they really think about the fans, because the fans have now spoken. ""It is clearly obvious that they don't want this, so let's see what their fans mean to the football clubs."" There has been no concrete plan released on how the tournament would be structured but Perez said it could have shorter matches in order to keep their targeted younger audience interested. ""Young people say the game is too long,"" he said. ""If young people don't watch an entire game it is because it is not interesting enough, or we will have to shorten the games."" He also said that referees and the video review system would be ""improved"" in the tournament. ""There will be financial fair play and stability. We'll try to select the referees with professional criteria,"" he added. Another three teams will be added to the league as guaranteed members, with five more qualifying each year. Perez said the group want to start the new league by August, should they reach an agreement with Uefa, otherwise it could be delayed by a year. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin called the league a""disgraceful, self-serving"" planand a ""spit in the face of football lovers"". Ceferin also said that players involved with the ESL could be banned from all Uefa competitions, which Perez denied. ""It will not happen, the law protects us,"" Perez added. ""We will not get into legal issues. It is impossible. The players should remain calm because the threats won't happen.      ""This is not a league for the rich, it's a league to save football."" A dozen clubs - including Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - agree to form a new midweek competition European Super League will feature 20 clubsin all and run alongside domestic leagues such as the Premier League Founding clubs are being enticed with ashare of a â¬3.5bn (Â£3bn) grant provided by the investment bank JP Morgan UK government says it is prepared""to put everything on the table to prevent this from happening"".

"Avram Glazer, Joel Glazer and Bryan Glazer, pictured, are part of the family that owns a majority stake in Manchester United, although Avram sold some of his shares in March Sports fans love a bit of jeopardy - a nail biting contest which can end in glory or defeat. But business owners generally hate all of that. Owners and business managers of football clubs have a peculiar problem. As one former chief executive of a Premier League club told me: ""I won't know till the last day of the season if my budget for next year is going to be Â£170m or Â£70m."" That is not only almost impossible to manage, it has another very important consequence. Businesses with steady revenues are worth a lot more than ones with erratic earnings. In business terms it's known as getting a higher ""multiple"" - volatile businesses are worth as little as five times average annual earnings, whereas steady ones are worth up to 20 times or more. This is what the European Super League is all about - making the clubs involved worth more by eliminating the jeopardy of being relegated or missing out on Champions League qualification. This is the moment many football team owners have been waiting for - particularly the American owners of Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal - who know for themselves how much more stable and therefore valuable are the earnings of American sports teams. The backers of the Super League say that the existing Champions League was a poor product - too many meaningless one sided games between minnows and giants of European football before it got interesting. Q&A: What is the new Super League? 'Big six' agree to join 'Super League' They also argue that a more stable financial top to the football pyramid is needed to ensure the cascade or trickle down to the smaller clubs that they promise will increase as a result of this. But many sports fans would argue the prospect of a romantic giant killing in Real Madrid's Bernabeau stadium or Old Trafford is an essential part of the game - while regular meetings between the great clubs normalise and make humdrum what was once an exotic and rare event. The backers have told the BBC this is not another extreme form of negotiation to make Uefa cave to the big clubs' long-standing demands for more control of the world's most prestigious club event - ""this is really happening, it's on, even if Uefa backs down"". If it does it will have far reaching implications for the existing leagues around Europe. Finishing in the top four of the Premier League is the biggest prize in English football. The six teams joining the Super League have realised that six doesn't go into four - two miss out every year. Not any more. An insider at the Super League admitted that the plan will seriously dilute the value of the Premier League as a product - the race which is one of its key attractions will be meaningless. We have been down this road before and the former Premier League chief executive suggested that the pandemic had provided a window of opportunity for a very radical proposal that would not have a chance of succeeding in normal times. ""There is a cynical opportunism to this,"" he said. ""They realise that things are chaotic right now and that in many ways - anything goes."" But he added: ""Football is about two groups of people. Players and fans. You upset them at your peril. ""If fans decide to boycott the matches, that will be a financial disaster, and if Fifa threatens to ban participating players from representing their country in the World Cup - they won't go for it."" If you like jeopardy, the stakes don't get much higher than this. Q&A: What is the new Super League?

Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape. The organiser's fine will be reduced to half if paid within two weeks, and if it is not paid, he will face a court appearance, the force said. A man who has helped bury dozens of Muslims who died with Covid-19 in one of England's worst-affected towns has spoken about the daily pressures of his role. Imran Patel, who is a volunteer at Blackburn Muslim Burial Society, has helped with 340 interments in the last 12 months, of which 200 were for people who had died with coronavirus. This video can not be played Reality Check There are currently not enough vaccines for India's vast population As we reported earlier, India haspledged to offer alladults over the age of 18a coronavirus vaccine from 1 May in a bid to stem a
severe second wave of the virus. However, domestic vaccine makers are struggling to meet
demand both at home and globally. The government has offered financial assistance to two
vaccine makers - the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech - and halted
large exports of vaccines in a bid to help boost local production. But will it be enough?Read more about the situation here. Yogita LimayeBBC India correspondent Many families are losing loved ones to the coronavirus More than 99% of all intensive care beds are full in Indiaâs
capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral
rituals as crematoriums and graveyards are running out of manpower and space. In smaller towns the situation is even worse. A sharp surge
in cases and deaths is being reported from many parts of India. Some areas are
now in lockdown. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about
decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the
Joint Biosecurity Centre, the JBC, they look at the issue and will make their
determination based on what they think we need to doâ. Asked about yesterdayâs decision to put India on the red list
he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here. Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,0.9867448
"Fans protested against the proposed league outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge stadium on Tuesday Plans for a European Super League offend ""the basic principles of competition"", Boris Johnson has said. Describing the proposal as a ""cartel"", the prime minister said he would use legislation to block it if needed. The 12 founding members of the league faced a fierce backlash after unveiling proposals for a breakaway tournament, in which they would be permanent members and not face relegation. But Real Madrid insisted they were doing it to ""save football"". Latest reaction to the European Super League Why Super League makes financial sense for top clubs Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new league? Asked about the proposed league at a Downing Street press conference, Mr Johnson said: ""I think it's not in the interests of fans, it's not in the interests of football. ""How can it be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel that stops clubs competing against each other, playing against each other properly, with all the hope and excitement that gives to the fans up and down the country?"" ""These clubs, these names, originate from famous towns and cities in our country,"" he added. ""I don't think that it is right that they should be somehow dislocated from their home towns, home cities, taken and turned into international brands and commodities that just circulate the planet, propelled by the billions of banks, without any reference to fans and to those who have loved them all their lives."" Asked what legislative measures the government might use, the prime minister said: ""What we want to do first of all is back the FA, back the Premier League and hope that we can thwart this proposal before it goes very much further."" Earlier, the prime minister met with FA and Premier League officials, as well as fans' representatives. Following the meeting,No 10 said Mr Johnson would take ""whatever action necessary"" to stop the plans. The prime minister's official spokesman said among the measures under consideration were preventing players of the clubs involved getting work visas and the withdrawal of police funding for match days. Six English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - have signed up to the league. They would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan. The competition would have 20 teams and another five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition. Matches would take place midweek in an attempt to have more matches between the big-name clubs and rival the existing Champions League. The plans revealed on Sunday that the 12 founding football clubs would be permanent members and never face relegation. Critics say the new league could supplant the existing Champions League and disrupt the current football ""pyramid"" that sees teams rise or fall on merit. Read morehere. Real Madrid's president Florentino Perezhas defended the decision to create the new league, saying it was taken in part because ""young people are no longer interested"" in the game. He told a Spanish TV show: ""Audiences are decreasing and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt."" The president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, has warned that players for teams in the ESL would be ""banned from the World Cup and the Euros"". But in a letter to Uefa and Fifa, seen by the BBC, lawyers for the ESL say they have filed injunctions to prevent player and club bans, saying they consider such actions to be ""unlawful"". An insider at the ESL said they had prepared themselves for a huge backlash, and thought they were on firm legal ground with respect to competition law. ""I think in the cold light of day, they are looking at this and the reality is dawning that this is happening and it's perfectly legal,"" they told the BBC. A Spanish court has temporarily blocked any attempt by Uefa or Fifa to ban clubs or players from leagues or competitions, in an interim ruling to prevent any bans before the legal basis of them can be tested.

"Man City start withdrawal process from European Super League Other five Premier League clubs to withdraw Ed Woodward to resign as executive vice chairman at Man Utd Premier League's 'big six' had agreed to join the breakaway league Get Involved: #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Callum Matthews and Luke Reddy Let's end tonight with some Bobby Robson. A lot of fans have worried about the step their club was taking or what kind of environment their club would be left in. Fans, pundits, managers, former players, current players, politicians, celebrities, journalists and many, many more have raged against a new dawn. Why do people care so much? Over to the late Sir Bobby Robson... âWhat is a club in any case? Not the buildings or the directors or the people who are paid to represent it. Itâs not the television contracts, get-out clauses, marketing departments or executive boxes. Itâs the noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging, the pride in your city. Itâs a small boy clambering up stadium steps for the very first time, gripping his fatherâs hand, gawping at that hallowed stretch of turf beneath him and, without being able to do a thing about it, falling in love.â Goodnight. Right then, it's been lively has it not? Every now and again a story comes up that just kicks on to another level. This one is comfortably filed in the 'cling on during the carnage' folder. Let's boil it down nice and simple: - Man Utd will need a new executive vice chairman as Ed Woodward is leaving.More on that here. - There were 12 teams proposing a European Super League break away. After 48 hours we are down to six and none of them are from England as Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester City and Chelsea are all no longer getting involved.More on that here.

You know I'd not leave you hanging like that. What have you missed on this night of nights? - A protest at Chelsea where even Petr Cech featured (this actually happened) - Chelsea's acknowledgment they would withdraw from the European Super League (cue goal-like celebrations. That was a good thing because Chelsea later drew 0-0 with Brighton) - Manchester City went all in and said they were done with the idea of an ESL and were pulling out. That left four English clubs in the mix. - Ed Woodward resigned at Manchester United and he'll depart at the end of the season. - Liverpool's players started tweeting their dislike for the European Super League - Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United all pulled out at around 23:00 BST. - There have been supporting roles on this fine evening from Boris Johnson, Conor McGregor, Gary Neville, Luke Shaw, the list goes on. Some evening friends. Right, so you've spent the night catching up on Line of Duty and an Only Fools and Horses box set. What have you missed? Too much for me to describe. So we're moving on. Tweet us on #bbcfootball The Other Brian:So all the England based teams have cut and run... they are very sorry, they made a mistake!

Its all good then, no problem, don't worry about it, I'm sure us fans will have completely forgotten about the total contempt you have shown towards us, by the weekend. :-) Allow Twitter content?

Arsenal The last few days have shown us yet again the depth of feeling our supporters around the world have for this great club and the game we love. We needed no reminding of this but the response from supporters in recent days has given us time for further reflection and deep thought. It was never our intention to cause such distress, however when the invitation to join the Super League came, while knowing there were no guarantees, we did not want to be left behind to ensure we protected Arsenal and its future. As a result of listening to you and the wider football community over recent days we are withdrawing from the proposed Super League. We made a mistake, and we apologise for it. We know it will take time to restore your faith in what we are trying to achieve here at Arsenal but let us be clear that the decision to be part of the Super League was driven by our desire to protect Arsenal, the club you love, and to support the game you love through greater solidarity and financial stability. Stability is essential for the game to prosper and we will continue to strive to bring the security the game needs to move forward. The system needs to be fixed. We must work together to find solutions which protect the future of the game and harness the extraordinary power football has to get us on the edge of our seats. Finally, we know this has been hugely unsettling at the end of what has been an incredibly difficult year for us all. Our aim is always to make the right decisions for this great football club, to protect it for the future and to take us forward. We didnât make the right decision here, which we fully accept. We have heard you. The Arsenal Board Simon StoneBBC Sport For three nights my plans have been shredded. I need to see the latest episode. We assume some of you may be celebrating?

"This video can not be played Alan Shearer says the proposed European Super League is ""plain and simply wrong"" The government will take ""whatever action necessary"", including legislative options, to stop plans for a European Super League, No 10 says. Following the PM's meeting with the FA and Premier League officials, and fans' representatives, Downing Street said: ""No action is off the table."" The 12 founding members of the league faced a fierce backlash after unveiling proposals for a breakaway tournament. One of these, Real Madrid, insisted they were doing it to ""save football"". Club president Florentino Perez saidthe decision to create the new league was in part taken because ""young people are no longer interested"" in the game. He told a Spanish TV show: ""Audiences are decreasing and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt."" Latest reaction to the European Super League Why Super League makes financial sense for top clubs Klopp against ESL but will not quit Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new league? The president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, has warned players who play for teams in the ESL that they would be ""banned from the World Cup and the Euros"". But in a letter to Uefa and Fifa, seen by the BBC, lawyers for the ESL say they have filed injunctions to prevent player and club bans, saying they consider such actions to be ""unlawful"". An insider at the ESL said they had prepared themselves for a huge backlash, and thought they were on firm legal ground with respect to competition law. ""I think in the cold light of day, they are looking at this and the reality is dawning that this is happening and it's perfectly legal,"" they told the BBC. A Spanish court has temporarily blocked any attempt by Uefa or Fifa to ban clubs or players from leagues or competitions, in an interim ruling to prevent any bans before the legal basis of this can be tested. ESL insiders said ""this looks aggressive but we had to take defensive action in the face of threats from Uefa and Fifa - our hope is we can ultimately resolve this in negotiations"". This video can not be played European Super League chairman, Florentino Perez: ""We want to save football"" The 14 Premier League clubs not participating in the new venture ""unanimously and vigorously"" rejected the plans for the competition and are ""considering all actions available to prevent it from progressing"". A statement released on Tuesday said they ""call on those clubs involved in the proposed competition to cease their involvement immediately"". One of these, Everton, released a statementcriticising the ""preposterous arrogance"" of the clubs involved. Downing Street said the prime minister told his meeting with FA and Premier League officials that the government ""will not stand by while a small handful of owners create a closed shop"". Boris Johnson reiterated his ""unwavering support for the football authorities and confirmed they have the government's full backing to take whatever action necessary to put a stop to these plans"", a statement said. He also made it clear ""that no action is off the table and the government is exploring every possibility, including legislative options, to ensure these proposals are stopped"". The prime minister's official spokesman said among the measures under consideration were preventing players of the clubs involved getting work visas and the withdrawal of police funding for match days. This video can not be played 'Football is meant to be on merit' - fans react to European Super League proposals Chief executive of the Football Supporters' Association, Kevin Miles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""The mood music from the government was they would do what was required to make sure that the measures to exclude those [ESL] clubs from competitions would not fall foul of competition law, and that they would amend the law if necessary."" UK watchdog the Competition and Markets Authority said it would be ""carefully considering any competition aspects of these proposals"". The proposed league has united MPs from every party against it. Suggestions from MPs on action the government could take include governance reform, changes to competition law, changes to taxpayer support for clubs and border controls on arrivals into the UK. The Arsenal Supporters' Trust said it was ""delighted"" to hear the government's promise of action, adding that the PM vowed the football governance review led by Conservative MP and former sports minister Tracey Crouch would be ""swift"". There have been protests by fans across the country against the proposed league, including outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground on Tuesday. Fans burn a Liverpool replica shirt outside Elland Road against Liverpool's decision to be included in the European Super League Six English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - have signed up to the league. They would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan. The competition would have 20 teams and another five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition. Matches would take place midweek in an attempt to have more matches between the big-name clubs and rival the existing Champions League. The plans revealed on Sunday that the 12 founding football clubs would be permanent members and never face relegation. Critics say the new league could supplant the existing Champions League and disrupt the current football ""pyramid"" that sees teams rise or fall on merit. Read morehere. Former England captain Alan Shearer told BBC Breakfast the six English clubs should be expelled from the Premier League, which they have said they aim to remain in while also playing in the European Super League. ""It's not right what they are doing, it's not competitive, it's a closed shop - you can't have a competition where no one else is allowed in,"" he said. ""You can hear, feel and see the anger from almost everyone in football."" Chairman of the Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Julian Knight, said restricting work visas for footballers who play in the proposed ESL could be one way the government could pull levers to stop the league going ahead. Speaking to the BBC, he said other options were a windfall tax on clubs and long-term reform giving fans much greater power on football club boards. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he thought the ""threat of legislation will have an effect"" but the government needed to act quickly. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called for ""real action"" from the government, suggesting a new law requiring owners to ballot season ticket holders before committing clubs to newly formed competitions. And on Monday, the Duke of Cambridge, who is president of the Football Association, said he shared fans' concerns about ""the damage it risks causing to the game we love"". Gianni Infantino, president of the world football's governing body Fifa, said he ""strongly disapproves"" of the plans. ""If some elect to go their own way, they must live with the consequences of their choice. They are responsible for their choice completely. This means you are either in or you are out. You cannot be half in and half out."" Sky Sports confirmed it had ""not been involved in any discussions"" about the breakaway league.

"Yvette Cooper, the Labour MP who chairs Parliament's Home Affairs Committee, has criticised the delay in putting India on the government's travel-ban ""red list"". ""They should have put India on the red list at the same time as Pakistan and Bangladesh. Since then, we've had this three-week period in which thousands of people have returned from India and that probably includes hundreds of the new variant Covid cases,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. India was added to the red list on 23 April, but neighbouring Pakistan and Bangladesh had been on it since 9 April. One of the variants of coronavirus first identified in India has spread to the UK. Just under half of these cases involve international travel and the strain has now been designated a ""variant of concern"". What is the India Covid variant? The red list is the government'slist of 43 countries,externalfrom which there are strict restrictions on travel to England. Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales all have similar rules in place with the same list of countries. The restrictions are designed to protect the UK from new variants, against which vaccines may be less effective and which may spread more easily. Which countries are on the red list? What are the Indian, Brazil, South Africa and UK variants? India red list add 'may be too late', Prof Mark Walport says Travel to England is banned for anyone who has been in one of the countries in the past 10 days, except for UK citizens and residents, who have to isolate on arrival at government-approved hotels. Direct flights are banned from most red list countries, but not Pakistan, Bangladesh, Kenya and India. The government says this is to allow critical freight and make it easier for British nationals to return home. The decision is based on Joint Biosecurity Centre risk assessments, which include: how good a country's testing structures are, including checking for variants how many cases those systems have identified whether people in that country have been catching new variants at home or the cases have come from overseas evidence of whether that country has exported cases of new variants to other countries, including to the UK how good the country's travel links with the UK are The first point is important, because the genome sequencing needed to identify new variants is very sophisticated and relatively rare. But just because a country has found variants of concern, or has many cases of coronavirus, it will not necessarily be on the red list. On 18 May,external, the World Health Organization identified: 106 countries where the variant identified in South Africa had been found, of which 28 are on the red list 61 countries with the variant identified in Brazil, of which 19 are on the red list 48 countries with the variant identified in India, of which 6 are on the red list. Bangladesh had the South Africa but not the Brazil variant and Pakistan had neither when they were added to the red list on 9 April. India had both, as well as a new variant, but was not added for another two weeks. On 9 April: Pakistan had a seven-day average of 21 cases per million people Bangladesh had twice as many India had four times as many Health Secretary Matt Hancock said these figures depended on how much testing was being done and said ""far more"" was carried out in India. He said the decision to add Pakistan and Bangladesh earlier was based on a higher proportion of people arriving in the UK from these countries, testing positive for coronavirus. ""When we put Pakistan and Bangladesh on the red list, positivity among those arriving from those countries was three times higher than it was among those arriving from India,"" Mr Hancock told Parliament on 17 May. Figures from NHS Test and Trace,externaldo not support that claim. For the period 25 March to 7 April, the positivity rate from Bangladesh was 3.7%, from India was 5.1% and from Pakistan was 6.2%. Mr Hancock was asked about this in Parliament on 19 May and said: ""The positivity rate in India, on which the decision to put Pakistan but not India on the red list was 1.6% in India and 4.6% in Pakistan, which is three times higher, as I said."" But those are not published figures. He didn't give the date for them and didn't mention Bangladesh this time. Checking Matt Hancock's claim about Covid cases from India ""Nobody knows the full criteria - but there may be a political element because the UK wants a trade deal with India,"" Dr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology, at the University of Reading, said. Boris Johnson had planned a trade visit to India but cancelled iton 19 April- days before the country was added to the red list. One of the variants first identified in India was designated as a variant of concern on 7 May. By 17 May, 2,323 cases of this variant had been found in the UK, of which 483 had been in Bolton and Blackburn with Darwen. The WHO said,externalit appeared to have a higher rate of transmission and that there was preliminary evidence suggesting some vaccines may be less effective against it. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon cited fears of the India variant on 14 May as one of the reasons why Glasgow and Moray willnot have restrictions eased as planned. In the four weeks before India was added to the red list, 6,560 people were tested on arrival in England from India. Of those, 425 tested positive for coronavirus, which is about 6%. The Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. Just under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling, according toa 13 May briefing from Public Health England,external. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England. Almost 60% of positive Covid19 tests are now sent for genome sequencing to identify new variants, which means the government has a good idea of where the cases are. Asked about the delays in adding India to the red list, the UK's former chief scientific adviser Prof Mark Walport told the BBC: ""These decisions are almost inevitably taken a bit too late in truth.""

"This video can not be played Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by has died of his injuries following clashes with rebels in the north of the country at the weekend, the army has said. The announcement came a day after provisional election results projected he would win a sixth term in office. The government and parliament have been dissolved. A curfew has also been imposed and the borders have been shut. DÃ©by, 68, spent more than three decades in power and was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. An army officer by training, he came to power in 1990 through an armed uprising. He was a long-time ally of France and other Western powers in the battle against jihadist groups in the Sahel region of Africa. DÃ©by ""breathed his last defending the sovereign nation on the battlefield"", an army general said on state TV on Tuesday. He had gone to the front line, several hundred kilometres north of the capital, N'Djamena, at the weekend to visit troops battling rebels belonging to a group calling itself Fact (the Front for Change and Concord in Chad). A state funeral is due to take place on Friday. Reaction to DÃ©byâs death Chad's future rocked by president's battlefield death Idriss DÃ©by - the end of Chad's 'Great Survivor' A quick guide to Chad A military council led by DÃ©by's son, a 37-year-old four star general, will govern for the next 18 months. Mahamat Idriss DÃ©by Itno will lead the council, but ""free and democratic"" elections will be held once the transition period is over, the army said in its statement. He later issued a statement naming the 14 other generals who will make up the new governing body. A BBC Monitoring journalist tweeted a copy of the notice: Allow Twitter content?

Experts have told the BBC and other broadcasters that the move is unconstitutional, and that the speaker of parliament should take over when a sitting president dies before organising elections. Ahead of the election on 11 April, DÃ©by campaigned on a platform of bringing peace and security to the region. Provisional results showed he had 80% of the vote. But there had been growing unhappiness over his government's management of Chad's oil resources. Idriss DÃ©by was known as that rare thing - a true warrior president. The former rebel and trained pilot was the opposite of an armchair general. For 30 years, he clung to power in Chad - a vast nation that straddles the Sahara and is surrounded by some of the continent's most protracted conflicts. And DÃ©by had a hand in every one of them - from Darfur to Libya, Mali, Nigeria and the Central African Republic. His troops were among the most battle-hardened on the planet. Domestically, he had become an increasingly autocratic figure. His latest election victory saw him claim nearly 80% of the vote. It is unclear if the poor, feuding, brittle state he leaves behind can manage a smooth transition. And there are wider concerns too. For years, President DÃ©by was the West's indispensable ally in the war against Islamist militants - in Mali, Niger and beyond. His death leaves a vacuum that many may now fight to fill. In a statement, the French presidency described Mr DÃ©by as a ""brave friend"" and said it affirmed its attachment to the stability of Chad. Over the years, France has deployed troops and fighter jets to push back Mr DÃ©by's opponents. Chadian forces are considered to be the most effective of the Western-backed ""G5"" countries fighting Islamist militants in the Sahel region. And it has often proved to be the more stable country in a region that includes Libya, Sudan and the Central African Republic - where armed groups roam freely and trade in weapons and lucrative resources that fuel conflict, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga. Founded in 2016 by disillusioned former army officers, the rebel Fact group accuses President DÃ©by of repression in the run-up to the election. They built up their base in Libya in the Tibesti mountains, which straddle northern Chad and part of southern Libya. On election day, the group mounted an attack on a border post and gradually advanced on N'Djamena. The latest clashes began on Saturday. The army says that 300 insurgents were killed and 150 captured. Five government soldiers were killed and 36 injured, it says. The figures could not immediately be verified. Some foreign embassies in the capital have urged their staff to leave. A former BBC journalist in N'Djamena says the situation there seemed relatively calm: ""The news is filtering through to people, but the city is calm and people are just shocked to hear that actually, because many people didn't even know that he [President DÃ©by] was wounded or that he was at the frontline,"" said Mahamat Adamou. ""In the street in downtown, there are armoured vehicles that are posted at key road junctions. Of course, there is a sense of 'What is going to happen?'. But not more than that."" N'Djamena has come under rebel attack before and there was panic in the city on Monday, with parents taking their children home from school, when tanks were deployed along the main roads. 1) It is named after Lake Chad. This is the second-largest lake in Africa, but has shrunk by 90% since the 1960s. Its basin covers parts of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, and is a water source for between 20 million and 30 million people. 2) The Sahara Desert roughly covers one third of the country. Much of the north is desert and home to a mere 1% of Chad's population. The south has large expanses of wooded savannahs and woodlands. 3) Remains of a seven-million-year-old human-like creature - or hominid - known as ""Toumai"" were unearthed in 2001. Its discoverers argued that Toumai was the oldest hominid known to science. 4) Chad became an oil-producing nation in 2003, with the completion of a $4bn (Â£2.87bn) pipeline linking its oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast. The industry has been plagued by allegations of corruption. 5) Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for most people - cotton is grown in the south, and exported to Europe and the US.

"Family members of a person who died of Covid-19 react during a cremation In early March, India's health minister Harsh Vardhan declared the country was ""in the endgame"" of the Covid-19 pandemic. Mr Vardhan also lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership as an ""example to the world in international co-operation"". From January onwards, India had begun shipping doses to foreign countries as part of its much-vaunted ""vaccine diplomacy"". Mr Vardhan's unbridled optimism was based on a sharp drop in reported infections. Since a peak of more than 93,000 cases per day on average in mid-September, infections had steadily declined. By mid-February, India was counting an average of 11,000 cases a day. The seven-day rolling average of daily deaths from the disease had slid to below 100. The euphoria at beating the virus had been building since late last year. Politicians, policy makers and parts of the media believed that India was truly out of the woods. In December, central bank officials announced that India was ""bending the Covid infection curve"". There was evidence, they said, in poetic terms, that the economy was ""breaking out amidst winter's lengthening shadows towards a place in sunlight"". Mr Modi was called a ""vaccine guru"". Hospitals are overflowing with patients, often two to a bed At the end of February, India's election authorities announced key elections in five states where 186 million people were eligible to vote for 824 seats. Beginning 27 March, the polls would stretch over a month, and in the case of the state of West Bengal, be held in eight phases. Campaigning had begun in full swing, with no safety protocols and social distancing. In mid-March, the cricket board allowed more than 130,000 fans, mostly unmasked, to watch two international cricket games between India and England at the Narendra Modi stadium in Gujarat. In less than a month, things began to unravel. India was in the grips of a devastating second wave of the virus and cities were facing fresh lockdowns. By mid-April, the country was averaging more than 100,000 cases a day. On Sunday, India recorded more than 270,000 cases and over 1,600 deaths, both new single-day records. If the runway infection was not checked, India could be recording more than 2,300 deaths every day by first week of June, according to areport by The Lancet Covid-19 Commission,external. India is in now in the grips of a public health emergency. Social media feeds are full with videos of Covid funerals at crowded cemeteries, wailing relatives of the dead outside hospitals, long queues of ambulances carrying gasping patients, mortuaries overflowing with the dead, and patients, sometimes two to a bed, in corridors and lobbies of hospitals. There are frantic calls for help for beds, medicines, oxygen, essential drugs and tests. Drugs are being sold on the black market, and test results are taking days. ""They didn't tell me for three hours that my child is dead,"" a dazed mother says in one video, sitting outside an ICU. Wails of another person outside the intensive care punctuate the silences. India is facing a shortage of vaccines even as it ramps up its inoculation drive Even India's mammoth vaccination effort was now struggling. In the beginning, the rollout had been embroiled in a controversy over the efficacy over a home-grown candidate. Even as the country ramped up the drive andadministered more than 100 million dosesby last week,vaccine shortages were being reported. Serum Institute of India, the country's - and the world's - biggest vaccine maker said it would not be able to ramp up supplies before June because it didn't have enough money to expand capacity. India placed a temporary hold on all exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, because the doses were needed urgently at home, and allowed imports of foreign vaccines. Even oxygen was likely to be imported now to meet the surge in demand. Meanwhile, almost in a parallel universe, away from the death and despair, the world's richest cricket tournament was beingplayed behind closed doorsevery evening, and tens of thousands of people were following their leaders to election rallies andattending the Hindu festival of Kumbh Mela. ""It is beyond surreal, what is happening,"" Shiv Visvanathan, a sociology professor, told me. Experts believe the government appears to have completely dropped the ball on the second wave of infections that was about to hit India. Relatives performing funerals of Covid victims in the city of Bhopal In mid-February, Tabassum Barnagarwala, a journalist with the Indian Express newspaper, flagged a seven-fold rise in new cases in parts of Maharashtra and reported that samples from the infected had been sent for genome sequencing to look for imported variants. By the end of the month, theBBC reported the surgeand asked whether India was facing a new Covid wave. ""We really don't know what the cause of the surge is. What is worrying is that entire families are getting infected. This is a completely new trend,"" Dr Shyamsunder Nikam, civil surgeon of an affected district in Maharashtra, said at the time. Experts now say that crowing about India's exceptionalism in ""beating"" the epidemic - younger population, native immunity, a largely rural population - and declaring victory on the virus turned out to be cruelly premature. ""As is typical in India, official arrogance, hyper-nationalism, populism and an ample dose of bureaucratic incompetence have combined to create a crisis,"" said Mihir Sharma, a columnist for Bloomberg. India's second wave was fuelled by people letting their guard down, attending weddings and social gatherings, and by mixed messaging from the government, allowing political rallies and religious gatherings. With infections declining, fewer people were taking the jabs, slowing down the vaccination drive, which had aimed to inoculate 250 million people by the end of July. In mid-February, Bhramar Mukherjee, a biostatistician at the University of Michigan, tweeted that India needed to ""accelerate the vaccination drive while the case counts are low"". Nobody quite took notice. Devotees at the Kumbh Mela festival on 14 April, when India recorded more than 184,000 new infections ""There was a feeling of triumphalism,"" said K Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India. ""Some felt we had achieved herd immunity. Everyone wanted to get back to work. This narrative fell on many receptive ears, and the few voices of caution were not heeded to,"" he said. A second wave may have been inevitable, but India could have ""postponed or delayed it and lessened its impact,"" said Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology. Like many other countries, India should have begun careful genomic surveillance in January to detect variants, Mr Menon said. Some of thesevariants could be driving the surge. ""We learnt of new variants in February from reports from Maharashtra. This was initially denied by authorities,"" Mr Menon added. ""This was a significant turning point."" What are the lessons of this public health crisis? For one, India should learn not to declare victory over the virus prematurely, and it should put a lid on triumphalism. People should also learn to adapt to short, local lockdowns in the event of the inevitable future spikes of infection. Most epidemiologists predict more waves, given that India is evidently still far away from reaching herd immunity and its vaccination rate remains slow. ""We cant freeze human life,"" Professor Reddy said. ""If we can't physically distance in the crowded cities, we can at least make sure everyone wears a proper mask. And wear it properly. That's not a big ask.""

"Man City start withdrawal process from European Super League Other five Premier League clubs to withdraw Ed Woodward to resign as executive vice chairman at Man Utd Premier League's 'big six' had agreed to join the breakaway league Get Involved: #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Callum Matthews and Luke Reddy Let's end tonight with some Bobby Robson. A lot of fans have worried about the step their club was taking or what kind of environment their club would be left in. Fans, pundits, managers, former players, current players, politicians, celebrities, journalists and many, many more have raged against a new dawn. Why do people care so much? Over to the late Sir Bobby Robson... âWhat is a club in any case? Not the buildings or the directors or the people who are paid to represent it. Itâs not the television contracts, get-out clauses, marketing departments or executive boxes. Itâs the noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging, the pride in your city. Itâs a small boy clambering up stadium steps for the very first time, gripping his fatherâs hand, gawping at that hallowed stretch of turf beneath him and, without being able to do a thing about it, falling in love.â Goodnight. Right then, it's been lively has it not? Every now and again a story comes up that just kicks on to another level. This one is comfortably filed in the 'cling on during the carnage' folder. Let's boil it down nice and simple: - Man Utd will need a new executive vice chairman as Ed Woodward is leaving.More on that here. - There were 12 teams proposing a European Super League break away. After 48 hours we are down to six and none of them are from England as Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester City and Chelsea are all no longer getting involved.More on that here. My friends, I needs some normality. How about this? Read it while it's hot. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Well, there is also the Women's Super League... but let's not let the detail get in the way of a cheeky tweet from Fenerbahce midfielder Mesut Ozil. There is quite a lot of frustration on Twitter regarding Liverpool's statement on no longer participating in the European Super League. The club kept it short and sweet and some are pointing to a lack of apology or compassion. Sky Sports' Vinny O'Connor and The Athletic's James Pearce are among those pointing to the statement.

You know I'd not leave you hanging like that. What have you missed on this night of nights? - A protest at Chelsea where even Petr Cech featured (this actually happened) - Chelsea's acknowledgment they would withdraw from the European Super League (cue goal-like celebrations. That was a good thing because Chelsea later drew 0-0 with Brighton) - Manchester City went all in and said they were done with the idea of an ESL and were pulling out. That left four English clubs in the mix. - Ed Woodward resigned at Manchester United and he'll depart at the end of the season. - Liverpool's players started tweeting their dislike for the European Super League - Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United all pulled out at around 23:00 BST. - There have been supporting roles on this fine evening from Boris Johnson, Conor McGregor, Gary Neville, Luke Shaw, the list goes on. Some evening friends. Right, so you've spent the night catching up on Line of Duty and an Only Fools and Horses box set. What have you missed? Too much for me to describe. So we're moving on. Tweet us on #bbcfootball The Other Brian:So all the England based teams have cut and run... they are very sorry, they made a mistake!

Its all good then, no problem, don't worry about it, I'm sure us fans will have completely forgotten about the total contempt you have shown towards us, by the weekend. :-) Allow Twitter content?

Tottenham Hotspur We can confirm that we have formally commenced procedures to withdraw from the group developing proposals for a European Super League (ESL). Chairman Daniel Levy said: âWe regret the anxiety and upset caused by the ESL proposal. We felt it was important that our club participated in the development of a possible new structure that sought to better ensure financial fair play and financial sustainability whilst delivering significantly increased support for the wider football pyramid. âWe believe that we should never stand still and that the sport should constantly review competitions and governance to ensure the game we all love continues to evolve and excite fans around the world. âWe should like to thank all those supporters who presented their considered opinions.â Allow Twitter content?

Arsenal The last few days have shown us yet again the depth of feeling our supporters around the world have for this great club and the game we love. We needed no reminding of this but the response from supporters in recent days has given us time for further reflection and deep thought. It was never our intention to cause such distress, however when the invitation to join the Super League came, while knowing there were no guarantees, we did not want to be left behind to ensure we protected Arsenal and its future. As a result of listening to you and the wider football community over recent days we are withdrawing from the proposed Super League. We made a mistake, and we apologise for it. We know it will take time to restore your faith in what we are trying to achieve here at Arsenal but let us be clear that the decision to be part of the Super League was driven by our desire to protect Arsenal, the club you love, and to support the game you love through greater solidarity and financial stability. Stability is essential for the game to prosper and we will continue to strive to bring the security the game needs to move forward. The system needs to be fixed. We must work together to find solutions which protect the future of the game and harness the extraordinary power football has to get us on the edge of our seats. Finally, we know this has been hugely unsettling at the end of what has been an incredibly difficult year for us all. Our aim is always to make the right decisions for this great football club, to protect it for the future and to take us forward. We didnât make the right decision here, which we fully accept. We have heard you. The Arsenal Board Simon StoneBBC Sport For three nights my plans have been shredded. I need to see the latest episode. We assume some of you may be celebrating?

"This video can not be played Alan Shearer says the proposed European Super League is ""plain and simply wrong"" The government will take ""whatever action necessary"", including legislative options, to stop plans for a European Super League, No 10 says. Following the PM's meeting with the FA and Premier League officials, and fans' representatives, Downing Street said: ""No action is off the table."" The 12 founding members of the league faced a fierce backlash after unveiling proposals for a breakaway tournament. One of these, Real Madrid, insisted they were doing it to ""save football"". Club president Florentino Perez saidthe decision to create the new league was in part taken because ""young people are no longer interested"" in the game. He told a Spanish TV show: ""Audiences are decreasing and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt."" Latest reaction to the European Super League Why Super League makes financial sense for top clubs Klopp against ESL but will not quit Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new league? The president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, has warned players who play for teams in the ESL that they would be ""banned from the World Cup and the Euros"". But in a letter to Uefa and Fifa, seen by the BBC, lawyers for the ESL say they have filed injunctions to prevent player and club bans, saying they consider such actions to be ""unlawful"". An insider at the ESL said they had prepared themselves for a huge backlash, and thought they were on firm legal ground with respect to competition law. ""I think in the cold light of day, they are looking at this and the reality is dawning that this is happening and it's perfectly legal,"" they told the BBC. A Spanish court has temporarily blocked any attempt by Uefa or Fifa to ban clubs or players from leagues or competitions, in an interim ruling to prevent any bans before the legal basis of this can be tested. ESL insiders said ""this looks aggressive but we had to take defensive action in the face of threats from Uefa and Fifa - our hope is we can ultimately resolve this in negotiations"". This video can not be played European Super League chairman, Florentino Perez: ""We want to save football"" The 14 Premier League clubs not participating in the new venture ""unanimously and vigorously"" rejected the plans for the competition and are ""considering all actions available to prevent it from progressing"". A statement released on Tuesday said they ""call on those clubs involved in the proposed competition to cease their involvement immediately"". One of these, Everton, released a statementcriticising the ""preposterous arrogance"" of the clubs involved. Downing Street said the prime minister told his meeting with FA and Premier League officials that the government ""will not stand by while a small handful of owners create a closed shop"". Boris Johnson reiterated his ""unwavering support for the football authorities and confirmed they have the government's full backing to take whatever action necessary to put a stop to these plans"", a statement said. He also made it clear ""that no action is off the table and the government is exploring every possibility, including legislative options, to ensure these proposals are stopped"". The prime minister's official spokesman said among the measures under consideration were preventing players of the clubs involved getting work visas and the withdrawal of police funding for match days. This video can not be played 'Football is meant to be on merit' - fans react to European Super League proposals Chief executive of the Football Supporters' Association, Kevin Miles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""The mood music from the government was they would do what was required to make sure that the measures to exclude those [ESL] clubs from competitions would not fall foul of competition law, and that they would amend the law if necessary."" UK watchdog the Competition and Markets Authority said it would be ""carefully considering any competition aspects of these proposals"". The proposed league has united MPs from every party against it. Suggestions from MPs on action the government could take include governance reform, changes to competition law, changes to taxpayer support for clubs and border controls on arrivals into the UK. The Arsenal Supporters' Trust said it was ""delighted"" to hear the government's promise of action, adding that the PM vowed the football governance review led by Conservative MP and former sports minister Tracey Crouch would be ""swift"". There have been protests by fans across the country against the proposed league, including outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground on Tuesday. Fans burn a Liverpool replica shirt outside Elland Road against Liverpool's decision to be included in the European Super League Six English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - have signed up to the league. They would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan. The competition would have 20 teams and another five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition. Matches would take place midweek in an attempt to have more matches between the big-name clubs and rival the existing Champions League. The plans revealed on Sunday that the 12 founding football clubs would be permanent members and never face relegation. Critics say the new league could supplant the existing Champions League and disrupt the current football ""pyramid"" that sees teams rise or fall on merit. Read morehere. Former England captain Alan Shearer told BBC Breakfast the six English clubs should be expelled from the Premier League, which they have said they aim to remain in while also playing in the European Super League. ""It's not right what they are doing, it's not competitive, it's a closed shop - you can't have a competition where no one else is allowed in,"" he said. ""You can hear, feel and see the anger from almost everyone in football."" Chairman of the Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Julian Knight, said restricting work visas for footballers who play in the proposed ESL could be one way the government could pull levers to stop the league going ahead. Speaking to the BBC, he said other options were a windfall tax on clubs and long-term reform giving fans much greater power on football club boards. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he thought the ""threat of legislation will have an effect"" but the government needed to act quickly. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called for ""real action"" from the government, suggesting a new law requiring owners to ballot season ticket holders before committing clubs to newly formed competitions. And on Monday, the Duke of Cambridge, who is president of the Football Association, said he shared fans' concerns about ""the damage it risks causing to the game we love"". Gianni Infantino, president of the world football's governing body Fifa, said he ""strongly disapproves"" of the plans. ""If some elect to go their own way, they must live with the consequences of their choice. They are responsible for their choice completely. This means you are either in or you are out. You cannot be half in and half out."" Sky Sports confirmed it had ""not been involved in any discussions"" about the breakaway league.

Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said.

capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral

decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the

he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here. Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC.

round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories we have been covering around the world: The 22-year-old organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate in Nottingham city centre A 22-year-old man has been fined Â£10,000 for organisinga 90-person illegal partyin Nottinghamshire, England. Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape.

capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral
rituals as crematoriums and graveyards are running out of manpower and space. In smaller towns the situation is even worse. A sharp surge

"This video can not be played Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by has died of his injuries following clashes with rebels in the north of the country at the weekend, the army has said. The announcement came a day after provisional election results projected he would win a sixth term in office. The government and parliament have been dissolved. A curfew has also been imposed and the borders have been shut. DÃ©by, 68, spent more than three decades in power and was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. An army officer by training, he came to power in 1990 through an armed uprising. He was a long-time ally of France and other Western powers in the battle against jihadist groups in the Sahel region of Africa. DÃ©by ""breathed his last defending the sovereign nation on the battlefield"", an army general said on state TV on Tuesday. He had gone to the front line, several hundred kilometres north of the capital, N'Djamena, at the weekend to visit troops battling rebels belonging to a group calling itself Fact (the Front for Change and Concord in Chad). A state funeral is due to take place on Friday. Reaction to DÃ©byâs death Chad's future rocked by president's battlefield death Idriss DÃ©by - the end of Chad's 'Great Survivor' A quick guide to Chad A military council led by DÃ©by's son, a 37-year-old four star general, will govern for the next 18 months. Mahamat Idriss DÃ©by Itno will lead the council, but ""free and democratic"" elections will be held once the transition period is over, the army said in its statement. He later issued a statement naming the 14 other generals who will make up the new governing body. A BBC Monitoring journalist tweeted a copy of the notice: Allow Twitter content?

Experts have told the BBC and other broadcasters that the move is unconstitutional, and that the speaker of parliament should take over when a sitting president dies before organising elections. Ahead of the election on 11 April, DÃ©by campaigned on a platform of bringing peace and security to the region. Provisional results showed he had 80% of the vote. But there had been growing unhappiness over his government's management of Chad's oil resources. Idriss DÃ©by was known as that rare thing - a true warrior president. The former rebel and trained pilot was the opposite of an armchair general. For 30 years, he clung to power in Chad - a vast nation that straddles the Sahara and is surrounded by some of the continent's most protracted conflicts. And DÃ©by had a hand in every one of them - from Darfur to Libya, Mali, Nigeria and the Central African Republic. His troops were among the most battle-hardened on the planet. Domestically, he had become an increasingly autocratic figure. His latest election victory saw him claim nearly 80% of the vote. It is unclear if the poor, feuding, brittle state he leaves behind can manage a smooth transition. And there are wider concerns too. For years, President DÃ©by was the West's indispensable ally in the war against Islamist militants - in Mali, Niger and beyond. His death leaves a vacuum that many may now fight to fill. In a statement, the French presidency described Mr DÃ©by as a ""brave friend"" and said it affirmed its attachment to the stability of Chad. Over the years, France has deployed troops and fighter jets to push back Mr DÃ©by's opponents. Chadian forces are considered to be the most effective of the Western-backed ""G5"" countries fighting Islamist militants in the Sahel region. And it has often proved to be the more stable country in a region that includes Libya, Sudan and the Central African Republic - where armed groups roam freely and trade in weapons and lucrative resources that fuel conflict, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga. Founded in 2016 by disillusioned former army officers, the rebel Fact group accuses President DÃ©by of repression in the run-up to the election. They built up their base in Libya in the Tibesti mountains, which straddle northern Chad and part of southern Libya. On election day, the group mounted an attack on a border post and gradually advanced on N'Djamena. The latest clashes began on Saturday. The army says that 300 insurgents were killed and 150 captured. Five government soldiers were killed and 36 injured, it says. The figures could not immediately be verified. Some foreign embassies in the capital have urged their staff to leave. A former BBC journalist in N'Djamena says the situation there seemed relatively calm: ""The news is filtering through to people, but the city is calm and people are just shocked to hear that actually, because many people didn't even know that he [President DÃ©by] was wounded or that he was at the frontline,"" said Mahamat Adamou. ""In the street in downtown, there are armoured vehicles that are posted at key road junctions. Of course, there is a sense of 'What is going to happen?'. But not more than that."" N'Djamena has come under rebel attack before and there was panic in the city on Monday, with parents taking their children home from school, when tanks were deployed along the main roads. 1) It is named after Lake Chad. This is the second-largest lake in Africa, but has shrunk by 90% since the 1960s. Its basin covers parts of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, and is a water source for between 20 million and 30 million people. 2) The Sahara Desert roughly covers one third of the country. Much of the north is desert and home to a mere 1% of Chad's population. The south has large expanses of wooded savannahs and woodlands. 3) Remains of a seven-million-year-old human-like creature - or hominid - known as ""Toumai"" were unearthed in 2001. Its discoverers argued that Toumai was the oldest hominid known to science. 4) Chad became an oil-producing nation in 2003, with the completion of a $4bn (Â£2.87bn) pipeline linking its oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast. The industry has been plagued by allegations of corruption. 5) Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for most people - cotton is grown in the south, and exported to Europe and the US.

capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral

he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on

Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Spies are using fake profiles to steal classified information, according to the counter-intelligence agency MI5 At least 10,000 UK nationals have been approached by fake profiles linked to hostile states, on the professional social network LinkedIn, over the past five years, according to MI5. It warned users who had accepted such connection requests might have then been lured into sharing secrets. ""Malicious profiles"" are being used on ""an industrial scale"", the security agency's chief, Ken McCallum, said. A campaign has been launched to educate government workers about the threat. The effort - Think Before You Link - warns foreign spies are targeting those with access to sensitive information. The awareness campaign includes guides, posters and a video One concern is the victims' colleagues, in turn, become more willing to accept follow-up requests - because it looks as if they share a mutual acquaintance. MI5 did not specifically name LinkedIn but BBC News has learned the Microsoft-owned service is indeed the platform involved. The 10,000-plus figure includes staff in virtually every government departments as well as key industries, who might be offered speaking or business and travel opportunities that could lead to attempts to recruit them to provide confidential information. And it is thought a large number of those approached engaged initially with the profiles that contacted them online. ""No-one is immune to being socially manipulated into wrongdoing through these approaches,"" the guidance given to government staff says. LinkedInhas said it welcomes the initiative,external. The campaign, run by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, which reports to MI5, asks government staff to focus on ""the four Rs"": recognising malicious profiles realising the potential threat reporting suspicious profiles to a security manager removing the profiles ""Since the start of the pandemic, many of us have been working remotely and having to spend more time at home on our personal devices,"" government chief security officer Dominic Fortescue said. ""As a result, staff have become more vulnerable to malicious approaches from hostile security services and criminal organisations on social media."" The US and other countries have launched similar campaigns. Former CIA officer Kevin Mallory was sentenced to 20 years in prison, after being convicted of giving secrets to China following an approach on LinkedIn. And the UK's move is also being backed by the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.3127189
"This video can not be played Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by has died of his injuries following clashes with rebels in the north of the country at the weekend, the army has said. The announcement came a day after provisional election results projected he would win a sixth term in office. The government and parliament have been dissolved. A curfew has also been imposed and the borders have been shut. DÃ©by, 68, spent more than three decades in power and was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. An army officer by training, he came to power in 1990 through an armed uprising. He was a long-time ally of France and other Western powers in the battle against jihadist groups in the Sahel region of Africa. DÃ©by ""breathed his last defending the sovereign nation on the battlefield"", an army general said on state TV on Tuesday. He had gone to the front line, several hundred kilometres north of the capital, N'Djamena, at the weekend to visit troops battling rebels belonging to a group calling itself Fact (the Front for Change and Concord in Chad). A state funeral is due to take place on Friday. Reaction to DÃ©byâs death Chad's future rocked by president's battlefield death Idriss DÃ©by - the end of Chad's 'Great Survivor' A quick guide to Chad A military council led by DÃ©by's son, a 37-year-old four star general, will govern for the next 18 months. Mahamat Idriss DÃ©by Itno will lead the council, but ""free and democratic"" elections will be held once the transition period is over, the army said in its statement. He later issued a statement naming the 14 other generals who will make up the new governing body. A BBC Monitoring journalist tweeted a copy of the notice: Allow Twitter content?

Experts have told the BBC and other broadcasters that the move is unconstitutional, and that the speaker of parliament should take over when a sitting president dies before organising elections. Ahead of the election on 11 April, DÃ©by campaigned on a platform of bringing peace and security to the region. Provisional results showed he had 80% of the vote. But there had been growing unhappiness over his government's management of Chad's oil resources. Idriss DÃ©by was known as that rare thing - a true warrior president. The former rebel and trained pilot was the opposite of an armchair general. For 30 years, he clung to power in Chad - a vast nation that straddles the Sahara and is surrounded by some of the continent's most protracted conflicts. And DÃ©by had a hand in every one of them - from Darfur to Libya, Mali, Nigeria and the Central African Republic. His troops were among the most battle-hardened on the planet. Domestically, he had become an increasingly autocratic figure. His latest election victory saw him claim nearly 80% of the vote. It is unclear if the poor, feuding, brittle state he leaves behind can manage a smooth transition. And there are wider concerns too. For years, President DÃ©by was the West's indispensable ally in the war against Islamist militants - in Mali, Niger and beyond. His death leaves a vacuum that many may now fight to fill. In a statement, the French presidency described Mr DÃ©by as a ""brave friend"" and said it affirmed its attachment to the stability of Chad. Over the years, France has deployed troops and fighter jets to push back Mr DÃ©by's opponents. Chadian forces are considered to be the most effective of the Western-backed ""G5"" countries fighting Islamist militants in the Sahel region. And it has often proved to be the more stable country in a region that includes Libya, Sudan and the Central African Republic - where armed groups roam freely and trade in weapons and lucrative resources that fuel conflict, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga. Founded in 2016 by disillusioned former army officers, the rebel Fact group accuses President DÃ©by of repression in the run-up to the election. They built up their base in Libya in the Tibesti mountains, which straddle northern Chad and part of southern Libya. On election day, the group mounted an attack on a border post and gradually advanced on N'Djamena. The latest clashes began on Saturday. The army says that 300 insurgents were killed and 150 captured. Five government soldiers were killed and 36 injured, it says. The figures could not immediately be verified. Some foreign embassies in the capital have urged their staff to leave. A former BBC journalist in N'Djamena says the situation there seemed relatively calm: ""The news is filtering through to people, but the city is calm and people are just shocked to hear that actually, because many people didn't even know that he [President DÃ©by] was wounded or that he was at the frontline,"" said Mahamat Adamou. ""In the street in downtown, there are armoured vehicles that are posted at key road junctions. Of course, there is a sense of 'What is going to happen?'. But not more than that."" N'Djamena has come under rebel attack before and there was panic in the city on Monday, with parents taking their children home from school, when tanks were deployed along the main roads. 1) It is named after Lake Chad. This is the second-largest lake in Africa, but has shrunk by 90% since the 1960s. Its basin covers parts of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, and is a water source for between 20 million and 30 million people. 2) The Sahara Desert roughly covers one third of the country. Much of the north is desert and home to a mere 1% of Chad's population. The south has large expanses of wooded savannahs and woodlands. 3) Remains of a seven-million-year-old human-like creature - or hominid - known as ""Toumai"" were unearthed in 2001. Its discoverers argued that Toumai was the oldest hominid known to science. 4) Chad became an oil-producing nation in 2003, with the completion of a $4bn (Â£2.87bn) pipeline linking its oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast. The industry has been plagued by allegations of corruption. 5) Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for most people - cotton is grown in the south, and exported to Europe and the US.

"Radical new climate change commitments will set the UK on course to cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035, the UK government has announced. Hitting the targets would require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy. For the first time, climate law will be extended to cover international aviation and shipping. But Labour said the government had to match ""rhetoric with reality"". It urged Boris Johnson to treat ""the climate emergency as the emergency it is"" and show ""greater ambition"". The prime minister's commitments, which are to become law, bring forward the current target for reducing carbon emissions by 15 years. This would be a world-leading position. Homes will need to be much better insulated, and people will be encouraged to drive less and walk and cycle more. Aviation is likely to become more expensive for frequent fliers. China and US pledge climate change commitment Have these seven green targets been met? World's wealthiest 'at heart of climate problem' Tax fliers and get rid of SUVs, government told Covid-19 paused climate emissions â but they're rising again The government has accepted the advice of its independent Climate Change Committee (CCC) to adopt the emissions cut, which is based on 1990 levels. The International Energy Agency (IEA) haspredicted a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year, as the world rebounds from the pandemic. The UK's new commitments come as US President Joe Biden prepares to stage a climate summit from Washington DC. Environmentalists welcomed the government's move, but warned that ministers had consistently failed to achieve previous CCC-set targets. And they insisted that Chancellor Rishi Sunak must show clearly how the transition is to be funded. Tom Burke, who chairs the environmental think tank E3G, explained what policy changes were needed to achieve the goal: ""The most important thing, I think, is for [the prime minister] to focus his policy around energy efficiency, around wind and solar, and around storage of electricity and the management of the grid,"" he said. However, he told the BBC's Today programme: ""At the moment, it's... a bit of a Boris blunderbuss and is a huge range of marginal things instead of a concentration of effort on those things that will deliver the most emissions reductions in the fastest time."" Leo Murray of the climate charity Possible called the announcement ""fantastic"", but added: ""We're not on track to meet previous climate commitments and in many ways the government is still failing."" Mr Murray said ministers were ""facing both directions at the same time"", as they had scrapped the Green Homes Grant for insulating homes, had not stopped airport expansion and were ""still pushing a Â£27bn roads budget"". The CCC report accepted by the government says low-carbon investment must scale up to Â£50bn a year in the UK. But it adds that in time fuel savings from more efficient equipment will cancel out investment costs. The CCC believes around 1% of GDP - national wealth - would need to be spent on shifting away from fossil fuels over 30 years. Its chairman, Lord Deben, said previously: ""The implication of this path is clear: the utmost focus is required from government over the next 10 years. ""If policy is not scaled up across every sector, if business is not encouraged to invest, if the people of the UK are not engaged in this challenge - the UK will not deliver net zero by 2050. The 2020s must be the decisive decade of progress and action."" Ed Matthew, campaigns director of E3G, said: ""Setting an ambitious emission reduction target would boost the UK's diplomatic drive to persuade other countries to set out ambitious targets of their own."" He added: ""The UK now has the opportunity to spark a global green industrial revolution, but ultimately its credibility will rest on action."" Net zero means cutting emissions as far as possible, then balancing out any remaining releases by, for example, tree planting. The government has adopted the new 2035 deadline for a 78% emissions cut because scientists say this is needed to keep the rise in global temperatures close to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""The character of this government on climate change is now clear: targets without delivery. ""So while any strengthening of our targets is the right thing to do, the government can't be trusted to match rhetoric with reality."" He added: ""We need a government that treats the climate emergency as the emergency it is. That means greater ambition than this government matched with much more decisive action."" Green Party MP Caroline Lucas commented: ""The most glaring problem [with the plan] is the government's failure to address what's driving the climate crisis: an outdated and exploitative economic system that treats our planet and natural world as peripheral to our lives and, worse, expendable. ""The Prime Minister needs to accompany stronger climate targets with an economic reset to put the health and well-being of people and planet above short-term profit and growth.""

The page was written by Ella Wills, Katie Wright, David Walker, Alex Kleiderman, Joseph Lee, Penny Spiller and Richard Morris, and edited by Marie Jackson. Pubs in Wales and Scotland will start serving customers alcohol outdoors again in the coming days, it was confirmed on Tuesday We're going to bring our live coverage of the Covid pandemic to an end shortly. But first, here's are some of the main UK stories we've been covering today: Here is a
round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories we have been covering around the world: The 22-year-old organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate in Nottingham city centre A 22-year-old man has been fined Â£10,000 for organisinga 90-person illegal partyin Nottinghamshire, England. Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape. The organiser's fine will be reduced to half if paid within two weeks, and if it is not paid, he will face a court appearance, the force said. A man who has helped bury dozens of Muslims who died with Covid-19 in one of England's worst-affected towns has spoken about the daily pressures of his role. Imran Patel, who is a volunteer at Blackburn Muslim Burial Society, has helped with 340 interments in the last 12 months, of which 200 were for people who had died with coronavirus. This video can not be played Reality Check There are currently not enough vaccines for India's vast population As we reported earlier, India haspledged to offer alladults over the age of 18a coronavirus vaccine from 1 May in a bid to stem a
severe second wave of the virus. However, domestic vaccine makers are struggling to meet
demand both at home and globally. The government has offered financial assistance to two
vaccine makers - the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech - and halted
large exports of vaccines in a bid to help boost local production. But will it be enough?Read more about the situation here. Yogita LimayeBBC India correspondent Many families are losing loved ones to the coronavirus More than 99% of all intensive care beds are full in Indiaâs
capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral
rituals as crematoriums and graveyards are running out of manpower and space. In smaller towns the situation is even worse. A sharp surge
in cases and deaths is being reported from many parts of India. Some areas are
now in lockdown. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about
decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the
Joint Biosecurity Centre, the JBC, they look at the issue and will make their
determination based on what they think we need to doâ. Asked about yesterdayâs decision to put India on the red list
he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here. Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says.

He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"".

But first, here's are some of the main UK stories we've been covering today: Here is a
round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories we have been covering around the world: The 22-year-old organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate in Nottingham city centre A 22-year-old man has been fined Â£10,000 for organisinga 90-person illegal partyin Nottinghamshire, England. Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape. The organiser's fine will be reduced to half if paid within two weeks, and if it is not paid, he will face a court appearance, the force said. A man who has helped bury dozens of Muslims who died with Covid-19 in one of England's worst-affected towns has spoken about the daily pressures of his role. Imran Patel, who is a volunteer at Blackburn Muslim Burial Society, has helped with 340 interments in the last 12 months, of which 200 were for people who had died with coronavirus. This video can not be played Reality Check There are currently not enough vaccines for India's vast population As we reported earlier, India haspledged to offer alladults over the age of 18a coronavirus vaccine from 1 May in a bid to stem a
severe second wave of the virus. However, domestic vaccine makers are struggling to meet
demand both at home and globally. The government has offered financial assistance to two
vaccine makers - the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech - and halted
large exports of vaccines in a bid to help boost local production. But will it be enough?Read more about the situation here. Yogita LimayeBBC India correspondent Many families are losing loved ones to the coronavirus More than 99% of all intensive care beds are full in Indiaâs
capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral
rituals as crematoriums and graveyards are running out of manpower and space. In smaller towns the situation is even worse. A sharp surge
in cases and deaths is being reported from many parts of India. Some areas are
now in lockdown. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about
decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the
Joint Biosecurity Centre, the JBC, they look at the issue and will make their
determination based on what they think we need to doâ. Asked about yesterdayâs decision to put India on the red list
he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here. Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Spies are using fake profiles to steal classified information, according to the counter-intelligence agency MI5 At least 10,000 UK nationals have been approached by fake profiles linked to hostile states, on the professional social network LinkedIn, over the past five years, according to MI5. It warned users who had accepted such connection requests might have then been lured into sharing secrets. ""Malicious profiles"" are being used on ""an industrial scale"", the security agency's chief, Ken McCallum, said. A campaign has been launched to educate government workers about the threat. The effort - Think Before You Link - warns foreign spies are targeting those with access to sensitive information. The awareness campaign includes guides, posters and a video One concern is the victims' colleagues, in turn, become more willing to accept follow-up requests - because it looks as if they share a mutual acquaintance. MI5 did not specifically name LinkedIn but BBC News has learned the Microsoft-owned service is indeed the platform involved. The 10,000-plus figure includes staff in virtually every government departments as well as key industries, who might be offered speaking or business and travel opportunities that could lead to attempts to recruit them to provide confidential information. And it is thought a large number of those approached engaged initially with the profiles that contacted them online. ""No-one is immune to being socially manipulated into wrongdoing through these approaches,"" the guidance given to government staff says. LinkedInhas said it welcomes the initiative,external. The campaign, run by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure, which reports to MI5, asks government staff to focus on ""the four Rs"": recognising malicious profiles realising the potential threat reporting suspicious profiles to a security manager removing the profiles ""Since the start of the pandemic, many of us have been working remotely and having to spend more time at home on our personal devices,"" government chief security officer Dominic Fortescue said. ""As a result, staff have become more vulnerable to malicious approaches from hostile security services and criminal organisations on social media."" The US and other countries have launched similar campaigns. Former CIA officer Kevin Mallory was sentenced to 20 years in prison, after being convicted of giving secrets to China following an approach on LinkedIn. And the UK's move is also being backed by the other members of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.

"Younger people continue to bear the brunt of the jobs crisis amid widespread cuts in sectors such as hospitality, official figures show. In the year to March, 811,000 payroll jobs were lost in the UK, with under-35s accounting for 80% of these cuts. The data also showed the unemployment rate dipped to 4.9% in the three months to February - down from 5% previously. This was despite most of the UK being under strict lockdown rules for at least some of the period. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the jobs market ""remains subdued"", with five million people employed but still on furlough. Head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Surenâ¯Thiru, said:â¯ ""Unemployment remains on course to peak towards the end of 2021, once the furlough scheme expires and those who stopped job hunting during the pandemic look to return to the workforce as restrictions ease. ""Although the furlough scheme will limit the peak in job losses, the longer-term structural unemployment caused by Covid-19, particularly among young people, may mean that the road back to pre-pandemic levels lags behind the wider economic recovery."" 'Finding work feels impossible for my generation' Overall, some 1.67 million people were unemployed between December and February. That is down 50,000 on the previous quarter but still 311,000 higher than a year ago. But the ONS said younger people,externalwere suffering disproportionately, as sectors such as retail and hospitality were hit hard by the crisis. People aged under 35 accounted for 635,000 payroll jobs lost in the year to March, with 436,000 of those positions held by people under 25. Gerwyn Davies, senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, said the number of young people in employment had hit a ""post-pandemic low"". ""This reinforces the urgent case for apprenticeship incentives to be made more generous and targeted specifically at 18-24 year-olds. It also underlines the need to improve employers' awareness of traineeships and the Kickstart [work placement] Scheme."" It would be wrong to get carried away with the pleasant surprise of a dip in the official unemployment rate below 5%. The real pandemic picture is in the tax data for March. 813,000 fewer payrolls on the PAYE system versus a year ago, and four fifths of those jobs were lost to under 35s. But the fact that the numbers in the first few months have been broadly stable is definitely a source of relief. Employers were able to navigate the second lockdown without widespread further job losses, thanks to the extension of support schemes such as furlough. This provides a more solid basis than might have been expected for the phased reopening of the economy. There will be strains, especially as support is phased out in late summer. But these figures offer hope of a lower peak to unemployment, perhaps at around 6%, than had been expected. The ONS said the overall jobs market had been ""broadly stable"" in recent months after the major shock of last spring, when where the economy contracted sharply. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said the labour market ""remains subdued"" but that there were positive signs. ""With the prospect of businesses reopening, there was a marked rise in job vacancies in March, especially in sectors such as hospitality."" The Bank of England expects an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures are eased and government support for jobs continues. But it says the recovery still depends on the ""evolution of the pandemic"". Hannah Audino, an economist at PwC, said the stabilisation of the jobs market during the third national lockdown boded well for the UK economy.

"Man City start withdrawal process from European Super League Other five Premier League clubs to withdraw Ed Woodward to resign as executive vice chairman at Man Utd Premier League's 'big six' had agreed to join the breakaway league Get Involved: #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Callum Matthews and Luke Reddy Let's end tonight with some Bobby Robson. A lot of fans have worried about the step their club was taking or what kind of environment their club would be left in. Fans, pundits, managers, former players, current players, politicians, celebrities, journalists and many, many more have raged against a new dawn. Why do people care so much? Over to the late Sir Bobby Robson... âWhat is a club in any case? Not the buildings or the directors or the people who are paid to represent it. Itâs not the television contracts, get-out clauses, marketing departments or executive boxes. Itâs the noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging, the pride in your city. Itâs a small boy clambering up stadium steps for the very first time, gripping his fatherâs hand, gawping at that hallowed stretch of turf beneath him and, without being able to do a thing about it, falling in love.â Goodnight. Right then, it's been lively has it not? Every now and again a story comes up that just kicks on to another level. This one is comfortably filed in the 'cling on during the carnage' folder. Let's boil it down nice and simple: - Man Utd will need a new executive vice chairman as Ed Woodward is leaving.More on that here. - There were 12 teams proposing a European Super League break away. After 48 hours we are down to six and none of them are from England as Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester City and Chelsea are all no longer getting involved.More on that here.

You know I'd not leave you hanging like that. What have you missed on this night of nights? - A protest at Chelsea where even Petr Cech featured (this actually happened) - Chelsea's acknowledgment they would withdraw from the European Super League (cue goal-like celebrations. That was a good thing because Chelsea later drew 0-0 with Brighton) - Manchester City went all in and said they were done with the idea of an ESL and were pulling out. That left four English clubs in the mix. - Ed Woodward resigned at Manchester United and he'll depart at the end of the season. - Liverpool's players started tweeting their dislike for the European Super League - Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United all pulled out at around 23:00 BST. - There have been supporting roles on this fine evening from Boris Johnson, Conor McGregor, Gary Neville, Luke Shaw, the list goes on. Some evening friends. Right, so you've spent the night catching up on Line of Duty and an Only Fools and Horses box set. What have you missed? Too much for me to describe. So we're moving on. Tweet us on #bbcfootball The Other Brian:So all the England based teams have cut and run... they are very sorry, they made a mistake!

Its all good then, no problem, don't worry about it, I'm sure us fans will have completely forgotten about the total contempt you have shown towards us, by the weekend. :-) Allow Twitter content?

Tottenham Hotspur We can confirm that we have formally commenced procedures to withdraw from the group developing proposals for a European Super League (ESL). Chairman Daniel Levy said: âWe regret the anxiety and upset caused by the ESL proposal. We felt it was important that our club participated in the development of a possible new structure that sought to better ensure financial fair play and financial sustainability whilst delivering significantly increased support for the wider football pyramid. âWe believe that we should never stand still and that the sport should constantly review competitions and governance to ensure the game we all love continues to evolve and excite fans around the world. âWe should like to thank all those supporters who presented their considered opinions.â Allow Twitter content?

Arsenal The last few days have shown us yet again the depth of feeling our supporters around the world have for this great club and the game we love. We needed no reminding of this but the response from supporters in recent days has given us time for further reflection and deep thought. It was never our intention to cause such distress, however when the invitation to join the Super League came, while knowing there were no guarantees, we did not want to be left behind to ensure we protected Arsenal and its future. As a result of listening to you and the wider football community over recent days we are withdrawing from the proposed Super League. We made a mistake, and we apologise for it. We know it will take time to restore your faith in what we are trying to achieve here at Arsenal but let us be clear that the decision to be part of the Super League was driven by our desire to protect Arsenal, the club you love, and to support the game you love through greater solidarity and financial stability. Stability is essential for the game to prosper and we will continue to strive to bring the security the game needs to move forward. The system needs to be fixed. We must work together to find solutions which protect the future of the game and harness the extraordinary power football has to get us on the edge of our seats. Finally, we know this has been hugely unsettling at the end of what has been an incredibly difficult year for us all. Our aim is always to make the right decisions for this great football club, to protect it for the future and to take us forward. We didnât make the right decision here, which we fully accept. We have heard you. The Arsenal Board Simon StoneBBC Sport For three nights my plans have been shredded. I need to see the latest episode. We assume some of you may be celebrating?

"This video can not be played Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by has died of his injuries following clashes with rebels in the north of the country at the weekend, the army has said. The announcement came a day after provisional election results projected he would win a sixth term in office. The government and parliament have been dissolved. A curfew has also been imposed and the borders have been shut. DÃ©by, 68, spent more than three decades in power and was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. An army officer by training, he came to power in 1990 through an armed uprising. He was a long-time ally of France and other Western powers in the battle against jihadist groups in the Sahel region of Africa. DÃ©by ""breathed his last defending the sovereign nation on the battlefield"", an army general said on state TV on Tuesday. He had gone to the front line, several hundred kilometres north of the capital, N'Djamena, at the weekend to visit troops battling rebels belonging to a group calling itself Fact (the Front for Change and Concord in Chad). A state funeral is due to take place on Friday. Reaction to DÃ©byâs death Chad's future rocked by president's battlefield death Idriss DÃ©by - the end of Chad's 'Great Survivor' A quick guide to Chad A military council led by DÃ©by's son, a 37-year-old four star general, will govern for the next 18 months. Mahamat Idriss DÃ©by Itno will lead the council, but ""free and democratic"" elections will be held once the transition period is over, the army said in its statement. He later issued a statement naming the 14 other generals who will make up the new governing body. A BBC Monitoring journalist tweeted a copy of the notice: Allow Twitter content?

Experts have told the BBC and other broadcasters that the move is unconstitutional, and that the speaker of parliament should take over when a sitting president dies before organising elections. Ahead of the election on 11 April, DÃ©by campaigned on a platform of bringing peace and security to the region. Provisional results showed he had 80% of the vote. But there had been growing unhappiness over his government's management of Chad's oil resources. Idriss DÃ©by was known as that rare thing - a true warrior president. The former rebel and trained pilot was the opposite of an armchair general. For 30 years, he clung to power in Chad - a vast nation that straddles the Sahara and is surrounded by some of the continent's most protracted conflicts. And DÃ©by had a hand in every one of them - from Darfur to Libya, Mali, Nigeria and the Central African Republic. His troops were among the most battle-hardened on the planet. Domestically, he had become an increasingly autocratic figure. His latest election victory saw him claim nearly 80% of the vote. It is unclear if the poor, feuding, brittle state he leaves behind can manage a smooth transition. And there are wider concerns too. For years, President DÃ©by was the West's indispensable ally in the war against Islamist militants - in Mali, Niger and beyond. His death leaves a vacuum that many may now fight to fill. In a statement, the French presidency described Mr DÃ©by as a ""brave friend"" and said it affirmed its attachment to the stability of Chad. Over the years, France has deployed troops and fighter jets to push back Mr DÃ©by's opponents. Chadian forces are considered to be the most effective of the Western-backed ""G5"" countries fighting Islamist militants in the Sahel region. And it has often proved to be the more stable country in a region that includes Libya, Sudan and the Central African Republic - where armed groups roam freely and trade in weapons and lucrative resources that fuel conflict, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga. Founded in 2016 by disillusioned former army officers, the rebel Fact group accuses President DÃ©by of repression in the run-up to the election. They built up their base in Libya in the Tibesti mountains, which straddle northern Chad and part of southern Libya. On election day, the group mounted an attack on a border post and gradually advanced on N'Djamena. The latest clashes began on Saturday. The army says that 300 insurgents were killed and 150 captured. Five government soldiers were killed and 36 injured, it says. The figures could not immediately be verified. Some foreign embassies in the capital have urged their staff to leave. A former BBC journalist in N'Djamena says the situation there seemed relatively calm: ""The news is filtering through to people, but the city is calm and people are just shocked to hear that actually, because many people didn't even know that he [President DÃ©by] was wounded or that he was at the frontline,"" said Mahamat Adamou. ""In the street in downtown, there are armoured vehicles that are posted at key road junctions. Of course, there is a sense of 'What is going to happen?'. But not more than that."" N'Djamena has come under rebel attack before and there was panic in the city on Monday, with parents taking their children home from school, when tanks were deployed along the main roads. 1) It is named after Lake Chad. This is the second-largest lake in Africa, but has shrunk by 90% since the 1960s. Its basin covers parts of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, and is a water source for between 20 million and 30 million people. 2) The Sahara Desert roughly covers one third of the country. Much of the north is desert and home to a mere 1% of Chad's population. The south has large expanses of wooded savannahs and woodlands. 3) Remains of a seven-million-year-old human-like creature - or hominid - known as ""Toumai"" were unearthed in 2001. Its discoverers argued that Toumai was the oldest hominid known to science. 4) Chad became an oil-producing nation in 2003, with the completion of a $4bn (Â£2.87bn) pipeline linking its oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast. The industry has been plagued by allegations of corruption. 5) Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for most people - cotton is grown in the south, and exported to Europe and the US.

"PM Boris Johnson announces new taskforce to find ""promising new medicines"" to treat Covid by autumn He tells a Downing Street briefing it is hoped people will be able to take a pill or tablet at home to ""stop the virus in its tracks"" The number of people from ethnic minorities taking vaccine has tripled compared with the national average, says Dr Nikki Kanani from NHS England The PM says India has been placed on the UK's travel red list on a ""purely precautionary basis"" and the new Indian variant is ""still under investigation"" EU drugs regulator says blood clots should be listed as a ""very rare"" side effect of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine Scotland's first minister confirms the most significant changes to the nation's Covid restrictions since it went back into lockdown just after Christmas Pubs, restaurants, gyms and non-essential shops will reopen on Monday We're bringing our live coverage to a close now. We'll be back on Wednesday morning with more developments. The page was written by Ella Wills, Katie Wright, David Walker, Alex Kleiderman, Joseph Lee, Penny Spiller and Richard Morris, and edited by Marie Jackson. Pubs in Wales and Scotland will start serving customers alcohol outdoors again in the coming days, it was confirmed on Tuesday We're going to bring our live coverage of the Covid pandemic to an end shortly. But first, here's are some of the main UK stories we've been covering today: Here is a
round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories we have been covering around the world: The 22-year-old organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate in Nottingham city centre A 22-year-old man has been fined Â£10,000 for organisinga 90-person illegal partyin Nottinghamshire, England. Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape. The organiser's fine will be reduced to half if paid within two weeks, and if it is not paid, he will face a court appearance, the force said. A man who has helped bury dozens of Muslims who died with Covid-19 in one of England's worst-affected towns has spoken about the daily pressures of his role. Imran Patel, who is a volunteer at Blackburn Muslim Burial Society, has helped with 340 interments in the last 12 months, of which 200 were for people who had died with coronavirus. This video can not be played Reality Check There are currently not enough vaccines for India's vast population As we reported earlier, India haspledged to offer alladults over the age of 18a coronavirus vaccine from 1 May in a bid to stem a
severe second wave of the virus. However, domestic vaccine makers are struggling to meet
demand both at home and globally. The government has offered financial assistance to two
vaccine makers - the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech - and halted
large exports of vaccines in a bid to help boost local production. But will it be enough?Read more about the situation here. Yogita LimayeBBC India correspondent Many families are losing loved ones to the coronavirus More than 99% of all intensive care beds are full in Indiaâs
capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral
rituals as crematoriums and graveyards are running out of manpower and space. In smaller towns the situation is even worse. A sharp surge
in cases and deaths is being reported from many parts of India. Some areas are
now in lockdown. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about
decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the
Joint Biosecurity Centre, the JBC, they look at the issue and will make their
determination based on what they think we need to doâ. Asked about yesterdayâs decision to put India on the red list
he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here. Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.4439639

The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the

"Dr Michael Watt worked at the Royal Victoria Hospital as a neurologist Almost 20% of patients seen by neurology consultant Dr Michael Watt were given a wrong diagnosis, a report has found. A review of 927 of Dr Watt's high-risk patients found 181 people received a diagnosis described as ""not secure"", Health Minister Robin Swann said. He was speaking as the Belfast Trust announced the recall of a further 209 neurology patients seen and discharged by Dr Watt between 1996 and 2012. This is the third such recall. Dr Watt was at the centre of Northern Ireland'sbiggest patient recalllinked to his work at Belfast's Royal Victoria Hospital. Mr Swann said he had met patients and families affected by the recall in October last year. ""While this report is statistical in nature, it deals with individuals, their families and their experiences,"" he said. ""I know that many will have had their confidence in our health service shaken and I remain committed to helping restore it."" Mr Swann ""unreservedly apologised"" to those patients who have been affected. ""I also want to acknowledge that in announcing a further recall, more patients will be affected,"" he said. ""It is deeply regrettable that this experience should happen to any of our patients and it is even more so when I consider the total number of patients involved."" In May 2018, the Belfast Trust recalled 2,500 patients for review after concerns were raised about the clinical work carried out by Dr Watt. This was followed by a further 1,044 patients who were recalled in November 2018. The RQIA regulatory body is also conducting a review into patient deaths. An independent inquiry was elevated to a statutory public inquiry late last year but has yet to start hearing evidence. Those affected by this latest recall were seen and discharged between 1996, when Dr Watt began his career, and 2012 and who are taking certain prescribed medications for specific neurological conditions. The Belfast Trust said those affected would have received a letter asking them to set up a telephone review to ascertain whether the medication is appropriate for their condition. Extra clinics have been set up to facilitate face-to-face interviews where necessary. Belfast Trust chief executive Dr Cathy Jack said she was ""truly sorry"" over the further recall. ""I absolutely understand that this will cause worry and anxiety to a number of people and their families and I am deeply sorry for that,"" she said. ""I also accept this next stage may be very difficult for those patients who have already been reviewed and whose diagnoses may have been changed as a result of our two previous recalls. ""Again, I want to express the trust's sincere regret for all the hurt and pain caused over the last number of years and for the harm that has undoubtedly been done. ""It is absolutely imperative that we put right any past wrongs and while this is painful, it is vital we assure ourselves that former patients, now discharged and who are taking very specific medication, are taking it for the correct reasons."" Neurologist Watt no longer Belfast Trust employee Neurology inquiry concerns not unique, says chair Ulster Independent Clinic and Hillsborough Private Clinic are recalling 57 and 10 former patients respectively. Separately, the trust also reviewed case notes of 66 patients who had a blood patch procedure under the care of Dr Watt and who did not have a clinical review as part of the recall process. It found that for 45 patients there was no clinical evidence to support that a blood patch was required. And, for 46 patients the care was unsatisfactory and fell below the standard expected by the trust. ""We are deeply sorry for this and for the undue hurt these patients experienced,"" the trust added. Colm Gildernew, who chairs the health scrutiny committee at Stormont. described it as a scandal that has caused immense distress. ""The neurology inquiry has revealed again more examples of a lack of transparency, deficits in governance arrangements and accountability within the health service,"" he said. The Sinn FÃ©in assembly member asked what lessons had been learned? Meanwhile DUP assembly member Pam Cameron, deputy chair of the committee, asked about a timetable and scale of resource for financial redress for those entitled to compensation. Mr Swann could not provide a definitive date but added: ""Redress payments will be paid because this is a failure of our systems that has to be corrected.""

"Asda's sale to forecourt tycoons the Issa brothers could raise petrol prices in some parts of the UK, the competition watchdog has warned. The Competition and Markets Authority found ""local competition concerns"" regarding fuel in 37 areas in the UK. Zuber and Mohsin Issa, and TDR Capital, agreed to buy Asda for Â£6.8bn last year. However, they also own 395 UK petrol stations while Asda owns 323. The Issa brothers said they would work with the CMA to find a solution. The deal to buy the UK's third-largest supermarket chain from its US owner Walmartwas announced in October last year. However, the CMA launched an initial inquiry into the takeover in December to see if it would lead to a ""substantial lessening of competition"". Following the competition body's initial findings, the buyers now have five working days to address its concerns and avoid a more in-depth investigation. Joel Bamford, CMA senior director of mergers, said: ""Our job is to protect consumers by making sure there continues to be strong competition between petrol stations, which leads to lower prices at the pump. Asda: How to buy a Â£6.8bn supermarket for Â£780m ""These are two key players in the market, and it's important that we thoroughly analyse the deal to make sure that people don't end up paying over the odds. ""Right now, we're concerned the merger could lead to higher prices for motorists in certain parts of the UK. However, if the companies can provide a clear-cut solution to address our concerns, we won't carry out an in-depth Phase 2 investigation."" A spokesperson for the Issa brothers and TDR Capital said: ""We will be working constructively with the CMA over the course of the next 10 days in order to arrive at a satisfactory outcome for all parties within Phase 1. ""This would provide welcome certainty for our colleagues, suppliers and customers, and allow us to move forward with our exciting plans for investment and growth at Asda.""

Pubs in Wales and Scotland will start serving customers alcohol outdoors again in the coming days, it was confirmed on Tuesday We're going to bring our live coverage of the Covid pandemic to an end shortly. But first, here's are some of the main UK stories we've been covering today: Here is a
round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories we have been covering around the world: The 22-year-old organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate in Nottingham city centre A 22-year-old man has been fined Â£10,000 for organisinga 90-person illegal partyin Nottinghamshire, England. Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape. The organiser's fine will be reduced to half if paid within two weeks, and if it is not paid, he will face a court appearance, the force said. A man who has helped bury dozens of Muslims who died with Covid-19 in one of England's worst-affected towns has spoken about the daily pressures of his role. Imran Patel, who is a volunteer at Blackburn Muslim Burial Society, has helped with 340 interments in the last 12 months, of which 200 were for people who had died with coronavirus. This video can not be played Reality Check There are currently not enough vaccines for India's vast population As we reported earlier, India haspledged to offer alladults over the age of 18a coronavirus vaccine from 1 May in a bid to stem a
severe second wave of the virus. However, domestic vaccine makers are struggling to meet
demand both at home and globally. The government has offered financial assistance to two
vaccine makers - the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech - and halted
large exports of vaccines in a bid to help boost local production. But will it be enough?Read more about the situation here. Yogita LimayeBBC India correspondent Many families are losing loved ones to the coronavirus More than 99% of all intensive care beds are full in Indiaâs
capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral
rituals as crematoriums and graveyards are running out of manpower and space. In smaller towns the situation is even worse. A sharp surge
in cases and deaths is being reported from many parts of India. Some areas are
now in lockdown. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about
decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the
Joint Biosecurity Centre, the JBC, they look at the issue and will make their
determination based on what they think we need to doâ. Asked about yesterdayâs decision to put India on the red list
he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here. Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference.

very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Younger people continue to bear the brunt of the jobs crisis amid widespread cuts in sectors such as hospitality, official figures show. In the year to March, 811,000 payroll jobs were lost in the UK, with under-35s accounting for 80% of these cuts. The data also showed the unemployment rate dipped to 4.9% in the three months to February - down from 5% previously. This was despite most of the UK being under strict lockdown rules for at least some of the period. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the jobs market ""remains subdued"", with five million people employed but still on furlough. Head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Surenâ¯Thiru, said:â¯ ""Unemployment remains on course to peak towards the end of 2021, once the furlough scheme expires and those who stopped job hunting during the pandemic look to return to the workforce as restrictions ease. ""Although the furlough scheme will limit the peak in job losses, the longer-term structural unemployment caused by Covid-19, particularly among young people, may mean that the road back to pre-pandemic levels lags behind the wider economic recovery."" 'Finding work feels impossible for my generation' Overall, some 1.67 million people were unemployed between December and February. That is down 50,000 on the previous quarter but still 311,000 higher than a year ago. But the ONS said younger people,externalwere suffering disproportionately, as sectors such as retail and hospitality were hit hard by the crisis. People aged under 35 accounted for 635,000 payroll jobs lost in the year to March, with 436,000 of those positions held by people under 25. Gerwyn Davies, senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, said the number of young people in employment had hit a ""post-pandemic low"". ""This reinforces the urgent case for apprenticeship incentives to be made more generous and targeted specifically at 18-24 year-olds. It also underlines the need to improve employers' awareness of traineeships and the Kickstart [work placement] Scheme."" It would be wrong to get carried away with the pleasant surprise of a dip in the official unemployment rate below 5%. The real pandemic picture is in the tax data for March. 813,000 fewer payrolls on the PAYE system versus a year ago, and four fifths of those jobs were lost to under 35s. But the fact that the numbers in the first few months have been broadly stable is definitely a source of relief. Employers were able to navigate the second lockdown without widespread further job losses, thanks to the extension of support schemes such as furlough. This provides a more solid basis than might have been expected for the phased reopening of the economy. There will be strains, especially as support is phased out in late summer. But these figures offer hope of a lower peak to unemployment, perhaps at around 6%, than had been expected. The ONS said the overall jobs market had been ""broadly stable"" in recent months after the major shock of last spring, when where the economy contracted sharply. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said the labour market ""remains subdued"" but that there were positive signs. ""With the prospect of businesses reopening, there was a marked rise in job vacancies in March, especially in sectors such as hospitality."" The Bank of England expects an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures are eased and government support for jobs continues. But it says the recovery still depends on the ""evolution of the pandemic"". Hannah Audino, an economist at PwC, said the stabilisation of the jobs market during the third national lockdown boded well for the UK economy. ""We expect a gradual recovery in the labour market in the coming months with the reopening of hospitality and retail, provided the government's roadmap to reopening the economy continues to go to plan.""

"Primark has said the number of people visiting its stores in England and Wales last week after lockdown eased reached pre-pandemic levels. The chain said the stores ""delivered record sales"" in the first week since reopening after more than three months. Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark has no online operations. As a result, the business has been hit hard by Covid restrictions and estimates it lost Â£1.1bn in sales while stores were closed. However, it said more than half of its stores broke their own sales records when they reopened last week. George Weston, chief executive of Primark's parent firm, Associated British Foods, said it was a reflection of the company's confidence that it had decided to repay Â£121m in furlough money claimed under government job retention schemes. ""Compared to previous reopenings, this time we have seen excellent demand for our fashion ranges, particularly in womenswear,"" Primark said. ""We expect the period after the reopening of stores to be very cash-generative as we sell the higher-than-normal inventory on hand. ""In line with our normal practice, we have placed substantial orders for merchandise for the coming autumn/winter season."" 'Revenge purchases' drive High Street comeback Primark was not alone in seeing a surge in demand last week, as shoppers rushed to take advantage of the reopening of non-essential stores in England and Wales. Retail analyst Springboard said footfall across all UK shopping destinations was up 87.8% week-on-week. AB Foods, which also makes branded consumer goods including Silver Spoon sugar and Twinings tea, is to pay out a dividend of 6.2p a share to shareholders despite a slump in profits. The company saw an 8% fall in statutory pre-tax profit to Â£275m in the 24 weeks to 27 February. Primark said that despite the lack of sales during the enforced closure of its stores, the furlough scheme had allowed it to preserve all its 65,000 jobs. ""We estimate the loss of sales while stores were closed to be some Â£1.1bn and when stores were open, the restrictions resulted in like-for-like sales of -15% compared to last year,"" it added. Primark said it was ""very optimistic"" about opportunities for growth in the business, with ""a strong pipeline of store openings across a number of growth markets"", particularly in southern and eastern Europe. It was also looking to expand in France, Spain, Portugal and Italy, where the Primark brand ""resonates strongly with consumers"".

"Colin and Cuthbert caterpillar cakes Marks & Spencer has stepped up its caterpillar rights wrangle with Aldi after the discounter said its Cuthbert cake was returning for charity. Aldi had stopped selling the cake in February, two months before M&S accused the supermarket of infringing its Colin the Caterpillar trademark. But now sales of a limited edition version will benefit Teenage Cancer Trust and Macmillan Cancer Support. M&S said it loved a charity idea, but Aldi should use its own character. Unveiling the idea on social media, Aldi said: ""Let's raise money for charity, not lawyers."" M&S replied that a cake based on Aldi's Kevin the Carrot commercials would be better, adding: ""That idea's on us."" Last week, M&S lodged an intellectual property claim with the High Court. It said Cuthbert's similarity with its own Colin cake led consumers to believe they were of the same standard and ""rides on the coat-tails"" of M&S's reputation. The retailer has three trademarks relating to Colin, which it believes means Colin has acquired and retains an enhanced distinctive character. Rival supermarkets, which all sell caterpillar cakes of their own, remained tight-lipped in the face of the action by M&S, which said it had ""not ruled out"" pursuing other retailers as well. The food and drinks with trademarked shapes The battle to stop people from copying shapes M&S said it wanted Aldi to agree not to sell anything similar in the future, but it clearly had not bargained on Aldi's latest cheeky charity-related move. ""Hey Marks and Spencer we're taking a stand against caterpillar cruelty. Can Colin and Cuthbert be besties?"" said Aldi on social media. ""We're bringing back a limited edition Cuthbert next month and want to donate all profits to cancer charities including your partners Macmillan Cancer Support and ours Teenage Cancer Trust,"" it said, using the Twitter hashtag #caterpillarsforcancer. Aldi said it was calling on other supermarkets to join it in raising money for cancer charities through the sale of caterpillar cakes. M&S tweeted back: ""Hey @AldiUK we love a charity idea (Colin's been a BIG fundraiser for years). We just want you to use your own character. ""How about #kevinthecarrotcake ? That idea's on us... and we promise we won't do Keith."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Colin the Caterpillar was launched by M&S about 30 years ago. His appearance has been substantially unchanged since around 2004, except for adaptations for events such as Halloween and Christmas, and related products such as Connie the Caterpillar. Colin is central to M&S's partnership with cancer charity Macmillan, and the retailer has created a Colin product for the annual World's Biggest Coffee Morning fundraising event. The cake is a sponge with milk chocolate and buttercream, topped with chocolate sweets and a smiling white chocolate face. M&S was the first retailer to sell a caterpillar cake, but many supermarkets have since created their own similar products. Other cakes include Waitrose's Cecil, Sainsbury's Wiggles, Tesco's Curly and Asda's Clyde the Caterpillar. ""Aldi is known to sail close to the wind on creating products which look and/or sound incredibly similar to other brands,"" said Gary Assim, an intellectual property specialist at law firm Shoosmiths. ""M&S may find their case against Aldi difficult, since there are other caterpillar cakes on the market. They should have taken a zero-tolerance approach from the start if they felt that Colin and Connie were so important to them.""

"This video can not be played Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. Chad's President Idriss DÃ©by has died of his injuries following clashes with rebels in the north of the country at the weekend, the army has said. The announcement came a day after provisional election results projected he would win a sixth term in office. The government and parliament have been dissolved. A curfew has also been imposed and the borders have been shut. DÃ©by, 68, spent more than three decades in power and was one of Africa's longest-serving leaders. An army officer by training, he came to power in 1990 through an armed uprising. He was a long-time ally of France and other Western powers in the battle against jihadist groups in the Sahel region of Africa. DÃ©by ""breathed his last defending the sovereign nation on the battlefield"", an army general said on state TV on Tuesday. He had gone to the front line, several hundred kilometres north of the capital, N'Djamena, at the weekend to visit troops battling rebels belonging to a group calling itself Fact (the Front for Change and Concord in Chad). A state funeral is due to take place on Friday. Reaction to DÃ©byâs death Chad's future rocked by president's battlefield death Idriss DÃ©by - the end of Chad's 'Great Survivor' A quick guide to Chad A military council led by DÃ©by's son, a 37-year-old four star general, will govern for the next 18 months. Mahamat Idriss DÃ©by Itno will lead the council, but ""free and democratic"" elections will be held once the transition period is over, the army said in its statement. He later issued a statement naming the 14 other generals who will make up the new governing body. A BBC Monitoring journalist tweeted a copy of the notice: Allow Twitter content?

Experts have told the BBC and other broadcasters that the move is unconstitutional, and that the speaker of parliament should take over when a sitting president dies before organising elections. Ahead of the election on 11 April, DÃ©by campaigned on a platform of bringing peace and security to the region. Provisional results showed he had 80% of the vote. But there had been growing unhappiness over his government's management of Chad's oil resources. Idriss DÃ©by was known as that rare thing - a true warrior president. The former rebel and trained pilot was the opposite of an armchair general. For 30 years, he clung to power in Chad - a vast nation that straddles the Sahara and is surrounded by some of the continent's most protracted conflicts. And DÃ©by had a hand in every one of them - from Darfur to Libya, Mali, Nigeria and the Central African Republic. His troops were among the most battle-hardened on the planet. Domestically, he had become an increasingly autocratic figure. His latest election victory saw him claim nearly 80% of the vote. It is unclear if the poor, feuding, brittle state he leaves behind can manage a smooth transition. And there are wider concerns too. For years, President DÃ©by was the West's indispensable ally in the war against Islamist militants - in Mali, Niger and beyond. His death leaves a vacuum that many may now fight to fill. In a statement, the French presidency described Mr DÃ©by as a ""brave friend"" and said it affirmed its attachment to the stability of Chad. Over the years, France has deployed troops and fighter jets to push back Mr DÃ©by's opponents. Chadian forces are considered to be the most effective of the Western-backed ""G5"" countries fighting Islamist militants in the Sahel region. And it has often proved to be the more stable country in a region that includes Libya, Sudan and the Central African Republic - where armed groups roam freely and trade in weapons and lucrative resources that fuel conflict, says the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga. Founded in 2016 by disillusioned former army officers, the rebel Fact group accuses President DÃ©by of repression in the run-up to the election. They built up their base in Libya in the Tibesti mountains, which straddle northern Chad and part of southern Libya. On election day, the group mounted an attack on a border post and gradually advanced on N'Djamena. The latest clashes began on Saturday. The army says that 300 insurgents were killed and 150 captured. Five government soldiers were killed and 36 injured, it says. The figures could not immediately be verified. Some foreign embassies in the capital have urged their staff to leave. A former BBC journalist in N'Djamena says the situation there seemed relatively calm: ""The news is filtering through to people, but the city is calm and people are just shocked to hear that actually, because many people didn't even know that he [President DÃ©by] was wounded or that he was at the frontline,"" said Mahamat Adamou. ""In the street in downtown, there are armoured vehicles that are posted at key road junctions. Of course, there is a sense of 'What is going to happen?'. But not more than that."" N'Djamena has come under rebel attack before and there was panic in the city on Monday, with parents taking their children home from school, when tanks were deployed along the main roads. 1) It is named after Lake Chad. This is the second-largest lake in Africa, but has shrunk by 90% since the 1960s. Its basin covers parts of Nigeria, Niger, Chad and Cameroon, and is a water source for between 20 million and 30 million people. 2) The Sahara Desert roughly covers one third of the country. Much of the north is desert and home to a mere 1% of Chad's population. The south has large expanses of wooded savannahs and woodlands. 3) Remains of a seven-million-year-old human-like creature - or hominid - known as ""Toumai"" were unearthed in 2001. Its discoverers argued that Toumai was the oldest hominid known to science. 4) Chad became an oil-producing nation in 2003, with the completion of a $4bn (Â£2.87bn) pipeline linking its oilfields to terminals on the Atlantic coast. The industry has been plagued by allegations of corruption. 5) Agriculture is the main source of livelihood for most people - cotton is grown in the south, and exported to Europe and the US.

decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the
Joint Biosecurity Centre, the JBC, they look at the issue and will make their
determination based on what they think we need to doâ. Asked about yesterdayâs decision to put India on the red list
he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here. Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Positive,1.0
"Tensions are high in Minnesota this week as the jury in the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin prepares to deliver its verdict. Mr Chauvin faces two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, last May in Minneapolis. Protesters crowded the streets in Mr Floyd's name in cities across the US and around the world over the summer. The trial is being viewed as a referendum on policing in the US. An African-American political hopeful, a Minnesota resident and a retired police veteranshared their thoughts with the BBCwhen the trial began in late March. We reached out to them again and they told us what stood out to them over the past three weeks. A community activist, an entrepreneur and a father of two, Curtis went viral last year for his impassioned message about the generational injustices African Americans have suffered. He is now running for city council in his hometown of Charlotte. What did you make of the cases presented by each side? The state brought a very solid case, with very credible witnesses. I do believe the defence ""won"" a couple of days, but the prosecution held steady and remained strong throughout the whole case. At the end, the defence tried to throw a wrench in there with the opinion that carbon monoxide may have been a factor in Floyd's death. I feel like they were scrambling to convince the jury or give them some sense of doubt. Their case was basically speculation and opinion of what they think might have happened, and they never had hardcore facts. What moments stood out to you the most? When it comes to an officer of the law, one would think that the police protect police and any investigations they conduct are basically of themselves. Every moment when an officer of the law got up there and testified against Chauvin - that was a moment of great bravery, for themselves and for the departments that they serve. People wanted to see if the police chief and all these other officers were going to hold this man accountable for what he did, and I believe that all of those moments were very significant. Police in uniform said that the force was unnecessary and that's what Chauvin was on trial for: he killed this man for no reason. The jurors who will decide Derek Chauvin's fate What do you think the outcome of this trial will be? The evidence is there. The facts are there. The testimonies are there. Everything is there and we need to come out with a conviction for sure. I hope the jury is going to come back with the fastest verdict in history and find him guilty of the highest charges. Hopefully this is a teaching moment for police in America. It is time to protect and serve. Hopefully they start putting police in neighbourhoods that can actually police those neighbourhoods. A problem we are facing is that we are hiring police who have not had any interaction with individuals who live in these neighbourhoods and they don't know how to react or de-escalate or don't want to handle situations appropriately. Melissa is a mixed-race resident of the Minneapolis-St Paul area and a mother of two. With the trial unfolding in her backyard, she is keeping a close eye on it and hopes to see some accountability What did you make of the cases presented by each side? I think the state laid out a good case. They brought witnesses with details, and a lot of experts. They did a good job. And they faced a competent defence. This has been a fair trial, which is important, whether I agree with the defence or not. The defence tried to argue that their police officers became distracted by the bystanders, who they tried to portray as a threatening crowd. I imagined myself there and I didn't think they looked threatening. They looked extremely concerned, extremely upset and were pleading. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life Four facts that help explain anger at US policing What moments stood out to you the most? Listening to the testimony of the bystanders, understanding how desperate they were and ""calling the police on the police"" was very moving testimony for me. I keep thinking about the fire department EMT [paramedic] - the woman who wanted them to check for a pulse. She was desperate to provide medical care. It was painful to watch her testimony, but I have to say all of the witnesses are sticking in my memory. It's heart-breaking. The whole thing was heart-breaking last year. The testimony of the witnesses was very upsetting. The whole thing didn't have to happen. You feel a sense of hopelessness and helplessness because it's an overwhelming problem. What do you think the outcome of this trial will be? I think Derek Chauvin should be found guilty. He's got three different charges against him and I don't know the nuances of these different charges, but it's up to the jury to find the perfect charge to find him guilty. I still believe that if George Floyd had not encountered the police that day, he would still be alive, despite all his health issues and other stuff mentioned. I haven't talked to anybody who doesn't think the police were responsible for his death. There will be an outpouring of emotion in this community. A retired police lieutenant who spent 34 years on the force in two states, Randy trained law enforcement for over three decades and founded The Wounded Blue, a national organisation that assists injured and disabled officers. What did you make of the cases presented by each side? The cases presented the arguments as expected. It's pretty frustrating to be a police officer or a police veteran these days. It is guilt presumed before innocence, which is backwards to how the United States was established to be in its delivery of justice. Recruitment of officers is down, and is in crisis. Who would want to be a police officer under these conditions? Not many. What moments stood out to you the most? The testimony that George Floyd had no carotid artery damage was very compelling to me. This would indicate that he was not suffocated via the neck. And the evidence of the fentanyl in the back seat of the car was also an indicator that he was in fact on fentanyl as the autopsy showed. Fentanyl causes severe breathing difficulties. What do you think the outcome of this trial will be? It's difficult to predict, given the political correctness and extraordinary amount of pressure this jury is under. The unfortunate reality I think the country is facing is that anything short of first degree murder will bring riots.

"Primark has said the number of people visiting its stores in England and Wales last week after lockdown eased reached pre-pandemic levels. The chain said the stores ""delivered record sales"" in the first week since reopening after more than three months. Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark has no online operations. As a result, the business has been hit hard by Covid restrictions and estimates it lost Â£1.1bn in sales while stores were closed. However, it said more than half of its stores broke their own sales records when they reopened last week. George Weston, chief executive of Primark's parent firm, Associated British Foods, said it was a reflection of the company's confidence that it had decided to repay Â£121m in furlough money claimed under government job retention schemes. ""Compared to previous reopenings, this time we have seen excellent demand for our fashion ranges, particularly in womenswear,"" Primark said. ""We expect the period after the reopening of stores to be very cash-generative as we sell the higher-than-normal inventory on hand. ""In line with our normal practice, we have placed substantial orders for merchandise for the coming autumn/winter season."" 'Revenge purchases' drive High Street comeback Primark was not alone in seeing a surge in demand last week, as shoppers rushed to take advantage of the reopening of non-essential stores in England and Wales. Retail analyst Springboard said footfall across all UK shopping destinations was up 87.8% week-on-week. AB Foods, which also makes branded consumer goods including Silver Spoon sugar and Twinings tea, is to pay out a dividend of 6.2p a share to shareholders despite a slump in profits. The company saw an 8% fall in statutory pre-tax profit to Â£275m in the 24 weeks to 27 February. Primark said that despite the lack of sales during the enforced closure of its stores, the furlough scheme had allowed it to preserve all its 65,000 jobs. ""We estimate the loss of sales while stores were closed to be some Â£1.1bn and when stores were open, the restrictions resulted in like-for-like sales of -15% compared to last year,"" it added. Primark said it was ""very optimistic"" about opportunities for growth in the business, with ""a strong pipeline of store openings across a number of growth markets"", particularly in southern and eastern Europe. It was also looking to expand in France, Spain, Portugal and Italy, where the Primark brand ""resonates strongly with consumers"".

"Colin and Cuthbert caterpillar cakes Marks & Spencer has stepped up its caterpillar rights wrangle with Aldi after the discounter said its Cuthbert cake was returning for charity. Aldi had stopped selling the cake in February, two months before M&S accused the supermarket of infringing its Colin the Caterpillar trademark. But now sales of a limited edition version will benefit Teenage Cancer Trust and Macmillan Cancer Support. M&S said it loved a charity idea, but Aldi should use its own character. Unveiling the idea on social media, Aldi said: ""Let's raise money for charity, not lawyers."" M&S replied that a cake based on Aldi's Kevin the Carrot commercials would be better, adding: ""That idea's on us."" Last week, M&S lodged an intellectual property claim with the High Court. It said Cuthbert's similarity with its own Colin cake led consumers to believe they were of the same standard and ""rides on the coat-tails"" of M&S's reputation. The retailer has three trademarks relating to Colin, which it believes means Colin has acquired and retains an enhanced distinctive character. Rival supermarkets, which all sell caterpillar cakes of their own, remained tight-lipped in the face of the action by M&S, which said it had ""not ruled out"" pursuing other retailers as well. The food and drinks with trademarked shapes The battle to stop people from copying shapes M&S said it wanted Aldi to agree not to sell anything similar in the future, but it clearly had not bargained on Aldi's latest cheeky charity-related move. ""Hey Marks and Spencer we're taking a stand against caterpillar cruelty. Can Colin and Cuthbert be besties?"" said Aldi on social media. ""We're bringing back a limited edition Cuthbert next month and want to donate all profits to cancer charities including your partners Macmillan Cancer Support and ours Teenage Cancer Trust,"" it said, using the Twitter hashtag #caterpillarsforcancer. Aldi said it was calling on other supermarkets to join it in raising money for cancer charities through the sale of caterpillar cakes. M&S tweeted back: ""Hey @AldiUK we love a charity idea (Colin's been a BIG fundraiser for years). We just want you to use your own character. ""How about #kevinthecarrotcake ? That idea's on us... and we promise we won't do Keith."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Colin the Caterpillar was launched by M&S about 30 years ago. His appearance has been substantially unchanged since around 2004, except for adaptations for events such as Halloween and Christmas, and related products such as Connie the Caterpillar. Colin is central to M&S's partnership with cancer charity Macmillan, and the retailer has created a Colin product for the annual World's Biggest Coffee Morning fundraising event. The cake is a sponge with milk chocolate and buttercream, topped with chocolate sweets and a smiling white chocolate face. M&S was the first retailer to sell a caterpillar cake, but many supermarkets have since created their own similar products. Other cakes include Waitrose's Cecil, Sainsbury's Wiggles, Tesco's Curly and Asda's Clyde the Caterpillar. ""Aldi is known to sail close to the wind on creating products which look and/or sound incredibly similar to other brands,"" said Gary Assim, an intellectual property specialist at law firm Shoosmiths. ""M&S may find their case against Aldi difficult, since there are other caterpillar cakes on the market. They should have taken a zero-tolerance approach from the start if they felt that Colin and Connie were so important to them.""

Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape. The organiser's fine will be reduced to half if paid within two weeks, and if it is not paid, he will face a court appearance, the force said. A man who has helped bury dozens of Muslims who died with Covid-19 in one of England's worst-affected towns has spoken about the daily pressures of his role. Imran Patel, who is a volunteer at Blackburn Muslim Burial Society, has helped with 340 interments in the last 12 months, of which 200 were for people who had died with coronavirus.

demand both at home and globally. The government has offered financial assistance to two
vaccine makers - the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech - and halted
large exports of vaccines in a bid to help boost local production. But will it be enough?Read more about the situation here. Yogita LimayeBBC India correspondent Many families are losing loved ones to the coronavirus More than 99% of all intensive care beds are full in Indiaâs
capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral
rituals as crematoriums and graveyards are running out of manpower and space. In smaller towns the situation is even worse. A sharp surge
in cases and deaths is being reported from many parts of India. Some areas are
now in lockdown. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about
decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the
Joint Biosecurity Centre, the JBC, they look at the issue and will make their
determination based on what they think we need to doâ. Asked about yesterdayâs decision to put India on the red list
he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here. Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"Primark has said the number of people visiting its stores in England and Wales last week after lockdown eased reached pre-pandemic levels. The chain said the stores ""delivered record sales"" in the first week since reopening after more than three months. Unlike most High Street retailers, Primark has no online operations. As a result, the business has been hit hard by Covid restrictions and estimates it lost Â£1.1bn in sales while stores were closed. However, it said more than half of its stores broke their own sales records when they reopened last week. George Weston, chief executive of Primark's parent firm, Associated British Foods, said it was a reflection of the company's confidence that it had decided to repay Â£121m in furlough money claimed under government job retention schemes. ""Compared to previous reopenings, this time we have seen excellent demand for our fashion ranges, particularly in womenswear,"" Primark said. ""We expect the period after the reopening of stores to be very cash-generative as we sell the higher-than-normal inventory on hand. ""In line with our normal practice, we have placed substantial orders for merchandise for the coming autumn/winter season."" 'Revenge purchases' drive High Street comeback Primark was not alone in seeing a surge in demand last week, as shoppers rushed to take advantage of the reopening of non-essential stores in England and Wales. Retail analyst Springboard said footfall across all UK shopping destinations was up 87.8% week-on-week. AB Foods, which also makes branded consumer goods including Silver Spoon sugar and Twinings tea, is to pay out a dividend of 6.2p a share to shareholders despite a slump in profits. The company saw an 8% fall in statutory pre-tax profit to Â£275m in the 24 weeks to 27 February. Primark said that despite the lack of sales during the enforced closure of its stores, the furlough scheme had allowed it to preserve all its 65,000 jobs. ""We estimate the loss of sales while stores were closed to be some Â£1.1bn and when stores were open, the restrictions resulted in like-for-like sales of -15% compared to last year,"" it added. Primark said it was ""very optimistic"" about opportunities for growth in the business, with ""a strong pipeline of store openings across a number of growth markets"", particularly in southern and eastern Europe. It was also looking to expand in France, Spain, Portugal and Italy, where the Primark brand ""resonates strongly with consumers"".

"A majority of people on both sides of the Irish border believes Northern Ireland will have left the UK within 25 years, a poll suggests. Most respondents said they thought NI would still be part of the UK in 10 years time, but not in 25 years. In NI, 49% of people said if there was a border poll today they would vote to remain in the UK, with 43% backing a united Ireland and 8% undecided. The poll was commissioned by BBC NI's Spotlight programme. In the Republic of Ireland, where a vote would have to be held in parallel with any border poll in Northern Ireland, 51%  said they would vote for a United Ireland, 27% would vote for Northern Ireland to stay in the UK and 22% were not sure. You can watch a discussion exploring the issues raised and delving further into the results of the cross-border opinion poll on theBBC News NI websiteand the BBC iPlayer When asked if they thought NI woud be part of the UK in 10 years, 55% in NI and 59% in the Republic of Ireland said they thought it would be. But when asked if this would be the case in 25 years, 51% of people in NI and 54% in the Republic said NI would have left the UK. The poll also suggested that only 40% of people in Northern Ireland sawits formation 100 years agoas a cause for celebration. Most people on both sides of the Irish border believed there was a potential for a return to political violence in Northern Ireland, according to the poll. The poll was carried out over the Easter period when clashes were taking place in a number of areas across Northern Ireland, sparked by loyalist anger over the Northern Ireland trade protocol and the Police Service of Northern Ireland's handling of a republican funeral during the pandemic. Of those surveyed in Northern Ireland, 76% agreed with the proposition that ""the dispute over Northern Ireland's status remains unresolved and there is still a potential for violence in the future"". In the Republic, an even higher proportion, 87%, echoed that view. A total of 48% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters they want the controversial trade protocol introduced as part of the UK's EU Withdrawal Agreement scrapped, in line with demands from the DUP and other unionist parties, while 46% wanted the protocol to be retained. Unionists have claimed the protocol, which requires checks on goods moving across the Irish Sea from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, threatens the constitutional integrity of the UK. Interviewed for the Spotlight programme, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin insisted the protocol was not tearing the UK apart, while Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was working to ""sandpaper"" away what he described as the ""ludicrous barriers"" to trade across the Irish Sea. This video can not be played Boris Johnson pledges to end ""ludicrous barriers"" Between Great Britain and Northern Ireland In the Republic, a majority of those surveyed supported the Irish government's defence of the trade protocol, with 74% saying it should not be scrapped. Although within Northern Ireland a larger number of people rejected the trade protocol than backed it, the poll also provided an indication that a majority wants to retain some form of economic link with the EU. Some 56% of those surveyed in Northern Ireland told the pollsters that they wanted their assembly members (MLAs) to vote to stay within the EU Single Market when the matter is put to a vote at Stormont in three years' time. Only 38% indicated they wanted to leave the EU Single Market. In Northern Ireland 37% of people surveyed told the pollsters they would like to see a border poll within the next five years, whilst a further 29% want it to happen at some point after that. However the prime minister told the Spotlight programme that he cannot see any Northern Ireland secretary considering a border poll for a ""very, very long time to come"". The prime minister told BBC Northern Ireland that as ""a proud unionist"" he views the centenary of Northern Ireland's formation as a cause for celebration. However only 40% of the people surveyed agreed with the proposition that ""the formation of Northern Ireland 100 years ago was an achievement which should be celebrated"", while 45% disagreed with the statement. Outright celebration of the centenary turned out to be the least popular of five options included in the survey. In Northern Ireland, 48% agreed that the partition of Ireland and the creation of a land border 100 years ago was ""a negative development which should be regretted"". A total of 50% wanted to concentrate on current challenges such as the Covid pandemic rather than the centenary, whilst 61% backed marking Northern Ireland's formation in a neutral manner acknowledging the differing opinions on the subject. The same proportion, 61%, agreed with the statement ""Northern Ireland's history is not just about constitutional politics and the centenary should provide an opportunity to showcase its sporting, business, scientific and cultural achievements"". In the Republic, celebrating the formation of Northern Ireland was even more unpopular with just 12% agreeing with the proposition. The most popular options were marking this year's centenary in a neutral manner, which was favoured by 74% of those surveyed and regretting partition - a view 71% agreed with. The poll commissioned by BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme was carried out by the NI Pollsters LucidTalk and the Irish polling firm Ireland Thinks. In Northern Ireland polling was carried out online between 5 and 7 April and 2,845 responses were used for the analysis. In the Republic of Ireland polling took place between 6 and 9 April and 1,088 responses were analysed. A small amount of fieldwork was carried out in the Republic of Ireland on 10 April. The margin of error is +/- 2.5%. The results from a number of other questions in the survey regarding what should happen to the Irish flag, national anthem, the Stormont Executive and the health service in the event of a United Ireland will be released on BBC Northern Ireland's political programme The View on Thursday night.

"Coal-fired power stations like this one in Guizhou province, China are expected to play a role in the carbon surge The International Energy Agency (IEA) is predicting a major surge in CO2 emissions from energy this year, as the world rebounds from the pandemic. Total energy emissions for 2021 will still be slightly lower than in 2019, the agency says. But CO2 will rise by the second largest annual amount on record. The use of coal in Asia is expected to be key: the IEA says it will push global demand up by 4.5%, taking it close to the global peak seen in 2014. However, renewable energy is also booming, with green sources set to supply 30% of electricity this year. Satellite network to find carbon super-emitters China 'can save $1.6 trillion by scrapping coal' Delaying climate meeting 'preferable to failure' A deserted airport during the pandemic lockdown - demand for aviation is likely to stay low until the end of this year The empty roads, high streets and airports that marked the global response to coronavirus saw the biggest fall in demand for energy since World War Two. That decline saw carbon emissions tumble by around 6% in 2020, as the more carbon-intensive fuels such as coal and oil were hardest hit by restrictions. Many hoped that these changes in energy use would be sustained in the recovery from the pandemic, butthese latest predictions from the IEA,externalindicate that is not likely to be the case. Energy demand is booming in the developing world, with a rise of 3.4% predicted for this year - this contrasts with richer economies, where overall energy use is expected to still be 3% below 2019. In the places where energy demand is growing, coal is playing a key role. Overall global use declined by around 4% in 2020, but is expected to rise by 4.5% this year. Wind energy is expected to grow by 17% from 2020 levels This is mainly happening in Asia, where China is leading the way and expected to account for more than half of the global coal growth this year. But even in the US and EU, where coal has been on the back foot for some time, demand is expected to rise - although it will still likely remain below 2019 levels in these regions. According to the IEA, coal demand is likely to be close to the global peak seen in 2014 - and that has implications for efforts to rein in climate change. ""Global carbon emissions are set to jump by 1.5 billion tonnes this year - driven by the resurgence of coal use in the power sector,"" said Fatih Birol, the IEA's executive director. ""This is a dire warning that the economic recovery from the Covid crisis is currently anything but sustainable for our climate."" Renewables are booming in China - this image shows a floating solar park in the country The emissions predictions for 2021 would be even worse, according to the IEA, if demand for oil increased to pre-covid levels. By the end of this year, oil use for aviation is still expected to be 20% below 2019 levels. However there are some strong positives for renewable energy in the IEA report. Wind, solar and other sustainable forms grew 3% during 2020, and in the power sector they are expected to grow by 8% this year. Overall green energy sources will provide 30% of electricity generation, the highest level since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Reflecting the complexities of the global energy picture, China is likely to account for almost half the global increase in renewable electricity this year. ""As we have seen at the country-level in the past 15 years, the countries that succeed to cut their emissions are those where renewable energy replaces fossil energy,"" said Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ©, from the University of East Anglia, who hasstudied the factors,externalthat drive countries to change their power systems. ""What seems to be happening now is that we have a massive deployment of renewable energy, which is good for tackling climate change, but this is occurring alongside massive investments in coal and gas."" ""Stimulus spending post-Covid-19 worldwide is still largely funding activities that lock us into high CO2 emissions for decades."" Later this week, President Biden will host a climate summit, with around 40 presidents and prime ministers expected to take part virtually. President Biden is hosting a key climate gathering this week The US is also expected to announce a significantly improved emissions cutting target for 2030. According to the IEA, these actions can't come quickly enough if emissions are to be reined in to keep the temperature targets of the Paris climate agreement within sight. ""Unless governments around the world move rapidly to start cutting emissions, we are likely to face an even worse situation in 2022,"" said Dr Birol from the IEA. ""The leaders' summit on climate hosted by US President Joe Biden this week is a critical moment to commit to clear and immediate action ahead of COP26 in Glasgow.""

Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape. The organiser's fine will be reduced to half if paid within two weeks, and if it is not paid, he will face a court appearance, the force said.

Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC.

But first, here's are some of the main UK stories we've been covering today: Here is a
round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories we have been covering around the world: The 22-year-old organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate in Nottingham city centre A 22-year-old man has been fined Â£10,000 for organisinga 90-person illegal partyin Nottinghamshire, England. Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape. The organiser's fine will be reduced to half if paid within two weeks, and if it is not paid, he will face a court appearance, the force said. A man who has helped bury dozens of Muslims who died with Covid-19 in one of England's worst-affected towns has spoken about the daily pressures of his role. Imran Patel, who is a volunteer at Blackburn Muslim Burial Society, has helped with 340 interments in the last 12 months, of which 200 were for people who had died with coronavirus. This video can not be played Reality Check There are currently not enough vaccines for India's vast population As we reported earlier, India haspledged to offer alladults over the age of 18a coronavirus vaccine from 1 May in a bid to stem a
severe second wave of the virus. However, domestic vaccine makers are struggling to meet
demand both at home and globally. The government has offered financial assistance to two
vaccine makers - the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech - and halted
large exports of vaccines in a bid to help boost local production. But will it be enough?Read more about the situation here. Yogita LimayeBBC India correspondent Many families are losing loved ones to the coronavirus More than 99% of all intensive care beds are full in Indiaâs
capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral
rituals as crematoriums and graveyards are running out of manpower and space. In smaller towns the situation is even worse. A sharp surge
in cases and deaths is being reported from many parts of India. Some areas are
now in lockdown. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about
decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the
Joint Biosecurity Centre, the JBC, they look at the issue and will make their
determination based on what they think we need to doâ. Asked about yesterdayâs decision to put India on the red list
he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here.

"This video can not be played European Super League chairman, Florentino Perez: ""We want to save football"" The European Super League was created ""to save football"", says Real Madrid president Florentino Perez. Real are one of the 12 European clubs who have signed up to the breakaway league and intend to establish a new midweek competition. Perez said the move had been made because young people are ""no longer interested in football"" because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". ""Whenever there is change, there are always people who oppose it,"" he said. Fifa boss 'strongly disapproves' of ESL plans as Everton criticise clubs for 'preposterous arrogance' This video can not be played Alan Shearer says the proposed European Super League is ""plain and simply wrong"" The English 'big six' of Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham haveagreed to join the new league. The move has been criticised by football authorities and government ministers in the UK and widely condemned across Europe by Uefa and leagues associations. Prime Minister Boris Johnson willhold a meetingwith football's governing bodies on Tuesday to discuss the move, while the 14 Premier League clubs not included in the plans are also scheduled to meet. Perez said that the top teams were losing money and that big-name matches would help increase their revenue. ""We are doing this to save football at this critical moment,"" Perez told Spanish TV show El Chiringuito de Jugones. ""If we continue with the Champions League there is less and less interest and then it's over. ""The new format which starts in 2024 is absurd. In 2024, we are all dead."" Plans for a revamped 36-team Champions League, starting in 2024, wereconfirmed by Uefa on Monday. He added: ""In the '50s, it was a similar situation. Uefa and Fifa went against the new European Cup, but that competition changed football."" 'Bonfire of greed' - How Europe has reacted European Super League Q&A - What happens next? AC Milan chief executive Ivan Gazidis said the ESL would be ""a new, exciting chapter for the game"" and that it will ""provide value and support"" across European football. ""We're confident that this new competition will capture the imagination of billions of soccer fans all over the world,"" he said. Gazidis also said the club wants to continue to play in Serie A, which he said ""will remain the most important weekend competition in Italy"". Juventus manager Andrea Pirlo came out in support of the ESL and the club's owner Andrea Agnelli, who quit as European Club Association (ECA) chairman after signing the Turin club up to the new competition. ""He explained this project to us, he gave us great confidence, but the most important thing he told us is that we have to continue with our work,"" Pirlo said. Perez said the move had been accelerated by the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to matches being played behind closed doors. He claimed 40% of young people are not interested in football and Real have lost 400m euros (Â£344m) because of the impact of the pandemic. ""When you don't have any income other than from television, you have to find a solution to make more attractive matches that fans all over the world can watch with all of the big clubs,"" said Perez. ""Young people are no longer interested in football. They have other platforms on which to distract themselves. ""We could get back some of the money we lost because of the pandemic. We have to raise more money organising more competitive games."" A YouGov poll of 1,730 football fans in the UK found 79% opposed the idea of a Super League. Among fans aged between 18 and 24, 71% were found to be against it with only 19% of respondents saying they were in favour of the competition. Only 7% said they strongly supported the creation of the ESL. However, critics say the move is being driven purely by money, would destroy domestic leagues and is against the integrity of the sport. Former England captain Alan Shearer said he hoped the English clubs would consider the reaction of their fans, which has been overwhelmingly negative. ""Clubs talk about being a family and how fans are the soul of the club,"" Shearer told BBC Breakfast. ""Well, let's see what they really think about the fans, because the fans have now spoken. ""It is clearly obvious that they don't want this, so let's see what their fans mean to the football clubs."" There has been no concrete plan released on how the tournament would be structured but Perez said it could have shorter matches in order to keep their targeted younger audience interested. ""Young people say the game is too long,"" he said. ""If young people don't watch an entire game it is because it is not interesting enough, or we will have to shorten the games."" He also said that referees and the video review system would be ""improved"" in the tournament. ""There will be financial fair play and stability. We'll try to select the referees with professional criteria,"" he added. Another three teams will be added to the league as guaranteed members, with five more qualifying each year. Perez said the group want to start the new league by August, should they reach an agreement with Uefa, otherwise it could be delayed by a year. Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin called the league a""disgraceful, self-serving"" planand a ""spit in the face of football lovers"". Ceferin also said that players involved with the ESL could be banned from all Uefa competitions, which Perez denied. ""It will not happen, the law protects us,"" Perez added. ""We will not get into legal issues. It is impossible. The players should remain calm because the threats won't happen.      ""This is not a league for the rich, it's a league to save football."" A dozen clubs - including Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - agree to form a new midweek competition European Super League will feature 20 clubsin all and run alongside domestic leagues such as the Premier League Founding clubs are being enticed with ashare of a â¬3.5bn (Â£3bn) grant provided by the investment bank JP Morgan UK government says it is prepared""to put everything on the table to prevent this from happening"".

"Avram Glazer, Joel Glazer and Bryan Glazer, pictured, are part of the family that owns a majority stake in Manchester United, although Avram sold some of his shares in March Sports fans love a bit of jeopardy - a nail biting contest which can end in glory or defeat. But business owners generally hate all of that. Owners and business managers of football clubs have a peculiar problem. As one former chief executive of a Premier League club told me: ""I won't know till the last day of the season if my budget for next year is going to be Â£170m or Â£70m."" That is not only almost impossible to manage, it has another very important consequence. Businesses with steady revenues are worth a lot more than ones with erratic earnings. In business terms it's known as getting a higher ""multiple"" - volatile businesses are worth as little as five times average annual earnings, whereas steady ones are worth up to 20 times or more. This is what the European Super League is all about - making the clubs involved worth more by eliminating the jeopardy of being relegated or missing out on Champions League qualification. This is the moment many football team owners have been waiting for - particularly the American owners of Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal - who know for themselves how much more stable and therefore valuable are the earnings of American sports teams. The backers of the Super League say that the existing Champions League was a poor product - too many meaningless one sided games between minnows and giants of European football before it got interesting. Q&A: What is the new Super League? 'Big six' agree to join 'Super League' They also argue that a more stable financial top to the football pyramid is needed to ensure the cascade or trickle down to the smaller clubs that they promise will increase as a result of this. But many sports fans would argue the prospect of a romantic giant killing in Real Madrid's Bernabeau stadium or Old Trafford is an essential part of the game - while regular meetings between the great clubs normalise and make humdrum what was once an exotic and rare event. The backers have told the BBC this is not another extreme form of negotiation to make Uefa cave to the big clubs' long-standing demands for more control of the world's most prestigious club event - ""this is really happening, it's on, even if Uefa backs down"". If it does it will have far reaching implications for the existing leagues around Europe. Finishing in the top four of the Premier League is the biggest prize in English football. The six teams joining the Super League have realised that six doesn't go into four - two miss out every year. Not any more. An insider at the Super League admitted that the plan will seriously dilute the value of the Premier League as a product - the race which is one of its key attractions will be meaningless. We have been down this road before and the former Premier League chief executive suggested that the pandemic had provided a window of opportunity for a very radical proposal that would not have a chance of succeeding in normal times. ""There is a cynical opportunism to this,"" he said. ""They realise that things are chaotic right now and that in many ways - anything goes."" But he added: ""Football is about two groups of people. Players and fans. You upset them at your peril. ""If fans decide to boycott the matches, that will be a financial disaster, and if Fifa threatens to ban participating players from representing their country in the World Cup - they won't go for it.""

"Man City start withdrawal process from European Super League Other five Premier League clubs to withdraw Ed Woodward to resign as executive vice chairman at Man Utd Premier League's 'big six' had agreed to join the breakaway league Get Involved: #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only) Callum Matthews and Luke Reddy Let's end tonight with some Bobby Robson. A lot of fans have worried about the step their club was taking or what kind of environment their club would be left in. Fans, pundits, managers, former players, current players, politicians, celebrities, journalists and many, many more have raged against a new dawn. Why do people care so much? Over to the late Sir Bobby Robson... âWhat is a club in any case? Not the buildings or the directors or the people who are paid to represent it. Itâs not the television contracts, get-out clauses, marketing departments or executive boxes. Itâs the noise, the passion, the feeling of belonging, the pride in your city. Itâs a small boy clambering up stadium steps for the very first time, gripping his fatherâs hand, gawping at that hallowed stretch of turf beneath him and, without being able to do a thing about it, falling in love.â Goodnight. Right then, it's been lively has it not? Every now and again a story comes up that just kicks on to another level. This one is comfortably filed in the 'cling on during the carnage' folder. Let's boil it down nice and simple: - Man Utd will need a new executive vice chairman as Ed Woodward is leaving.More on that here. - There were 12 teams proposing a European Super League break away. After 48 hours we are down to six and none of them are from England as Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester City and Chelsea are all no longer getting involved.More on that here.

Well, there is also the Women's Super League... but let's not let the detail get in the way of a cheeky tweet from Fenerbahce midfielder Mesut Ozil. There is quite a lot of frustration on Twitter regarding Liverpool's statement on no longer participating in the European Super League. The club kept it short and sweet and some are pointing to a lack of apology or compassion. Sky Sports' Vinny O'Connor and The Athletic's James Pearce are among those pointing to the statement.

You know I'd not leave you hanging like that. What have you missed on this night of nights? - A protest at Chelsea where even Petr Cech featured (this actually happened) - Chelsea's acknowledgment they would withdraw from the European Super League (cue goal-like celebrations. That was a good thing because Chelsea later drew 0-0 with Brighton) - Manchester City went all in and said they were done with the idea of an ESL and were pulling out. That left four English clubs in the mix. - Ed Woodward resigned at Manchester United and he'll depart at the end of the season. - Liverpool's players started tweeting their dislike for the European Super League - Liverpool, Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United all pulled out at around 23:00 BST. - There have been supporting roles on this fine evening from Boris Johnson, Conor McGregor, Gary Neville, Luke Shaw, the list goes on. Some evening friends. Right, so you've spent the night catching up on Line of Duty and an Only Fools and Horses box set. What have you missed? Too much for me to describe. So we're moving on. Tweet us on #bbcfootball The Other Brian:So all the England based teams have cut and run... they are very sorry, they made a mistake!

Its all good then, no problem, don't worry about it, I'm sure us fans will have completely forgotten about the total contempt you have shown towards us, by the weekend. :-) Allow Twitter content?

Chairman Daniel Levy said: âWe regret the anxiety and upset caused by the ESL proposal. We felt it was important that our club participated in the development of a possible new structure that sought to better ensure financial fair play and financial sustainability whilst delivering significantly increased support for the wider football pyramid. âWe believe that we should never stand still and that the sport should constantly review competitions and governance to ensure the game we all love continues to evolve and excite fans around the world. âWe should like to thank all those supporters who presented their considered opinions.â Allow Twitter content?

Arsenal The last few days have shown us yet again the depth of feeling our supporters around the world have for this great club and the game we love. We needed no reminding of this but the response from supporters in recent days has given us time for further reflection and deep thought. It was never our intention to cause such distress, however when the invitation to join the Super League came, while knowing there were no guarantees, we did not want to be left behind to ensure we protected Arsenal and its future. As a result of listening to you and the wider football community over recent days we are withdrawing from the proposed Super League. We made a mistake, and we apologise for it. We know it will take time to restore your faith in what we are trying to achieve here at Arsenal but let us be clear that the decision to be part of the Super League was driven by our desire to protect Arsenal, the club you love, and to support the game you love through greater solidarity and financial stability. Stability is essential for the game to prosper and we will continue to strive to bring the security the game needs to move forward. The system needs to be fixed. We must work together to find solutions which protect the future of the game and harness the extraordinary power football has to get us on the edge of our seats. Finally, we know this has been hugely unsettling at the end of what has been an incredibly difficult year for us all. Our aim is always to make the right decisions for this great football club, to protect it for the future and to take us forward. We didnât make the right decision here, which we fully accept. We have heard you. The Arsenal Board Simon StoneBBC Sport For three nights my plans have been shredded. I need to see the latest episode. We assume some of you may be celebrating?

"Younger people continue to bear the brunt of the jobs crisis amid widespread cuts in sectors such as hospitality, official figures show. In the year to March, 811,000 payroll jobs were lost in the UK, with under-35s accounting for 80% of these cuts. The data also showed the unemployment rate dipped to 4.9% in the three months to February - down from 5% previously. This was despite most of the UK being under strict lockdown rules for at least some of the period. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the jobs market ""remains subdued"", with five million people employed but still on furlough. Head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Surenâ¯Thiru, said:â¯ ""Unemployment remains on course to peak towards the end of 2021, once the furlough scheme expires and those who stopped job hunting during the pandemic look to return to the workforce as restrictions ease. ""Although the furlough scheme will limit the peak in job losses, the longer-term structural unemployment caused by Covid-19, particularly among young people, may mean that the road back to pre-pandemic levels lags behind the wider economic recovery."" 'Finding work feels impossible for my generation' Overall, some 1.67 million people were unemployed between December and February. That is down 50,000 on the previous quarter but still 311,000 higher than a year ago. But the ONS said younger people,externalwere suffering disproportionately, as sectors such as retail and hospitality were hit hard by the crisis. People aged under 35 accounted for 635,000 payroll jobs lost in the year to March, with 436,000 of those positions held by people under 25. Gerwyn Davies, senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, said the number of young people in employment had hit a ""post-pandemic low"". ""This reinforces the urgent case for apprenticeship incentives to be made more generous and targeted specifically at 18-24 year-olds. It also underlines the need to improve employers' awareness of traineeships and the Kickstart [work placement] Scheme."" It would be wrong to get carried away with the pleasant surprise of a dip in the official unemployment rate below 5%. The real pandemic picture is in the tax data for March. 813,000 fewer payrolls on the PAYE system versus a year ago, and four fifths of those jobs were lost to under 35s. But the fact that the numbers in the first few months have been broadly stable is definitely a source of relief. Employers were able to navigate the second lockdown without widespread further job losses, thanks to the extension of support schemes such as furlough. This provides a more solid basis than might have been expected for the phased reopening of the economy. There will be strains, especially as support is phased out in late summer. But these figures offer hope of a lower peak to unemployment, perhaps at around 6%, than had been expected. The ONS said the overall jobs market had been ""broadly stable"" in recent months after the major shock of last spring, when where the economy contracted sharply. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said the labour market ""remains subdued"" but that there were positive signs. ""With the prospect of businesses reopening, there was a marked rise in job vacancies in March, especially in sectors such as hospitality."" The Bank of England expects an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures are eased and government support for jobs continues. But it says the recovery still depends on the ""evolution of the pandemic"". Hannah Audino, an economist at PwC, said the stabilisation of the jobs market during the third national lockdown boded well for the UK economy. ""We expect a gradual recovery in the labour market in the coming months with the reopening of hospitality and retail, provided the government's roadmap to reopening the economy continues to go to plan.""

"PM Boris Johnson announces new taskforce to find ""promising new medicines"" to treat Covid by autumn He tells a Downing Street briefing it is hoped people will be able to take a pill or tablet at home to ""stop the virus in its tracks"" The number of people from ethnic minorities taking vaccine has tripled compared with the national average, says Dr Nikki Kanani from NHS England The PM says India has been placed on the UK's travel red list on a ""purely precautionary basis"" and the new Indian variant is ""still under investigation"" EU drugs regulator says blood clots should be listed as a ""very rare"" side effect of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine Scotland's first minister confirms the most significant changes to the nation's Covid restrictions since it went back into lockdown just after Christmas Pubs, restaurants, gyms and non-essential shops will reopen on Monday We're bringing our live coverage to a close now. We'll be back on Wednesday morning with more developments. The page was written by Ella Wills, Katie Wright, David Walker, Alex Kleiderman, Joseph Lee, Penny Spiller and Richard Morris, and edited by Marie Jackson. Pubs in Wales and Scotland will start serving customers alcohol outdoors again in the coming days, it was confirmed on Tuesday We're going to bring our live coverage of the Covid pandemic to an end shortly. But first, here's are some of the main UK stories we've been covering today: Here is a
round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories we have been covering around the world: The 22-year-old organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate in Nottingham city centre A 22-year-old man has been fined Â£10,000 for organisinga 90-person illegal partyin Nottinghamshire, England. Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape. The organiser's fine will be reduced to half if paid within two weeks, and if it is not paid, he will face a court appearance, the force said. A man who has helped bury dozens of Muslims who died with Covid-19 in one of England's worst-affected towns has spoken about the daily pressures of his role. Imran Patel, who is a volunteer at Blackburn Muslim Burial Society, has helped with 340 interments in the last 12 months, of which 200 were for people who had died with coronavirus. This video can not be played Reality Check There are currently not enough vaccines for India's vast population As we reported earlier, India haspledged to offer alladults over the age of 18a coronavirus vaccine from 1 May in a bid to stem a
severe second wave of the virus. However, domestic vaccine makers are struggling to meet
demand both at home and globally. The government has offered financial assistance to two
vaccine makers - the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech - and halted
large exports of vaccines in a bid to help boost local production. But will it be enough?Read more about the situation here. Yogita LimayeBBC India correspondent Many families are losing loved ones to the coronavirus More than 99% of all intensive care beds are full in Indiaâs
capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral
rituals as crematoriums and graveyards are running out of manpower and space. In smaller towns the situation is even worse. A sharp surge
in cases and deaths is being reported from many parts of India. Some areas are
now in lockdown. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about
decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the
Joint Biosecurity Centre, the JBC, they look at the issue and will make their
determination based on what they think we need to doâ. Asked about yesterdayâs decision to put India on the red list
he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here. Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC.

"PM Boris Johnson announces new taskforce to find ""promising new medicines"" to treat Covid by autumn He tells a Downing Street briefing it is hoped people will be able to take a pill or tablet at home to ""stop the virus in its tracks"" The number of people from ethnic minorities taking vaccine has tripled compared with the national average, says Dr Nikki Kanani from NHS England The PM says India has been placed on the UK's travel red list on a ""purely precautionary basis"" and the new Indian variant is ""still under investigation"" EU drugs regulator says blood clots should be listed as a ""very rare"" side effect of the Johnson & Johnson Covid vaccine Scotland's first minister confirms the most significant changes to the nation's Covid restrictions since it went back into lockdown just after Christmas Pubs, restaurants, gyms and non-essential shops will reopen on Monday We're bringing our live coverage to a close now. We'll be back on Wednesday morning with more developments. The page was written by Ella Wills, Katie Wright, David Walker, Alex Kleiderman, Joseph Lee, Penny Spiller and Richard Morris, and edited by Marie Jackson. Pubs in Wales and Scotland will start serving customers alcohol outdoors again in the coming days, it was confirmed on Tuesday We're going to bring our live coverage of the Covid pandemic to an end shortly. But first, here's are some of the main UK stories we've been covering today: Here is a
round-up of some of the main coronavirus stories we have been covering around the world: The 22-year-old organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate in Nottingham city centre A 22-year-old man has been fined Â£10,000 for organisinga 90-person illegal partyin Nottinghamshire, England. Partygoers were found hiding in a laundry room, bathrooms and lifts when police broke up the event in the early hours of 10 April. The organiser is believed to have booked a venue on Pilcher Gate, in Nottingham city centre, using an online booking agency, Nottinghamshire Police said. The force added that ""astonished"" officers also saw people running into the basement, with some trying to leave through a fire escape. The organiser's fine will be reduced to half if paid within two weeks, and if it is not paid, he will face a court appearance, the force said. A man who has helped bury dozens of Muslims who died with Covid-19 in one of England's worst-affected towns has spoken about the daily pressures of his role. Imran Patel, who is a volunteer at Blackburn Muslim Burial Society, has helped with 340 interments in the last 12 months, of which 200 were for people who had died with coronavirus. This video can not be played Reality Check There are currently not enough vaccines for India's vast population As we reported earlier, India haspledged to offer alladults over the age of 18a coronavirus vaccine from 1 May in a bid to stem a
severe second wave of the virus. However, domestic vaccine makers are struggling to meet
demand both at home and globally. The government has offered financial assistance to two
vaccine makers - the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech - and halted
large exports of vaccines in a bid to help boost local production. But will it be enough?Read more about the situation here. Yogita LimayeBBC India correspondent Many families are losing loved ones to the coronavirus More than 99% of all intensive care beds are full in Indiaâs
capital Delhi as the country battles its second wave of Covid-19. Just seven beds with ventilator facilities are
available. There is also a severe oxygen crisis in the city as well with just a few hours of supplies left in some hospitals, according to the government. Delhi is known to have among the best healthcare
facilities in India, but it has been brought to its knees by the pandemic. People are going from hospital to hospital, desperately searching for any help
for their loved ones. Many have died because they couldnât get the treatment
they need. Their families are having to wait for hours to perform funeral
rituals as crematoriums and graveyards are running out of manpower and space. In smaller towns the situation is even worse. A sharp surge
in cases and deaths is being reported from many parts of India. Some areas are
now in lockdown. Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked about
decisions about which countries should go on the âred listâ of countries
subject to the strictest UK travel rules. He
said the list was kept under constant review âand
this work is done actually not by the government itself, it is done by the
Joint Biosecurity Centre, the JBC, they look at the issue and will make their
determination based on what they think we need to doâ. Asked about yesterdayâs decision to put India on the red list
he said that decision âwas taken by the JBCâ. The government has previously been clear that decisions on
travel restrictions are made by ministers based on advice from the JBC and
other groups. Indeed, when Reality Check asked yesterday about why it had
taken so long to put India on the red list, the Department of Health said
decisions were taken by ministers informed by evidence from the JBC and others. You canread more about the decision on India here. Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent Given the scale of reaction so far, itâs hardly surprising that the PM was asked about football and his hopes to stop the establishment of a European Super League. Boris Johnsonâs description of the ESL as a âkind of cartelâ was far from diplomatic, and reinforces his opposition to the plans involving six Premier League clubs. By taking such a strong stance, the PM will be aware that the ESL going ahead in its current form could end up being regarded as a political failure. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Scientists hope to find more treatments to be used against Covid, following on from the discovery Dexamethasone helped patients The decision to set up an antiviral taskforce reflects the
desire to make progress in finding treatments people can take at home if they
have tested positive or been exposed to someone who has. Through theRecovery trial,externalrun in hospitals, the UK has been
at the forefront of developing treatments for people who are already severely
ill. But this focus is aimed at identifying medicines that could
help prevent people getting ill. There are thought to be a number of treatments that are
being looked at that work by stopping the virus replicating and making someone
very ill. As Prime Minister Boris Johnson acknowledged, there will be
a future wave of infection even though the scale of it will be limited by the
rollout of the vaccines. When it comes, the hope is the antivirals will offer another
tool with which to fight it. It is all part, the PM says, of learning to live with the
virus. But at the moment this is just an aspiration rather than a
guarantee of something.  Responding to the government briefing, Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the prime minister had been ""missing the point"" in his response to questions about the red list. He tells the BBC that the list of countries where people need to quarantine in hotels is ""far too narrowly drawn"". Only 1% of the 20,000 people arriving daily have to do hotel quarantine, Norris says. ""The prime minister has said the majority of scientists believe there will be another wave of Covid,"" he says. ""We still have gaping holes at the border and our defences, as a result, are weakened."" He says Labour wants to see a presumption that all travellers will quarantine in hotels unless there is a good reason not to - such as for hauliers or countries will extremely low levels of the virus. The Huffington Post's Paul Waugh says the UK has set out a new legally binding target to cut carbon emissions, and he asks if this means there won't be a third runway at Heathrow. On Greensill lobbying, he asks if rules politicians are supposed to follow ""have any teeth or relevance anymore"". He asks if he agrees with the Independent Office for Police Conduct that reviewed Boris Johnson's links with Jennifer Arcuri, and concluded that Johnson should have declared being in a relationship with Arcuri. He asks if the PM thinks he acted with ""honesty and integrity"" during the affair. On carbon emissions, Johnson says it's a matter for Heathrow to deal with, ""it's a private matter and they've got to finance it... my own views about that particular matter are well known"". He says the UK can pioneer low carbon aviation. He says he wants to get to a ""jet zero world"" and the government is working with those in the industry to try and tackle the problem. Humanity will need to fly, and it will need to fly in a ""clean, green way"" he adds. On the second question, he says ""yes"". With that, he closes the press conference. The Guardian's Jessica Elgot asks if the verdict of the European Medicines' Agency that there is a ""possible link"" between the Johnson and Johnson vaccine and rare blood clots might delay the UK vaccine programme - particularly for younger people? But the prime minister says: ""Weâre confident in the security of our supply and we will be able to get done what weâve said we will do by the end of July."" Kanani says this vaccine is not in use in the UK at the moment and hasn't yet been approved. Johnson is also asked for his view on fan ownership of football clubs, as in Germany, given the Super League news. He says it's a matter for sports minister Tracey Crouch, who is conducting a review of football governance. He says ""sheâs very interested in those models"". Harry Cole from the Sun asks what the odds are of people being able to take part in summer holidays abroad. He also asks what the government plans to do if the European Super League goes ahead. Boris Johnson says he cannot yet give information on which countries will be allowed and which won't be. He says he cannot speculate on what will be announced for holidays on 17 May. He says he ""doesn't want to say very much more"" about what the government could do against football clubs. He says that one of his MPs is doing a ""full fan-based review"" of the sport. He says his priorities are to back the Football Association and the Premier League. Andy Bell from Channel 5 asks if Covid passports will be part of learning to live with the virus, with Michael Gove visiting Israel today to learn about the system in use there. Boris Johnson says a ""Covid status certification"" is being considered for the UK to help ""open up those things that proved very tough to open last year"". But he says they won't just record vaccine status, but will also show whether people have been recently tested or have natural immunity after being infected. ""People certainly donât need to think about it before 17 May,"" he says, however. He is also asked to say a few words to the billionaire football club owners considering a European Super League and says our football clubs are ""one of the great glories of our country's heritage"". He says he doesn't think it is right they should be turned into ""international brands and commodities"" without any reference to the fans. It's been the biggest story of the last few days, so it is not surprising that the the PM is also being asked about the plans for six English football clubs to be part of a European Super League. Boris Johnson reiterates the government opposes the move and says ministers' first step has been to back the football authorities in England - the FA and Premier League - in rejecting the plans. He says the ESL is ""not in the interests of fans, not in the interests of football"". ""How it can be right to have a situation in which you create a kind of cartel,"" the PM said, adding it is ""offends against the basic principles of competition"". If necessary, he adds, the UK will seek a ""legislative solution"" but he hopes the football authorities can find a way forward themselves. The prime minister has denied that the UK's new antivirals taskforce that is aiming to help identify new medicines for the treatment of Covid is a ""hugely ambitious"" project. Responding to a question from ITV's Emily Morgan, Boris Johnson described it as a further ""shots in our locker"" following British scientists' discovery that existing drugs such as dexamethasone  could be effective against Covid. Nikita Kanani, medical director of primary care for NHS England, told the Downing Street briefing the project was an important way of helping to manage a rise in new infections and variants. She said the NHS has been working with international partners and a number of treatments were already being tested.  Greg DawsonBBC political correspondent With
the establishment of an anti-virals taskforce the government will be hoping to
repeat the success of the UK Vaccine Taskforce, which is widely credited for
the scale and success of the vaccination rollout so far. However,
the very fact such a taskforce is being created serves as a reminder that
concerns remain over the potential for new vaccine-resistant variants and the
need to find other ways to protect people so that society can continue its path
back to normality. The BBC's Vicki Young asks why it's taken so long to put India on the travel red list following the Indian variant that has emerged in the country. She also asks if Boris Johnson is prepared to make the ""difficult and unpopular"" decisions to meet new carbon targets unveiled by government. Johnson says the Indian variant is still ""under investigation"". He says banning travel to the country is on a ""purely precautionary basis"" but there were already measures for people coming from India which were ""very tough indeed"". There are slightly over 100 Indian variant cases in the UK, he says, and those people are having their contacts traced. There's also surge testing taking place in their local areas. On climate change, he says that since 1990 the UK has cut emissions by ""something like 42, 44%, and yet the economy has grown by 73%,"" he states he doesn't see ""any contradiction"" between green investment and jobs. He says he wants to see more ""high wage, high skill jobs"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking.",Negative,0.4347724
"Tensions are high in Minnesota this week as the jury in the trial of former police officer Derek Chauvin prepares to deliver its verdict. Mr Chauvin faces two counts of murder and one count of manslaughter over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, last May in Minneapolis. Protesters crowded the streets in Mr Floyd's name in cities across the US and around the world over the summer. The trial is being viewed as a referendum on policing in the US. An African-American political hopeful, a Minnesota resident and a retired police veteranshared their thoughts with the BBCwhen the trial began in late March. We reached out to them again and they told us what stood out to them over the past three weeks. A community activist, an entrepreneur and a father of two, Curtis went viral last year for his impassioned message about the generational injustices African Americans have suffered. He is now running for city council in his hometown of Charlotte. What did you make of the cases presented by each side? The state brought a very solid case, with very credible witnesses. I do believe the defence ""won"" a couple of days, but the prosecution held steady and remained strong throughout the whole case. At the end, the defence tried to throw a wrench in there with the opinion that carbon monoxide may have been a factor in Floyd's death. I feel like they were scrambling to convince the jury or give them some sense of doubt. Their case was basically speculation and opinion of what they think might have happened, and they never had hardcore facts. What moments stood out to you the most? When it comes to an officer of the law, one would think that the police protect police and any investigations they conduct are basically of themselves. Every moment when an officer of the law got up there and testified against Chauvin - that was a moment of great bravery, for themselves and for the departments that they serve. People wanted to see if the police chief and all these other officers were going to hold this man accountable for what he did, and I believe that all of those moments were very significant. Police in uniform said that the force was unnecessary and that's what Chauvin was on trial for: he killed this man for no reason. The jurors who will decide Derek Chauvin's fate What do you think the outcome of this trial will be? The evidence is there. The facts are there. The testimonies are there. Everything is there and we need to come out with a conviction for sure. I hope the jury is going to come back with the fastest verdict in history and find him guilty of the highest charges. Hopefully this is a teaching moment for police in America. It is time to protect and serve. Hopefully they start putting police in neighbourhoods that can actually police those neighbourhoods. A problem we are facing is that we are hiring police who have not had any interaction with individuals who live in these neighbourhoods and they don't know how to react or de-escalate or don't want to handle situations appropriately. Melissa is a mixed-race resident of the Minneapolis-St Paul area and a mother of two. With the trial unfolding in her backyard, she is keeping a close eye on it and hopes to see some accountability What did you make of the cases presented by each side? I think the state laid out a good case. They brought witnesses with details, and a lot of experts. They did a good job. And they faced a competent defence. This has been a fair trial, which is important, whether I agree with the defence or not. The defence tried to argue that their police officers became distracted by the bystanders, who they tried to portray as a threatening crowd. I imagined myself there and I didn't think they looked threatening. They looked extremely concerned, extremely upset and were pleading. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life Four facts that help explain anger at US policing What moments stood out to you the most? Listening to the testimony of the bystanders, understanding how desperate they were and ""calling the police on the police"" was very moving testimony for me. I keep thinking about the fire department EMT [paramedic] - the woman who wanted them to check for a pulse. She was desperate to provide medical care. It was painful to watch her testimony, but I have to say all of the witnesses are sticking in my memory. It's heart-breaking. The whole thing was heart-breaking last year. The testimony of the witnesses was very upsetting. The whole thing didn't have to happen. You feel a sense of hopelessness and helplessness because it's an overwhelming problem. What do you think the outcome of this trial will be? I think Derek Chauvin should be found guilty. He's got three different charges against him and I don't know the nuances of these different charges, but it's up to the jury to find the perfect charge to find him guilty. I still believe that if George Floyd had not encountered the police that day, he would still be alive, despite all his health issues and other stuff mentioned. I haven't talked to anybody who doesn't think the police were responsible for his death. There will be an outpouring of emotion in this community. A retired police lieutenant who spent 34 years on the force in two states, Randy trained law enforcement for over three decades and founded The Wounded Blue, a national organisation that assists injured and disabled officers. What did you make of the cases presented by each side? The cases presented the arguments as expected. It's pretty frustrating to be a police officer or a police veteran these days. It is guilt presumed before innocence, which is backwards to how the United States was established to be in its delivery of justice. Recruitment of officers is down, and is in crisis. Who would want to be a police officer under these conditions? Not many. What moments stood out to you the most? The testimony that George Floyd had no carotid artery damage was very compelling to me. This would indicate that he was not suffocated via the neck. And the evidence of the fentanyl in the back seat of the car was also an indicator that he was in fact on fentanyl as the autopsy showed. Fentanyl causes severe breathing difficulties. What do you think the outcome of this trial will be? It's difficult to predict, given the political correctness and extraordinary amount of pressure this jury is under. The unfortunate reality I think the country is facing is that anything short of first degree murder will bring riots.

"Younger people continue to bear the brunt of the jobs crisis amid widespread cuts in sectors such as hospitality, official figures show. In the year to March, 811,000 payroll jobs were lost in the UK, with under-35s accounting for 80% of these cuts. The data also showed the unemployment rate dipped to 4.9% in the three months to February - down from 5% previously. This was despite most of the UK being under strict lockdown rules for at least some of the period. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the jobs market ""remains subdued"", with five million people employed but still on furlough. Head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, Surenâ¯Thiru, said:â¯ ""Unemployment remains on course to peak towards the end of 2021, once the furlough scheme expires and those who stopped job hunting during the pandemic look to return to the workforce as restrictions ease. ""Although the furlough scheme will limit the peak in job losses, the longer-term structural unemployment caused by Covid-19, particularly among young people, may mean that the road back to pre-pandemic levels lags behind the wider economic recovery."" 'Finding work feels impossible for my generation' Overall, some 1.67 million people were unemployed between December and February. That is down 50,000 on the previous quarter but still 311,000 higher than a year ago. But the ONS said younger people,externalwere suffering disproportionately, as sectors such as retail and hospitality were hit hard by the crisis. People aged under 35 accounted for 635,000 payroll jobs lost in the year to March, with 436,000 of those positions held by people under 25. Gerwyn Davies, senior policy adviser at the Chartered Institute of Professional Development, said the number of young people in employment had hit a ""post-pandemic low"". ""This reinforces the urgent case for apprenticeship incentives to be made more generous and targeted specifically at 18-24 year-olds. It also underlines the need to improve employers' awareness of traineeships and the Kickstart [work placement] Scheme."" It would be wrong to get carried away with the pleasant surprise of a dip in the official unemployment rate below 5%. The real pandemic picture is in the tax data for March. 813,000 fewer payrolls on the PAYE system versus a year ago, and four fifths of those jobs were lost to under 35s. But the fact that the numbers in the first few months have been broadly stable is definitely a source of relief. Employers were able to navigate the second lockdown without widespread further job losses, thanks to the extension of support schemes such as furlough. This provides a more solid basis than might have been expected for the phased reopening of the economy. There will be strains, especially as support is phased out in late summer. But these figures offer hope of a lower peak to unemployment, perhaps at around 6%, than had been expected. The ONS said the overall jobs market had been ""broadly stable"" in recent months after the major shock of last spring, when where the economy contracted sharply. ONS director of economic statistics Darren Morgan said the labour market ""remains subdued"" but that there were positive signs. ""With the prospect of businesses reopening, there was a marked rise in job vacancies in March, especially in sectors such as hospitality."" The Bank of England expects an economic rebound this year, as lockdown measures are eased and government support for jobs continues. But it says the recovery still depends on the ""evolution of the pandemic"". Hannah Audino, an economist at PwC, said the stabilisation of the jobs market during the third national lockdown boded well for the UK economy. ""We expect a gradual recovery in the labour market in the coming months with the reopening of hospitality and retail, provided the government's roadmap to reopening the economy continues to go to plan.""

"Walter Mondale was the first major US party presidential candidate to pick a female running mate Former US Vice-President Walter Mondale has died in Minneapolis on Monday aged 93, his family has announced. Mr Mondale was Jimmy Carter's running mate for his winning 1976 presidential bid and defeat four years later. Mr Carter said he considered Mr Mondale the ""best vice-president in our country's history"". Mr Mondale lost heavily to Ronald Reagan in the 1984 presidential election, securing only his home state of Minnesota and Washington DC. That gave him 13 electoral votes compared with President Reagan's record-high tally of 525. Mr Mondale is also remembered for choosing Geraldine Ferraro of New York as his running mate - the first woman on a major-party presidential ticket. In a statement, Mr Carter said he was ""an invaluable partner and an able servant of the people of Minnesota, the United States and the world"". ""Rosalynn and I join all Americans in giving thanks for his exemplary life, and we extend our deepest condolences to his family,"" he added. Jimmy Carter (2nd left) and Walter Mondale (3rd left) at New York's Madison Square Gardens in 1976 Meanwhile, President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden said in a statement that they ""were able to call one of our nation's most dedicated patriots and public servants a dear friend and mentor"". ""Jill and I had the opportunity to speak to Fritz and his family over the weekend, to reflect on the years of friendship we shared, and how much we learned from and leaned on each other."" Mr Mondale's family earlier said in a statement: ""It is with profound sadness that we share news that our beloved dad passed away."" The family paid tribute to his achievements in housing, civil rights and environmental policy. They said plans for memorials in both Minnesota and Washington DC would be announced later.

"This video can not be played Players not to blame for Super League - Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp Jurgen Klopp is determined to remain Liverpool boss and ""help sort it"" after reiterating his opposition to the European Super League. The Reds are one of 12 clubs toagree to join the breakaway competition. In 2019 Klopp saidhe hoped there would never be a Super League,externaland before the1-1 Premier League draw with Leedshe confirmed his opinion had not changed. ""I heard I will resign. If times get tough it makes me even more sticky that I will stay,"" he said after the game. Super League created to save football, says Real president Perez Monday Night Club on the European Super League Reds vice-captain James Milner was even more critical of the new tournament - which has threatened to cause a schism in football. ""I don't like it one bit and hopefully it doesn't happen,"" he told BBC Sport. ""It [the current system] has worked well for a long time. What has made it special, what we have done over the last few years, is we have earned the right to win the Champions League and the Premier League. The product we have currently is very good. ""It is difficult. Coming into the game today Leeds fans were making their feelings shown. As players we don't really have a say so it feels a bit unjust."" Former England captain Alan Shearer said it was unfair for Klopp to have to address the ESL and end up in an awkward situation. ""He doesn't want what his owners want and that is a really powerful voice,"" Shearer told BBC Breakfast. ""Where are these owners? Why don't they come out and tell us why they want a closed shop that no-one else can get into?""

Somebody has made a decision with the owners in world football that we don't know exactly why. ""We are here, we are the face of the club and arrived here and Leeds fans shouted at us as though we made the decision but we didn't. ""Gary Neville was talking about 'You'll Never Walk Alone'.

If times get tough it makes me even more sticky that I will stay,"" he said after the game. Super League created to save football, says Real president Perez Monday Night Club on the European Super League Reds vice-captain James Milner was even more critical of the new tournament - which has threatened to cause a schism in football. ""I don't like it one bit and hopefully it doesn't happen,"" he told BBC Sport. ""It [the current system] has worked well for a long time. What has made it special, what we have done over the last few years, is we have earned the right to win the Champions League and the Premier League. The product we have currently is very good. ""It is difficult. Coming into the game today Leeds fans were making their feelings shown. As players we don't really have a say so it feels a bit unjust."" Former England captain Alan Shearer said it was unfair for Klopp to have to address the ESL and end up in an awkward situation.

"This video can not be played Alan Shearer says the proposed European Super League is ""plain and simply wrong"" The government will take ""whatever action necessary"", including legislative options, to stop plans for a European Super League, No 10 says. Following the PM's meeting with the FA and Premier League officials, and fans' representatives, Downing Street said: ""No action is off the table."" The 12 founding members of the league faced a fierce backlash after unveiling proposals for a breakaway tournament. One of these, Real Madrid, insisted they were doing it to ""save football"". Club president Florentino Perez saidthe decision to create the new league was in part taken because ""young people are no longer interested"" in the game. He told a Spanish TV show: ""Audiences are decreasing and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt."" Latest reaction to the European Super League Why Super League makes financial sense for top clubs Klopp against ESL but will not quit Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new league? The president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, has warned players who play for teams in the ESL that they would be ""banned from the World Cup and the Euros"". But in a letter to Uefa and Fifa, seen by the BBC, lawyers for the ESL say they have filed injunctions to prevent player and club bans, saying they consider such actions to be ""unlawful"". An insider at the ESL said they had prepared themselves for a huge backlash, and thought they were on firm legal ground with respect to competition law. ""I think in the cold light of day, they are looking at this and the reality is dawning that this is happening and it's perfectly legal,"" they told the BBC. A Spanish court has temporarily blocked any attempt by Uefa or Fifa to ban clubs or players from leagues or competitions, in an interim ruling to prevent any bans before the legal basis of this can be tested. ESL insiders said ""this looks aggressive but we had to take defensive action in the face of threats from Uefa and Fifa - our hope is we can ultimately resolve this in negotiations"". This video can not be played European Super League chairman, Florentino Perez: ""We want to save football"" The 14 Premier League clubs not participating in the new venture ""unanimously and vigorously"" rejected the plans for the competition and are ""considering all actions available to prevent it from progressing"". A statement released on Tuesday said they ""call on those clubs involved in the proposed competition to cease their involvement immediately"". One of these, Everton, released a statementcriticising the ""preposterous arrogance"" of the clubs involved. Downing Street said the prime minister told his meeting with FA and Premier League officials that the government ""will not stand by while a small handful of owners create a closed shop"". Boris Johnson reiterated his ""unwavering support for the football authorities and confirmed they have the government's full backing to take whatever action necessary to put a stop to these plans"", a statement said. He also made it clear ""that no action is off the table and the government is exploring every possibility, including legislative options, to ensure these proposals are stopped"". The prime minister's official spokesman said among the measures under consideration were preventing players of the clubs involved getting work visas and the withdrawal of police funding for match days. This video can not be played 'Football is meant to be on merit' - fans react to European Super League proposals Chief executive of the Football Supporters' Association, Kevin Miles, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""The mood music from the government was they would do what was required to make sure that the measures to exclude those [ESL] clubs from competitions would not fall foul of competition law, and that they would amend the law if necessary."" UK watchdog the Competition and Markets Authority said it would be ""carefully considering any competition aspects of these proposals"". The proposed league has united MPs from every party against it. Suggestions from MPs on action the government could take include governance reform, changes to competition law, changes to taxpayer support for clubs and border controls on arrivals into the UK. The Arsenal Supporters' Trust said it was ""delighted"" to hear the government's promise of action, adding that the PM vowed the football governance review led by Conservative MP and former sports minister Tracey Crouch would be ""swift"". There have been protests by fans across the country against the proposed league, including outside Chelsea's Stamford Bridge ground on Tuesday. Fans burn a Liverpool replica shirt outside Elland Road against Liverpool's decision to be included in the European Super League Six English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - have signed up to the league. They would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan. The competition would have 20 teams and another five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition. Matches would take place midweek in an attempt to have more matches between the big-name clubs and rival the existing Champions League. The plans revealed on Sunday that the 12 founding football clubs would be permanent members and never face relegation. Critics say the new league could supplant the existing Champions League and disrupt the current football ""pyramid"" that sees teams rise or fall on merit. Read morehere. Former England captain Alan Shearer told BBC Breakfast the six English clubs should be expelled from the Premier League, which they have said they aim to remain in while also playing in the European Super League. ""It's not right what they are doing, it's not competitive, it's a closed shop - you can't have a competition where no one else is allowed in,"" he said. ""You can hear, feel and see the anger from almost everyone in football."" Chairman of the Commons' Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee Julian Knight, said restricting work visas for footballers who play in the proposed ESL could be one way the government could pull levers to stop the league going ahead. Speaking to the BBC, he said other options were a windfall tax on clubs and long-term reform giving fans much greater power on football club boards. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he thought the ""threat of legislation will have an effect"" but the government needed to act quickly. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey called for ""real action"" from the government, suggesting a new law requiring owners to ballot season ticket holders before committing clubs to newly formed competitions. And on Monday, the Duke of Cambridge, who is president of the Football Association, said he shared fans' concerns about ""the damage it risks causing to the game we love"". Gianni Infantino, president of the world football's governing body Fifa, said he ""strongly disapproves"" of the plans. ""If some elect to go their own way, they must live with the consequences of their choice. They are responsible for their choice completely. This means you are either in or you are out. You cannot be half in and half out."" Sky Sports confirmed it had ""not been involved in any discussions"" about the breakaway league.

"Plans for a new football European Super League (ESL) have collapsed, following the withdrawal of most of the teams involved. The decision follows a massive backlash against the league, which had the support of some of the world's biggest clubs. Six English Premier League teams had signed up to the ESL - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham. They joined AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Barcelona, Inter Milan, Juventus and Real Madrid as founder members. The idea was for the clubs to remain in their national leagues, but also to play each other in a new midweek European competition, which would have rivalled the Champions League. The ESL would have had 20 teams, of which 15 founding members would be permanent and never face relegation. Five other sides would qualify each year. All six English Premier League clubs dropped out of the project on Tuesday night. They have now been followed by Atletico Madrid in Spain and Italian team Inter Milan. One of the chief movers behind the ESL, Juventus chairman Andrea Agnelli, has now admitted that the ESL is not likely to go ahead. ""I remain convinced of the beauty of that project,"" he said. ""But evidently no, I don't think that project is now still up and running."" ESL 'cannot now proceed' How football's volatile 72 hours unfolded With 15 teams in the ESL not facing qualification or relegation, critics said it would have devalued the game because it was unfair and uncompetitive. For instance, Arsenal have not qualified for the Champions League since the 2016-17 season, but they would have been guaranteed a place - regardless of how they performed in the domestic league. However, a future winner of the Premier League would not necessarily have qualified for the ESL if they were not a permanent member. If this were the case, that team would miss out on millions of pounds in revenue. The ESL attracted widespread criticism from pundits, players, MPs and most football bodies not involved. Fans of the clubs involved held several protests outside their grounds. Chelsea fans protest against plans for a European Super League ahead of the club's game against Brighton It appears they were taken aback by the strength of criticism. Arsenal apologised in an open letter to their fans and said they had ""made a mistake"", adding they were withdrawing after listening to supporters and the ""wider football community"". Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said the club regretted the ""anxiety and upset"" caused by the proposal. Manchester United said they had ""listened carefully to the reaction from our fans, the UK government and other key stakeholders,"" in making their decision. Real Madrid president Florentino Perezhad claimed it would ""save football"", at a time when young people are ""no longer interested"" because of ""a lot of poor quality games"". The founding clubs were promised a share of a â¬3.5bn (Â£3bn) grant, provided by investment bank JP Morgan. Most are in considerable debt,made worse by the Covid pandemic, due to disrupted fixtures and a lack of spectators. Big clubs also have superstar players with multi-million pound salaries. If they could guarantee taking part in a major European football competition every year, they would have become more valuable and stable businesses. Super League makes financial sense for top clubs The 20-team league would have been split into two groups of 10, playing each other at home and away. The top three in each group would have qualified for the quarter-finals, with the fourth and fifth-placed teams competing in a two-legged play-off for the two remaining spots. It would then have the same two-leg knockout format used in the Champions League, with a final in May. The president of Uefa (the Union of European Football Associations), Aleksander Ceferin, had warned that participating clubs could be banned from European competition, and their players prevented from appearing at the Euros and the World Cup. Mr Ceferin welcomed the English clubs' reversal, saying, ""the important thing now is that we move on, rebuild the unity that the game enjoyed before this, and move forward together"".

"Streets in Soho, London, were packed as pubs were allowed to open outdoors in England on Monday Reopening pubs too soon could run the risk of ""undoing all the good"" during lockdown, an infectious disease expert has said. Beer gardens reopened in England on Monday, but in Wales industry experts have expressed frustration they cannot open until 26 April. Dr Mike Tildesley said it was important lockdown was eased gradually to stop a spike in coronavirus cases. The Welsh government said it was taking ""a careful step-by-step approach"". England 'buzzing' after first night out in 97 days Early queues as Wales' shops reopen after lockdown Q&A: What are the new Covid travel rules in Wales? Dr Tildesley, who is part of a modelling group which advises the UK government on the pandemic, said he understood people were ""frustrated"" at the different timetables out of lockdown. However, he said a cautious approach was needed for the next few weeks to prevent a third wave, in the hope ""we can get back to normal by summer"". ""We need to remember that these are paced at a rate that the vaccinations can keep up with us and can help us along the way,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. More than half the people in Waleshave now had their first Covid-19 vaccination dose, and Covid admissions to hospitals in Wales have hit record low levels. Dr Tildesley said while things were moving in the right direction, scientists needed to monitor the impact of relaxing other restrictions on case rates, before reopening other parts of life. This video can not be played Stores in Wales reopen to queues of eager shoppers On Monday shoppers queued as non-essential shopsreopened in Wales for the first time since they were forced to close in the run-up to Christmas. ""The key thing is we need to take it at a gradual rate so we can ensure that we can reopen safely... we are doing well, but if we go too fast we run the risk of too much mixing, and undoing all the good we have done so far,"" he said. While he said cases could go up as people began mixing again and going back to their daily lives, the progress of the vaccine should help avoid a ""significant resurgence"". Dr Tildesley urged people to be cautious for a few more weeks, adding the biggest concern was that if there was a spoke in cases the virus could mutate. ""We are not quite out of the woods yet, in the not too distant future we will be in a position where we can meet people... and hug our friends and family again, but we are not there yet,"" he said. John Turner is landlord of a pub on the Wales-England border which means he is just a few minutes away from an open pub One landlord, whose pub is on the border said it was ""frustrating"" remaining closed until 26 April when outdoorhospitality opened on Monday in England. John Turner said two other pubs in his village - that are technically in England - had now reopened. But Mr Turner, who runs the Dolphin Inn, in Llanymynech, on the Powys-Shropshire border, said Wales was ""always two weeks behind England"" and he was anxious to open again. On Monday,the border reopened between Wales and Englandand people are now allowed to travel in both directions. Once in England, you can visit a pub or cafe garden with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households. However, some people have agreed with Dr Tildesley's view and expressed relief pubs remain closed in Wales. Garfield Doc Oakleeffe posted on Facebook: ""After seeing the footage of the lack of social distancing when drinking in Soho, I think slow and cautious is better."" Sian Louise said: ""I know it's horrible to not be open and I feel for businesses, I really do as I was getting annoyed with it all, but by looking how this last lockdown went and how it started I actually understand why [Mark Drakeford is] doing it slowly, because we don't want another lockdown and we don't want anymore people getting seriously ill either. ""Hopefully, in time we will come out better and safer by doing it gradually."" Michelle Murphy commented: ""I am so glad they are still closed. If this is what it is going to be like, no wonder they predict a third wave."" Kerry Lea Edwards did not understand the ""urgency to be back in the pub"", adding: ""If it's the social side you can meet outdoors in your garden with your friends and have a drink. ""Surely it's not worth the risk - we will be in another lockdown before we know it, very sad."" John Turner said he was looking forward to pubs opening after ""a year of being two weeks behind England"" Mr Turner said: ""The firebreak [lockdown] was going to be the saviour for Christmas and then I didn't even imagine we would miss out on Easter as well. ""An extra two weeks' trade will be lost once again to England."" He added that even when pubs in Wales can reopen, it could be a struggle only being able to serve outside because of ""the weather element"". While he has used some of his government support to put up a marquee, and purchase heaters and furniture, he said other pubs might not be able to keep up. He said he was anxious to make the money back to make the new equipment worthwhile. ""People are desperate to get to the pub. I am hopeful we will be full and I'm looking forward to being busy again because otherwise it will be harder and more disappointing,"" he said. Emma McClarkin said a lack of outdoor space was already a barrier to many pubs and bars Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association (WBPA), said pubs across Wales were ""hugely disappointed"" to not open on Monday alongside England. She said pubs in Wales having to wait another two weeks while pubs in England were trading outdoors was ""a bitter pill to swallow"". Ms McClarkin said: ""Vaccination rates continue to climb while case rates are falling week on week. Even when they will be allowed to open, we still think about 60% of pubs in Wales will be unable to because of a lack of usable outside space. ""The Welsh government need to recognise that and bring forward a package of funding as soon as possible that will prevent hundreds of Welsh pubs being lost for good."" In England, you can meet in a pub or cafe gardens with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households The Welsh government said it had provided more than Â£2bn of funding to support businesses impacted by the pandemic, safeguarding 165,000 Welsh jobs. A spokesperson said tourism and hospitality businesses would continue to receive cash grants this month to help them through until the reopening date in May. ""Businesses will therefore see no interruption in the flow of financial support, as we move cautiously to relax public health restrictions,"" they said. ""Another Â£200m in additional support for business has already been earmarked in the Final Budget 2021-22. ""Ministers have had a constructive meeting with representatives from the hospitality sector and Welsh government officials will work with them on options for a further support package to be put to the new government following May's Senedd election."" A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said many would question the decision not to move forward the reopening of beer gardens after scenes like those seen inCardiff Bay, where crowds gathered to drink over the bank holiday weekend. ""A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option,"" the spokesperson said. ""Likewise, the lack of clear date on indoor hospitality remains a major problem and at the very least the government should urgently revisit its decision to delay any additional financial support until after election."" Leader of the Welsh Conservative group Andrew RT Davies, said the Welsh government's decision was about politics not science, and lost trade meant ""lost livelihoods in Wales"". ""After a crippling 12 months for businesses, Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay seem to have a tin ear to these concerns. Welsh Conservatives would cut the border games, end the confusion, and get Wales on the road to recovery with a safe, consistent and one-nation approach,"" he said. The Welsh Liberal Democrats said: ""Lockdown is frustrating but we all need to stay safe and follow the regulations. ""If we do, we will not need to enter a lockdown again and that is the the most important thing. We've seen before what happened when lockdowns were eased too quickly.""

"Some income tax powers were devolved to ministers in Cardiff in 2019 The Welsh Conservatives have vowed to cut income tax if a target to create 65,000 new jobs is met by 2025. The party said it would cut the basic rate by 1% before the next Senedd election in five years time. It comes as the Tories launched their Senedd election manifesto in Wrexham. Pledges include an M4 relief road and ending business rates for small firms. Senedd group leader Andrew RT Davies said Wales needed a ""critical national mission"" for the economy. The Welsh Conservatives will be defending 11 seats when voters go to the polls on 6 May. It was the third-largest party at the previous Senedd election, but at the UK general election in December 2019 it gained six constituencies from Labour, giving the party the best result in Wales since the days of Margaret Thatcher. The party also promised to build five new or upgraded hospitals, 100,000 new homes and provide extra funding for the NHS every year. A Â£10 minimum wage for social care workers is pledged, Natural Resources Wales would be scrapped and Cardiff Airport sold off. Key points from Welsh Conservative manifesto WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage The Conservatives' manifesto says it would be the party's ""national mission"" to create 65,000 new jobs. The document says the party would cut the basic rate of tax once the new jobs had been created, but does not specify the size of a cut. A press release for the party says it would be a 1p cut in the Â£1 on the basic rate - currently a total of 20% for earnings between Â£12,571 and Â£50,270 a year. There were 2.1m basic rate taxpayers in 2020/21. Andrew RT Davies launched the manifesto at the JCB factory in Wrexham on Tuesday Asked how the tax cut would be funded, a party spokesman said: ""By having more people paying into the pot, we can reduce the amount of money everyone puts in, so that people can spend more money in their local economy, creating more jobs in return."" The policy suggests the Conservatives would make the tax cut in the last financial year before the next Senedd election in 2026, provided the jobs target is met. Manifesto pledges on tax include a freeze for council tax for at least the next two years, and cutting the Welsh version of stamp duty, called land transaction tax (LTT). The changes would mean first time buyers would not pay LTT, while the threshold for others would be raised to Â£250,000. No income tax rise 'at least' until recovery: Labour Who is Senedd Tory leader Andrew RT Davies? Since 2019 Welsh ministers have been able to vary income tax rates from those set by the UK government by up to 10p in the pound. This money, along with some other taxes collected in Wales and cash from Westminster, funds Welsh public services run from Cardiff. The income tax powers have so far not been used. Labour, which has been leading the Welsh government since the start of devolution, vowed at the last election not to raise taxes. In its manifesto this year the party changed tack, only ruling out a tax rise until the economy recovered from the impact of Covid. Guto Ifan from Cardiff University estimated that in 2025 a cut of 1p to the basic rate would cost around Â£220m. ""There are huge post-pandemic spending pressures and UK gov spending plans have already been reined back significantly. There are difficult trade-offs facing the next Welsh Government, and tax cuts will need to be balanced against these,"" hetweeted,external. WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.Find out more here. What powers does the Senedd have?MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. The manifesto commits to building the M4 relief road The Conservatives said they would invest Â£2bn to create modern infrastructure for Wales, including the M4 relief road which was scrapped by the Welsh government in 2019 and was then estimated to cost Â£1.6bn. The cash would also be used to upgrade the A55 and A40 and to create 20,000 charging points for electric vehicles. On Radio Wales Breakfast Mr Davies denied there was a contradiction between his road plans and the UK government's plans toaccelerate cuts in carbon emissions. ""The carbon engine is disappearing out of the transport system,"" he said, ""because by 2030 it will be illegal to sell petrol and diesel engines and they'll be phased out by 2035."" ""So we're moving to an environmentally friendly mode of transport here in Wales and indeed across the United Kingdom, and it's incumbent on any government to make sure we put that investment in the green infrastructure."" ""It's really important that we have a big sign that says open for business to people so that we can create these 65,000 jobs that ultimately would be rewarded with a tax cut at the end of the parliament,"" he said. He said 15,000 of the 65,000 jobs would be in ""green jobs"". ""Many of those jobs would be engineering jobs,"" he said, in installing charging points, and in ""developing green energy projects and concepts around Wales"". Other pledges include: boosting opportunities for workers hit hard by the pandemic with a Retrain, Gain programme to get people into key sectors supporting ""micro businesses"" by paying the National Insurance contributions of two new employees for two years setting up a new business development agency called Innovate Wales in north Wales The Conservatives are the only party in this election that is proposing cutting the Welsh rate of income tax. But it's actually less of a cut than what the party suggestedback in 2016, when Andrew RT Davies said the Tories would aim for cutting the basic rate by 2p. Tuesday's plan also depends on a rise in the number of jobs, and it's also not baked into the manifesto itself. It might be surprising how limited it is when Mr Davies had, years ago,sacked some of his frontbenchbecause they disagreed with the powers being devolved to do this. But it perhaps reflects how difficult it is in 2021 to promise tax cuts. Especially when Mr Davies' party colleagues at the other end of the M4 are suggesting the opposite,with a million more across the UK expectedto enter the basic tax bracket in the next five years.

"This video can not be played 'Football is meant to be on merit' - fans react to European Super League proposals The government has said it will do ""whatever it takes"" to prevent a breakaway European Super League involving six leading English clubs. Boris Johnson said ministers would be working to make sure the league did not go ahead in the way being proposed. The Duke of Cambridge also said he shared fans' concerns about ""the damage it risks causing to the game we love"". But the president of Real Madrid told a Spanish TV show: ""We are doing this to save football at this critical moment."" Florentino Perez, president of Real Madrid, said the decision to create the new league was in part taken because ""young people are no longer interested"" in the game. Speaking for the first time since the league was announced, Mr Perez said: ""Audiences are decreasing and rights are decreasing and something had to be done. We are all ruined. Television has to change so we can adapt."" The 12 founding members of the league, which includes Real Madrid plus three yet to join - would be permanent and never face relegation. Six English clubs - Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham - have signed up to the league They would join Spanish sides Atletico Madrid, Real Madrid and Barcelona and Italian clubs AC Milan, Juventus and Inter Milan. The competition would have 20 teams and another five sides would have to qualify each year for the competition. Matches would take place midweek and rival the existing Champions League. But the president of European football's governing body Uefa, Aleksander Ceferin, warnedplayers who play for teams in the ESL would be ""banned from the World Cup and the Euros"". European Super League Q&A - what happens next? Why are football's biggest clubs starting a new league? I'm disappointed and disgusted - Danny Murphy As opposition to the plans gathered momentum, Prince William, President of the Football Association, said in a tweet: ""Now, more than ever, we must protect the entire football community - from the top level to the grassroots - and the values of competition and fairness at its core."" And broadcaster Sky Sports said: ""We have not been involved in any discussions with the proposed breakaway European Super League."" ""We are completely focused on supporting our long term football partners in the UK and in Europe, already providing fans with the best live action from the best football competitions in the world,"" the company added. This video can not be played ""We will do whatever it takes to protect our national game"" â Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden In a statement to MPs in the House of Commons, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden criticised the so-called ""big six"" English clubs for going ""against the very spirit of the game"". He added club owners ""should remember that they are only temporary custodians of these clubs and that they forget fans at their peril"". Mr Dowden said he had spoken to Uefa and the Football Association, who both oppose the move by the 12 clubs, adding that, ""if they can't act, we will"". ""We will put everything on the table to prevent this from happening,"" he told MPs. ""We are examining every option from governance reform to competition law and mechanisms that allow football to take place. ""We will be reviewing everything Government does to support these clubs to play. We will do whatever it takes to protect our national game."" A fan-led review, due to take place after the pandemic, has been brought forward because of the ESL announcement, Mr Dowden said. It will be led by former sports minister Tracey Crouch and consider how fans can have an even greater say in the oversight of the game. The review will also look at the finances of the men's and women's game, its governance and whether an independent football regulator should be set up. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Super League ""not good for football"" Earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government was ""going to look at everything that we can do with the football authorities to make sure that this (plan) doesn't go ahead in the way that it's currently being proposed"". Downing Street said ministers were looking at a ""range of options"", including a German-style system of fan ownership of clubs and clawing back coronavirus support loans. But Labour urged ministers to do more, with shadow culture secretary Jo Stevens saying it was ""time for the government to get off the subs bench and show some leadership on the pitch because we need reform of football"". She added: ""It's not as if there's been a blockage here in Parliament preventing the government from taking action to sort the problems out."" About 700 fans gathered outside the ground and then dispersed before kick-off Fans and pundits have expressed revulsion at what they claim would be an unfair competition that would lock many teams out of top European football. Match of the Day host and former England footballer Gary Lineker said it was ""a time of great concern"", adding that if the ESL went ahead as planned, it would have ""massive ramifications"" on the domestic game. ""It will wreck the pyramid system (of leagues, promotion and relegation) that has been so important to local football clubs, communities and teams, and it takes out the competition."" Around 68% of football fans strongly oppose the creation of the ESL, while only 14% support it,according to a YouGov survey of 1,730 fans,external. Some 700 football supporters gathered outside Leeds United's Elland Road groundahead of the club's Premier League game against Liverpool to protest against the proposed new league. A Liverpool shirt was burned and a plane flew over the stadium displaying an anti-Super League message. Inside the stadium Leeds players wore T-shirts saying 'Earn it' next to the Champions League logo and 'Football is for the fans'. A banner behind one goal had the same message. This video can not be played Manchester United fan Natalie Burrell said she was 'disgusted' by the plans Launching their plan, the 12 founding members of the ESL said the pandemic had ""accelerated the instability in the existing European football economic model"". They said there was a ""need to provide higher-quality matches and additional financial resources for the overall football pyramid"". BBC's Sports Editor Dan Roan said leading figures were insisting the Super League would generate much more money, not just for the clubs involved, but for the rest of the ""football family"". He added they seemed ""very confident"" they were on a strong legal footing when it came to blocking any punishments threatened by bodies such as Uefa. Earlier, Manchester United's shares rose within minutes of the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, where they are traded. Fifteen minutes after the trading day began, they were up around 8.5%. Meanwhile, Juventus's share price jumped by more than 14% on Monday morning. But Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp hassaid he remained opposed to the idea of the league- despite his club agreeing to join it. ""I like the competitive aspect of football. I like that West Ham might play in the Champions League,"" he said, adding that he and his players did not know about the move before it happened.
