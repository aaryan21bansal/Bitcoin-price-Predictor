"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces stay at home rules in new lockdown Scots are to be ordered to stay at home amid a fresh Covid-19 lockdown which will see schools remain closed to pupils until February. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said new curbs would be introduced at midnight in a bid to contain the new, faster-spreading strain of the virus. New laws will require people to stay at home and work from home where possible. Outdoor gatherings are also to be cut back, with people only allowed to meet one person from one other household. Places of worship are to be closed, group exercise banned, and schools will largely operate via online and remote learning. These rules will apply across the Scottish mainland until at least the end of January, and will be kept under review. Island areas will remain in level three - but Ms Sturgeon said they would be monitored carefully. Live: Latest on Covid-19 in Scotland What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Prime Minister Boris Johnson later announcedsimilar lockdown measures for the whole of Englandwith all schools and colleges closing to most pupils until mid February. A further 1,905 new cases were reported in Scotland on Monday - with 15% of tests returning a positive result, something Ms Sturgeon said ""illustrates the severity and urgency of the situation"". The first minister said she was ""more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year"", with the new coronavirus strain now accounting for half of new cases. And she said a ""steeply rising trend of infections"" was threatening to put ""significant pressure"" on NHS services, saying hospitals could breach capacity within three to four weeks. The new rules - which will be put down in law - mean Scots will only be allowed to leave home for essential purposes, such as shopping for food and medicine, exercise and caring responsibilities. No limit is to be put on how many times people can go out to exercise, but outdoor meetings are to be limited to a maximum of two people from two households. Everyone who can work from home will be required to, and people in the ""shielding"" category are advised not to go in to work at all. The construction and manufacturing industries will remain open, but Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review. Places of worship are to close, the number of people who can attend weddings is to be cut to five, and funeral wakes will no longer be allowed. Schools are to remain closed to the majority of pupils until February, with Ms Sturgeon saying community transmission of the virus must be brought to a lower level amid concerns that the new variant of the virus spreads more easily among young people. She said she knew remote learning presented ""significant challenges"" for parents, teachers and pupils, adding: ""I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils are quickly as possible and then keep them open."" The first minister said she was considering whether teachers could be given the Covid-19 vaccine as a priority. More than 100,000 people have been given a first dose of the vaccine in Scotland, and the government expects to have access to just over 900,000 doses by the end of January. However Ms Sturgeon said the best way to get schools open again was to drive down transmission of the virus - urging Scots to abide by the rules. These are the toughest restrictions Scotland has faced since the lockdown of March 2020. It is - once again - becoming compulsory to stay at home except for essential purposes like food shopping, exercise and medical care. The extended closure of schools to most pupils is something the Scottish government was particularly keen to avoid. These decisions are a measure of how worried ministers are about the rapid spread of the new variant of coronavirus, which is fast becoming the dominant strain. With 225 cases per 100,000 people, Scotland is thought to be about four weeks behind London, which already has four times as many cases and NHS services under considerable pressure. The Scottish government believes that without further action the NHS here would run out of beds for Covid patients within a month. This new alert comes at the start of a new year which also brings new hope for a route out of the pandemic with two vaccines now beginning to offer protection. Around 100,000 doses have already been administered in Scotland but it is likely to take several months to reach all in the most vulnerable groups. The first minister said Scotland was now in ""a race between the vaccine and the virus"". She said: ""The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine. But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus. ""We can already see - by looking at infection rates in the south of England - some of what could happen here in Scotland. To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly. ""For government, that means introducing tough measures - as we have done today. And for all of us, it means sticking to the rules."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson raised concerns about online learning, saying it was vital that pupils had ""equal access to high-quality education"". And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers and working parents would need support to make the remote learning system work. Ms Sturgeon said her government had ""agonised"" over the decision on schools, and said the ""fundamental priority"" was to re-open them in full as soon as possible. She said: ""Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown."" The NHS has coped so far in Scotland - more so than many other parts of the UK. But in places like Glasgow and Lanarkshire it has been very, very tight. And here like everywhere else staff are bracing themselves for the post-Christmas effects of rising cases. The first minister gave some stark figures on hospital and ICU occupancy - suggesting we are just weeks away from reaching limits. There is so little give in the system they will be glad to see everything possible done to prevent stretched services being overwhelmed at a time when we are on our way to getting out the other side. There is real anxiety about what the next few weeks might bring. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces the third national lockdown Everyone in England must stay at home except for permitted reasons during a new coronavirus lockdown expected to last until mid-February, the PM says. All schools and colleges will close to most pupils and switch to remote learning from Tuesday. Boris Johnson warned the coming weeks would be the ""hardest yet"" amid surging cases and patient numbers. He said those in the top four priority groups would be offered a first vaccine dose by the middle of next month. All care home residents and their carers, everyone aged 70 and over, all frontline health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable will be offered one dose of a vaccine by mid-February. Scotland earlierissued a stay-at-home orderandWales said schools and colleges would shut until 18 Januaryfor most pupils. Schools in Northern Ireland will have an ""extended period of remote learning"",the Stormont Executive said. Schools to close and exams facing axe in England Kuenssberg: Much is an echo of March - but a lot is different too Speaking from Downing Street, Mr Johnson told the public to follow the new lockdown rules immediately, before they become law in the early hours of Wednesday. All the new measures in England will then last until at least the middle of February, he said, as anew more infectious variantof the virus spreads across the UK. The PM added that he believed the country was entering ""the last phase of the struggle"". Hospitals were under ""more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic"", he said. And he reiterated the slogan used earlier in the pandemic, urging people to immediately ""stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives"". People cannot leave their homesexcept for certain reasons, like the first lockdown last March These includeessential medical needs, food shopping, exerciseand work for those who cannot do so from home All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesdaywith remote learning until February half term Early years settings such asnurseries will stay open End-of-year examswill not take place this summer as normal Elsewhere,university students should not returnto campuses and will be taught online Restaurants can continue to offer food delivery, buttakeaway alcohol will be banned Outdoor sports venues - such asgolf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close Butoutdoor playgrounds will remain open Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such asPremier League footballcan continue On Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. A further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded. As of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. This is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high. Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be contacted by letter and should now shield once more, Mr Johnson said. Support and childcare bubbles will continue under the new measures - and people can meet one person from another household for outdoor exercise. Communal worship and life events like funerals and weddings can continue, subject to limits on attendance. While Mr Johnson said end-of-year exams would not take place as normal in the summer, he said alternative arrangements would be announced separately. The government haspublished a 22-page document,externaloutlining the new rules in detail. The House of Commons has been recalled to allow MPs to vote on the new restrictions on Wednesday. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his MPs would ""support the package of measures"", saying ""we've all got to pull together now to make this work"". Once again it is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. In England there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid since Christmas day. To put that into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled. Currently around three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease. In some hospitals it is more than six in 10. But what is worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to increase. In the spring it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak. The last six days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the UK - a number of these infections are next week's hospital admissions. It is why the UK's chief medical officers were warning there was a ""material risk"" of some hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change. Mr Johnson spoke after UK chief medical officers recommendedthe Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level. Level five means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement. NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a ""critical point"" and that ""immediate and decisive action"" was needed. Announcing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year."" For pupils who returned for their first day of the new term at primary school on Monday, it's turned out to be an extremely short-lived visit. Boris Johnson's announcement will see primary, secondary and further education colleges closed for at least the next six weeks, except for vulnerable and key workers' children. It's a much bigger shift in policy than had been anticipated, even a few days ago. Even the return date will depend on the progress in tackling the virus. ""I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term,"" said the prime minister. Keeping schools open was the government's most definite of red lines, a few weeks ago they were threatening councils that wanted to close them - but it's now been overtaken by the spiking lines on the Covid infection charts. Even after the chaos of last year's replacement grades, GCSEs and A-levels are being cancelled again - with a replacement system still to be decided. Vocational exams are to continue. For parents dreading home schooling, there are plans for it to be better supported this time - with more computer devices available and suggestions that Ofsted inspectors will check what schools are offering. But there's no escaping that this will feel like another sudden and chaotic change of direction for schools and parents. Mr Johnson's pledge on vaccinations comes after an 82-year-old retired maintenance manager became the first person in the UKto receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab Some 13.9 million people are among the four priority groups who will receive a vaccine dose by about 15 February, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said.

"Most pupils will be studying from home for the rest of this half term Schools and colleges in England are to be closed to most pupils until at least half term, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister said the new lockdown had to be ""tough enough"" to stop the variant virus from spreading - and teaching will go online. A-Levels and GCSEs will be cancelled, a government source confirmed to BBC News - although vocational exams will go ahead. The National Education Union accused the government of causing ""chaos"". In a television address, Mr Johnson announced the biggest changes to schools since the early days of the first lockdown in March. ""Because we now have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England must move to remote provision from tomorrow,"" said the prime minister. This means a return to online learning for pupils of all ages - apart from vulnerable children and the children of key workers who can continue to go into school. Primary schools went back today - and will then close again tomorrow ""We recognise that this will mean it's not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer, as normal,"" said Mr Johnson. It is understood that vocational exams will continue, but GCSEs and A-levels will be cancelled -  and that the exam watchdog Ofqual will make ""alternative arrangements"" for delivering results. New lockdown rules for England Thousands of primary pupils return to closed schools Scotland switches to remote learning Delay to schools opening in Wales An attempt to produce replacement exam grades last summer turned into one of the biggest U-turns of the pandemic. Teachers' unions accused the government of failing to react more swiftly to ""mounting evidence"" about Covid transmission in schools and to make preparations for remote teaching and alternatives to written exams. But Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union, said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had ""become an expert in putting his head in the sand"". Geoff Barton of the ASCL head teachers' union criticised ministers for having issued legal threats to keep schools open at the end of last term - and then ""made a series of chaotic announcements about the start of this term"". The new term, which began on Monday for primary pupils, has only lasted a day before it has been suspended. The prime minister said he hoped that schools would be ""reopening schools after the February half term"". There have been assurances that there will be a more thorough approach to home learning than in the first lockdown last year. The Department for Education has provided hundreds of thousands of computer devices - with the aim of supporting those without the equipment needed to work online from home. There have also been suggestions Ofsted inspectors will play a more active role in checking on what support schools are providing to pupils in their online learning. Universities in England had already planned a staggered return for this term - but there will now be even fewer students on campus this month. The latest lockdown guidance says university students who are taking hands-on courses such as medicine or veterinary science should return for face-to-face lessons as planned. These students will be expected to take two Covid tests or self-isolate for 10 days when they return.

"Assange pictured leaving court in January a year ago Wikileaks founder Julian Assange cannot be extradited to the United States, a court in London has ruled. The judge blocked the request because of concerns over Mr Assange's mental health and risk of suicide in the US. Mr Assange, who is wanted over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011, says the case is politically motivated. Expressing disappointment at the ruling, the US justice department noted that its legal arguments had prevailed. Profile: Julian Assange How the UK decides whether to extradite Assange Its position is that the leaks broke the law and endangered lives. ""While we are extremely disappointed in the court's ultimate decision, we are gratified that the United States prevailed on every point of law raised,"" the justice department said. The US authorities have 14 days in which to lodge an appeal and are expected to do so. Mr Assange appeared at the Old Bailey on Monday Mr Assange will now be taken back to Belmarsh Prison - where he is being held - and a full application for his bail will be made on Wednesday. His lawyer Ed Fitzgerald QC told the court there would be evidence to show Mr Assange would not abscond. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that while US prosecutors had met the tests for Mr Assange to be extradited for trial, the US was incapable of preventing him from attempting to take his own life. Outlining evidence of his self-harm and suicidal thoughts, she said: ""The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man fearful for his future."" She said: ""Faced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at HMP Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr Assange from finding a way to commit suicide and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm and I order his discharge."" Mr Assange's partner, lawyer Stella Moris, said ""today's victory is a first step towards justice"" Mr Assange, who wore a blue suit and green face mask in the dock, closed his eyes as the judge read out her ruling on Monday. His fiancee Stella Moris, with whom he has two young sons, wept and was comforted by Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson, who sat next to her in court. Speaking outside court after the ruling, she called on the US president to ""end this now"". ""Mr President, tear down these prison walls,"" she said. ""Let our little boys have their father. Free Julian, free the press, free us all."" This video can not be played Julian Assangeâs fiancÃ©e says she dreaded going public with their relationship District Judge Vanessa Baraitser explicitly concluded that Mr Assange should answer allegations that he aided and abetted hacking, theft and the disclosure of the identities of informants working for the US security agencies - disclosures that endangered their lives. In English law, that would be enough for him to be charged with a crime here - and so the route was open for Mr Assange to face trial for the same in the United States. But British extradition law also requires a judge to consider Mr Assange's health. And it's the effect of his possible detention in near-solitary confinement in a ""supermax"" prison that proved decisive. The US, in the judge's conclusion, can't stop a mentally unwell man taking his own life in those conditions. And so the legal requirement to treat Mr Assange humanely trumps the seriousness of the case that the judge acknowledges he should answer. When the US appeals - it'll have to convince more senior judges otherwise. If convicted in the US, Mr Assange faces a possible penalty of up to 175 years in jail, his lawyers have said. However the US government said the sentence was more likely to be between four and six years. Mr Assange faces an 18-count indictment from the US government, accusing him of conspiring to hack into US military databases to acquire sensitive secret information relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, which was then published on the Wikileaks website. He says the information exposed abuses by the US military. But US prosecutors say the leaks of classified material endangered lives, and so the US sought his extradition from the UK. Extradition is the process under which one country can ask another to hand over a suspect to face trial. Following the judgement, several politicians and organisations welcomed the news, although some expressed dismay that the ruling was made on health grounds: Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he had instructed his foreign minister to offer political asylum to Mr Assange who ""is a journalist and deserves a chance"" ""Good news Julian Assange's extradition has been blocked,"" saidUK Conservative MP David Davis on Twitter.,external""Extradition treaties should not be used for political prosecutions"" Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyncalled it,external""good news"" but said it was ""alarming that the judge has accepted US government arguments threatening freedom of speech and freedom to publish"" Supporters of Mr Assange gathered outside the Old Bailey on Monday Amnesty International welcomed the ruling but criticised the UK for ""having engaged in this politically-motivated process at the behest of the USA and putting media freedom and freedom of expression on trial"" The head of the National Union of Journalists, Michelle Stanistreet, said the outcome was ""the right one"" but the judgment contained ""much that is troubling"" Journalist and documentary maker John Pilger, who has been a vocal campaigner for Mr Assange,tweeted,externalthat it was ""wonderful"", adding the UK ruling was a ""face-saving cover for the British to justify their disgraceful political trial of Assange on America's behalf"" This video can not be played Julian Assange's father fears 'worried' son's extradition Mr Assange was jailed for 50 weeks in May 2019 for breaching his bail conditions after going into hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He sought refuge in the embassy for seven years from 2012 until he was arrested in April 2019. At the time he fled to the embassy, he had been facing extradition to Sweden on allegations of sexual assault which he denied. That case was later dropped.

"This video can not be played Olly Stephens was pronounced dead in Bugs Bottom fields in Emmer Green, Reading A school says its community has been left ""reeling"" after a 13-year-old boy was stabbed to death in Reading. Oliver Stephens, known as Olly, was pronounced dead at Bugs Bottom fields, Emmer Green, on Sunday. Four boys and a girl, all aged 13 or 14, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. They remain in custody. Highdown School and Sixth Form Centre head teacher Rachel Cave described the boy's death as a ""total tragedy"". In a statement, she said: ""This student was part of our community and many students and staff knew him well. ""Many have been deeply affected by this tragedy. ""In normal circumstances we would open the school and welcome in students for support before the start of the term. ""We are currently unable to do this, of course, but are arranging counselling support and will be establishing an electronic book of condolence."" Flowers have been left outside Highdown School Ms Cave said the school was ""a supportive and close-knit community"" which would ""work together over the coming days and weeks"". Det Supt Kevin Brown, of Thames Valley Police, said: ""Our thoughts remain with Olly's family at this incredibly difficult time."" He added: ""This is a tragic and shocking incident which has resulted in the death of a young boy."" The victim's family are being supported by specially trained officers. Thames Valley Police said a ""considerable police presence"" would be in place in the area for several days Officers were called just before 16:00 GMT on Sunday following reports of an attack. Officers are appealing for anyone who was in the area between 15:00 and 16:30 who might have taken photos or camera footage to contact them if they notice anything suspicious. Det Supt Brown said he believed there would have been witnesses to the ""dreadful incident"" as the area is popular with dog walkers. A man said his wife was walking their dog through the park on Sunday afternoon when she saw a boy on the ground with several people around him trying to give him first aid. Another dog walker said she saw a group of young people standing in the woods in Bugs Bottom fields at about 15:30 and described it as ""slightly unusual"". Reading East MP Matt Rodda has offered his ""deepest condolences"" to the boy's family. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"About 10 UK nationals resident in Spain say they were wrongly turned back when their flight landed in Barcelona. They left Heathrow on the Saturday morning British Airways flight, but were refused entry on arrival. They were stopped by border police and ultimately flown back to the UK. Spain has banned all but Spanish nationals and residents flying from the UK to Spain since 22 December in the hope of containing the spread of the new UK strain of Covid-19. One passenger on the flight, who did not wish to be named, said that those on board had been told repeatedly that only Spanish nationals or residents would be allowed to enter the country and that their residency certificates, also known as green certificates, were shown to airline staff several times. Ruth OâLeary found the experience upsetting However, on arrival, British passengers with green residency certificates were prevented from entering Spain. BA has confirmed that about 10 people were denied entry into Barcelona, as they did not meet the Spanish authorities' required criteria. British Airways to launch Covid testing trial British Airways owner cuts flight numbers again One of those affected, Ruth O'Leary, said: ""I was very confused, obviously. I asked them what other documents I could provide. ""They seemed to be just flat-out refusing anything I had and just wouldn't let me on the flight. Very upsetting really. ""Quite an awful feeling not to be able to go back to your own house and to not really be given an explanation why you can't go home."" Other British expat passengers have also said that they have been stopped from boarding planes to Spain. One passenger on board said that seven British citizens were prevented from boarding a British Airways/Iberia flight from Heathrow to Madrid on Saturday evening, despite having their green residency certificates, as well as negative Covid tests. The exact number of flights and passengers affected has not been released by the Foreign Office. Spain now demands a negative Covid test for foreign visitors In a statement on Monday, Iberia said that on 1 January, it received an email from the border police saying that registration as a European citizen was no longer considered to be a valid document to prove legal residency in Spain as a British citizen. However, by 19:30 on 2 January, the airline received a second email, confirming that the document could be used if it had not expired. A British Airways spokesperson said: ""In these difficult and unprecedented times with dynamic travel restrictions, we are doing everything we can to help and support our customers."" The Spanish Embassy in London tweeted a letter stating it was aware that during the current travel restrictions, there had been some problems for British nationals resident in Spain who had not been allowed to return. The embassy clarified that green certificates were valid proof of residency. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said: ""We have worked closely with the Spanish government to resolve these issues. ""The Spanish Embassy in London has re-confirmed today that both the green residence certificate and the new residence TIE card [Photo-ID card] are equally valid in terms of proving residence in Spain, as set out in the [Brexit] Withdrawal Agreement.""

"Some EU specialist online retailers have said they will no longer deliver to the UK because of tax changes which came into force on 1 January. Bicycle part firm Dutch Bike Bits said from now on, it would ship to every country in the world except the UK. ""We are forced by British policy to stop dealing with British customers,"" it said on its website. Another firm, Belgium-based Beer On Web, said it was now shunning the UK ""due to the new Brexit measures"". The companies are angry because they now face higher costs and increased bureaucracy in order to comply with UK tax authorities. However, it is unclear how many have taken the drastic step of refusing all UK orders. At the same time, international shipping companies including Federal Express and TNT have said they are levying additional charges on shipments between the UK and the EU. They said this reflected the increased investment they had had to make in adjusting their systems to cope with Brexit. Adieu to the single market created by the UK UK set for 'bumpy' period as new EU rules come in The moves follow changes in VAT rules brought in by HM Revenue and Customs on 1 January. VAT is now being collected at the point of sale rather than at the point of importation. This essentially means that overseas retailers sending goods to the UK are expected to register for UK VAT and account for it to HMRC if the sale value is less than â¬150 (Â£135). A government spokesperson said: ""The new VAT model ensures goods from EU and non-EU countries are treated in the same way and that UK businesses are not disadvantaged by competition from VAT-free imports. ""The new system also addresses the problem of overseas sellers failing to pay the right amount of VAT on sales of goods already in the UK at the point of sale, raising an anticipated Â£300m every year. ""Many EU businesses which currently sell goods to UK customers will have already registered for UK VAT under existing rules and HMRC is working very closely with those who haven't to ensure they can comply with the changes."" Adam French, Which? consumer rights expert, said consumers would be ""frustrated"" if the new VAT rules were applied in a way that causes significant inconvenience. ""It's vital the government makes it clear to consumers as well as traders what the changes as a result of Brexit mean for them and how they shop. It should also work to ensure UK consumers can retain access to a wide range of competitively priced and quality goods."" Campaigner Richard Allen, founder of Retailers Against VAT Abuse Schemes, told the BBC that the massive increase in international online shopping had led to VAT evasion on a huge scale. He said the new HMRC rules were aimed at tackling that, but it was unclear how firms who failed to register for UK VAT would be dealt with. ""Why should a phonograph spares manufacturer in Idaho bother to register for VAT in the UK and how are you going to make them do it?"" he said. ""And if they send the package anyway, what are you going to do?"" ""For providing this service, [HMRC] intend to charge a fee to every company in the world in every country in the world which exports to the UK,"" said Dutch Bike Bits on its website. ""Clearly this is ludicrous for one country, but imagine if every country in the world had the same idea. ""If every country decided to behave in the same way, then we would have to pay 195 fees every year, keep up with the changes in taxation law for 195 different countries, keep accounts on behalf of 195 different countries and submit payments to 195 tax offices in 195 different countries, and jump through whatever hoops were required to prove that we were doing all of this honestly and without any error."" Dutch Bike Bits said it had many customers within the UK and would like to be able to trade with them. ""Not being able to send parcels to the UK does not work in any way in our favour and it is not what we wanted,"" the firm added. ""If you're angry about this, and you may well be so, please contact your elected representative in the UK."" Other firms held out the hope that their ban on exports to the UK might prove to be temporary. Scandinavian Outdoor, which is based in Finland and sells outdoor clothing and equipment, posted a message on its homepage saying: ""No delivery to UK just now."" In a further message explaining its decision, it said: ""Due to Brexit, we have temporarily closed our store from UK-based customers. Ordering will be possible as soon as our UK VAT registration and the overall process of selling to the UK post-Brexit has been sorted out."" Meanwhile, mail and freight company TNT has said it is now imposing a surcharge of Â£4.31 on all shipments between the UK and the EU. TNT is now owned by Federal Express, which has also ""updated"" its charges, a spokesperson for the two companies said. ""FedEx/TNT has been making incremental investments to adjust our systems, processes, resourcing and customer-facing solutions to ensure readiness for the change on 1 January 2021,"" the spokesperson added. ""To reflect these investments and the incremental cost of customs clearance, we are increasing transportation rates for shipments from UK to EU, and EU to UK."" Rivals DHL and UPS have also taken similar measures.

"The homes of Frank and Christine Lampard, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Tamara Ecclestone and her husband were broken into in December 2019 Four people have been cleared of being involved in a plot to raid the luxury homes of celebrities in west London. Items belonging to Frank Lampard, Tamara Ecclestone and the family of tycoon Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha were among the items taken during three burglaries in December 2019. Prosecutors said Maria Mester, 48, Emil Bogdan Savastru, 30, Sorin Marcovici, 53, and Alexandru Stan, 49, were a ""supporting cast"" for the burglars. But a jury found all four not guilty. Isleworth Crown Court heard the three burglaries had netted ""big money"" for the raiders, with ""fabulous jewellery"" stolen and the majority of it having never been recovered. Jay Rutland, Tamara Ecclestone and their daughter had left for Lapland on the morning of the burglary Jewellery and cash worth Â£25m was taken from Ms Ecclestone's Kensington home while she was on holiday in Lapland with her husband Jay Rutland and their daughter. Mr Lampard and his TV presenter wife Christine had about Â£60,000 in watches and jewellery stolen when they were out, while raiders also ransacked the family home of Mr Srivaddhanaprabha, who died in 2018 in a helicopter crash, the jury was told. The four defendants were accused of eight charges including conspiracy to burgle. However, each denied their involvement with the plot, saying they had no knowledge that the alleged burglars were criminals. Jurors were shown an image from Maria Mester's Facebook account, in which she was said to be wearing Tamara Ecclestone's necklace The court heard escort Ms Mester had flown into the UK from Italy on 7 December. Police described her as the plot's ""matriarch"", but the 48-year-old told jurors she was only in London after being paid Â£5,000 to accompany one of the alleged burglars for the week. Savastru was arrested at Heathrow Airport on 30 January as he prepared to leave for Japan, wearing Mr Srivaddhanaprabha's Tag watch and carrying a Louis Vuitton bag stolen from Mr Rutland. He told the court he thought the items had been left behind by the alleged burglars at the Airbnb property he had helped them rent. The four Romanian nationals were cleared of all charges apart from Savastru, who was convicted of one count of attempting to conceal criminal property. The 30-year-old will be sentenced at a later date. A group of alleged burglars, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are accused of carrying out the raids.

"There are concerns that the new Covid-19 variant in South Africa could ""weaken the impact"" of vaccines Scientists in South Africa say there is a ""reasonable concern"" that the new variant of Covid-19 sweeping across the country might prove to be more resistant to current vaccines being rolled out in the UK and elsewhere, and warn that it makes the need for a global roll-out of vaccines ""even more critical"". ""It's a theoretical concern. A reasonable concernâ¦ that the South African variant might be more resistant,"" Prof Shabir Madhi, who has led trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa, told the BBC. Prof Madhi was responding to comments by the UK government and scientists. He said a definitive answer would probably come in a matter of weeks, with extensive testing already under way in South Africa. The concern arises from the fact that the virus here has mutated far more than the variant in the UK, and one of those mutations might mean it can evade attack by antibodies that would normally fight coronavirus. Vaccines teach the body to mount an immune response - which includes creating antibodies - to fight the coronavirus, should it ever encounter it. Antibodies are small proteins made by the immune system that stick to the surface of viruses, effectively disabling them. If that ability to connect is weakened, then the antibodies created following the introduction of a vaccine might not be as effective. Prof Madhi said it was ""unlikely"" that the mutation in South Africa would make the current vaccines useless, but might ""weaken the impact"". South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? Coronavirus variants: The science explained Race to understand how many South Africans have had Covid A vaccine expert at Wits University, Prof Helen Rees, said: ""Fortunately, should further modifications of the vaccine be required to address the new variants, some of the vaccine technologies under development could allow this to be done relatively rapidly."" South Africa recently pushed back against suggestions from the British government that its variant was more transmissible than the one in the UK. Scientists insist there is no evidence of that, nor that the mutations here have made the virus deadlier. Prof Rees said concern about the mutations in South Africa should add to global pressure for a swift roll-out of vaccines across the world, and not just to wealthier nations. ""As the new variants are already spreading to other countries, the importance of ensuring that vaccines remain effective against new variants is a global imperative,"" said Prof Rees. Prof Barry Schoub, who chairs the government's advisory committee on vaccines, said the ""preliminary evidence"" from tests did not suggest that mutations would allow the virus to ""escape"" the impact of the current vaccines. ""The vaccines seem to be very effective,"" he said, citing laboratory tests that appeared to show the current vaccines still ""neutralise this new variant"". Prof Madhi said the crucial laboratory experiments were yet to start and the efficacy of the vaccines would only be known ""over the next few weeks"".

"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed. You may be entitled to extra money if you have children or are a carer, or have a disability or health condition. You may also be entitled to help with housing costs.

From March 2020 to the end of September 2021, the cost of furlough will come to about Â£66bn, according to estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility. That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

"Most pupils will be studying from home for the rest of this half term Schools and colleges in England are to be closed to most pupils until at least half term, Boris Johnson has announced. The prime minister said the new lockdown had to be ""tough enough"" to stop the variant virus from spreading - and teaching will go online. A-Levels and GCSEs will be cancelled, a government source confirmed to BBC News - although vocational exams will go ahead. The National Education Union accused the government of causing ""chaos"". In a television address, Mr Johnson announced the biggest changes to schools since the early days of the first lockdown in March. ""Because we now have to do everything we possibly can to stop the spread of the disease, primary schools, secondary schools and colleges across England must move to remote provision from tomorrow,"" said the prime minister. This means a return to online learning for pupils of all ages - apart from vulnerable children and the children of key workers who can continue to go into school. Primary schools went back today - and will then close again tomorrow ""We recognise that this will mean it's not possible or fair for all exams to go ahead this summer, as normal,"" said Mr Johnson. It is understood that vocational exams will continue, but GCSEs and A-levels will be cancelled -  and that the exam watchdog Ofqual will make ""alternative arrangements"" for delivering results. New lockdown rules for England Thousands of primary pupils return to closed schools Scotland switches to remote learning Delay to schools opening in Wales An attempt to produce replacement exam grades last summer turned into one of the biggest U-turns of the pandemic. Teachers' unions accused the government of failing to react more swiftly to ""mounting evidence"" about Covid transmission in schools and to make preparations for remote teaching and alternatives to written exams. But Mary Bousted, co-leader of the National Education Union, said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had ""become an expert in putting his head in the sand"". Geoff Barton of the ASCL head teachers' union criticised ministers for having issued legal threats to keep schools open at the end of last term - and then ""made a series of chaotic announcements about the start of this term"". The new term, which began on Monday for primary pupils, has only lasted a day before it has been suspended. The prime minister said he hoped that schools would be ""reopening schools after the February half term"". There have been assurances that there will be a more thorough approach to home learning than in the first lockdown last year. The Department for Education has provided hundreds of thousands of computer devices - with the aim of supporting those without the equipment needed to work online from home. There have also been suggestions Ofsted inspectors will play a more active role in checking on what support schools are providing to pupils in their online learning. Universities in England had already planned a staggered return for this term - but there will now be even fewer students on campus this month. The latest lockdown guidance says university students who are taking hands-on courses such as medicine or veterinary science should return for face-to-face lessons as planned. These students will be expected to take two Covid tests or self-isolate for 10 days when they return.

"There are concerns that the new Covid-19 variant in South Africa could ""weaken the impact"" of vaccines Scientists in South Africa say there is a ""reasonable concern"" that the new variant of Covid-19 sweeping across the country might prove to be more resistant to current vaccines being rolled out in the UK and elsewhere, and warn that it makes the need for a global roll-out of vaccines ""even more critical"". ""It's a theoretical concern. A reasonable concernâ¦ that the South African variant might be more resistant,"" Prof Shabir Madhi, who has led trials for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in South Africa, told the BBC. Prof Madhi was responding to comments by the UK government and scientists. He said a definitive answer would probably come in a matter of weeks, with extensive testing already under way in South Africa. The concern arises from the fact that the virus here has mutated far more than the variant in the UK, and one of those mutations might mean it can evade attack by antibodies that would normally fight coronavirus. Vaccines teach the body to mount an immune response - which includes creating antibodies - to fight the coronavirus, should it ever encounter it. Antibodies are small proteins made by the immune system that stick to the surface of viruses, effectively disabling them. If that ability to connect is weakened, then the antibodies created following the introduction of a vaccine might not be as effective. Prof Madhi said it was ""unlikely"" that the mutation in South Africa would make the current vaccines useless, but might ""weaken the impact"". South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? Coronavirus variants: The science explained Race to understand how many South Africans have had Covid A vaccine expert at Wits University, Prof Helen Rees, said: ""Fortunately, should further modifications of the vaccine be required to address the new variants, some of the vaccine technologies under development could allow this to be done relatively rapidly."" South Africa recently pushed back against suggestions from the British government that its variant was more transmissible than the one in the UK. Scientists insist there is no evidence of that, nor that the mutations here have made the virus deadlier. Prof Rees said concern about the mutations in South Africa should add to global pressure for a swift roll-out of vaccines across the world, and not just to wealthier nations. ""As the new variants are already spreading to other countries, the importance of ensuring that vaccines remain effective against new variants is a global imperative,"" said Prof Rees. Prof Barry Schoub, who chairs the government's advisory committee on vaccines, said the ""preliminary evidence"" from tests did not suggest that mutations would allow the virus to ""escape"" the impact of the current vaccines. ""The vaccines seem to be very effective,"" he said, citing laboratory tests that appeared to show the current vaccines still ""neutralise this new variant"". Prof Madhi said the crucial laboratory experiments were yet to start and the efficacy of the vaccines would only be known ""over the next few weeks"".

"Rules around face coverings are easing across the UK, but they are still required in some settings. Heathrow Airport and a number of airlines are relaxing their rules on masks. But Nicola Sturgeon has said face coverings must still be worn in Scotland after all other legal requirements are lifted on 21 March. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon hasconfirmed that Scotland's rules on face coverings will remain in place until April, due to a rise in Covid cases. All other restrictions on businesses and services will move from legal requirement to guidance on 21 March. The rules on masks will be reviewed again on 29 March, and are expected to be converted to guidance by 4 April. At the moment,masks must be worn,externalin most indoor public spaces including public transport, shops and gyms (although they can be temporarily removed when exercising). They are mandatory in pubs and restaurants when not seated or dancing, as well as in the workplace in communal areas and canteens. They no longer have to be worn bysecondary school students in the classroom- but are still required in ""indoor communal areas"" like corridors. Under-12s are exempt. What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Masks are no longer legally required in most public spaces - although they are still recommended in some situations: face coveringsremain a requirement in healthcare settings,external, such as GP surgeries, hospitals andcare homes government guidance recommends that people still wear face coverings in enclosed or private spaces where they are mixing with people they don't know many major retailers includingTesco, Sainsburys, Lidl, Waitrose and John Lewis have asked staff and customers to keep wearing masks face coveringsare no longer mandatory on Transport for London's tubes, trains or buses, but are still ""strongly encouraged"" face coveringsare no longer mandatory in Heathrow Airport's terminals, railway stations or office buildings, but are still recommended British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have said air passengerswill only have to wear masks if their destination country requires it What are the latest changes to the UK's Covid rules? Face coverings are no longer required in classrooms and some venues such as museums and cinemas. However, they will still need to be worn in shops, salons, hairdressers, health and social care settings and on public transport. The Welsh government has said it intends to lift all remaining Covid regulations by the end of March. Masks no longer needed in classrooms and cinemas Wales' mask and isolation laws could end in March Mask-wearing is no longer legally enforced in Northern Ireland. However, face coverings are still recommended in certain places, such as enclosed public spaces and health and social care settings. Northern Ireland's last Covid rules are lifted What are the remaining Covid regulations set to go? InWales, the penalty for a first offence is Â£60, with the fine doubling for each subsequent offence - up to a maximum of Â£1,920. Repeat offenders can also be prosecuted in court where fines are unlimited. InScotland, the police can issue a penalty notice of up to Â£60 for breaking the law on mask-wearing. Evidence suggeststransmission mainly happens indoors,external, where people are close together. Covering the nose and mouth reduces the spread of coronavirus droplets from coughs, sneezes and while speaking. The main purpose is to protect others, although there is someevidence they offer protection to wearers. Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors It should: have a nose wire have at least two or three layers of material fit snugly over mouth, nose and chin Standard surgical masks are acceptable. It is also possible to buy FFP2 and FFP3 masks used by healthcare workerswhich can offer higher protection. However, these must be fitted correctly to work.

"The firing of Google AI research scientist Timnit Gebru provoked outcry More than 200 workers at Google-parent Alphabet have taken steps to form a labour union in a rare development for an American tech giant. They said the organisation will give staff greater power to voice concerns about discriminatory work practices at the firm and how it handles issues like online hate speech. The move follows walkouts and other actions by staff in recent years. Google said it would ""continue engaging directly with all our employees"". ""We've always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce,"" Kara Silverstein, director of people operations, said in a statement. ""Of course our employees have protected labour rights that we support. But as we've always done, we'll continue engaging directly with all our employees"". The announcement of the Alphabet Workers Union comes weeks afterGoogle's firing of a high-profile black artificial intelligence and ethics researcher generated uproar. The US National Labor Relations Board also recentlyruled the firm had unlawfully fired employees for attempting to organise a union. Google staff stage a walkout in 2018 over the company's handling of sexual misconduct allegations Staff have also mobilised against the firm's ""Project Maven"" work with the Department of Defense and the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints. ""This union builds upon years of courageous organizing by Google workers,"" Nicki Anselmo, program manager,said in the announcement,external. ""From fighting the 'real names' policy, to opposing Project Maven, to protesting the egregious, multi-million dollar payouts that have been given to executives who've committed sexual harassment, we've seen first-hand that Alphabet responds when we act collectively.

The group was organised by software engineers but is open to all ranks at the company's US and Canadian workforce, including temporary workers and contractors. It is affiliated with the larger labour group, Communication Workers of America, but is not seeking formal recognition from the federal government, limiting its bargaining power. It represents a small fraction of Alphabet's workforce, which includes more than 130,000 people as of September and roughly as many contractors, vendors and temporary staff.

"The UK's coronavirus alert level has been increased from level three to four - meaning transmission of cases is high or rising exponentially. The last time the UK was at this level was between late February and May this year. A joint statement from the UK's four chief medical officers, and NHS England director Professor Stephen Powis, said the change was ""in light of the rapid increase in Omicron cases"". The statement says: ""Transmission of Covid-19 is already high in the community, mainly still driven by Delta, but the emergence of Omicron adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services."" It added that early evidence shows Omicron was ""spreading much faster than Delta and that vaccine protection against symptomatic disease from Omicron is reduced"". ""Hospitalisations from Omicron are already occurring and these are likely to increase rapidly."" The Covid alert level system is separate and independent from any government decisions on easing or tightening restrictions. Risk levels are measured by a five-level, colour-coded alert system. The government unveiled the system in May 2020. There are five levels: Level five (red) - a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"" Level four - a high or rising level of transmission Level three - the virus is in general circulation Level two - the number of cases and transmission are low Level one (green) - Covid-19 is no longer present in the UK Covid-19's reproduction (R) number,a scientific measureof how fast the virus is spreading The number of confirmed coronavirus cases at any one time TheJoint Biosecurity Centre (JBC),external- set up by the government in the spring of 2020 - has the task of recommending what the alert level should be. JBC scientists identify changes in infection rates using testing, environmental and workplace data. The JBC also has an ""insight team"" which monitors local spikes of Covid-19 and advises health officials and local authorities. Their recommendations are then reviewed and agreed by the chief medical officers of the four UK nations. Not automatically.

"Fully jabbed travellers arriving in the UK from Francehave to quarantine, because of the Beta variant. The government is concerned jabs may not work as well against the variant. French authorities say most cases are from the overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte, rather than mainland France. How have summer holiday rules changed? Your travel guide to seven Mediterranean countries Beta, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant genetic changes that experts are studying. It was first identified in South Africa. All viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants. These tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. Most are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. How worrying are the Covid variants? Some of the changes Beta has undergone involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations. Beta, along with a few other variants of coronavirus, such as Delta and Alpha, have been labelled ""variants of concern"". These have some worrying changes experts want to keep a very close eye on. Beta carries a mutation, called N501Y, which appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. Another mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system, and may affect how well vaccines work. There is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people. As with the original version, the risk is still highest for elderly people and those with significant underlying health conditions. When will I get a Covid vaccine? Which children are being vaccinated and why? Vaccines are designed around original Covid, rather than new variants. There is some evidence they are less effective at stopping Beta infections. But experts say they should still work to stop severe illness. Trials ofNovavax,external,Janssen,externaland theOxford/AstraZeneca vaccinesin South Africa suggest the variant can overcome some built-up immunity Another study,external, also in South Africa, found the AstraZeneca vaccine was only 10% effective against mild-to-moderate Beta infections Areal-world data study in Israel,external- not yet peer-reviewed - found some people who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine still caught Beta Lab results from Modernasuggest its shot works against the South Africa variant, although the immune response may not be as strong or prolonged Data on Moderna use in Qatar,externalsuggests two doses is more than 96% effective against symptomatic Covid caused by Beta Data from the Pfizer rollout in Qatar,external, suggests immunisation is 97% effective at stopping severe cases of Beta Even in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary. Atrial of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine,external, designed against Beta, has begun in the UK. Some of the other Covid vaccines are also being updated. The Beta variant has been identified in more than 50 countries around the world. So far, theUK has recorded just over 1,000 cases,externalof Beta. That's a tiny fraction of all Covid cases. Another variant, called Delta, currently makes up more than 99% of Covid seen in the UK. South Africa hasreported higher cases of Beta.,external Covid map: Where are cases the highest? When it was first identified in the UK, the government recommendedsurge testing in the communityin some regions to help stop the spread. A system of foreign travel restrictions has also been introduced to minimise the chance of UK travellers spreading Beta as well as other variants of concern. Although adults who were fully jabbed in the UKnow no longer need to quarantine on return from amber list countries, double vaccinated travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to self-isolate for ten days. They will also have to take two PCR tests to ensure they are not infectious. UK scientists are tracking variants, including Beta, to learn more and are providinggenomic sequencing help to other countries,externalso that they can do the same.

"Bath are set to host Wasps on Friday in the first of this weekend's Gallagher Premiership matches Professional sport in England can continue behind closed doors, despite a new national lockdown announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It means Premier League football and elite leagues in other sports are allowed to carry on. The sport and leisure rules in England are similar tothose announced in Scotlandearlier on Monday. People living in England have been told to stay at home and schools will shut for most pupils from Tuesday. On Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. For those in England, exercising outside is allowed once a day. Venues such as gyms, tennis courts and golf courses will be closed. Organised outdoor sport for disabled people is exempt from the new measures. Games and training in non-elite football - which includes all adult and youth grassroots, except for disabled people - have been suspended. The Women's FA Cup is among the non-elite competitions placed on hold. All but one of the second-round matches scheduled to take place on Sunday were postponed because of Covid-19 regulations. Teams from the Women's Super League and Women's Championship enter the draw from the fourth round onwards. Which non-elite football has been suspended? Steps three to six of the National League System (all divisions below the National League North and South) Tiers three to seven of the Women's Football Pyramid (all divisions below the Women's Championship) Women's FA Cup (classified as 'non-elite' up to and including the third round) Regional National League System feeder leagues Barclays FA WSL Academy League (unless under elite status) FA Girls' Regional Talent Clubs (unless under elite status) All indoor and outdoor youth and adult grassroots football, including under-18s (except organised outdoor football for disabled people, which is allowed to continue) Following Monday's announcement by the prime minister, this week's sporting fixtures in England are set to go ahead as planned. In football, the Carabao Cup semi-finals are being played on Tuesday and Wednesday, while the FA Cup third round - which has 32 fixtures spanning four days - starts on Friday. There are also several Women's Super League, English Football League and National League games set to take place, as well as English Premiership and Premier 15s rugby union matches, plus the Masters snooker event in Milton Keynes. Earlier on Monday, Rochdale chief executive David Bottomley saidhe believes it is ""inevitable""that the EFL will have to temporarily suspend fixtures because of rising coronavirus cases. Seven of last Saturday's EFL games - and 52 across the season - have been called off as teams are affected by the virus. Four Premier League matches have also been postponed this season because of coronavirus cases. The UK government published its guidance for England's new national lockdown shortly after the prime minister's televised address at 20:00 GMT. Here are the points relating to sport and physical activity: Elite sportspeople (and their coaches if necessary, or parents/guardians if they are under 18) - or those on an official elite sports pathway - to compete and train Indoor gyms and sports facilities will remain closed Outdoor sports courts, outdoor gyms, golf courses, outdoor swimming pools, archery/driving/shooting ranges and riding arenas must also close Organised outdoor sport for disabled people is allowed to continue While golfing has been allowed to continue in Scotland under strict rules, courses will be closed in England. England Golf said it was ""extremely disappointed"" with the decision, adding it had made a ""strong case"" to keep the sport open in recent months. You can exercise in a public outdoor place: by yourself with the people you live with with your support bubble ( if you are legally permitted to form one) in a childcare bubble where providing childcare or, when on your own, with one person from another household Public outdoor places include: parks, beaches, countryside accessible to the public, forests public gardens (whether or not you pay to enter them) the grounds of a heritage site playgrounds UK Active, a not-for-profit organisation that promotes health and fitness, says the government must act immediately to ""minimise the damaging impact of lockdown"". ""We know from the millions of people that depend on gyms, pools, and leisure centres to support their physical and mental health, how essential they are,"" said UK Active chief executive Huw Edwards. ""We cannot afford to wait until the vaccine rollout is advanced before we act, so the government must explore all options at this time and provide a credible plan for maintaining this support to millions of people who rely on these Covid-secure facilities to stay strong and healthy. ""Furthermore, the UK governments must protect this sector before it becomes too late.""

"Margaret Ferrier admitted travelling back from London to Glasgow after testing positive for coronavirus Scottish MP Margaret Ferrier has been arrested by police after she admitted using public transport while infected with Covid-19. Ms Ferrier apologised for what she called a ""blip"" in September. She was suspended from the SNP group at Westminster and leaders, including First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, urged her to quit as an MP over the row. Police Scotland said she had been charged in connection with ""alleged culpable and reckless conduct"". Ms Ferrier apologised in September after travelling from London to Glasgow having tested positive for coronavirus. The Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP said she had experienced ""mild symptoms"" and taken a test, but had then decided to travel to Westminster because she was ""feeling much better"". She then travelled home again on a train after receiving the positive test result, and said she ""deeply regretted"" her actions. A Police Scotland spokesman said: ""We can confirm that officers today arrested and charged a 60-year-old woman in connection with alleged culpable and reckless conduct. ""This follows a thorough investigation by Police Scotland into an alleged breach of coronavirus regulations between 26 and 29 September 2020.

"Bath are set to host Wasps on Friday in the first of this weekend's Gallagher Premiership matches Professional sport in England can continue behind closed doors, despite a new national lockdown announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson. It means Premier League football and elite leagues in other sports are allowed to carry on. The sport and leisure rules in England are similar tothose announced in Scotlandearlier on Monday. People living in England have been told to stay at home and schools will shut for most pupils from Tuesday. On Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. For those in England, exercising outside is allowed once a day. Venues such as gyms, tennis courts and golf courses will be closed. Organised outdoor sport for disabled people is exempt from the new measures. Games and training in non-elite football - which includes all adult and youth grassroots, except for disabled people - have been suspended. The Women's FA Cup is among the non-elite competitions placed on hold. All but one of the second-round matches scheduled to take place on Sunday were postponed because of Covid-19 regulations. Teams from the Women's Super League and Women's Championship enter the draw from the fourth round onwards. Which non-elite football has been suspended? Steps three to six of the National League System (all divisions below the National League North and South) Tiers three to seven of the Women's Football Pyramid (all divisions below the Women's Championship) Women's FA Cup (classified as 'non-elite' up to and including the third round) Regional National League System feeder leagues Barclays FA WSL Academy League (unless under elite status) FA Girls' Regional Talent Clubs (unless under elite status) All indoor and outdoor youth and adult grassroots football, including under-18s (except organised outdoor football for disabled people, which is allowed to continue) Following Monday's announcement by the prime minister, this week's sporting fixtures in England are set to go ahead as planned. In football, the Carabao Cup semi-finals are being played on Tuesday and Wednesday, while the FA Cup third round - which has 32 fixtures spanning four days - starts on Friday. There are also several Women's Super League, English Football League and National League games set to take place, as well as English Premiership and Premier 15s rugby union matches, plus the Masters snooker event in Milton Keynes. Earlier on Monday, Rochdale chief executive David Bottomley saidhe believes it is ""inevitable""that the EFL will have to temporarily suspend fixtures because of rising coronavirus cases. Seven of last Saturday's EFL games - and 52 across the season - have been called off as teams are affected by the virus. Four Premier League matches have also been postponed this season because of coronavirus cases. The UK government published its guidance for England's new national lockdown shortly after the prime minister's televised address at 20:00 GMT. Here are the points relating to sport and physical activity: Elite sportspeople (and their coaches if necessary, or parents/guardians if they are under 18) - or those on an official elite sports pathway - to compete and train Indoor gyms and sports facilities will remain closed Outdoor sports courts, outdoor gyms, golf courses, outdoor swimming pools, archery/driving/shooting ranges and riding arenas must also close Organised outdoor sport for disabled people is allowed to continue While golfing has been allowed to continue in Scotland under strict rules, courses will be closed in England. England Golf said it was ""extremely disappointed"" with the decision, adding it had made a ""strong case"" to keep the sport open in recent months. You can exercise in a public outdoor place: by yourself with the people you live with with your support bubble ( if you are legally permitted to form one) in a childcare bubble where providing childcare or, when on your own, with one person from another household Public outdoor places include: parks, beaches, countryside accessible to the public, forests public gardens (whether or not you pay to enter them) the grounds of a heritage site playgrounds UK Active, a not-for-profit organisation that promotes health and fitness, says the government must act immediately to ""minimise the damaging impact of lockdown"". ""We know from the millions of people that depend on gyms, pools, and leisure centres to support their physical and mental health, how essential they are,"" said UK Active chief executive Huw Edwards. ""We cannot afford to wait until the vaccine rollout is advanced before we act, so the government must explore all options at this time and provide a credible plan for maintaining this support to millions of people who rely on these Covid-secure facilities to stay strong and healthy. ""Furthermore, the UK governments must protect this sector before it becomes too late.""

"Classrooms in Wales will remain empty until 18 January at the earliest All schools and colleges will move to online learning until 18 January in Wales. Some schools had been due to open on Wednesdayand others by 11 January withdecisions made by local authorities. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the decision had been taken jointly with the Welsh Local Government Association and Colegau Cymru. Teaching unions had called for a delayed start to termamid concerns about thecoronavirus variant. However, the timing of the decision has been criticised, with some claiming it left little time for parents and schools to make plans. Ms Williams said: ""As a government we will use the next two weeks to continue to work with local authorities, schools and colleges to best plan for the rest of term. ""This is the best way to ensure that parents, staff and learners can be confident in the return to face to face learning, based on the latest evidence and information."" How many have died with Covid in Wales? 'Momentous day' as Oxford Covid jab rollout begins Education Minister Kirsty Williams made a video announcement Schools and colleges would remain open for children of critical workers and vulnerable learners, as well as for learners who needed to complete essential exams or assessments All childcare settings can remain open Universities in Wales have already agreed a staggered start to term Welsh university students studying in England should not return to campuses and will be taught online after a separatelockdownwas imposed The announcement comes as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increasedthe Covid threat level to five - its highest level. Level five warns of a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"", according to theUK government's website,external. Wales has been under ""stay-at-home""lockdown restrictionssince 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, withmore than 31,000 casesin the two weeks over the Christmas period. A""flexible"" agreementon reopening schools had been put in place before Christmas with the decision in the hands of local authorities. However, that decision has changed following the latest announcement. Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said: ""It continues to be a difficult situation for children and young people. ""Children certainly would rather be in school, and are concerned about uncertainty, but it is clear we are living in difficult times,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

First Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted to say moving classes online was the ""best way to help reduce the spread of this deadly virus"". Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said the decision made sense but the plan to resume face-to-face education after 18 January should be kept under review and ""not set in stone"". Laura Doel, director of the head teachers' union, NAHT Cymru, said the decision brought ""much-needed clarity"". ""The Welsh Government has repeatedly said it wants to prioritise education, in that case it must also prioritise safety in schools and the communities schools serve,"" she said. ""Work should be undertaken with school leaders and Public Health Wales to establish and agree new Covid-related safety measures in schools during the temporary restriction for implementation in good time prior to lifting restrictions."" Claire Jones, deputy head teacher at Crickhowell High School, Powys, said she was ""really optimistic that blended learning is a way forward"" although ""it's not the ideal"". Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: ""With many children having been due to begin a staggered return to school from Wednesday onwards, this news has come late for them and for their parents."" Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the decision had left ""little or no time for parents and teachers to adapt to the changing circumstances"". ""It is unclear what the Welsh Government expects will change in just two weeks' time and so we risk being in the same position yet again with yet more confusion in a fortnight,"" she said. There are more Covid patients in hospital beds than ever before - 2,688 on Sunday - which included a record number of more than 900 recovering patients too ill to be discharged There were also 136 patients in critical care with Covid, getting closer to the peak seen during the first wave in April Case rates have been falling on average in Wales in recent days, although there is some caution due to a fall in tests over the Christmas period.Wrexham and other parts of north east Wales have nevertheless reached their highest levels yet Bridgend has the highest case rate in Wales. Although falling, its proportion of positive cases - 36.5% - remains the highest in the UK Another25 deaths were reported by Public Health Wales,with the average of deaths running at around 34 a day in the most recent week Wales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties. It went into alevel four national lockdown on 20 December. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales New lockdown for England as cases surge Covid deniers removed from 'at capacity' hospital However, the latest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK. This delay until 18 January is something the unions had been calling for but to decide on the Monday before some schools are about to go back on the Wednesday is quite late in the day. And that's something the opposition parties have picked up on. With all the uncertainty that we are facing over how this new variant will play out and the condition, and the pressure that's on the NHS, I wouldn't put any money necessarily on face-to-face learning resuming on the 18th. I'm told that is something that will be kept very much under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set ofnew national restrictions for England, as head teachers over the border warned of a""confusing picture""with thousands of pupils unable to start primary school as expected. Schools and colleges will be closed until the end of February half term and pupils will be taught online. Scotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at homefrom midnight, with schools to be closed. Most pupils in Northern Ireland werenot expected to return to schoolthis week as had been planned.

"Assange pictured leaving court in January a year ago Wikileaks founder Julian Assange cannot be extradited to the United States, a court in London has ruled. The judge blocked the request because of concerns over Mr Assange's mental health and risk of suicide in the US. Mr Assange, who is wanted over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011, says the case is politically motivated. Expressing disappointment at the ruling, the US justice department noted that its legal arguments had prevailed. Profile: Julian Assange How the UK decides whether to extradite Assange Its position is that the leaks broke the law and endangered lives. ""While we are extremely disappointed in the court's ultimate decision, we are gratified that the United States prevailed on every point of law raised,"" the justice department said. The US authorities have 14 days in which to lodge an appeal and are expected to do so. Mr Assange appeared at the Old Bailey on Monday Mr Assange will now be taken back to Belmarsh Prison - where he is being held - and a full application for his bail will be made on Wednesday. His lawyer Ed Fitzgerald QC told the court there would be evidence to show Mr Assange would not abscond. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that while US prosecutors had met the tests for Mr Assange to be extradited for trial, the US was incapable of preventing him from attempting to take his own life. Outlining evidence of his self-harm and suicidal thoughts, she said: ""The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man fearful for his future."" She said: ""Faced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at HMP Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr Assange from finding a way to commit suicide and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm and I order his discharge."" Mr Assange's partner, lawyer Stella Moris, said ""today's victory is a first step towards justice"" Mr Assange, who wore a blue suit and green face mask in the dock, closed his eyes as the judge read out her ruling on Monday. His fiancee Stella Moris, with whom he has two young sons, wept and was comforted by Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson, who sat next to her in court. Speaking outside court after the ruling, she called on the US president to ""end this now"". ""Mr President, tear down these prison walls,"" she said. ""Let our little boys have their father. Free Julian, free the press, free us all."" This video can not be played Julian Assangeâs fiancÃ©e says she dreaded going public with their relationship District Judge Vanessa Baraitser explicitly concluded that Mr Assange should answer allegations that he aided and abetted hacking, theft and the disclosure of the identities of informants working for the US security agencies - disclosures that endangered their lives. In English law, that would be enough for him to be charged with a crime here - and so the route was open for Mr Assange to face trial for the same in the United States. But British extradition law also requires a judge to consider Mr Assange's health. And it's the effect of his possible detention in near-solitary confinement in a ""supermax"" prison that proved decisive. The US, in the judge's conclusion, can't stop a mentally unwell man taking his own life in those conditions. And so the legal requirement to treat Mr Assange humanely trumps the seriousness of the case that the judge acknowledges he should answer. When the US appeals - it'll have to convince more senior judges otherwise. If convicted in the US, Mr Assange faces a possible penalty of up to 175 years in jail, his lawyers have said. However the US government said the sentence was more likely to be between four and six years. Mr Assange faces an 18-count indictment from the US government, accusing him of conspiring to hack into US military databases to acquire sensitive secret information relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, which was then published on the Wikileaks website. He says the information exposed abuses by the US military. But US prosecutors say the leaks of classified material endangered lives, and so the US sought his extradition from the UK. Extradition is the process under which one country can ask another to hand over a suspect to face trial. Following the judgement, several politicians and organisations welcomed the news, although some expressed dismay that the ruling was made on health grounds: Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he had instructed his foreign minister to offer political asylum to Mr Assange who ""is a journalist and deserves a chance"" ""Good news Julian Assange's extradition has been blocked,"" saidUK Conservative MP David Davis on Twitter.,external""Extradition treaties should not be used for political prosecutions"" Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyncalled it,external""good news"" but said it was ""alarming that the judge has accepted US government arguments threatening freedom of speech and freedom to publish"" Supporters of Mr Assange gathered outside the Old Bailey on Monday Amnesty International welcomed the ruling but criticised the UK for ""having engaged in this politically-motivated process at the behest of the USA and putting media freedom and freedom of expression on trial"" The head of the National Union of Journalists, Michelle Stanistreet, said the outcome was ""the right one"" but the judgment contained ""much that is troubling"" Journalist and documentary maker John Pilger, who has been a vocal campaigner for Mr Assange,tweeted,externalthat it was ""wonderful"", adding the UK ruling was a ""face-saving cover for the British to justify their disgraceful political trial of Assange on America's behalf"" This video can not be played Julian Assange's father fears 'worried' son's extradition Mr Assange was jailed for 50 weeks in May 2019 for breaching his bail conditions after going into hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He sought refuge in the embassy for seven years from 2012 until he was arrested in April 2019. At the time he fled to the embassy, he had been facing extradition to Sweden on allegations of sexual assault which he denied. That case was later dropped.

"This video can not be played 82-year-old Brian Pinker is given the Oxford vaccine at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford Dialysis patient Brian Pinker, 82, has become the first person to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. The retired maintenance manager got the jab at 7:30 GMT from nurse Sam Foster at Oxford's Churchill Hospital. More than half a million doses of the vaccine are ready for use on Monday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was a ""pivotal moment"" in the UK's fight against the virus, as vaccines will help curb infections and then allow restrictions to be lifted. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Mondaythere was ""no question we will have to take tougher measures"", which will be announced in ""due course"", as the UK struggles to control a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus. On Sunday more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases were recorded in the UK for the sixth day running, prompting Labour to call for a third national lockdown in England. Northern IrelandandWalescurrently have their own lockdowns in place and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a fresh lockdown will beginin Scotlandfrom 00:01 on Tuesday. The rollout comes asrows continue over whether pupils should return to schoolwith the current high levels of Covid infections. PM expects 'tens of millions' of jabs by April When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What could 'tougher' coronavirus measures mean? PM: 'No question' tougher Covid measures will happen Six hospital trusts - in Oxford, London, Sussex, Lancashire and Warwickshire - have begun administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, with 530,000 doses ready for use. Most other available doses will be sent to hundreds of GP-led services and care homes across the UK later in the week, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Mr Pinker, who has been having dialysis for kidney disease at the Churchill Hospital for a number of years, said he was ""really proud"" the vaccine was developed in Oxford. ""The nurses, doctors and staff today have all been brilliant and I can now really look forward to celebrating my 48th wedding anniversary with my wife Shirley later this year,"" he said. Father-of-three Trevor Cowlett, 88, also received the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine Music teacher and father-of-three Trevor Cowlett, 88, and Prof Andrew Pollard, a paediatrician working at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and lead investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, were also among the first to be vaccinated. Chief nurse Ms Foster, who administered the first dose, told the BBC it was a ""huge privilege"", saying: ""Every single patient that we have vaccinated over the last couple of weeks have got their own personal stories to the difference it's going to make, so it is no different this morning."" Speaking during a visit to London's Chase Farm Hospital, to meet some of the first people to receive the Oxford vaccine, the prime minister said there were ""tough, tough"" weeks to come. There will now be a ""massive ramp-up"" in vaccination numbers ""in the weeks ahead"", Mr Johnson said, and the number of vaccine doses will amount to ""tens of millions by the end of March"". Asked when the government will be able to vaccinate two million people a week, Mr Johnson said the government will give more details ""in the next few days... as soon as we have better numbers to give"". Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the Oxford vaccine rollout was a ""pivotal moment"" in the fight against coronavirus, saying: ""It's going to be a tough few weeks ahead, but this is the way out."" Asked about reports potential volunteerswere being deterred by the additional training and forms, Mr Hancock said they were going to ""reduce the amount of bureaucracy"". ""For instance there's one of the training programmes about how to tackle terrorism, I don't think that's necessary, we're going to stop that,"" he said. However, he said this was not delaying the delivery of the vaccine, adding that the next delivery of the vaccine will be ""early this week"" to be ""deployed next week"". England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the vaccines ""give us a route out in the medium term"" but warned the NHS was ""under considerable and rising pressure in the short term"". Former health secretary and Conservative chairman of the Commons' health committee Jeremy Hunttweeted,externalthat it was ""time to act"" and the government needed to close schools and borders, ban all household mixing and impose a 12-week national lockdown in England.

Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth agreed that a national lockdown was needed, as well as ""rapidly scaled-up vaccine distribution"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'This way can save more lives' As the recent rise in Covid cases puts increased pressure on the NHS, the UK has accelerated its vaccination rollout by planning to give both doses of the vaccine 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between jabs. The UK's chief medical officers have defended the delay to second doses, saying getting more people vaccinated with the first jab ""is much more preferable"". Make no mistake, the UK is in a race against time. That much is clear from the decision to delay the second dose of the vaccine to focus on giving as many people as possible their first doses. So how fast can the NHS go? Ultimately it wants to get to two million doses a week. That will not be achieved this week. But Monday marks the start of the NHS putting the accelerator to the floor. A rapid increase in the vaccination rate should follow. But how quickly the UK can go is dependent on several complex processes. First, the vaccine has to be manufactured, then it has to be put into vials and packaged up (known as fill and finish). After that each batch has to be checked and certified before being sent to NHS vaccination sites where there needs to be enough vaccinators and support staff to ensure those doses are given as quickly as possible. Problems at any one stage can disrupt how quickly the vaccination programme can be rolled out. While there are millions of doses of each vaccine in the country and a total of 140 million of both vaccines pre-ordered, there are currently just over one million - around 500,000 of each - ready to be given this week. NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: ""The NHS' biggest vaccination programme in history is off to a strong start, thanks to the tremendous efforts of NHS staff who have already delivered more than one million jabs."" He said the Oxford vaccine rollout was ""chalking up another world first that will protect thousands more over the coming weeks"". The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first jab approved in the UK, and more than a million people have had their first one. The first person to get the jabon 8 December, Margaret Keenan, has already had her second dose. This video can not be played Dr Nikita Kanani, NHS England's medical director for primary care, says it's crucial to get more patients the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine The Oxford jab -which was approved for use in late December- can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, making it easier to distribute and store than the Pfizer jab. It is also cheaper per dose. The UK has secured 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for most of the population. Care home residents and staff, people aged over 80, and frontline NHS staff will be first to receive it. GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there?

GPs and local vaccination services have been asked to ensure every care home resident in their local area is vaccinated by the end of January, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Some 730 vaccination sites have already been established across the UK, with the total set to surpass 1,000 later this week, the department added.

"Pupils going back to school for a new term in Cheshire Thousands of pupils have not started primary school as expected - with local closures in several parts of England. Head teachers warned of a ""confusing picture"" with some schools staying shut after teachers' union safety warnings about the risk of Covid infections. A joint letter from education unions called for a ""pause"" in reopening schools, accusing the government of ""creating chaos"". The Department for Education said closing should only be a ""last resort"". Adding to the uncertainty, some local authorities have argued against reopening and some individual primary schools have remained closed for most pupils - in addition to those schools already required to stay shut because of high coronavirus levels. There are so far no official national figures for how many schools have not have fully opened, apart from for vulnerable and key workers' children - but local reports include: more than 130 schools in Norfolk, many citing staff shortages more than 40 in Durham 21 in North Tyneside 26 in Newcastle 10 in Reading nine in Northumberland five in Oldham Health Secretary Matt Hancock said school was the ""right place"" for children, wherever possible. ""When it comes to schools, we've taken the decision not to reopen schools in some of the most affected areas. ""But these are difficult balances - and people will have very mixed emotions,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. If schools are closed, Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds has called for support for parents unable to work because of childcare problems. PM urges parents to send children to school Parents react to primaries in England reopening All London primary schools to stay closed Head teacher warns of stress of Covid on staff Council leaders question return to school Vicky Smith from Hertfordshire faces an anxious personal dilemma about sending her daughter back to primary school - as she is worried about the risk of infection to her seriously ill father, who also lives with them. ""I want to send my kids to school because all her friends are there, but what if she brings it home?,"" she says. ""Chances are if she gives it to her granddad, she might not have a granddad. It's not so much we think our children are in danger - it's the people they are going to bring it down to."" Vicky also says even in Tier 4 the current restrictions do not seem to be particularly strict. ""You can still go to work and go to school, it doesn't feel safe. ""My dad is quite happy for her to go to school, but how is she going to feel if she gives it to her granddad. I don't know what to do. ""I don't want to get a big fine and I don't want to stop her learning. But I also feelâ¦ I just don't know what to do."" Secondary schools are staying closed this week except for vulnerable and key workers' children - and in local authorities with high levels of coronavirus, including across London, primary schools are also not open to most pupils. But reopening primary schools in other areas, including for some in Tier 4, has been challenged, with the biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, calling for teaching to be moved online for the first two weeks of term. The NEU has advised teachers they can say they are not going to teach classes in school because of concerns over safety. A joint letter from education unions, including teachers and support staff, says bringing pupils back to school ""risks increasing the infection rate"" and means exposing school staff to ""serious risk of ill-health"". The letter, co-ordinated by the TUC, calls for priority access to Covid vaccines for school staff and to move lessons online ""while Covid-secure working arrangements are reviewed"". Any school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"", said Amanda Spielman, head of the Ofsted education watchdog, because ""children's lives can't just be put on hold while we wait for vaccination programmes"". But the wife of a primary school teacher in Harrow who caught Covid towards the end of last term, and was hospitalised over Christmas, said protecting staff had to be a priority. ""Teachers are passionate and loyal but somebody needs to fight for them,"" she told the BBC. Mungo Sheppard, head teacher of Ash Green primary school in Calderdale, says his school opened as planned on Monday - without staff staying away, but with higher than usual numbers of missing pupils. Of the school's 500 pupils, Mr Sheppard says 75 are off, mostly with ""Covid-related"" issues, compared with 15 absent at the end of last term. ""We also have, for the first time since September, children whose parents have taken the decision to keep them at home due to anxieties linked to the new variant and rising rates,"" he said. But the head teacher says their efforts have been hampered by last-minute decisions at a national level. ""It has been incredibly difficult to make these decisions and communicate them in a tiny timeframe and within a holiday,"" says Mr Sheppard. Unions have warned of safety risks to teachers as coronavirus cases rise across the country Some local authorities have backed schools deciding not to open - and others have questioned the decision to keep schools open in some areas, when other nearby schools have been told to shut. Kent County Council called for a delay in reopening primary schools in four parts of the county. But a message on Twitter from the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe, Damian Collins, suggested further changes were on the way. After a meeting with School Standards Minister Nick Gibb, Mr Collins said the ""decision about which schools will be required to stay open will be reviewed in the next few days by the Department for Education"". Julian Rose, head of West Chiltington School in West Sussex, has an inset day on Monday and is expecting to open on Tuesday. He says ""some very anxious"" parents have been in touch about children going back when the area is in Tier 4. ""I think many feel astonished that we are still open when operating under Tier 4,"" says Mr Rose. And he says the school will ""not have a full complement of staff in attendance"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Children's education has consistently been a national priority, which is why we want classrooms to reopen wherever possible in the new term. ""Schools will continue to implement appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission."" GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there?

"The UK's coronavirus alert level has been increased from level three to four - meaning transmission of cases is high or rising exponentially. The last time the UK was at this level was between late February and May this year. A joint statement from the UK's four chief medical officers, and NHS England director Professor Stephen Powis, said the change was ""in light of the rapid increase in Omicron cases"". The statement says: ""Transmission of Covid-19 is already high in the community, mainly still driven by Delta, but the emergence of Omicron adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services."" It added that early evidence shows Omicron was ""spreading much faster than Delta and that vaccine protection against symptomatic disease from Omicron is reduced"". ""Hospitalisations from Omicron are already occurring and these are likely to increase rapidly."" The Covid alert level system is separate and independent from any government decisions on easing or tightening restrictions. Risk levels are measured by a five-level, colour-coded alert system. The government unveiled the system in May 2020. There are five levels: Level five (red) - a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"" Level four - a high or rising level of transmission Level three - the virus is in general circulation Level two - the number of cases and transmission are low Level one (green) - Covid-19 is no longer present in the UK Covid-19's reproduction (R) number,a scientific measureof how fast the virus is spreading The number of confirmed coronavirus cases at any one time TheJoint Biosecurity Centre (JBC),external- set up by the government in the spring of 2020 - has the task of recommending what the alert level should be. JBC scientists identify changes in infection rates using testing, environmental and workplace data. The JBC also has an ""insight team"" which monitors local spikes of Covid-19 and advises health officials and local authorities. Their recommendations are then reviewed and agreed by the chief medical officers of the four UK nations. Not automatically.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces the third national lockdown Everyone in England must stay at home except for permitted reasons during a new coronavirus lockdown expected to last until mid-February, the PM says. All schools and colleges will close to most pupils and switch to remote learning from Tuesday. Boris Johnson warned the coming weeks would be the ""hardest yet"" amid surging cases and patient numbers. He said those in the top four priority groups would be offered a first vaccine dose by the middle of next month. All care home residents and their carers, everyone aged 70 and over, all frontline health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable will be offered one dose of a vaccine by mid-February. Scotland earlierissued a stay-at-home orderandWales said schools and colleges would shut until 18 Januaryfor most pupils. Schools in Northern Ireland will have an ""extended period of remote learning"",the Stormont Executive said. Schools to close and exams facing axe in England Kuenssberg: Much is an echo of March - but a lot is different too Speaking from Downing Street, Mr Johnson told the public to follow the new lockdown rules immediately, before they become law in the early hours of Wednesday. All the new measures in England will then last until at least the middle of February, he said, as anew more infectious variantof the virus spreads across the UK. The PM added that he believed the country was entering ""the last phase of the struggle"". Hospitals were under ""more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic"", he said. And he reiterated the slogan used earlier in the pandemic, urging people to immediately ""stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives"". People cannot leave their homesexcept for certain reasons, like the first lockdown last March These includeessential medical needs, food shopping, exerciseand work for those who cannot do so from home All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesdaywith remote learning until February half term Early years settings such asnurseries will stay open End-of-year examswill not take place this summer as normal Elsewhere,university students should not returnto campuses and will be taught online Restaurants can continue to offer food delivery, buttakeaway alcohol will be banned Outdoor sports venues - such asgolf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close Butoutdoor playgrounds will remain open Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such asPremier League footballcan continue On Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. A further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded. As of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. This is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high. Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be contacted by letter and should now shield once more, Mr Johnson said. Support and childcare bubbles will continue under the new measures - and people can meet one person from another household for outdoor exercise. Communal worship and life events like funerals and weddings can continue, subject to limits on attendance. While Mr Johnson said end-of-year exams would not take place as normal in the summer, he said alternative arrangements would be announced separately. The government haspublished a 22-page document,externaloutlining the new rules in detail. The House of Commons has been recalled to allow MPs to vote on the new restrictions on Wednesday. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his MPs would ""support the package of measures"", saying ""we've all got to pull together now to make this work"". Once again it is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. In England there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid since Christmas day. To put that into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled. Currently around three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease. In some hospitals it is more than six in 10. But what is worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to increase. In the spring it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak. The last six days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the UK - a number of these infections are next week's hospital admissions. It is why the UK's chief medical officers were warning there was a ""material risk"" of some hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change. Mr Johnson spoke after UK chief medical officers recommendedthe Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level. Level five means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement. NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a ""critical point"" and that ""immediate and decisive action"" was needed. Announcing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year."" For pupils who returned for their first day of the new term at primary school on Monday, it's turned out to be an extremely short-lived visit. Boris Johnson's announcement will see primary, secondary and further education colleges closed for at least the next six weeks, except for vulnerable and key workers' children. It's a much bigger shift in policy than had been anticipated, even a few days ago. Even the return date will depend on the progress in tackling the virus. ""I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term,"" said the prime minister. Keeping schools open was the government's most definite of red lines, a few weeks ago they were threatening councils that wanted to close them - but it's now been overtaken by the spiking lines on the Covid infection charts. Even after the chaos of last year's replacement grades, GCSEs and A-levels are being cancelled again - with a replacement system still to be decided. Vocational exams are to continue. For parents dreading home schooling, there are plans for it to be better supported this time - with more computer devices available and suggestions that Ofsted inspectors will check what schools are offering. But there's no escaping that this will feel like another sudden and chaotic change of direction for schools and parents. Mr Johnson's pledge on vaccinations comes after an 82-year-old retired maintenance manager became the first person in the UKto receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab Some 13.9 million people are among the four priority groups who will receive a vaccine dose by about 15 February, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said.

"This video can not be played James Shaw, from Dundee, was among the first to receive the jab The first Scottish recipients of the new Oxford University and AstraZeneca vaccine have received their jabs. James Shaw, 82, and his 82-year-old wife Malita were among the first to be vaccinated in Dundee. The couple received their first doses at Lochee Health and Community Care Centre. Nicola Sturgeon has said she hoped all over-50s and those with underlying health conditions will have been vaccinated by early May. James said: ""My wife and I are delighted to be receiving this vaccination. I have asthma and bronchitis and I have been desperate to have it so I am really pleased to be one of the first to be getting it. ""I know it takes a little while for the vaccine to work but after today I know that I will feel a bit less worried about going out. I will still be very careful and avoid busy places but knowing I have been vaccinated will really help me. ""All of my friends have said they are going to have the vaccine when it is their turn and I would encourage everyone who is offered this vaccination to take it."" James Shaw, 82, was one of the first people in Scotland to receive the AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, administered by advanced nurse practitioner Justine Williams The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine programme is being rolled out less than a week after it was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). It is the second vaccine approved for use in the UK. NHS Tayside is rolling out the vaccine through GP practices in the community and will also vaccinate elderly residents and staff in care homes. Its associate director of public health Dr Daniel Chandleris said: ""The efforts of our vaccination teams have been amazing and it is testament to a real whole team approach that sees the first over-80s in the general population have their jabs today in Tayside. ""The availability and mobility of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine gives us the opportunity to start to roll out the biggest vaccine programme that the UK has ever seen across our communities. ""Over-80s are the first priority group and patients will be contacted directly to attend a vaccination session."" Scottish cabinet to consider more Covid measures PM expects 'tens of millions' of jabs by April How mass vaccinations halted a 1950s killer virus Scottish Secretary Alister Jack added: ""This is another important moment in our fight against the virus - every vaccination takes us a step closer to getting back to our normal lives as soon as possible. ""As with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the UK is the first country in the world to approve and roll out the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, with the UK Government ordering and paying for millions of doses for people in all parts of the UK."" The milestone came as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a new stricter lockdown. With the exception of essential travel, people in mainland Scotland will have to remain at home from midnight. Statistics released on Monday showed a further 1,905 people had contracted Covid-19. Figures for hospital admissions and deaths over the holiday weekend will not be published until Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon likened the situation to a race between the vaccine and the virus. She said: ""In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they run as fast as possible. ""But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new variant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks. ""To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible. But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down."" The new vaccine will initially be available in the hospitals that have been delivering the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine, and new community settings will be able to deliver the jabs from 11 January. People in Scotland will be contacted by their health board when it is their turn to be vaccinated. The Oxford vaccination marks a major turning point in the pandemic and will lead to a massive expansion in the UK's immunisation campaign, with enough to vaccinate 50 million people throughout the UK already on order. It is easier to transport and store than the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which needs cold storage of about -70C. The Oxford vaccine is logistically much easier to distribute The UK government has said 530,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be available to the UK from Monday, with ""millions due by the beginning of February"". Scotland will ultimately get an 8.2% share of these vaccines, based on its population. Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith has said he expects the NHS in Scotland to receive 440,360 doses of the vaccine during January. The first minister said on Monday about 100,000 people in Scotland have already received a first dose of vaccine. Both vaccines require two doses to be administered with an interval ofbetween four and 12 weeks. Previously the advice was for the vaccines to have a four-week gap between doses. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) then recommended as many people as possible in the top priority groups should beoffered a first dose as the initial priority,external.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces stay at home rules in new lockdown Scots are to be ordered to stay at home amid a fresh Covid-19 lockdown which will see schools remain closed to pupils until February. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said new curbs would be introduced at midnight in a bid to contain the new, faster-spreading strain of the virus. New laws will require people to stay at home and work from home where possible. Outdoor gatherings are also to be cut back, with people only allowed to meet one person from one other household. Places of worship are to be closed, group exercise banned, and schools will largely operate via online and remote learning. These rules will apply across the Scottish mainland until at least the end of January, and will be kept under review. Island areas will remain in level three - but Ms Sturgeon said they would be monitored carefully. Live: Latest on Covid-19 in Scotland What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Prime Minister Boris Johnson later announcedsimilar lockdown measures for the whole of Englandwith all schools and colleges closing to most pupils until mid February. A further 1,905 new cases were reported in Scotland on Monday - with 15% of tests returning a positive result, something Ms Sturgeon said ""illustrates the severity and urgency of the situation"". The first minister said she was ""more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year"", with the new coronavirus strain now accounting for half of new cases. And she said a ""steeply rising trend of infections"" was threatening to put ""significant pressure"" on NHS services, saying hospitals could breach capacity within three to four weeks. The new rules - which will be put down in law - mean Scots will only be allowed to leave home for essential purposes, such as shopping for food and medicine, exercise and caring responsibilities. No limit is to be put on how many times people can go out to exercise, but outdoor meetings are to be limited to a maximum of two people from two households. Everyone who can work from home will be required to, and people in the ""shielding"" category are advised not to go in to work at all. The construction and manufacturing industries will remain open, but Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review. Places of worship are to close, the number of people who can attend weddings is to be cut to five, and funeral wakes will no longer be allowed. Schools are to remain closed to the majority of pupils until February, with Ms Sturgeon saying community transmission of the virus must be brought to a lower level amid concerns that the new variant of the virus spreads more easily among young people. She said she knew remote learning presented ""significant challenges"" for parents, teachers and pupils, adding: ""I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils are quickly as possible and then keep them open."" The first minister said she was considering whether teachers could be given the Covid-19 vaccine as a priority. More than 100,000 people have been given a first dose of the vaccine in Scotland, and the government expects to have access to just over 900,000 doses by the end of January. However Ms Sturgeon said the best way to get schools open again was to drive down transmission of the virus - urging Scots to abide by the rules. These are the toughest restrictions Scotland has faced since the lockdown of March 2020. It is - once again - becoming compulsory to stay at home except for essential purposes like food shopping, exercise and medical care. The extended closure of schools to most pupils is something the Scottish government was particularly keen to avoid. These decisions are a measure of how worried ministers are about the rapid spread of the new variant of coronavirus, which is fast becoming the dominant strain. With 225 cases per 100,000 people, Scotland is thought to be about four weeks behind London, which already has four times as many cases and NHS services under considerable pressure. The Scottish government believes that without further action the NHS here would run out of beds for Covid patients within a month. This new alert comes at the start of a new year which also brings new hope for a route out of the pandemic with two vaccines now beginning to offer protection. Around 100,000 doses have already been administered in Scotland but it is likely to take several months to reach all in the most vulnerable groups. The first minister said Scotland was now in ""a race between the vaccine and the virus"". She said: ""The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine. But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus. ""We can already see - by looking at infection rates in the south of England - some of what could happen here in Scotland. To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly. ""For government, that means introducing tough measures - as we have done today. And for all of us, it means sticking to the rules."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson raised concerns about online learning, saying it was vital that pupils had ""equal access to high-quality education"". And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers and working parents would need support to make the remote learning system work. Ms Sturgeon said her government had ""agonised"" over the decision on schools, and said the ""fundamental priority"" was to re-open them in full as soon as possible. She said: ""Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown."" The NHS has coped so far in Scotland - more so than many other parts of the UK. But in places like Glasgow and Lanarkshire it has been very, very tight. And here like everywhere else staff are bracing themselves for the post-Christmas effects of rising cases. The first minister gave some stark figures on hospital and ICU occupancy - suggesting we are just weeks away from reaching limits. There is so little give in the system they will be glad to see everything possible done to prevent stretched services being overwhelmed at a time when we are on our way to getting out the other side. There is real anxiety about what the next few weeks might bring. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces the third national lockdown Everyone in England must stay at home except for permitted reasons during a new coronavirus lockdown expected to last until mid-February, the PM says. All schools and colleges will close to most pupils and switch to remote learning from Tuesday. Boris Johnson warned the coming weeks would be the ""hardest yet"" amid surging cases and patient numbers. He said those in the top four priority groups would be offered a first vaccine dose by the middle of next month. All care home residents and their carers, everyone aged 70 and over, all frontline health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable will be offered one dose of a vaccine by mid-February. Scotland earlierissued a stay-at-home orderandWales said schools and colleges would shut until 18 Januaryfor most pupils. Schools in Northern Ireland will have an ""extended period of remote learning"",the Stormont Executive said. Schools to close and exams facing axe in England Kuenssberg: Much is an echo of March - but a lot is different too Speaking from Downing Street, Mr Johnson told the public to follow the new lockdown rules immediately, before they become law in the early hours of Wednesday. All the new measures in England will then last until at least the middle of February, he said, as anew more infectious variantof the virus spreads across the UK. The PM added that he believed the country was entering ""the last phase of the struggle"". Hospitals were under ""more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic"", he said. And he reiterated the slogan used earlier in the pandemic, urging people to immediately ""stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives"". People cannot leave their homesexcept for certain reasons, like the first lockdown last March These includeessential medical needs, food shopping, exerciseand work for those who cannot do so from home All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesdaywith remote learning until February half term Early years settings such asnurseries will stay open End-of-year examswill not take place this summer as normal Elsewhere,university students should not returnto campuses and will be taught online Restaurants can continue to offer food delivery, buttakeaway alcohol will be banned Outdoor sports venues - such asgolf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close Butoutdoor playgrounds will remain open Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such asPremier League footballcan continue On Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. A further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded. As of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. This is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high. Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be contacted by letter and should now shield once more, Mr Johnson said. Support and childcare bubbles will continue under the new measures - and people can meet one person from another household for outdoor exercise. Communal worship and life events like funerals and weddings can continue, subject to limits on attendance. While Mr Johnson said end-of-year exams would not take place as normal in the summer, he said alternative arrangements would be announced separately. The government haspublished a 22-page document,externaloutlining the new rules in detail. The House of Commons has been recalled to allow MPs to vote on the new restrictions on Wednesday. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his MPs would ""support the package of measures"", saying ""we've all got to pull together now to make this work"". Once again it is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. In England there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid since Christmas day. To put that into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled. Currently around three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease. In some hospitals it is more than six in 10. But what is worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to increase. In the spring it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak. The last six days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the UK - a number of these infections are next week's hospital admissions. It is why the UK's chief medical officers were warning there was a ""material risk"" of some hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change. Mr Johnson spoke after UK chief medical officers recommendedthe Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level. Level five means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement. NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a ""critical point"" and that ""immediate and decisive action"" was needed. Announcing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year."" For pupils who returned for their first day of the new term at primary school on Monday, it's turned out to be an extremely short-lived visit. Boris Johnson's announcement will see primary, secondary and further education colleges closed for at least the next six weeks, except for vulnerable and key workers' children. It's a much bigger shift in policy than had been anticipated, even a few days ago. Even the return date will depend on the progress in tackling the virus. ""I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term,"" said the prime minister. Keeping schools open was the government's most definite of red lines, a few weeks ago they were threatening councils that wanted to close them - but it's now been overtaken by the spiking lines on the Covid infection charts. Even after the chaos of last year's replacement grades, GCSEs and A-levels are being cancelled again - with a replacement system still to be decided. Vocational exams are to continue. For parents dreading home schooling, there are plans for it to be better supported this time - with more computer devices available and suggestions that Ofsted inspectors will check what schools are offering. But there's no escaping that this will feel like another sudden and chaotic change of direction for schools and parents. Mr Johnson's pledge on vaccinations comes after an 82-year-old retired maintenance manager became the first person in the UKto receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab Some 13.9 million people are among the four priority groups who will receive a vaccine dose by about 15 February, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said.

"This video can not be played Eileen Lynch, 94, was the first person in Northern Ireland to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine Up to 11,000 people aged over 80 across Northern Ireland are set to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine this week. The aim is to ensure everyone in that age group will be offered the vaccine by the end of January. Thirty GP practices will be administering 50,000 doses of the vaccine, which wasapproved for use in the UK on 30 December. It is the second vaccine to be approved in the battle against coronavirus in Northern Ireland. It comes ahead of a UK-wide announcement by the prime minister, set to be made at 20:00 GMT on Monday, in which further restrictions will be announced. In a statement, a No 10 spokesman said the new variant of Covid-19 had ""led to rapidly escalating case numbers across the country"" and ""further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise"". On Monday, Northern Ireland recorded a further 1,801 Covid-19 cases and 12 more virus-related deaths. These latest figures from the Department of Health bring the total number of deaths to 1,366, while 79,873 people have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic started. More than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the week before. The seven-day rate per 100,000 people is now 660 positive cases, compared to 200 per 100,000 two weeks ago. Medical experts believe that is down to the two-week easing of restrictions over the Christmas period. In the Republic of Ireland on Monday, an additional 6,110 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were announced, with six further deaths linked to the virus. Northern Ireland is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed. 82-year-old first to get Oxford Covid vaccine When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered The first doses of the vaccine were given delivered at a GP surgery on the Falls Road in West Belfast on Monday afternoon. The first person in Northern Ireland to receive the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine was 94-year-old Eileen Lynch. Speaking after receiving the vaccine, Ms Lynch said she was ""delighted and privileged"" to receive it. ""I feel like I can really look forward to the year ahead now that I have been vaccinated,"" she said. The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has already been used tovaccinate care home residentsand staff. By mid December, 50,000 doses of that vaccine had been made available and by 30 December, Northern Ireland's Department of Health reported that 33,000 people had been vaccinated. This included 8,940 care home residents, 10,484 care home staff and 14,259 health and social care staff. According to the latest NI statistics, for the first time the percentage positive cases in the over 80s is down - an indication the vaccination process is working. There are approximately 82,000 people over 80 in NI and BBC News NI understands that if deliveries of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine happen as planned, it is thought that all of those over 80, as well as GPs and their staff, could be vaccinated within three weeks. While 50,000 doses have been delivered to Northern Ireland, a further 23,000 vaccines are expected on 19 January while another 68,000 are due on 24 January. Dr Alan Stout, who is a GP in Belfast, told BBC News NI that members are ""very optimistic"" that 11,000 people can be vaccinated this week. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is the second coronavirus vaccine to be approved in the UK NI's chief medical officer said the Oxford-AstraZeneca rollout would run alongside the ongoing vaccination programme. Dr Michael McBride said: ""First and foremost we must act to protect those most at risk of severe disease and death. ""The evidence shows that the initial dose of vaccine offers as much as 70% protection against the effects of the virus. ""Providing that level of protection on a large scale will have the greatest impact on reducing mortality and hospitalisations, protecting the health and social care system."" The Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine has to be kept at an extremely low temperature which complicates handling constraints. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is considered easier to store and distribute. Its rollout consists of two full doses of the vaccine, with the second dose to be given four to 12 weeks after the first. What you need to know about vaccine safety How do the Covid vaccines compare? How effective is the Oxford vaccine? GPs are appealing to the public to remain calm and wait to be called for their vaccine either by telephone or by letter. Dr Stout said as demand grows worldwide for the vaccine, that schedule could easily change. ""The public have to be patient, we have a system and must be allowed to get on with it - it really is 'don't call us - we will call you'."" While some vaccinations will take place in surgeries others will happen in a drive-through system. Covid-19 is deadlier than flu, which means January 2021 is going to be even tougher than usual. Also, Covid patients tend to stay much longer in hospital with more severe symptoms requiring additional beds and care. But those rising patient numbers aren't matched by an increased workforce. Instead it is expected that the nurse-patient ratio will increase (even though many aren't trained to work in critical care) as there simply aren't enough nurses available. Some health unions fear this will only add to Northern Ireland's excess mortality rate, which is greater than that in Great Britain. Once again, this highlights Northern Ireland's failing health care system, which was already below par well before the start of the pandemic. Coronavirus infection figures here are expected to peak between 15 and 21 January. That will be felt not only in hospitals but also in GP practices as they continue to roll out the vaccine. While at this stage the six weeks look bleak it's hoped that the additional Astra-Zeneca vaccine and the low incidence of flu will go a long way in not only saving lives, but also protecting the health service. Dr Stout said much planning had gone into ensuring the programme happened as smoothly as possible. ""People will literally stay in their cars and be asked to roll up their sleeves - it has to be safe and efficient in order for us to get through it and safely."" The UK has ordered 100 million doses of the new vaccine - enough to vaccinate 50 million people. Meanwhile, Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, said it was ""appalling"" that the Pfizer vaccine was not to be administered in two doses within 21 days as instructed by the company and threatened legal action. Dr Black was responding to news that the UK willgive both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart. ""They have left care workers in Northern Ireland with a gap in their expected immunity,"" he told BBC NI's Radio Foyle on Monday. ""In that period doctors, nurses, porters or health care professionals could infect patients because they will not be protected against the transmission of the infection to patients."" The UK's chief medical officers have defended their Covid vaccination plan. They said getting more people vaccinated with the first jab was ""much more preferable"" and that the great majority of the initial protection from clinical disease is after the first dose of vaccine. Dr Black is to meet NI Health Minister Robin Swann later to express health care workers' concern over the change in vaccine policy. TEACHERS:Are they are at risk with schools reopening?

"The firing of Google AI research scientist Timnit Gebru provoked outcry More than 200 workers at Google-parent Alphabet have taken steps to form a labour union in a rare development for an American tech giant. They said the organisation will give staff greater power to voice concerns about discriminatory work practices at the firm and how it handles issues like online hate speech. The move follows walkouts and other actions by staff in recent years. Google said it would ""continue engaging directly with all our employees"". ""We've always worked hard to create a supportive and rewarding workplace for our workforce,"" Kara Silverstein, director of people operations, said in a statement. ""Of course our employees have protected labour rights that we support. But as we've always done, we'll continue engaging directly with all our employees"". The announcement of the Alphabet Workers Union comes weeks afterGoogle's firing of a high-profile black artificial intelligence and ethics researcher generated uproar. The US National Labor Relations Board also recentlyruled the firm had unlawfully fired employees for attempting to organise a union. Google staff stage a walkout in 2018 over the company's handling of sexual misconduct allegations Staff have also mobilised against the firm's ""Project Maven"" work with the Department of Defense and the company's handling of sexual harassment complaints. ""This union builds upon years of courageous organizing by Google workers,"" Nicki Anselmo, program manager,said in the announcement,external. ""From fighting the 'real names' policy, to opposing Project Maven, to protesting the egregious, multi-million dollar payouts that have been given to executives who've committed sexual harassment, we've seen first-hand that Alphabet responds when we act collectively. ""Our new union provides a sustainable structure to ensure that our shared values as Alphabet employees are respected even after the headlines fade."" The group was organised by software engineers but is open to all ranks at the company's US and Canadian workforce, including temporary workers and contractors. It is affiliated with the larger labour group, Communication Workers of America, but is not seeking formal recognition from the federal government, limiting its bargaining power. It represents a small fraction of Alphabet's workforce, which includes more than 130,000 people as of September and roughly as many contractors, vendors and temporary staff. Members who join will contribute about 1% of their compensation to the effort. ""We want Alphabet to be a company where workers have a meaningful say in decisions that affect us and the societies we live in,"" organisers wrote on Twitter.

"PM Boris Johnson announces new lockdown for England in a televised address People in England are told to work from home after a sharp rise in coronavirus cases All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesday with remote learning until February half term End-of-year exams will not take place this summer as normal PM suggests England could ""steadily"" move out of lockdown from mid-February People in Scotland will also be legally required to stay at home - except for essential purposes - from midnight tonight Most schools in Scotland will remain closed until 1 February ""Material risk"" of NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days say chief medical officers The newly-approved coronavirus vaccine created by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is being rolled out across the UK today Globally more than 85 million cases of Covid have been reported and 1.84 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Vanessa Barford and Sarah Fowler Thanks for joining us. Updates were brought to you today by Claire Heald, Vanessa Barford, James Clarke, Doug Faulkner, Becky Morton, Mary
OâConnor, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Jen Meierhans, George Wright, Katie Wright, Victoria Bisset and Sarah Fowler. We're about to close the live page now, but before we go, here's a quick re-cap of the key points from Boris Johnson's speech:  Business leaders are reacting with concern to the fresh lockdown announced by Boris Johnson amid fears that companies may not last until the spring. British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall says: ""Businesses will understand why the prime minister has felt compelled to act on the spiralling threat to public health, but they will be baffled and disappointed by the fact that he did not announce additional support for affected businesses alongside these new restrictions. Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of London First, says: ""The Government must now extend business rates and VAT relief throughout 2021 and stand ready to pump further direct support to businesses forced to close.""  Now for some more reaction to the news that schools will be moving to remote learning for most pupils under England's new lockdown measures. Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union: âNo one wanted schools and colleges to be shut again but the evidence clearly pointed to the necessity for this to happen weeks ago. ""Why Boris Johnson allowed such confusion and chaos to build up around school openings before making this belated, blindingly obvious decision is beyond belief. ""Government must take responsibility for this closure because it has allowed Covid-19 to become, again, out of control.â Reality Check Boris
Johnson said that the UK has vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe
combined. As of 27
December, 944,539 people in the UK had received the first dose of the Covid-19
vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. The latest
data from 22 of the EU's 27 member states, collected by Our World in Data, shows 682,279 vaccinations have
been carried out so far. As each EU
member state publishes its own statistics, some of this data goes up to early
January but some only to late December. Germany is
leading the EU, having vaccinated 265,610 people as of 3 January. France though
had only vaccinated 516 citizens by 1 January and the Netherlands won't begin
vaccinations till 8 January. The UK
started vaccinating citizens with the Pfizer jab on 8 December, while the EU vaccine
rollout began on 27 December. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Egyptian authorities
are denying claims that at least six Covid-19 patients died in two government
hospitals over the past two days due to a lack of oxygen. It follows anger aftera video of nurses in intensive care units struggling to keep patients alive,externalwas
widely shared on social media. At one point, a nurse in
blue PPE can be seen crumpled over on the floor in apparent shock. The voice of
the person filming repeats: âAll those in the intensive care are dead... there is
no oxygen.â In a statement on Facebook,external, Egyptâs health ministry spokesman said there were sufficient oxygen supplies at all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. He said that most of the deaths at two hospitals in the north of the country - Al-Husseiniya and Zefta - were patients already suffering from chronic diseases. The ministry spokesman called on the media not to spread âinaccurate or false information that may cause panic among people"". In Egypt, there have been 142,187 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 7,805 deaths. However, many experts suspect the actual figures are far higher. The government has now publishedfull guidance,externalon what people are allowed to do in England under the new national lockdown. Here's a quick summary of the new rules: Cyprus and Brazil  have become the latest countries to identify the new coronavirus variant, which was first discovered in the UK. In total, more than 30 countries around the world have seen cases involving the new strain, including: Sir Keir Starmer said the most important thing is the messaging about 'stay at home' and going back to the spirit of March ""because a lot is now going to depend on the willingness of people to comply and I urge everyone to comply"". He adds: ""We have to rekindle that spirit and I think that in a way we need to remake that contract with the British people, in return for you enduring these measures now for the coming weeks the vaccine must be rolled out at speed. We need this to be mission critical. We were the first country to get the vaccine and we need to be the first country to have the vaccine programme rolled out."" Reality Check We know that the UK is going to
threat level 5, the highest level, which means there is a danger of the NHS
being overwhelmed within 21 days. When the prime minister announced
these threat levels in May he was clear that during the first lockdown the country
had only been in level four. At the time he also said:,externalâThe
higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.â So on that basis should we have expected tighter restrictions in England than we saw during the
first lockdown in March? If anything, the restrictions
appear slightly less severe. For example, support bubbles and childcare bubbles
exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds will be open when they were closed
last time. Communal worship is still
allowed as long as social distancing is observed. One significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops, public transport or places of worship. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The lockdown announcement
contained the clearest indication yet of how quickly the government hopes to
vaccinate the at risk groups. A target of mid February for
vaccinating all the over 70s and those deemed extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care
staff opens up a pathway to a significant easing of restrictions by the start of
March. But it will require a rapid
acceleration in vaccination rates. So far nearly one million
people have been vaccinated. By the end of the week that
number is expected to double. The hope is that later in
January two million doses a week will be given. That will be the minimum needed
â there are around 12 million in those priority groups. By vaccinating them, there is
the potential to prevent close to nine in 10 deaths. But achieving that requires a
lot to go right. There is enough vaccine in
the country to vaccinate that many people, but not all of it has been through
the final âfill and finishâ process which involves packaging it in glass vials
(and there is a shortage of those) and then the batches have to be checked and
signed off by the regulator â a process that is taking weeks at the moment. And all of that is before it
is sent out to the NHS vaccination centres to inject it into peopleâs arms. The Labour leader say it's time for everyone to pull together. Sir Keir Starmer says: ""The situation we are in is obviously very serious, the figures are very stark and these measures are necessary, sadly, and therefore we support the packages of measures that the prime minister has just outlined. ""And I think whatever our criticisms and challenges of the government we've all got to pull together now to make this work over the next few weeks and months. ""It's going to be a very, very difficult period, there are questions about the timing of decisions etc but now is the time to support this package, pull together and try do everything we can to try and make this work."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Itâs a familiar mantra but one that many hoped had been left in
the past.Stay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives.That was the key,
simple message when the first lockdown was introduced back in March. It was
well understood and big news in England when the government decided to modify
it. But now, itâs back. And, as in Tier 4, the Stay at Home message will be
legally enforceable. While saying that the new
variant means there needs to be another lockdown, the prime minister is also
trying to emphasise a hope that didnât exist before, back in March. Specifically, the vaccine. Significantly, heâs outlined an ambition that the
top four priority groups will have received their first dose by mid-February.
However, as weâve learnt so many times, caution can be the watchword when it
comes to coronavirus. But ministers do want to keep emphasising that there is
hope, amidst all the gloom. The prime minister says by the middle of February, ""if things go well"", the government expects to have
offered a first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups. This includes vaccinating all residents in a care home for
older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70 and all frontline health
and social care workers If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups âwe will have removed
huge numbers of people from the path of the virus"", he says. ""That will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have
endured for so long."" Johnson stresses there will remain a time lag of two to
three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity, and there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted. ""So we
should remain cautious about the timetable ahead,"" he adds. ""But if
our understanding of the virus doesnât change dramatically once again, if the
rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful, if
deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect, and,
critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules, then I
hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February
half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers."" The PM says the weeks ahead ""will be the hardest yet"". ""But I really do believe we are entering the last phase of the struggle because with every jab that goes into our arms we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people,"" he says. ""Thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight but we know exactly how we are going to get there."" The PM addresses people across the UK, saying he knows how ""tough this is"" and how ""frustrated"" people are. But he says ""now, more than ever, we must pull together"". Mr Johnson says people should follow the new rules from now, which  will become law in the early hours of Wednesday
morning and parliament will meet remotely later that day. He says the governments of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland
share his ""conviction"" that this is a ""pivotal moment"" and were taking similar steps to contain the spread of the virus. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Once again it
is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. In England
there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid
since Christmas day. To put that
into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled. Currently around
three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease. In some
hospitals it is more than six in 10. But what is
worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to
increase. In the spring
it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak. The last six
days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the
UK â a number of these infections are next weekâs hospital admissions. It is why the
UKâs chief medical officers were warning there was a âmaterial riskâ of some
hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change. The PM repeats the advice of the UK's chief medical officers that the nation's Covid alert level should move to level 5 - ""meaning that if action is not taken, NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days"". He adds though, that there is ""one huge difference"" compared to last time, saying the UK is ""rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in its history"" and had so far ""vaccinated more people than in the rest of Europe combined"". He says the ""pace of vaccination is accelerating"" thanks to the arrival of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which patients began receiving earlier today.  The prime minister says he ""completely understands the inconvenience and distress"" the disruption to education will cause parents and pupils. But he says the government has been doing ""everything in our power to keep schools
openâ because of the importance of education to childrenâs
life chances. ""The problem is not that schools are unsafe for children,"" he says, adding that children are still very unlikely to be severely affected even by the new variant of Covid. But he says schools may act as ""vectors for transmission"", causing the virus to spread between households. The prime minister adds that given the alarming figures, it had become ""clear that we need to do more"" to bring the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant ""under control"" and help the vaccination roll-out in the UK. He says we must therefore go into a national lockdown, with the government once more telling people to stay at home, except for specific reasons, including essential shopping, to work, if you cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical help, and to escape domestic abuse. He says the government will be advising clinical extremely people to begin shielding again. Primary and secondary schools must move to remote learning from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and those of key workers, he adds. Given this, it is not ""fair"" for all exams to go ahead this summer, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"The UK's coronavirus alert level has been increased from level three to four - meaning transmission of cases is high or rising exponentially. The last time the UK was at this level was between late February and May this year. A joint statement from the UK's four chief medical officers, and NHS England director Professor Stephen Powis, said the change was ""in light of the rapid increase in Omicron cases"". The statement says: ""Transmission of Covid-19 is already high in the community, mainly still driven by Delta, but the emergence of Omicron adds additional and rapidly increasing risk to the public and healthcare services."" It added that early evidence shows Omicron was ""spreading much faster than Delta and that vaccine protection against symptomatic disease from Omicron is reduced"". ""Hospitalisations from Omicron are already occurring and these are likely to increase rapidly."" The Covid alert level system is separate and independent from any government decisions on easing or tightening restrictions. Risk levels are measured by a five-level, colour-coded alert system. The government unveiled the system in May 2020. There are five levels: Level five (red) - a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"" Level four - a high or rising level of transmission Level three - the virus is in general circulation Level two - the number of cases and transmission are low Level one (green) - Covid-19 is no longer present in the UK Covid-19's reproduction (R) number,a scientific measureof how fast the virus is spreading The number of confirmed coronavirus cases at any one time TheJoint Biosecurity Centre (JBC),external- set up by the government in the spring of 2020 - has the task of recommending what the alert level should be. JBC scientists identify changes in infection rates using testing, environmental and workplace data. The JBC also has an ""insight team"" which monitors local spikes of Covid-19 and advises health officials and local authorities. Their recommendations are then reviewed and agreed by the chief medical officers of the four UK nations. Not automatically.

"Fully jabbed travellers arriving in the UK from Francehave to quarantine, because of the Beta variant. The government is concerned jabs may not work as well against the variant. French authorities say most cases are from the overseas territories of La Reunion and Mayotte, rather than mainland France. How have summer holiday rules changed? Your travel guide to seven Mediterranean countries Beta, also known as 501.V2 or B.1.351, has some significant genetic changes that experts are studying. It was first identified in South Africa. All viruses, including the one that causes Covid-19, constantly mutate into new versions or variants. These tiny genetic changes happen as the virus makes new copies of itself to spread and thrive. Most are inconsequential, and a few can even be harmful to the virus's survival, but some variants can make the virus more infectious or threatening to the host - humans. How worrying are the Covid variants? Some of the changes Beta has undergone involve the virus's spike protein - the part that gains the virus entry into human cells. It is also the bit that vaccines are designed around, which is why experts are concerned about these particular mutations. Beta, along with a few other variants of coronavirus, such as Delta and Alpha, have been labelled ""variants of concern"". These have some worrying changes experts want to keep a very close eye on. Beta carries a mutation, called N501Y, which appears to make it more contagious or easy to spread. Another mutation, called E484K, could help the virus dodge a person's immune system, and may affect how well vaccines work. There is no evidence that the South Africa variant causes more serious illness for the vast majority of people. As with the original version, the risk is still highest for elderly people and those with significant underlying health conditions. When will I get a Covid vaccine? Which children are being vaccinated and why? Vaccines are designed around original Covid, rather than new variants. There is some evidence they are less effective at stopping Beta infections. But experts say they should still work to stop severe illness. Trials ofNovavax,external,Janssen,externaland theOxford/AstraZeneca vaccinesin South Africa suggest the variant can overcome some built-up immunity Another study,external, also in South Africa, found the AstraZeneca vaccine was only 10% effective against mild-to-moderate Beta infections Areal-world data study in Israel,external- not yet peer-reviewed - found some people who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine still caught Beta Lab results from Modernasuggest its shot works against the South Africa variant, although the immune response may not be as strong or prolonged Data on Moderna use in Qatar,externalsuggests two doses is more than 96% effective against symptomatic Covid caused by Beta Data from the Pfizer rollout in Qatar,external, suggests immunisation is 97% effective at stopping severe cases of Beta Even in the worst case scenario, vaccines can be redesigned and tweaked to provide a better match in a matter or weeks or months, if necessary. Atrial of a new version of the AstraZeneca vaccine,external, designed against Beta, has begun in the UK. Some of the other Covid vaccines are also being updated. The Beta variant has been identified in more than 50 countries around the world. So far, theUK has recorded just over 1,000 cases,externalof Beta. That's a tiny fraction of all Covid cases. Another variant, called Delta, currently makes up more than 99% of Covid seen in the UK. South Africa hasreported higher cases of Beta.,external Covid map: Where are cases the highest? When it was first identified in the UK, the government recommendedsurge testing in the communityin some regions to help stop the spread. A system of foreign travel restrictions has also been introduced to minimise the chance of UK travellers spreading Beta as well as other variants of concern. Although adults who were fully jabbed in the UKnow no longer need to quarantine on return from amber list countries, double vaccinated travellers returning to England and Wales from France will still have to self-isolate for ten days. They will also have to take two PCR tests to ensure they are not infectious.

"Assange pictured leaving court in January a year ago Wikileaks founder Julian Assange cannot be extradited to the United States, a court in London has ruled. The judge blocked the request because of concerns over Mr Assange's mental health and risk of suicide in the US. Mr Assange, who is wanted over the publication of thousands of classified documents in 2010 and 2011, says the case is politically motivated. Expressing disappointment at the ruling, the US justice department noted that its legal arguments had prevailed. Profile: Julian Assange How the UK decides whether to extradite Assange Its position is that the leaks broke the law and endangered lives. ""While we are extremely disappointed in the court's ultimate decision, we are gratified that the United States prevailed on every point of law raised,"" the justice department said. The US authorities have 14 days in which to lodge an appeal and are expected to do so. Mr Assange appeared at the Old Bailey on Monday Mr Assange will now be taken back to Belmarsh Prison - where he is being held - and a full application for his bail will be made on Wednesday. His lawyer Ed Fitzgerald QC told the court there would be evidence to show Mr Assange would not abscond. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that while US prosecutors had met the tests for Mr Assange to be extradited for trial, the US was incapable of preventing him from attempting to take his own life. Outlining evidence of his self-harm and suicidal thoughts, she said: ""The overall impression is of a depressed and sometimes despairing man fearful for his future."" She said: ""Faced with the conditions of near total isolation without the protective factors which limited his risk at HMP Belmarsh, I am satisfied the procedures described by the US will not prevent Mr Assange from finding a way to commit suicide and for this reason I have decided extradition would be oppressive by reason of mental harm and I order his discharge."" Mr Assange's partner, lawyer Stella Moris, said ""today's victory is a first step towards justice"" Mr Assange, who wore a blue suit and green face mask in the dock, closed his eyes as the judge read out her ruling on Monday. His fiancee Stella Moris, with whom he has two young sons, wept and was comforted by Wikileaks editor-in-chief Kristinn Hrafnsson, who sat next to her in court. Speaking outside court after the ruling, she called on the US president to ""end this now"". ""Mr President, tear down these prison walls,"" she said. ""Let our little boys have their father. Free Julian, free the press, free us all."" This video can not be played Julian Assangeâs fiancÃ©e says she dreaded going public with their relationship District Judge Vanessa Baraitser explicitly concluded that Mr Assange should answer allegations that he aided and abetted hacking, theft and the disclosure of the identities of informants working for the US security agencies - disclosures that endangered their lives. In English law, that would be enough for him to be charged with a crime here - and so the route was open for Mr Assange to face trial for the same in the United States. But British extradition law also requires a judge to consider Mr Assange's health. And it's the effect of his possible detention in near-solitary confinement in a ""supermax"" prison that proved decisive. The US, in the judge's conclusion, can't stop a mentally unwell man taking his own life in those conditions. And so the legal requirement to treat Mr Assange humanely trumps the seriousness of the case that the judge acknowledges he should answer. When the US appeals - it'll have to convince more senior judges otherwise. If convicted in the US, Mr Assange faces a possible penalty of up to 175 years in jail, his lawyers have said. However the US government said the sentence was more likely to be between four and six years. Mr Assange faces an 18-count indictment from the US government, accusing him of conspiring to hack into US military databases to acquire sensitive secret information relating to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, which was then published on the Wikileaks website. He says the information exposed abuses by the US military. But US prosecutors say the leaks of classified material endangered lives, and so the US sought his extradition from the UK. Extradition is the process under which one country can ask another to hand over a suspect to face trial. Following the judgement, several politicians and organisations welcomed the news, although some expressed dismay that the ruling was made on health grounds: Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he had instructed his foreign minister to offer political asylum to Mr Assange who ""is a journalist and deserves a chance"" ""Good news Julian Assange's extradition has been blocked,"" saidUK Conservative MP David Davis on Twitter.,external""Extradition treaties should not be used for political prosecutions"" Former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyncalled it,external""good news"" but said it was ""alarming that the judge has accepted US government arguments threatening freedom of speech and freedom to publish"" Supporters of Mr Assange gathered outside the Old Bailey on Monday Amnesty International welcomed the ruling but criticised the UK for ""having engaged in this politically-motivated process at the behest of the USA and putting media freedom and freedom of expression on trial"" The head of the National Union of Journalists, Michelle Stanistreet, said the outcome was ""the right one"" but the judgment contained ""much that is troubling"" Journalist and documentary maker John Pilger, who has been a vocal campaigner for Mr Assange,tweeted,externalthat it was ""wonderful"", adding the UK ruling was a ""face-saving cover for the British to justify their disgraceful political trial of Assange on America's behalf"" This video can not be played Julian Assange's father fears 'worried' son's extradition Mr Assange was jailed for 50 weeks in May 2019 for breaching his bail conditions after going into hiding in the Ecuadorian embassy in London. He sought refuge in the embassy for seven years from 2012 until he was arrested in April 2019. At the time he fled to the embassy, he had been facing extradition to Sweden on allegations of sexual assault which he denied. That case was later dropped.

"First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill met throughout Monday There will be an extended period of remote learning for schools in Northern Ireland, the executive has said. Ministers met on Monday night asother parts of the UK tightened their coronavirus restrictions. The Stormont executive also plans to give its stay at home guidance legal force, with new restrictions on travel. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said details would be formalised on Tuesday. The health and education ministers will bring separate papers on the issues to the executive at the meeting, she added. Northern Ireland's Education Minister Peter Weir had previously announceda staggered return to school for pupilsduring the month of January. The first transfer test, used by many grammar schools to select pupils, is due to take place on Saturday but there have beencalls from some teaching unions and political partiesfor the test to be cancelled this year, in light of the uncertainty with the pandemic. In England,all schools and colleges will close to most pupilsand switch to remote learning until the middle of February, and end-of-year exams will not take place this summer as normal. Recommendations on exams in Northern Ireland are also expected to be brought forward by the executive on Tuesday. It is understood ministers will update the assembly on Wednesday about their decisions. First Minister Arlene Foster said the new restrictions were unfortunate, but necessary. She said she believed the stay-at-home message will be in place ""for the rest of January, probably into February"". ""We will of course review it, as we're legally bound to do every couple of weeks."" She added that ministers would ""much prefer"" for face-to-face education to continue, but said they had to ""take into account the very serious situation that we find ourselves in tonight."" Both organisations which organise transfer tests will be making announcements on Tuesday, she said. ""We'll wait to hear what they have to say. They do of course have to abide by public health advice, but they are private organisations and they will make their own announcements.""

In the Republic of Ireland on Monday, an additional 6,110 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were announced, with six further deaths linked to the virus. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has alreadyannounced a fresh lockdown therefrom midnight, with schools closed until February.

"Economy Minister Diane Dodds has written to Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Gove to call for urgent action to be taken on deliveries to NI. Since Christmas some orders have been cancelled or delayed and some retailers have suspended deliveries. The problem is related to uncertainty about post-Brexit transition rules. HM Customs announced a grace period on New Year's Eve confirming most parcels from GB-NI will not need customs declarations until at least April. The problems have not affected all companies with many continuing to take orders and deliver as normal. However, some companies had already suspended deliveries, including John Lewis. The government said the three-month grace period ""recognises the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, the impacts of any disruption to parcel movements in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic and specific challenges for operators moving express consignments"". A government spokesman said further details will be published in the new year, adding: ""Our priority is to have a pragmatic approach that allows us to comply with the [Northern Ireland] Protocol without causing undue disruption to businesses and citizens. ""HMRC is engaging with operators to finalise arrangements."" 'No customs declarations' for GB to NI parcels Brexit: How Northern Ireland is different Some changes have already come into effect. A Northern Ireland-based business receiving goods valued at Â£135 or more through an express carrier or Royal Mail will need to submit a customs declaration. They will need to do this within three months of receiving the goods and can use the government's Trader Support Service to do so. Excise goods, which mostly refers to alcoholic drinks, will also need a declaration when being sent from GB to NI. The government has advised retailers of those goods to contact their delivery company. It said: ""They will then tell you if they carry the type of goods you want to send and, if they do, they will ask you to provide any additional information that they need so that a declaration can be made.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson announces the third national lockdown Everyone in England must stay at home except for permitted reasons during a new coronavirus lockdown expected to last until mid-February, the PM says. All schools and colleges will close to most pupils and switch to remote learning from Tuesday. Boris Johnson warned the coming weeks would be the ""hardest yet"" amid surging cases and patient numbers. He said those in the top four priority groups would be offered a first vaccine dose by the middle of next month. All care home residents and their carers, everyone aged 70 and over, all frontline health and social care workers, and the clinically extremely vulnerable will be offered one dose of a vaccine by mid-February. Scotland earlierissued a stay-at-home orderandWales said schools and colleges would shut until 18 Januaryfor most pupils. Schools in Northern Ireland will have an ""extended period of remote learning"",the Stormont Executive said. Schools to close and exams facing axe in England Kuenssberg: Much is an echo of March - but a lot is different too Speaking from Downing Street, Mr Johnson told the public to follow the new lockdown rules immediately, before they become law in the early hours of Wednesday. All the new measures in England will then last until at least the middle of February, he said, as anew more infectious variantof the virus spreads across the UK. The PM added that he believed the country was entering ""the last phase of the struggle"". Hospitals were under ""more pressure from Covid than at any time since the start of the pandemic"", he said. And he reiterated the slogan used earlier in the pandemic, urging people to immediately ""stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives"". People cannot leave their homesexcept for certain reasons, like the first lockdown last March These includeessential medical needs, food shopping, exerciseand work for those who cannot do so from home All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesdaywith remote learning until February half term Early years settings such asnurseries will stay open End-of-year examswill not take place this summer as normal Elsewhere,university students should not returnto campuses and will be taught online Restaurants can continue to offer food delivery, buttakeaway alcohol will be banned Outdoor sports venues - such asgolf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close Butoutdoor playgrounds will remain open Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such asPremier League footballcan continue On Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. A further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded. As of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. This is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high. Those who are clinically extremely vulnerable will be contacted by letter and should now shield once more, Mr Johnson said. Support and childcare bubbles will continue under the new measures - and people can meet one person from another household for outdoor exercise. Communal worship and life events like funerals and weddings can continue, subject to limits on attendance. While Mr Johnson said end-of-year exams would not take place as normal in the summer, he said alternative arrangements would be announced separately. The government haspublished a 22-page document,externaloutlining the new rules in detail. The House of Commons has been recalled to allow MPs to vote on the new restrictions on Wednesday. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his MPs would ""support the package of measures"", saying ""we've all got to pull together now to make this work"". Once again it is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. In England there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid since Christmas day. To put that into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled. Currently around three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease. In some hospitals it is more than six in 10. But what is worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to increase. In the spring it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak. The last six days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the UK - a number of these infections are next week's hospital admissions. It is why the UK's chief medical officers were warning there was a ""material risk"" of some hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change. Mr Johnson spoke after UK chief medical officers recommendedthe Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level. Level five means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement. NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a ""critical point"" and that ""immediate and decisive action"" was needed. Announcing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year."" For pupils who returned for their first day of the new term at primary school on Monday, it's turned out to be an extremely short-lived visit. Boris Johnson's announcement will see primary, secondary and further education colleges closed for at least the next six weeks, except for vulnerable and key workers' children. It's a much bigger shift in policy than had been anticipated, even a few days ago. Even the return date will depend on the progress in tackling the virus. ""I hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February half term,"" said the prime minister. Keeping schools open was the government's most definite of red lines, a few weeks ago they were threatening councils that wanted to close them - but it's now been overtaken by the spiking lines on the Covid infection charts. Even after the chaos of last year's replacement grades, GCSEs and A-levels are being cancelled again - with a replacement system still to be decided. Vocational exams are to continue. For parents dreading home schooling, there are plans for it to be better supported this time - with more computer devices available and suggestions that Ofsted inspectors will check what schools are offering. But there's no escaping that this will feel like another sudden and chaotic change of direction for schools and parents. Mr Johnson's pledge on vaccinations comes after an 82-year-old retired maintenance manager became the first person in the UKto receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 jab Some 13.9 million people are among the four priority groups who will receive a vaccine dose by about 15 February, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said.

"Boris Johnson is expected to announce a set of new national restrictions for England, similar to the March lockdown, in a televised address at 20:00 GMT. The PM is likely to urge the public to follow the new rules from midnight. It is expected people will be told to work from home if possible and schools will close for most pupils. It is not yet clear when the measures will be reviewed, but MPs are likely to be given a vote to approve them retrospectively on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the UK's chief medical officers warned of a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"" in several areas over the next 21 days. Scotland announceda legal requirement to stay at homefrom midnight, with schools to be closed. Mr Johnson will set out plans for England as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations. Both Wales and Northern Ireland are already under national restrictions. On Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. As of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. This is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high. What could 'tougher' coronavirus measures mean? PM: 'No question' Covid measures will be tightened 82-year-old first to get Oxford Covid vaccine Mr Johnson is expected to tell people to work from home unless they are a key worker, or it is not possible for them to do so, for example if they work on a construction site, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. It is also understood that England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has told the prime minister the new variant of coronavirus is now spreading throughout the country. Thenew variant- first identified in Kent and since seen across the UK and other parts of the world - has been found tospread much more easily than earlier variants. A No 10 spokesman said the spread of the new variant had led to ""rapidly escalating case numbers across the country"". ""The prime minister is clear that further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise and to protect the NHS and save lives,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who called for a national lockdown in England within 24 hours on Sunday - said: ""I hope the prime minister has been listening to the clear calls for tough national restrictions."" Hospitals have said they are under ""extreme pressure"" and one of Britain's most senior doctors warned on the weekend that trusts across the UK shouldprepare themselves for a surge in cases. The number of Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals is currently above the level seen in spring 2020. A further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported on Monday, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded. What worked before may not work again - even a repeat of the March lockdown may not be enough to contain the new variant. Consider the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus onto on average. The March lockdown brought R down to 0.6 and led to a sharp decline in cases. Every 100 infected people passed the virus onto 60 others, who passed it onto 36, then 21, then 12 and so on. But the new variant is thought to be around 50% more transmissible so its R number, in the same lockdown conditions, would be around 0.9. Then 100 infected people would pass the virus onto 90 others, then 81, then 73, then 66 and so on. This is a far slower decline. However, uncertainty around the new variant means there are scenarios where its levels plateau rather than fall during lockdown conditions. It is going to be a tough start to the year. Even with immediate and tough restrictions there are a projected 20,000 additional deaths in the first months of 2021. Now more than ever this is a race between the virus and the vaccine. Mr Johnson's address comes as UK chief medical officers recommendedthe Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level. It means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement. NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a ""critical point"" and that ""immediate and decisive action"" is needed. Previously, the government described level five as requiring stricter social distancing measures. The first lockdown, which began in March 2020, was when the UK was under level four. These Covid threat levels are separate to the regional tier system of restrictions in England. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Announcing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year."" The new restrictions in Scotland mean it will be a legal requirement to stay at home except for certain essential purposes, similar to the first lockdown last March. Schools will be closed to pupils until February. In Wales, all schools and colleges will move to online learninguntil at least 18 January. Northern Ireland's Stormont Executiveare also meeting to discuss possible new measuresin light of Mr Johnson's televised address - which will air on BBC One andthe BBC iPlayerfrom 19:35 GMT. The prime minister will speak amid continued uncertainty over whether schools will remain open to all pupils in England, after several councilsrequested classrooms stay shut.

""The nurses, doctors and staff today have all been brilliant and I can now really look forward to celebrating my 48th wedding anniversary with my wife Shirley later this year,"" Mr Pinker said.

"Pupils going back to school for a new term in Cheshire Thousands of pupils have not started primary school as expected - with local closures in several parts of England. Head teachers warned of a ""confusing picture"" with some schools staying shut after teachers' union safety warnings about the risk of Covid infections. A joint letter from education unions called for a ""pause"" in reopening schools, accusing the government of ""creating chaos"". The Department for Education said closing should only be a ""last resort"". Adding to the uncertainty, some local authorities have argued against reopening and some individual primary schools have remained closed for most pupils - in addition to those schools already required to stay shut because of high coronavirus levels. There are so far no official national figures for how many schools have not have fully opened, apart from for vulnerable and key workers' children - but local reports include: more than 130 schools in Norfolk, many citing staff shortages more than 40 in Durham 21 in North Tyneside 26 in Newcastle 10 in Reading nine in Northumberland five in Oldham Health Secretary Matt Hancock said school was the ""right place"" for children, wherever possible. ""When it comes to schools, we've taken the decision not to reopen schools in some of the most affected areas. ""But these are difficult balances - and people will have very mixed emotions,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. If schools are closed, Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds has called for support for parents unable to work because of childcare problems. PM urges parents to send children to school Parents react to primaries in England reopening All London primary schools to stay closed Head teacher warns of stress of Covid on staff Council leaders question return to school Vicky Smith from Hertfordshire faces an anxious personal dilemma about sending her daughter back to primary school - as she is worried about the risk of infection to her seriously ill father, who also lives with them. ""I want to send my kids to school because all her friends are there, but what if she brings it home?,"" she says. ""Chances are if she gives it to her granddad, she might not have a granddad. It's not so much we think our children are in danger - it's the people they are going to bring it down to."" Vicky also says even in Tier 4 the current restrictions do not seem to be particularly strict. ""You can still go to work and go to school, it doesn't feel safe. ""My dad is quite happy for her to go to school, but how is she going to feel if she gives it to her granddad. I don't know what to do. ""I don't want to get a big fine and I don't want to stop her learning. But I also feelâ¦ I just don't know what to do."" Secondary schools are staying closed this week except for vulnerable and key workers' children - and in local authorities with high levels of coronavirus, including across London, primary schools are also not open to most pupils. But reopening primary schools in other areas, including for some in Tier 4, has been challenged, with the biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, calling for teaching to be moved online for the first two weeks of term. The NEU has advised teachers they can say they are not going to teach classes in school because of concerns over safety. A joint letter from education unions, including teachers and support staff, says bringing pupils back to school ""risks increasing the infection rate"" and means exposing school staff to ""serious risk of ill-health"". The letter, co-ordinated by the TUC, calls for priority access to Covid vaccines for school staff and to move lessons online ""while Covid-secure working arrangements are reviewed"". Any school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"", said Amanda Spielman, head of the Ofsted education watchdog, because ""children's lives can't just be put on hold while we wait for vaccination programmes"". But the wife of a primary school teacher in Harrow who caught Covid towards the end of last term, and was hospitalised over Christmas, said protecting staff had to be a priority. ""Teachers are passionate and loyal but somebody needs to fight for them,"" she told the BBC. Mungo Sheppard, head teacher of Ash Green primary school in Calderdale, says his school opened as planned on Monday - without staff staying away, but with higher than usual numbers of missing pupils. Of the school's 500 pupils, Mr Sheppard says 75 are off, mostly with ""Covid-related"" issues, compared with 15 absent at the end of last term. ""We also have, for the first time since September, children whose parents have taken the decision to keep them at home due to anxieties linked to the new variant and rising rates,"" he said. But the head teacher says their efforts have been hampered by last-minute decisions at a national level. ""It has been incredibly difficult to make these decisions and communicate them in a tiny timeframe and within a holiday,"" says Mr Sheppard. Unions have warned of safety risks to teachers as coronavirus cases rise across the country Some local authorities have backed schools deciding not to open - and others have questioned the decision to keep schools open in some areas, when other nearby schools have been told to shut. Kent County Council called for a delay in reopening primary schools in four parts of the county. But a message on Twitter from the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe, Damian Collins, suggested further changes were on the way. After a meeting with School Standards Minister Nick Gibb, Mr Collins said the ""decision about which schools will be required to stay open will be reviewed in the next few days by the Department for Education"". Julian Rose, head of West Chiltington School in West Sussex, has an inset day on Monday and is expecting to open on Tuesday. He says ""some very anxious"" parents have been in touch about children going back when the area is in Tier 4. ""I think many feel astonished that we are still open when operating under Tier 4,"" says Mr Rose. And he says the school will ""not have a full complement of staff in attendance"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Children's education has consistently been a national priority, which is why we want classrooms to reopen wherever possible in the new term. ""Schools will continue to implement appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission."" GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there?

"Roberts played geologist Stacey Sutton in A View To A Kill Former Bond actress and Charlie's Angel Tanya Roberts has died in hospital in Los Angeles at the age of 65. Roberts appeared with Sir Roger Moore in his final Bond film, 1985's A View To A Kill, and had a recurring role in That '70s Show. She also starred in the final series of Charlie's Angels on TV in 1980. Her death was prematurely announced on Monday, only for doctors to say she was still alive. However, her death was then confirmed on Tuesday. Roberts had collapsed while walking her dogs on 24 December and was admitted to Los Angeles' Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre. Her partner Lance O'Brien mistakenly thought she had died on Sunday after visiting her in hospital. After getting a call from doctors to say she was deteriorating quickly, he went to her bedside, her eyes closed and she ""faded"",TMZ reported,external. Devastated, he walked out of the room and then the hospital without speaking to medical staff before informing Roberts' agent that he had ""just said goodbye to Tanya"". But while being interviewed for US TV show Inside Edition on Monday, Mr O'Brien got a call from the hospital to say she was alive. The moment was captured on film,external, as he picked up his phone and said: ""Now you're telling me she's alive? Thank the Lord."" However, she died on Monday night. She appeared in A View To A Kill alongside Sir Roger Moore and singer Grace Jones Born Victoria Leigh Blum in 1955, Roberts grew up in New York before moving to Hollywood in 1977. Her big break came when she replaced Shelly Hack in Charlie's Angels, joining Jaclyn Smith and Cheryl Ladd as third 'Angel' Julie. After the show's cancellation, she appeared in such fantasy adventure films as The Beastmaster and Hearts and Armour. She also played comic book heroine Sheena in a 1984 film that saw her nominated for a Golden Raspberry award for worst actress. Roberts received another Razzie nomination for her role as geologist Stacey Sutton in 1985 Bond film A View to a Kill. Roberts in the title role in Sheena: Queen of the Jungle She admitted being ""a little cautious"" about taking the role, but said it would have been ""ridiculous"" to have turned it down. Roberts' subsequent films included Night Eyes and Inner Sanctum, erotic thrillers that did little to advance her career. She went on to play Midge Pinciotti in more than 80 episodes of That '70s Show between 1998 and 2004. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"This video can not be played The first minister says the phased return allows local circumstances to be taken into account. Closing schools will be a ""last resort"" that depends on scientific evidence, Wales' health minister has said. Some schools are due to welcome pupils back this week as the Welsh Government comes under fire from teachers' unions. Health minister Vaughan Gething said: ""If the evidence changes then we'll have to take account of that... and that may lead to a different choice."" Evidence is expected shortlyon the new Covid-19 variant, but local authorities have control over schools re-opening. Under a ""flexible"" agreement with the Welsh Governmentsome schools are due to open on Wednesday, local authorities said. First MinisterMark Drakeford has defended this flexibilitythat leaves the decision with local authorities on when to allow children back to school. But,unions have threatened legal actionbecause of concerns about the new variant. At Monday's coronavirus press briefing, Mr Gething said schools will continue with the phased return to face-to-face learning over the first two weeks of the new term unless the ""evidence changes"". ""The plan is for schools to open in a flexible wayâ¦ we made a choice before the Christmas break to have this flexible approach to opening, so we can learn and try to understand more of what is happening,"" he said. ""Now, if we get evidence and advice today, then that is advice we may well need to act upon today or tomorrow."" He stressed that decisions on schools ""are always underpinned by evidence"". Closing primary schools ""has a real impact on people being able to go to work"" and online learning is ""practically more difficult"" for younger pupils, he added. Schools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers while other pupils are taught online until face-to-face teaching resumes. The Trades' Union Congress - the UK's umbrella union body -has called for parents who are juggling their work lives with childcare should be put on furloughas long as schools are closed. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said there had to be as much ""advance warning as possible"" on any plans to change the return to school. ""I feel for students and I feel for teachers and here we are on the first day of term with a lack of assurance of what's coming down the line,"" he said. The Ynys Mon MS said the Welsh Government should make a statement on ""what the impact is"" of the new variant on schools so that schools can plan. ""It cannot be an end to education - it must be a move to full online education"", he added. Education Minister Kirsty Williams moved learning online for secondary schools and further education colleges in early December With Covid-19 cases rising in early December,Education Minister Kirsty Williams announcedall secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales would move to online learning as part of a ""national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus"". The move was criticised by children's commissioner for Wales Sally Holland, who said it was disruptive to education. But many parents had alreadystarted withdrawing their children from school earlydue to fears of having to self-isolate over Christmas. A week later, the Welsh Local Government Associationsaid children would return to school on a staggered basisafter the Christmas break, with a full return expected by 18 January. This sparked outrage from teachers' unions, who said schools would ""yet again"" have to ""pick up the pieces of a last-minute announcement"". Amelie Boyce, a sixth form student at Neath College, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast she had been enjoying online learning and felt ""a bit more worried I think for going back to college than I was maybe last term because obviously the virus is a lot more dangerous now"". But she added it was more difficult working in her bedroom at home as ""that's the place where I relax most of the time, so it's not really a working environment"". Tim Newbould, head teacher at Penycae Community Primary School in Wrexham, said he had mixed feelings about the return to school, but welcomed the flexibility given by the Welsh Government. ""We don't know yet the impact of Christmas Day,"" he said. He added six of his staff had been off following positive Covid tests and ""a number of us have been quite poorly, so we're well aware of the risks."" Mr Newbould said absence from school had an obvious impact on pupils' academic progress, but there was also the effect on socialising with peers, ""which is really important and has an impact on pupils' mental health and wellbeing"". But he stresses ""safety is the key issue"", particularly in light of the new variant of the virus, and that teachers and school staff should receive the vaccine early on. ""We simply don't know whether our risk assessments are adequate for the new variant of the virus,"" he said. ""We're right in front of a large number of pupils at the same time, breathing the same air."" Ceri Reed, from the group Parents Voices in Wales, said many members are worried about the danger of the new variant of the virus. ""I have to admit, we are divided in our group. We represent over 720 parents and carers in Wales, and I think the main concern from those parents who are not considering sending their children into school is because of the new strain,"" she said. ""We are encouraging parents to look at the science, and we need to applaud what the teachers have done from September onwards with things like track and trace. ""They have been absolutely phenomenal and we believe we can do it again."" First Minister Mark Drakeford scrapped a five-day relaxation of lockdown rules over Christmas due to concerns over the new coronavirus variant On 19 December, Mr Drakefordscrapped plans for a five-day relaxation of lockdown rulesover Christmas amid concerns about the spread ofa more virulent variant of coronavirus. Councils pressed on with the plans for a staggered reopening of schools, with the majority of local authorities intending to reopen secondary schools next Monday. Schools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers from this week, and all pupils are expected to take part in remote learning before their schools reopen for face-to-face teaching. On Saturday, theNASUWT teachers' union threatened ""appropriate action""to protect teachers, and the head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said it had taken legal action against the Welsh Government to obtain scientific evidence on the risks of the new variant it said it was ""withholding"". There is ""no evidence that young people get the illness more severely as a result of the variant,"" Mr Drakeford says The National Education Union Cymruhad already called for in-person learning to be delayed until at least 18 January. The unions say more time is needed to assess the risks posed by the new variant and have accused the Welsh Government of ""passing the buck"" to local authorities. On Sunday,a joint statement from nine unionscalled for a national decision on reopening schools rather than leaving it to local councils. In response, Mr Drakeford said there was ""no evidence that young people get the illness more severely as a result of the variant"", adding that the Welsh Government's technical advisory group ""will be looking at all the evidence again early next week"". However Dilwyn Roberts-Young, general secretary of Undeb Cenedlaethol Athrawon Cymru (UCAC), told BBC Wales Breakfast the evidence around transmission rates in schools did not instil confidence. ""We have listened to the first minister's comments about young people getting the illness more severely,"" he said. ""Schools aren't in a vacuum - there are adults in the school, there are older pupils, and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Chris Jones, said just before Christmas that high numbers of incidents continue to be reported, mainly in residential care homes and school settings. ""Looking at the evidence again... it does not give confidence to parents, to staff or to pupils, and if you look at last March, when the education minister talked about the five guiding principles to determine when schools should return to providing education, there was an emphasis on evidence and information, to ensure that any decisions taken are the correct ones.""

"Classrooms in Wales will remain empty until 18 January at the earliest All schools and colleges will move to online learning until 18 January in Wales. Some schools had been due to open on Wednesdayand others by 11 January withdecisions made by local authorities. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the decision had been taken jointly with the Welsh Local Government Association and Colegau Cymru. Teaching unions had called for a delayed start to termamid concerns about thecoronavirus variant. However, the timing of the decision has been criticised, with some claiming it left little time for parents and schools to make plans. Ms Williams said: ""As a government we will use the next two weeks to continue to work with local authorities, schools and colleges to best plan for the rest of term.

However, that decision has changed following the latest announcement. Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said: ""It continues to be a difficult situation for children and young people.

First Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted to say moving classes online was the ""best way to help reduce the spread of this deadly virus"". Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said the decision made sense but the plan to resume face-to-face education after 18 January should be kept under review and ""not set in stone"". Laura Doel, director of the head teachers' union, NAHT Cymru, said the decision brought ""much-needed clarity"". ""The Welsh Government has repeatedly said it wants to prioritise education, in that case it must also prioritise safety in schools and the communities schools serve,"" she said. ""Work should be undertaken with school leaders and Public Health Wales to establish and agree new Covid-related safety measures in schools during the temporary restriction for implementation in good time prior to lifting restrictions."" Claire Jones, deputy head teacher at Crickhowell High School, Powys, said she was ""really optimistic that blended learning is a way forward"" although ""it's not the ideal"". Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: ""With many children having been due to begin a staggered return to school from Wednesday onwards, this news has come late for them and for their parents."" Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the decision had left ""little or no time for parents and teachers to adapt to the changing circumstances"". ""It is unclear what the Welsh Government expects will change in just two weeks' time and so we risk being in the same position yet again with yet more confusion in a fortnight,"" she said. There are more Covid patients in hospital beds than ever before - 2,688 on Sunday - which included a record number of more than 900 recovering patients too ill to be discharged There were also 136 patients in critical care with Covid, getting closer to the peak seen during the first wave in April Case rates have been falling on average in Wales in recent days, although there is some caution due to a fall in tests over the Christmas period.Wrexham and other parts of north east Wales have nevertheless reached their highest levels yet Bridgend has the highest case rate in Wales. Although falling, its proportion of positive cases - 36.5% - remains the highest in the UK Another25 deaths were reported by Public Health Wales,with the average of deaths running at around 34 a day in the most recent week Wales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties. It went into alevel four national lockdown on 20 December. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales New lockdown for England as cases surge Covid deniers removed from 'at capacity' hospital However, the latest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK. This delay until 18 January is something the unions had been calling for but to decide on the Monday before some schools are about to go back on the Wednesday is quite late in the day. And that's something the opposition parties have picked up on. With all the uncertainty that we are facing over how this new variant will play out and the condition, and the pressure that's on the NHS, I wouldn't put any money necessarily on face-to-face learning resuming on the 18th. I'm told that is something that will be kept very much under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set ofnew national restrictions for England, as head teachers over the border warned of a""confusing picture""with thousands of pupils unable to start primary school as expected. Schools and colleges will be closed until the end of February half term and pupils will be taught online. Scotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at homefrom midnight, with schools to be closed. Most pupils in Northern Ireland werenot expected to return to schoolthis week as had been planned.

"Teachers' unions say they want to know more about the new variant of the virus Unions representing teachers and heads in Wales have called for face-to-face teaching to be suspended in response to the new coronavirus variant. The NASUWT has threatened ""appropriate action in order to protect members whose safety is put at risk"". Head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said it had taken legal action against the Welsh Government to obtain scientific evidence it said it was ""withholding"". The Welsh Government said it had agreed an approach with local authorities. The National Education Union Cymruhad already called for in-person learning to be delayed until at least 18 January. According to councils, many secondary schools aim to return from 11 January, with some fully open on 6 January. Welsh schools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers from this week. 'Flexible' school return plan in place in Wales from Monday Staggered return for Wales' schools in January New coronavirus variant: What do we know? All pupils will be expected to take part in remote learning before their schools reopen for face-to-face teaching. But teachers' unions have said more time is needed to understand thenew Covid-19 variant. While ""completely committed"" to ensuring children return to school as soon as possible, NASUWT general secretary Patrick Roach said it was now ""abundantly clear that the pandemic is seriously impacting on the ability of all schools to continue to operate normally"". ""The NASUWT will not hesitate to take appropriate action in order to protect members whose safety is put at risk as a result of the failure of employers or the Welsh Government to ensure safe working conditions in schools."" The Welsh Government says it has built flexibility into the first two weeks of term Neil Butler, the union's official for Wales, said there was ""chaos and confusion"" in the Welsh education system, and that ""the buck has effectively been passed to local authorities and some authorities have passed it down to individual schools"". Mr Butler said a suspension of face-to-face teaching would allow schools to review their risk assessments in light of the new variant. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""We have agreed with local authorities a common approach to schools returning in January with some flexibility built in over the first two weeks of term. ""It is our expectation that pupils, when not in school, will continue to benefit from remote learning."" Secondary schools in Englandwill stagger their return with pupils taking exams in 2021 starting on 11 January, and other year groups returning in person on 18 January. Mostprimary schools in Englandwill return on 4 January, but in London and some surrounding areas they will not open for most pupils until 18 January. InNorthern Ireland, primary school pupils will be taught online until 11 January. In secondary schools, years 8 to 11 will be taught online throughout January. Years 12 to 14 will return to school after the first week of January. InScotland, the Christmas holidays have been extended to 11 January, and the following week will be online learning only. A full return to face-to-face learning is planned for 18 January. Read more here Laura Doel, director of NAHT Cymru, said ""control of infection has been lost"" in large parts of Wales, which had created an ""intolerable risk to many school communities"". ""It is simply unacceptable for schools to remain open when there is such a question mark over the impact the new variant will have and we will not sit back and let this happen without calling the Welsh Government to account, for the sake of the whole school community,"" she added. Ms Doel said the union had taken legal action ""to force"" the Welsh Government ""to disclose the scientific information they are withholding"" which has guided its policies.

"This video can not be played Olly Stephens was pronounced dead in Bugs Bottom fields in Emmer Green, Reading A school says its community has been left ""reeling"" after a 13-year-old boy was stabbed to death in Reading. Oliver Stephens, known as Olly, was pronounced dead at Bugs Bottom fields, Emmer Green, on Sunday. Four boys and a girl, all aged 13 or 14, have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder. They remain in custody. Highdown School and Sixth Form Centre head teacher Rachel Cave described the boy's death as a ""total tragedy"". In a statement, she said: ""This student was part of our community and many students and staff knew him well. ""Many have been deeply affected by this tragedy. ""In normal circumstances we would open the school and welcome in students for support before the start of the term. ""We are currently unable to do this, of course, but are arranging counselling support and will be establishing an electronic book of condolence."" Flowers have been left outside Highdown School Ms Cave said the school was ""a supportive and close-knit community"" which would ""work together over the coming days and weeks"". Det Supt Kevin Brown, of Thames Valley Police, said: ""Our thoughts remain with Olly's family at this incredibly difficult time."" He added: ""This is a tragic and shocking incident which has resulted in the death of a young boy."" The victim's family are being supported by specially trained officers. Thames Valley Police said a ""considerable police presence"" would be in place in the area for several days Officers were called just before 16:00 GMT on Sunday following reports of an attack. Officers are appealing for anyone who was in the area between 15:00 and 16:30 who might have taken photos or camera footage to contact them if they notice anything suspicious. Det Supt Brown said he believed there would have been witnesses to the ""dreadful incident"" as the area is popular with dog walkers. A man said his wife was walking their dog through the park on Sunday afternoon when she saw a boy on the ground with several people around him trying to give him first aid. Another dog walker said she saw a group of young people standing in the woods in Bugs Bottom fields at about 15:30 and described it as ""slightly unusual"". Reading East MP Matt Rodda has offered his ""deepest condolences"" to the boy's family. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Classrooms in Wales will remain empty until 18 January at the earliest All schools and colleges will move to online learning until 18 January in Wales. Some schools had been due to open on Wednesdayand others by 11 January withdecisions made by local authorities. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said the decision had been taken jointly with the Welsh Local Government Association and Colegau Cymru. Teaching unions had called for a delayed start to termamid concerns about thecoronavirus variant. However, the timing of the decision has been criticised, with some claiming it left little time for parents and schools to make plans. Ms Williams said: ""As a government we will use the next two weeks to continue to work with local authorities, schools and colleges to best plan for the rest of term. ""This is the best way to ensure that parents, staff and learners can be confident in the return to face to face learning, based on the latest evidence and information."" How many have died with Covid in Wales? 'Momentous day' as Oxford Covid jab rollout begins Education Minister Kirsty Williams made a video announcement Schools and colleges would remain open for children of critical workers and vulnerable learners, as well as for learners who needed to complete essential exams or assessments All childcare settings can remain open Universities in Wales have already agreed a staggered start to term Welsh university students studying in England should not return to campuses and will be taught online after a separatelockdownwas imposed The announcement comes as the UK's Joint Biosecurity Centre increasedthe Covid threat level to five - its highest level. Level five warns of a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"", according to theUK government's website,external. Wales has been under ""stay-at-home""lockdown restrictionssince 20 December after a rise in Covid-19 cases, withmore than 31,000 casesin the two weeks over the Christmas period. A""flexible"" agreementon reopening schools had been put in place before Christmas with the decision in the hands of local authorities. However, that decision has changed following the latest announcement. Children's Commissioner for Wales Sally Holland said: ""It continues to be a difficult situation for children and young people. ""Children certainly would rather be in school, and are concerned about uncertainty, but it is clear we are living in difficult times,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

First Minister Mark Drakeford tweeted to say moving classes online was the ""best way to help reduce the spread of this deadly virus"". Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL) Cymru, said the decision made sense but the plan to resume face-to-face education after 18 January should be kept under review and ""not set in stone"". Laura Doel, director of the head teachers' union, NAHT Cymru, said the decision brought ""much-needed clarity"". ""The Welsh Government has repeatedly said it wants to prioritise education, in that case it must also prioritise safety in schools and the communities schools serve,"" she said. ""Work should be undertaken with school leaders and Public Health Wales to establish and agree new Covid-related safety measures in schools during the temporary restriction for implementation in good time prior to lifting restrictions."" Claire Jones, deputy head teacher at Crickhowell High School, Powys, said she was ""really optimistic that blended learning is a way forward"" although ""it's not the ideal"". Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said: ""With many children having been due to begin a staggered return to school from Wednesday onwards, this news has come late for them and for their parents."" Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said the decision had left ""little or no time for parents and teachers to adapt to the changing circumstances"". ""It is unclear what the Welsh Government expects will change in just two weeks' time and so we risk being in the same position yet again with yet more confusion in a fortnight,"" she said. There are more Covid patients in hospital beds than ever before - 2,688 on Sunday - which included a record number of more than 900 recovering patients too ill to be discharged There were also 136 patients in critical care with Covid, getting closer to the peak seen during the first wave in April Case rates have been falling on average in Wales in recent days, although there is some caution due to a fall in tests over the Christmas period.Wrexham and other parts of north east Wales have nevertheless reached their highest levels yet Bridgend has the highest case rate in Wales. Although falling, its proportion of positive cases - 36.5% - remains the highest in the UK Another25 deaths were reported by Public Health Wales,with the average of deaths running at around 34 a day in the most recent week Wales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas, and nine of the UK's ten most infected counties. It went into alevel four national lockdown on 20 December. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales New lockdown for England as cases surge Covid deniers removed from 'at capacity' hospital However, the latest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK. This delay until 18 January is something the unions had been calling for but to decide on the Monday before some schools are about to go back on the Wednesday is quite late in the day. And that's something the opposition parties have picked up on. With all the uncertainty that we are facing over how this new variant will play out and the condition, and the pressure that's on the NHS, I wouldn't put any money necessarily on face-to-face learning resuming on the 18th. I'm told that is something that will be kept very much under review. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a set ofnew national restrictions for England, as head teachers over the border warned of a""confusing picture""with thousands of pupils unable to start primary school as expected. Schools and colleges will be closed until the end of February half term and pupils will be taught online. Scotland has announced a legal requirement to stay at homefrom midnight, with schools to be closed. Most pupils in Northern Ireland werenot expected to return to schoolthis week as had been planned. Earlier on Monday, Health Minister Vaughan Gething said closing schools in Wales would be a""last resort"".

"Nick Hulme said intensive care units at Colchester and Ipswich hospitals were ""at capacity"" Security officers removed Covid-19 ""deniers"" who were taking pictures of empty corridors at a NHS hospital where the intensive care unit is at maximum capacity, its chief executive said. The incident took place at Colchester Hospital at the weekend. Chief executive Nick Hulme said it ""beggars belief"" some people were calling the pandemic a hoax. He said it was ""the right thing to do"" to keep corridors in outpatients units as empty as possible. The casualties of viral conspiracy theories in 2020 Covid-19 school U-turn 'like Vicar of Dibley' Grow up and take Covid seriously: Doctor Mr Hulme said hospital security had to ""remove people who were taking photographs of empty corridors and then posting them on social media, saying the hospital is not in crisis"". ""When you've got that sort of social media pressure and those people denying the reality of Covid it really concerns us. Words fail me,"" he said. ""Why would people do that when we all know somebody who has died from Covid? ""Of course there are empty corridors at the weekend in outpatients, because that's the right thing to do. ""We are facing the biggest health challenge we've ever seen and we are still seeing people flouting the [social distancing] rules."" People had to be removed from Colchester Hospital's outpatients ward for taking pictures of empty corridors and claiming Covid-19 was a hoax Under coronavirus pandemic restrictions on social distancing, many outpatient consultations had been moved online or were taking place over the telephone, he added. Physical appointments, tests and procedures had been organised differently to avoid crowded waiting areas. Mr Hulme is chief executive ofEast Suffolk and North Essex NHS Foundation Trust,externalwhich also runs Ipswich Hospital and he said there were currently 320 patients being treated for Covid-19 across both sites.

"This video can not be played Georgia official Gabriel Sterling urges voters to cast ballots Georgia's top election official Brad Raffensperger has called President Donald Trump's false claims that he won the state in 2020 ""just plain wrong"". Mr Raffensperger's comment came after Mr Trump pressured him in a phone call to ""find"" votes proving his win. Criticism of Mr Trump's call has been widespread, with some claiming that it amounts to illegal vote tampering. Republicans fear that the call could undermine their efforts to win two Senate races in Georgia on Tuesday. If Republicans win one of the Georgia Senate seats in the run-off, they will retain control of the upper chamber. If both candidates lose, Democrats will control the Senate, House of Representatives and White House. Trump's hour-long phone call fact-checked Why is the Georgia election so important? ""He did most of the talking. We did most of the listening,"" Mr Raffensperger told ABC News on Monday. ""But I did want to make my points that the data that he has is just plain wrong."" He was on the phone for an hour to the president and his team on Saturday, and the audio waspublished by the Washington Post,externalthe following day. On Monday, Mr Raffensperger told reporters that he did not know the call was being recorded, and said he spoke to the president from his home. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""I just want to find 11,780 votes"" ""He [Mr Trump] had hundreds and hundreds of people he said that were dead that voted. We found two, that's an example of just - he has bad data,"" he added. Gabriel Sterling, the state's voting systems implementation manager, said in a Monday news conference that Mr Trump's claims were ""easily, provably false"". He also rued the ""ridiculousness"" of the call to Mr Raffensperger. Mr Sterling warned that the president was undermining Georgians' trust in the election process, and pleaded with residents to vote in Tuesday's election. ""Everybody's vote is going to count,"" he said. Mr Trump can be heard alternately cajoling and pressuring Georgia's secretary of state to ""recalculate"" the vote tally. ""I just want to find 11,780 votes,"" he said. The number would have given him a total of 2,473,634 votes in the state, one more than Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who received 2,473,633 votes. He also accused Mr Raffensperger - a fellow Republican - of shredding ballots and engaging in criminal acts that cost Mr Trump the election. He called the disproven allegations ""a criminal offence,"" adding that it presents ""a big risk to you"". Mr Raffensperger responded by pointing out that Mr Trump's campaign has lost several legal challenges in court. ""The challenge you have, Mr President, is that the data you have is wrong."" Brad Raffensperger previously warned that debunked claims about voting fraud were ""hurting our state"" On Monday, two Democratic lawmakers wrote to the FBI, asking ""to open an immediate criminal investigation into the president"". ""As members of Congress and former prosecutors, we believe Donald Trump engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes,"" wrote Ted Lieu of California and Kathleen Rice of New York. Vice-president-elect Kamala Harris, who was in Georgia on Sunday to campaign for the Democratic senate candidates, called Mr Trump's call ""a bold abuse of power"". Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the names for the Republican Party in this week's election Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said Mr Trump was ""unhinged and dangerous"" and that his call to Mr Raffensperger merited ""nothing less than a criminal investigation"". Georgia's Republican Lt Governor added to the criticism on Monday, telling CNN: ""I am 100% certified to tell you that it was inappropriate. And it certainly did not help the situation."" ""It was based on misinformation,"" continued Geoff Duncan, whose boss Governor Brian Kemp has faced calls from Mr Trump to resign. ""It was based on, you know, all types of theories that have been debunked and disproved over the course of the last 10 weeks."" The Senate run-offs in Georgia have drawn national attention. On Monday, Mr Trump, Mr Biden and Vice-president Mike Pence are all holding rallies in the state on behalf of their chosen candidates ahead of Tuesday's vote. Speaking in Atlanta, Mr Biden urged Georgians to turn on Tuesday, saying the election's outcome could ""chart the course, not just for the four years, but for the next generation"". ""Tomorrow can be a new day for Atlanta, for Georgia and for America,"" he said. President Trump rallied voters in Dalton, Georgia, warning that the Georgia runoff was the ""last line of defence"" against Democratic control of the Senate. He said: ""If the liberal Democrats take the Senate and the White House - and they're not taking this White House - we're going to fight like hell, I'll tell you right now."" He added: ""This could be the most important vote you will ever cast for the rest of your life, it really could be."" The competing rallies come as nearly 3 million Georgia voters - around half of those that voted in the November general election - have already cast their ballots. Georgia's incumbent Republican Senator David Perdue, who is fighting to hold his seat in Tuesday's race, has sided with the president. ""To have a statewide elected official, regardless of party, tape without disclosing a conversation - private conversation - with the president of the United States, and then leaking it to the press is disgusting,"" he told Fox News. He also dismissed claims of wrongdoing by Mr Trump, saying: ""I didn't hear anything in that tape that the president hasn't already said for weeks now since the November election."" Raphael Warnock (left) and Jon Ossoff are the Democratic candidates for Georgia's seats Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff said the call was ""a direct attack on our democracy,"" and accused Mr Perdue and fellow Republican Senate candidate Kelly Loeffler of failing to defend ""Georgia voters from that kind of assault"". Raphael Warnock, the other Democratic Senate candidate, called upon Senator Loeffler to ""speak out against these unsubstantiated claims of fraud, defend Georgia's elections, and to put Georgia ahead of herself"". During a campaign appearance on Monday, Mrs Loeffler refused to respond to a question about the phone call, instead telling reporters: ""My sole focus is on tomorrow's election."" ""I am focused on that exclusively because this affects every single Georgian,"" she added. Trump's hour-long phone call fact-checked Why is the Georgia election so important?

"First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill met throughout Monday There will be an extended period of remote learning for schools in Northern Ireland, the executive has said. Ministers met on Monday night asother parts of the UK tightened their coronavirus restrictions. The Stormont executive also plans to give its stay at home guidance legal force, with new restrictions on travel. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said details would be formalised on Tuesday. The health and education ministers will bring separate papers on the issues to the executive at the meeting, she added. Northern Ireland's Education Minister Peter Weir had previously announceda staggered return to school for pupilsduring the month of January. The first transfer test, used by many grammar schools to select pupils, is due to take place on Saturday but there have beencalls from some teaching unions and political partiesfor the test to be cancelled this year, in light of the uncertainty with the pandemic. In England,all schools and colleges will close to most pupilsand switch to remote learning until the middle of February, and end-of-year exams will not take place this summer as normal. Recommendations on exams in Northern Ireland are also expected to be brought forward by the executive on Tuesday. It is understood ministers will update the assembly on Wednesday about their decisions. First Minister Arlene Foster said the new restrictions were unfortunate, but necessary. She said she believed the stay-at-home message will be in place ""for the rest of January, probably into February"". ""We will of course review it, as we're legally bound to do every couple of weeks."" She added that ministers would ""much prefer"" for face-to-face education to continue, but said they had to ""take into account the very serious situation that we find ourselves in tonight."" Both organisations which organise transfer tests will be making announcements on Tuesday, she said. ""We'll wait to hear what they have to say. They do of course have to abide by public health advice, but they are private organisations and they will make their own announcements."" The Irish government is considering a proposal to close schools for the rest of January. On Monday, the Department of Health reported that a further 1,801 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. There have also been 12 more Covid-19 related deaths. These latest figures from the Department of Health bring the total number of deaths to 1,366, while 79,873 people have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic started. More than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the week before. The seven-day rate per 100,000 people is now 660 positive cases, compared to 200 per 100,000 two weeks ago. In the Republic of Ireland on Monday, an additional 6,110 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were announced, with six further deaths linked to the virus. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has alreadyannounced a fresh lockdown therefrom midnight, with schools closed until February. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Dr Michael McBride said Scotland's measures were ""prudent and sensible"". Meanwhile,the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rollout has begun in Northern Ireland. Up to 11,000 people aged over 80 across Northern Ireland are set to receive the this week, with some of the first doses delivered at a GP surgery on the Falls Road in West Belfast on Monday afternoon. Up to 11,000 people aged over 80 across Northern Ireland are set to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca The SDLP has called for the assembly to be recalled on Tuesday to discuss the rolling out of the vaccine. It can be recalled if at least 30 MLAs sign a petition. On Monday, Justice Minister Naomi Long welcomed the opening of Northern Ireland's first Nightingale venue, which will be used for courts and tribunals business. The facility was approved by a meeting of the executive on 17 December, and will sit in the International Convention Centre in Belfast (ICC). Activity at the centre will be phased in, in line with Covid-19 regulations. In other coronavirus-related developments on Monday: Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, said it was""appalling"" that the Pfizer vaccine was not to be administered in two doses within 21 days as instructed by the company. Almost 100 house parties were broken up by police in Northern Ireland over the last week despite strict rules against indoor gatherings The PSNI also issued 339 Â£200 fines for breaches of the coronavirus regulations A group of principals said that they had been left confused by Department of Education guidance which hadinitially said that schools could offer face-to-face teaching to pupils facing exams.

If both candidates lose, Democrats will control the Senate, House of Representatives and White House. Trump's hour-long phone call fact-checked Why is the Georgia election so important? ""He did most of the talking. We did most of the listening,"" Mr Raffensperger told ABC News on Monday. ""But I did want to make my points that the data that he has is just plain wrong."" He was on the phone for an hour to the president and his team on Saturday, and the audio waspublished by the Washington Post,externalthe following day. On Monday, Mr Raffensperger told reporters that he did not know the call was being recorded, and said he spoke to the president from his home. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""I just want to find 11,780 votes"" ""He [Mr Trump] had hundreds and hundreds of people he said that were dead that voted. We found two, that's an example of just - he has bad data,"" he added. Gabriel Sterling, the state's voting systems implementation manager, said in a Monday news conference that Mr Trump's claims were ""easily, provably false"". He also rued the ""ridiculousness"" of the call to Mr Raffensperger. Mr Sterling warned that the president was undermining Georgians' trust in the election process, and pleaded with residents to vote in Tuesday's election. ""Everybody's vote is going to count,"" he said. Mr Trump can be heard alternately cajoling and pressuring Georgia's secretary of state to ""recalculate"" the vote tally. ""I just want to find 11,780 votes,"" he said. The number would have given him a total of 2,473,634 votes in the state, one more than Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who received 2,473,633 votes. He also accused Mr Raffensperger - a fellow Republican - of shredding ballots and engaging in criminal acts that cost Mr Trump the election. He called the disproven allegations ""a criminal offence,"" adding that it presents ""a big risk to you"". Mr Raffensperger responded by pointing out that Mr Trump's campaign has lost several legal challenges in court. ""The challenge you have, Mr President, is that the data you have is wrong."" Brad Raffensperger previously warned that debunked claims about voting fraud were ""hurting our state"" On Monday, two Democratic lawmakers wrote to the FBI, asking ""to open an immediate criminal investigation into the president"". ""As members of Congress and former prosecutors, we believe Donald Trump engaged in solicitation of, or conspiracy to commit, a number of election crimes,"" wrote Ted Lieu of California and Kathleen Rice of New York. Vice-president-elect Kamala Harris, who was in Georgia on Sunday to campaign for the Democratic senate candidates, called Mr Trump's call ""a bold abuse of power"". Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the names for the Republican Party in this week's election Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin, a Democrat, said Mr Trump was ""unhinged and dangerous"" and that his call to Mr Raffensperger merited ""nothing less than a criminal investigation"". Georgia's Republican Lt Governor added to the criticism on Monday, telling CNN: ""I am 100% certified to tell you that it was inappropriate. And it certainly did not help the situation."" ""It was based on misinformation,"" continued Geoff Duncan, whose boss Governor Brian Kemp has faced calls from Mr Trump to resign. ""It was based on, you know, all types of theories that have been debunked and disproved over the course of the last 10 weeks."" The Senate run-offs in Georgia have drawn national attention. On Monday, Mr Trump, Mr Biden and Vice-president Mike Pence are all holding rallies in the state on behalf of their chosen candidates ahead of Tuesday's vote. Speaking in Atlanta, Mr Biden urged Georgians to turn on Tuesday, saying the election's outcome could ""chart the course, not just for the four years, but for the next generation"". ""Tomorrow can be a new day for Atlanta, for Georgia and for America,"" he said. President Trump rallied voters in Dalton, Georgia, warning that the Georgia runoff was the ""last line of defence"" against Democratic control of the Senate. He said: ""If the liberal Democrats take the Senate and the White House - and they're not taking this White House - we're going to fight like hell, I'll tell you right now."" He added: ""This could be the most important vote you will ever cast for the rest of your life, it really could be."" The competing rallies come as nearly 3 million Georgia voters - around half of those that voted in the November general election - have already cast their ballots. Georgia's incumbent Republican Senator David Perdue, who is fighting to hold his seat in Tuesday's race, has sided with the president. ""To have a statewide elected official, regardless of party, tape without disclosing a conversation - private conversation - with the president of the United States, and then leaking it to the press is disgusting,"" he told Fox News. He also dismissed claims of wrongdoing by Mr Trump, saying: ""I didn't hear anything in that tape that the president hasn't already said for weeks now since the November election."" Raphael Warnock (left) and Jon Ossoff are the Democratic candidates for Georgia's seats Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff said the call was ""a direct attack on our democracy,"" and accused Mr Perdue and fellow Republican Senate candidate Kelly Loeffler of failing to defend ""Georgia voters from that kind of assault"". Raphael Warnock, the other Democratic Senate candidate, called upon Senator Loeffler to ""speak out against these unsubstantiated claims of fraud, defend Georgia's elections, and to put Georgia ahead of herself"". During a campaign appearance on Monday, Mrs Loeffler refused to respond to a question about the phone call, instead telling reporters: ""My sole focus is on tomorrow's election."" ""I am focused on that exclusively because this affects every single Georgian,"" she added. Trump's hour-long phone call fact-checked Why is the Georgia election so important?

"Iran says it suspended its nuclear commitments in response to reinstated US sanctions Iran has resumed enriching uranium to 20% purity, in its most significant breach yet of its 2015 deal with world powers to end nuclear sanctions. The global nuclear watchdog confirmed the process had begun at the underground Fordo plant on Monday. Enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear bombs. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% purity. A US state department spokesperson accused Iran of pursuing a ""campaign of nuclear extortion"". This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? Iran, which insists that its nuclear programme is peaceful, has rolled back a number of commitments under the deal. It has said it is retaliating for the US economic sanctions that were reinstated in 2018 by President Donald Trump when he abandoned the accord, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). In a separate development, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had seized a South Korean-flagged chemical tanker in the Gulf ""due to the repeated infringement of maritime environmental laws"". South Korea's foreign ministry demanded its immediate release of the Hankuk Chemi and said a South Korean anti-piracy unit stationed in the Strait of Hormuz had been dispatched to the area. Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told mediathe process of enriching uranium to 20% had started at Fordo,external. President Hassan Rouhani had ordered the move because he was ""bound"" by a new law requiring the production and storage of at least 120kg (265lbs) of 20%-enriched uranium annually for peaceful purposes, he said. Iran's parliament passed the law following the assassination in late November of the country's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, which Iranian leaders blamed on Israel. Later on Monday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Iran's move in a report to member states. ""Iran today began feeding uranium already enriched up to 4.1% U-235 into six centrifuge cascades at the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant for further enrichment up to 20%,"" a statement said. Some experts see the announcement as an attempt to put pressure on Joe Biden, who is due to succeed Mr Trump as president on 20 January. Mr Biden has said he will consider rejoining the nuclear deal so long as Iran returns to full compliance and commits to further negotiations. The state department spokesperson said: ""Iran enriching uranium to 20% at Fordow is a clear attempt to increase its campaign of nuclear extortion, an attempt that will continue to fail."" EU spokesman Peter Stano said Iran's move constituted ""a considerable departure from Iran's nuclear commitments under the JCPOA with serious nuclear non-proliferation implications"". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, one of Iran's main opponents in the Middle East,said,externalthe Iranian decision could not be ""explained in any way except as continued realisation of its intention to develop a military nuclear programme"". ""Israel will not allow Iran to manufacture nuclear weapons,"" he added. Why was a top Iranian scientist assassinated? Iran's enriched uranium stockpile '12 times limit' Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? Iran's parliament passed a law requiring 20% enrichment after the killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Enriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235. Low-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% purity of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Highly enriched uranium has a concentration of 20% or more and is used in research reactors. Under the nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to a 3.67% purity; to stockpile no more than 300kg (660lbs) of the material; to operate no more than 5,060 of its oldest and least efficient centrifuges; and was required to cease enrichment at Fordo altogether. But Iran has taken steps to ""reduce"" those commitments since Mr Trump reinstated US sanctions to compel it to negotiate a replacement of an agreement he said was ""defective at its core"". The steps have included building up the stockpile of low-enriched uranium, producing 4.5%-enriched uranium, restarting advanced centrifuges, and resuming enrichment activities at Fordo. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stressed on Monday that the measures were ""fully reversible upon full compliance by all"" parties. Allow Twitter content?

Experts at the Arms Control Association said last month that120kg of uranium enriched to 20% was about half the amount of uranium that, when enriched to weapons-grade (90% or more), was necessary for one bomb,external. They also warned that the production of highly enriched uranium would pose a more serious near-term proliferation risk. That is because going from uranium's natural state of 0.7% concentration of U-235 to 20% takes about 90% of the total effort required to get to weapons-grade. Before the nuclear deal, Iran had a sufficient amount of 20%-enriched uranium and number of centrifuges that its ""break-out time"" was estimated to be about two to three months. The agreement slowed the ""break-out time"" to at least a year. Why was a top Iranian scientist assassinated?

"This video can not be played James Shaw, from Dundee, was among the first to receive the jab The first Scottish recipients of the new Oxford University and AstraZeneca vaccine have received their jabs. James Shaw, 82, and his 82-year-old wife Malita were among the first to be vaccinated in Dundee. The couple received their first doses at Lochee Health and Community Care Centre. Nicola Sturgeon has said she hoped all over-50s and those with underlying health conditions will have been vaccinated by early May. James said: ""My wife and I are delighted to be receiving this vaccination. I have asthma and bronchitis and I have been desperate to have it so I am really pleased to be one of the first to be getting it. ""I know it takes a little while for the vaccine to work but after today I know that I will feel a bit less worried about going out. I will still be very careful and avoid busy places but knowing I have been vaccinated will really help me. ""All of my friends have said they are going to have the vaccine when it is their turn and I would encourage everyone who is offered this vaccination to take it."" James Shaw, 82, was one of the first people in Scotland to receive the AstraZeneca/Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, administered by advanced nurse practitioner Justine Williams The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine programme is being rolled out less than a week after it was approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). It is the second vaccine approved for use in the UK. NHS Tayside is rolling out the vaccine through GP practices in the community and will also vaccinate elderly residents and staff in care homes. Its associate director of public health Dr Daniel Chandleris said: ""The efforts of our vaccination teams have been amazing and it is testament to a real whole team approach that sees the first over-80s in the general population have their jabs today in Tayside. ""The availability and mobility of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine gives us the opportunity to start to roll out the biggest vaccine programme that the UK has ever seen across our communities. ""Over-80s are the first priority group and patients will be contacted directly to attend a vaccination session."" Scottish cabinet to consider more Covid measures PM expects 'tens of millions' of jabs by April How mass vaccinations halted a 1950s killer virus Scottish Secretary Alister Jack added: ""This is another important moment in our fight against the virus - every vaccination takes us a step closer to getting back to our normal lives as soon as possible. ""As with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, the UK is the first country in the world to approve and roll out the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, with the UK Government ordering and paying for millions of doses for people in all parts of the UK."" The milestone came as First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a new stricter lockdown. With the exception of essential travel, people in mainland Scotland will have to remain at home from midnight. Statistics released on Monday showed a further 1,905 people had contracted Covid-19. Figures for hospital admissions and deaths over the holiday weekend will not be published until Tuesday. Ms Sturgeon likened the situation to a race between the vaccine and the virus. She said: ""In one lane we have vaccines - our job is to make sure they run as fast as possible. ""But in the other lane is the virus which - as a result of this new variant - has just learned to run much faster and has most definitely picked up pace in the last couple of weeks. ""To ensure that the vaccine wins the race, it is essential to speed up vaccination as far as possible. But to give it the time it needs to get ahead, we must also slow the virus down."" The new vaccine will initially be available in the hospitals that have been delivering the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine, and new community settings will be able to deliver the jabs from 11 January. People in Scotland will be contacted by their health board when it is their turn to be vaccinated. The Oxford vaccination marks a major turning point in the pandemic and will lead to a massive expansion in the UK's immunisation campaign, with enough to vaccinate 50 million people throughout the UK already on order. It is easier to transport and store than the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which needs cold storage of about -70C. The Oxford vaccine is logistically much easier to distribute The UK government has said 530,000 doses of the Oxford vaccine will be available to the UK from Monday, with ""millions due by the beginning of February"". Scotland will ultimately get an 8.2% share of these vaccines, based on its population. Chief Medical Officer Dr Gregor Smith has said he expects the NHS in Scotland to receive 440,360 doses of the vaccine during January. The first minister said on Monday about 100,000 people in Scotland have already received a first dose of vaccine. Both vaccines require two doses to be administered with an interval ofbetween four and 12 weeks. Previously the advice was for the vaccines to have a four-week gap between doses. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) then recommended as many people as possible in the top priority groups should beoffered a first dose as the initial priority,external.

"Pupils going back to school for a new term in Cheshire Thousands of pupils have not started primary school as expected - with local closures in several parts of England. Head teachers warned of a ""confusing picture"" with some schools staying shut after teachers' union safety warnings about the risk of Covid infections. A joint letter from education unions called for a ""pause"" in reopening schools, accusing the government of ""creating chaos"". The Department for Education said closing should only be a ""last resort"". Adding to the uncertainty, some local authorities have argued against reopening and some individual primary schools have remained closed for most pupils - in addition to those schools already required to stay shut because of high coronavirus levels. There are so far no official national figures for how many schools have not have fully opened, apart from for vulnerable and key workers' children - but local reports include: more than 130 schools in Norfolk, many citing staff shortages more than 40 in Durham 21 in North Tyneside 26 in Newcastle 10 in Reading nine in Northumberland five in Oldham Health Secretary Matt Hancock said school was the ""right place"" for children, wherever possible. ""When it comes to schools, we've taken the decision not to reopen schools in some of the most affected areas. ""But these are difficult balances - and people will have very mixed emotions,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. If schools are closed, Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds has called for support for parents unable to work because of childcare problems. PM urges parents to send children to school Parents react to primaries in England reopening All London primary schools to stay closed Head teacher warns of stress of Covid on staff Council leaders question return to school Vicky Smith from Hertfordshire faces an anxious personal dilemma about sending her daughter back to primary school - as she is worried about the risk of infection to her seriously ill father, who also lives with them. ""I want to send my kids to school because all her friends are there, but what if she brings it home?,"" she says. ""Chances are if she gives it to her granddad, she might not have a granddad. It's not so much we think our children are in danger - it's the people they are going to bring it down to."" Vicky also says even in Tier 4 the current restrictions do not seem to be particularly strict. ""You can still go to work and go to school, it doesn't feel safe. ""My dad is quite happy for her to go to school, but how is she going to feel if she gives it to her granddad. I don't know what to do. ""I don't want to get a big fine and I don't want to stop her learning. But I also feelâ¦ I just don't know what to do."" Secondary schools are staying closed this week except for vulnerable and key workers' children - and in local authorities with high levels of coronavirus, including across London, primary schools are also not open to most pupils. But reopening primary schools in other areas, including for some in Tier 4, has been challenged, with the biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, calling for teaching to be moved online for the first two weeks of term. The NEU has advised teachers they can say they are not going to teach classes in school because of concerns over safety. A joint letter from education unions, including teachers and support staff, says bringing pupils back to school ""risks increasing the infection rate"" and means exposing school staff to ""serious risk of ill-health"". The letter, co-ordinated by the TUC, calls for priority access to Covid vaccines for school staff and to move lessons online ""while Covid-secure working arrangements are reviewed"". Any school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"", said Amanda Spielman, head of the Ofsted education watchdog, because ""children's lives can't just be put on hold while we wait for vaccination programmes"". But the wife of a primary school teacher in Harrow who caught Covid towards the end of last term, and was hospitalised over Christmas, said protecting staff had to be a priority. ""Teachers are passionate and loyal but somebody needs to fight for them,"" she told the BBC. Mungo Sheppard, head teacher of Ash Green primary school in Calderdale, says his school opened as planned on Monday - without staff staying away, but with higher than usual numbers of missing pupils. Of the school's 500 pupils, Mr Sheppard says 75 are off, mostly with ""Covid-related"" issues, compared with 15 absent at the end of last term. ""We also have, for the first time since September, children whose parents have taken the decision to keep them at home due to anxieties linked to the new variant and rising rates,"" he said. But the head teacher says their efforts have been hampered by last-minute decisions at a national level. ""It has been incredibly difficult to make these decisions and communicate them in a tiny timeframe and within a holiday,"" says Mr Sheppard. Unions have warned of safety risks to teachers as coronavirus cases rise across the country Some local authorities have backed schools deciding not to open - and others have questioned the decision to keep schools open in some areas, when other nearby schools have been told to shut. Kent County Council called for a delay in reopening primary schools in four parts of the county. But a message on Twitter from the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe, Damian Collins, suggested further changes were on the way. After a meeting with School Standards Minister Nick Gibb, Mr Collins said the ""decision about which schools will be required to stay open will be reviewed in the next few days by the Department for Education"". Julian Rose, head of West Chiltington School in West Sussex, has an inset day on Monday and is expecting to open on Tuesday. He says ""some very anxious"" parents have been in touch about children going back when the area is in Tier 4. ""I think many feel astonished that we are still open when operating under Tier 4,"" says Mr Rose. And he says the school will ""not have a full complement of staff in attendance"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Children's education has consistently been a national priority, which is why we want classrooms to reopen wherever possible in the new term. ""Schools will continue to implement appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission."" GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there?

"Boris Johnson is expected to announce a set of new national restrictions for England, similar to the March lockdown, in a televised address at 20:00 GMT. The PM is likely to urge the public to follow the new rules from midnight. It is expected people will be told to work from home if possible and schools will close for most pupils. It is not yet clear when the measures will be reviewed, but MPs are likely to be given a vote to approve them retrospectively on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the UK's chief medical officers warned of a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"" in several areas over the next 21 days. Scotland announceda legal requirement to stay at homefrom midnight, with schools to be closed. Mr Johnson will set out plans for England as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations. Both Wales and Northern Ireland are already under national restrictions. On Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. As of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. This is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high. What could 'tougher' coronavirus measures mean? PM: 'No question' Covid measures will be tightened 82-year-old first to get Oxford Covid vaccine Mr Johnson is expected to tell people to work from home unless they are a key worker, or it is not possible for them to do so, for example if they work on a construction site, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. It is also understood that England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has told the prime minister the new variant of coronavirus is now spreading throughout the country. Thenew variant- first identified in Kent and since seen across the UK and other parts of the world - has been found tospread much more easily than earlier variants. A No 10 spokesman said the spread of the new variant had led to ""rapidly escalating case numbers across the country"". ""The prime minister is clear that further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise and to protect the NHS and save lives,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who called for a national lockdown in England within 24 hours on Sunday - said: ""I hope the prime minister has been listening to the clear calls for tough national restrictions."" Hospitals have said they are under ""extreme pressure"" and one of Britain's most senior doctors warned on the weekend that trusts across the UK shouldprepare themselves for a surge in cases. The number of Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals is currently above the level seen in spring 2020. A further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported on Monday, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded. What worked before may not work again - even a repeat of the March lockdown may not be enough to contain the new variant. Consider the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus onto on average. The March lockdown brought R down to 0.6 and led to a sharp decline in cases. Every 100 infected people passed the virus onto 60 others, who passed it onto 36, then 21, then 12 and so on. But the new variant is thought to be around 50% more transmissible so its R number, in the same lockdown conditions, would be around 0.9. Then 100 infected people would pass the virus onto 90 others, then 81, then 73, then 66 and so on. This is a far slower decline. However, uncertainty around the new variant means there are scenarios where its levels plateau rather than fall during lockdown conditions. It is going to be a tough start to the year. Even with immediate and tough restrictions there are a projected 20,000 additional deaths in the first months of 2021. Now more than ever this is a race between the virus and the vaccine. Mr Johnson's address comes as UK chief medical officers recommendedthe Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level. It means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement. NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a ""critical point"" and that ""immediate and decisive action"" is needed. Previously, the government described level five as requiring stricter social distancing measures. The first lockdown, which began in March 2020, was when the UK was under level four. These Covid threat levels are separate to the regional tier system of restrictions in England. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Announcing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year.""

Updates were brought to you today by Claire Heald, Vanessa Barford, James Clarke, Doug Faulkner, Becky Morton, Mary
OâConnor, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Jen Meierhans, George Wright, Katie Wright, Victoria Bisset and Sarah Fowler. We're about to close the live page now, but before we go, here's a quick re-cap of the key points from Boris Johnson's speech:  Business leaders are reacting with concern to the fresh lockdown announced by Boris Johnson amid fears that companies may not last until the spring. British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall says: ""Businesses will understand why the prime minister has felt compelled to act on the spiralling threat to public health, but they will be baffled and disappointed by the fact that he did not announce additional support for affected businesses alongside these new restrictions. Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of London First, says: ""The Government must now extend business rates and VAT relief throughout 2021 and stand ready to pump further direct support to businesses forced to close.""  Now for some more reaction to the news that schools will be moving to remote learning for most pupils under England's new lockdown measures. Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union: âNo one wanted schools and colleges to be shut again but the evidence clearly pointed to the necessity for this to happen weeks ago. ""Why Boris Johnson allowed such confusion and chaos to build up around school openings before making this belated, blindingly obvious decision is beyond belief. ""Government must take responsibility for this closure because it has allowed Covid-19 to become, again, out of control.â Reality Check Boris
Johnson said that the UK has vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe
combined. As of 27
December, 944,539 people in the UK had received the first dose of the Covid-19
vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. The latest
data from 22 of the EU's 27 member states, collected by Our World in Data, shows 682,279 vaccinations have
been carried out so far. As each EU
member state publishes its own statistics, some of this data goes up to early
January but some only to late December. Germany is
leading the EU, having vaccinated 265,610 people as of 3 January. France though
had only vaccinated 516 citizens by 1 January and the Netherlands won't begin
vaccinations till 8 January. The UK
started vaccinating citizens with the Pfizer jab on 8 December, while the EU vaccine
rollout began on 27 December. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Egyptian authorities
are denying claims that at least six Covid-19 patients died in two government
hospitals over the past two days due to a lack of oxygen. It follows anger aftera video of nurses in intensive care units struggling to keep patients alive,externalwas
widely shared on social media. At one point, a nurse in
blue PPE can be seen crumpled over on the floor in apparent shock. The voice of
the person filming repeats: âAll those in the intensive care are dead... there is
no oxygen.â In a statement on Facebook,external, Egyptâs health ministry spokesman said there were sufficient oxygen supplies at all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. He said that most of the deaths at two hospitals in the north of the country - Al-Husseiniya and Zefta - were patients already suffering from chronic diseases. The ministry spokesman called on the media not to spread âinaccurate or false information that may cause panic among people"". In Egypt, there have been 142,187 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 7,805 deaths. However, many experts suspect the actual figures are far higher. The government has now publishedfull guidance,externalon what people are allowed to do in England under the new national lockdown. Here's a quick summary of the new rules: Cyprus and Brazil  have become the latest countries to identify the new coronavirus variant, which was first discovered in the UK. In total, more than 30 countries around the world have seen cases involving the new strain, including: Sir Keir Starmer said the most important thing is the messaging about 'stay at home' and going back to the spirit of March ""because a lot is now going to depend on the willingness of people to comply and I urge everyone to comply"". He adds: ""We have to rekindle that spirit and I think that in a way we need to remake that contract with the British people, in return for you enduring these measures now for the coming weeks the vaccine must be rolled out at speed. We need this to be mission critical. We were the first country to get the vaccine and we need to be the first country to have the vaccine programme rolled out."" Reality Check We know that the UK is going to
threat level 5, the highest level, which means there is a danger of the NHS
being overwhelmed within 21 days. When the prime minister announced
these threat levels in May he was clear that during the first lockdown the country
had only been in level four. At the time he also said:,externalâThe
higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.â So on that basis should we have expected tighter restrictions in England than we saw during the
first lockdown in March? If anything, the restrictions
appear slightly less severe. For example, support bubbles and childcare bubbles
exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds will be open when they were closed
last time. Communal worship is still
allowed as long as social distancing is observed. One significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops, public transport or places of worship. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The lockdown announcement
contained the clearest indication yet of how quickly the government hopes to
vaccinate the at risk groups. A target of mid February for
vaccinating all the over 70s and those deemed extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care
staff opens up a pathway to a significant easing of restrictions by the start of
March. But it will require a rapid
acceleration in vaccination rates. So far nearly one million
people have been vaccinated. By the end of the week that
number is expected to double. The hope is that later in
January two million doses a week will be given. That will be the minimum needed
â there are around 12 million in those priority groups. By vaccinating them, there is
the potential to prevent close to nine in 10 deaths. But achieving that requires a
lot to go right. There is enough vaccine in
the country to vaccinate that many people, but not all of it has been through
the final âfill and finishâ process which involves packaging it in glass vials
(and there is a shortage of those) and then the batches have to be checked and
signed off by the regulator â a process that is taking weeks at the moment. And all of that is before it
is sent out to the NHS vaccination centres to inject it into peopleâs arms. The Labour leader say it's time for everyone to pull together. Sir Keir Starmer says: ""The situation we are in is obviously very serious, the figures are very stark and these measures are necessary, sadly, and therefore we support the packages of measures that the prime minister has just outlined. ""And I think whatever our criticisms and challenges of the government we've all got to pull together now to make this work over the next few weeks and months. ""It's going to be a very, very difficult period, there are questions about the timing of decisions etc but now is the time to support this package, pull together and try do everything we can to try and make this work."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Itâs a familiar mantra but one that many hoped had been left in
the past.Stay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives.That was the key,
simple message when the first lockdown was introduced back in March. It was
well understood and big news in England when the government decided to modify
it. But now, itâs back. And, as in Tier 4, the Stay at Home message will be
legally enforceable. While saying that the new
variant means there needs to be another lockdown, the prime minister is also
trying to emphasise a hope that didnât exist before, back in March. Specifically, the vaccine. Significantly, heâs outlined an ambition that the
top four priority groups will have received their first dose by mid-February.
However, as weâve learnt so many times, caution can be the watchword when it
comes to coronavirus. But ministers do want to keep emphasising that there is
hope, amidst all the gloom. The prime minister says by the middle of February, ""if things go well"", the government expects to have
offered a first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups. This includes vaccinating all residents in a care home for
older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70 and all frontline health
and social care workers If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups âwe will have removed
huge numbers of people from the path of the virus"", he says. ""That will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have
endured for so long."" Johnson stresses there will remain a time lag of two to
three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity, and there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted. ""So we
should remain cautious about the timetable ahead,"" he adds. ""But if
our understanding of the virus doesnât change dramatically once again, if the
rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful, if
deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect, and,
critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules, then I
hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February
half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers."" The PM says the weeks ahead ""will be the hardest yet"". ""But I really do believe we are entering the last phase of the struggle because with every jab that goes into our arms we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people,"" he says. ""Thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight but we know exactly how we are going to get there."" The PM addresses people across the UK, saying he knows how ""tough this is"" and how ""frustrated"" people are. But he says ""now, more than ever, we must pull together"". Mr Johnson says people should follow the new rules from now, which  will become law in the early hours of Wednesday
morning and parliament will meet remotely later that day. He says the governments of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland
share his ""conviction"" that this is a ""pivotal moment"" and were taking similar steps to contain the spread of the virus. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Once again it
is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. In England
there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid
since Christmas day. To put that
into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled. Currently around
three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease. In some
hospitals it is more than six in 10. But what is
worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to
increase. In the spring
it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak. The last six
days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the
UK â a number of these infections are next weekâs hospital admissions. It is why the
UKâs chief medical officers were warning there was a âmaterial riskâ of some
hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change. The PM repeats the advice of the UK's chief medical officers that the nation's Covid alert level should move to level 5 - ""meaning that if action is not taken, NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days"". He adds though, that there is ""one huge difference"" compared to last time, saying the UK is ""rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in its history"" and had so far ""vaccinated more people than in the rest of Europe combined"". He says the ""pace of vaccination is accelerating"" thanks to the arrival of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which patients began receiving earlier today.  The prime minister says he ""completely understands the inconvenience and distress"" the disruption to education will cause parents and pupils. But he says the government has been doing ""everything in our power to keep schools
openâ because of the importance of education to childrenâs
life chances. ""The problem is not that schools are unsafe for children,"" he says, adding that children are still very unlikely to be severely affected even by the new variant of Covid. But he says schools may act as ""vectors for transmission"", causing the virus to spread between households. The prime minister adds that given the alarming figures, it had become ""clear that we need to do more"" to bring the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant ""under control"" and help the vaccination roll-out in the UK. He says we must therefore go into a national lockdown, with the government once more telling people to stay at home, except for specific reasons, including essential shopping, to work, if you cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical help, and to escape domestic abuse. He says the government will be advising clinical extremely people to begin shielding again. Primary and secondary schools must move to remote learning from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and those of key workers, he adds. Given this, it is not ""fair"" for all exams to go ahead this summer, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson is expected to announce a set of new national restrictions for England, similar to the March lockdown, in a televised address at 20:00 GMT. The PM is likely to urge the public to follow the new rules from midnight. It is expected people will be told to work from home if possible and schools will close for most pupils. It is not yet clear when the measures will be reviewed, but MPs are likely to be given a vote to approve them retrospectively on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the UK's chief medical officers warned of a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"" in several areas over the next 21 days. Scotland announceda legal requirement to stay at homefrom midnight, with schools to be closed. Mr Johnson will set out plans for England as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations. Both Wales and Northern Ireland are already under national restrictions. On Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. As of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. This is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high. What could 'tougher' coronavirus measures mean? PM: 'No question' Covid measures will be tightened 82-year-old first to get Oxford Covid vaccine Mr Johnson is expected to tell people to work from home unless they are a key worker, or it is not possible for them to do so, for example if they work on a construction site, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. It is also understood that England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has told the prime minister the new variant of coronavirus is now spreading throughout the country. Thenew variant- first identified in Kent and since seen across the UK and other parts of the world - has been found tospread much more easily than earlier variants. A No 10 spokesman said the spread of the new variant had led to ""rapidly escalating case numbers across the country"". ""The prime minister is clear that further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise and to protect the NHS and save lives,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who called for a national lockdown in England within 24 hours on Sunday - said: ""I hope the prime minister has been listening to the clear calls for tough national restrictions."" Hospitals have said they are under ""extreme pressure"" and one of Britain's most senior doctors warned on the weekend that trusts across the UK shouldprepare themselves for a surge in cases. The number of Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals is currently above the level seen in spring 2020. A further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported on Monday, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded. What worked before may not work again - even a repeat of the March lockdown may not be enough to contain the new variant. Consider the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus onto on average. The March lockdown brought R down to 0.6 and led to a sharp decline in cases. Every 100 infected people passed the virus onto 60 others, who passed it onto 36, then 21, then 12 and so on. But the new variant is thought to be around 50% more transmissible so its R number, in the same lockdown conditions, would be around 0.9. Then 100 infected people would pass the virus onto 90 others, then 81, then 73, then 66 and so on. This is a far slower decline. However, uncertainty around the new variant means there are scenarios where its levels plateau rather than fall during lockdown conditions. It is going to be a tough start to the year. Even with immediate and tough restrictions there are a projected 20,000 additional deaths in the first months of 2021. Now more than ever this is a race between the virus and the vaccine. Mr Johnson's address comes as UK chief medical officers recommendedthe Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level. It means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement. NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a ""critical point"" and that ""immediate and decisive action"" is needed. Previously, the government described level five as requiring stricter social distancing measures. The first lockdown, which began in March 2020, was when the UK was under level four. These Covid threat levels are separate to the regional tier system of restrictions in England. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

OâConnor, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Jen Meierhans, George Wright, Katie Wright, Victoria Bisset and Sarah Fowler. We're about to close the live page now, but before we go, here's a quick re-cap of the key points from Boris Johnson's speech:  Business leaders are reacting with concern to the fresh lockdown announced by Boris Johnson amid fears that companies may not last until the spring.

Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of London First, says: ""The Government must now extend business rates and VAT relief throughout 2021 and stand ready to pump further direct support to businesses forced to close.""  Now for some more reaction to the news that schools will be moving to remote learning for most pupils under England's new lockdown measures. Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union: âNo one wanted schools and colleges to be shut again but the evidence clearly pointed to the necessity for this to happen weeks ago. ""Why Boris Johnson allowed such confusion and chaos to build up around school openings before making this belated, blindingly obvious decision is beyond belief. ""Government must take responsibility for this closure because it has allowed Covid-19 to become, again, out of control.â Reality Check Boris
Johnson said that the UK has vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe
combined. As of 27
December, 944,539 people in the UK had received the first dose of the Covid-19
vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. The latest
data from 22 of the EU's 27 member states, collected by Our World in Data, shows 682,279 vaccinations have
been carried out so far. As each EU
member state publishes its own statistics, some of this data goes up to early
January but some only to late December. Germany is
leading the EU, having vaccinated 265,610 people as of 3 January. France though
had only vaccinated 516 citizens by 1 January and the Netherlands won't begin
vaccinations till 8 January. The UK
started vaccinating citizens with the Pfizer jab on 8 December, while the EU vaccine
rollout began on 27 December. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Egyptian authorities
are denying claims that at least six Covid-19 patients died in two government
hospitals over the past two days due to a lack of oxygen. It follows anger aftera video of nurses in intensive care units struggling to keep patients alive,externalwas
widely shared on social media. At one point, a nurse in
blue PPE can be seen crumpled over on the floor in apparent shock. The voice of
the person filming repeats: âAll those in the intensive care are dead... there is
no oxygen.â In a statement on Facebook,external, Egyptâs health ministry spokesman said there were sufficient oxygen supplies at all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. He said that most of the deaths at two hospitals in the north of the country - Al-Husseiniya and Zefta - were patients already suffering from chronic diseases. The ministry spokesman called on the media not to spread âinaccurate or false information that may cause panic among people"". In Egypt, there have been 142,187 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 7,805 deaths. However, many experts suspect the actual figures are far higher. The government has now publishedfull guidance,externalon what people are allowed to do in England under the new national lockdown. Here's a quick summary of the new rules: Cyprus and Brazil  have become the latest countries to identify the new coronavirus variant, which was first discovered in the UK. In total, more than 30 countries around the world have seen cases involving the new strain, including: Sir Keir Starmer said the most important thing is the messaging about 'stay at home' and going back to the spirit of March ""because a lot is now going to depend on the willingness of people to comply and I urge everyone to comply"". He adds: ""We have to rekindle that spirit and I think that in a way we need to remake that contract with the British people, in return for you enduring these measures now for the coming weeks the vaccine must be rolled out at speed. We need this to be mission critical. We were the first country to get the vaccine and we need to be the first country to have the vaccine programme rolled out."" Reality Check We know that the UK is going to
threat level 5, the highest level, which means there is a danger of the NHS
being overwhelmed within 21 days. When the prime minister announced
these threat levels in May he was clear that during the first lockdown the country
had only been in level four. At the time he also said:,externalâThe
higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.â So on that basis should we have expected tighter restrictions in England than we saw during the
first lockdown in March? If anything, the restrictions
appear slightly less severe. For example, support bubbles and childcare bubbles
exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds will be open when they were closed
last time. Communal worship is still
allowed as long as social distancing is observed. One significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops, public transport or places of worship. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The lockdown announcement
contained the clearest indication yet of how quickly the government hopes to
vaccinate the at risk groups. A target of mid February for
vaccinating all the over 70s and those deemed extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care
staff opens up a pathway to a significant easing of restrictions by the start of
March. But it will require a rapid
acceleration in vaccination rates. So far nearly one million
people have been vaccinated. By the end of the week that
number is expected to double. The hope is that later in
January two million doses a week will be given. That will be the minimum needed
â there are around 12 million in those priority groups. By vaccinating them, there is
the potential to prevent close to nine in 10 deaths. But achieving that requires a
lot to go right. There is enough vaccine in
the country to vaccinate that many people, but not all of it has been through
the final âfill and finishâ process which involves packaging it in glass vials
(and there is a shortage of those) and then the batches have to be checked and
signed off by the regulator â a process that is taking weeks at the moment. And all of that is before it
is sent out to the NHS vaccination centres to inject it into peopleâs arms. The Labour leader say it's time for everyone to pull together. Sir Keir Starmer says: ""The situation we are in is obviously very serious, the figures are very stark and these measures are necessary, sadly, and therefore we support the packages of measures that the prime minister has just outlined. ""And I think whatever our criticisms and challenges of the government we've all got to pull together now to make this work over the next few weeks and months. ""It's going to be a very, very difficult period, there are questions about the timing of decisions etc but now is the time to support this package, pull together and try do everything we can to try and make this work."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Itâs a familiar mantra but one that many hoped had been left in
the past.Stay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives.That was the key,
simple message when the first lockdown was introduced back in March. It was
well understood and big news in England when the government decided to modify
it. But now, itâs back. And, as in Tier 4, the Stay at Home message will be
legally enforceable. While saying that the new
variant means there needs to be another lockdown, the prime minister is also
trying to emphasise a hope that didnât exist before, back in March. Specifically, the vaccine. Significantly, heâs outlined an ambition that the
top four priority groups will have received their first dose by mid-February.
However, as weâve learnt so many times, caution can be the watchword when it
comes to coronavirus. But ministers do want to keep emphasising that there is
hope, amidst all the gloom. The prime minister says by the middle of February, ""if things go well"", the government expects to have
offered a first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups. This includes vaccinating all residents in a care home for
older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70 and all frontline health
and social care workers If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups âwe will have removed
huge numbers of people from the path of the virus"", he says. ""That will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have
endured for so long."" Johnson stresses there will remain a time lag of two to
three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity, and there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted. ""So we
should remain cautious about the timetable ahead,"" he adds. ""But if
our understanding of the virus doesnât change dramatically once again, if the
rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful, if
deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect, and,
critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules, then I
hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February
half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers."" The PM says the weeks ahead ""will be the hardest yet"". ""But I really do believe we are entering the last phase of the struggle because with every jab that goes into our arms we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people,"" he says. ""Thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight but we know exactly how we are going to get there."" The PM addresses people across the UK, saying he knows how ""tough this is"" and how ""frustrated"" people are. But he says ""now, more than ever, we must pull together"". Mr Johnson says people should follow the new rules from now, which  will become law in the early hours of Wednesday
morning and parliament will meet remotely later that day. He says the governments of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland
share his ""conviction"" that this is a ""pivotal moment"" and were taking similar steps to contain the spread of the virus. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Once again it
is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. In England
there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid
since Christmas day. To put that
into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled. Currently around
three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease. In some
hospitals it is more than six in 10. But what is
worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to
increase. In the spring
it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak. The last six
days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the
UK â a number of these infections are next weekâs hospital admissions. It is why the
UKâs chief medical officers were warning there was a âmaterial riskâ of some
hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change. The PM repeats the advice of the UK's chief medical officers that the nation's Covid alert level should move to level 5 - ""meaning that if action is not taken, NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days"". He adds though, that there is ""one huge difference"" compared to last time, saying the UK is ""rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in its history"" and had so far ""vaccinated more people than in the rest of Europe combined"". He says the ""pace of vaccination is accelerating"" thanks to the arrival of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which patients began receiving earlier today.  The prime minister says he ""completely understands the inconvenience and distress"" the disruption to education will cause parents and pupils. But he says the government has been doing ""everything in our power to keep schools
openâ because of the importance of education to childrenâs
life chances. ""The problem is not that schools are unsafe for children,"" he says, adding that children are still very unlikely to be severely affected even by the new variant of Covid. But he says schools may act as ""vectors for transmission"", causing the virus to spread between households. The prime minister adds that given the alarming figures, it had become ""clear that we need to do more"" to bring the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant ""under control"" and help the vaccination roll-out in the UK. He says we must therefore go into a national lockdown, with the government once more telling people to stay at home, except for specific reasons, including essential shopping, to work, if you cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical help, and to escape domestic abuse. He says the government will be advising clinical extremely people to begin shielding again. Primary and secondary schools must move to remote learning from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and those of key workers, he adds. Given this, it is not ""fair"" for all exams to go ahead this summer, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played 82-year-old Brian Pinker is given the Oxford vaccine at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford Dialysis patient Brian Pinker, 82, has become the first person to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. The retired maintenance manager got the jab at 7:30 GMT from nurse Sam Foster at Oxford's Churchill Hospital. More than half a million doses of the vaccine are ready for use on Monday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was a ""pivotal moment"" in the UK's fight against the virus, as vaccines will help curb infections and then allow restrictions to be lifted. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Mondaythere was ""no question we will have to take tougher measures"", which will be announced in ""due course"", as the UK struggles to control a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus. On Sunday more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases were recorded in the UK for the sixth day running, prompting Labour to call for a third national lockdown in England. Northern IrelandandWalescurrently have their own lockdowns in place and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a fresh lockdown will beginin Scotlandfrom 00:01 on Tuesday. The rollout comes asrows continue over whether pupils should return to schoolwith the current high levels of Covid infections. PM expects 'tens of millions' of jabs by April When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What could 'tougher' coronavirus measures mean? PM: 'No question' tougher Covid measures will happen Six hospital trusts - in Oxford, London, Sussex, Lancashire and Warwickshire - have begun administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, with 530,000 doses ready for use. Most other available doses will be sent to hundreds of GP-led services and care homes across the UK later in the week, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Mr Pinker, who has been having dialysis for kidney disease at the Churchill Hospital for a number of years, said he was ""really proud"" the vaccine was developed in Oxford. ""The nurses, doctors and staff today have all been brilliant and I can now really look forward to celebrating my 48th wedding anniversary with my wife Shirley later this year,"" he said. Father-of-three Trevor Cowlett, 88, also received the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine Music teacher and father-of-three Trevor Cowlett, 88, and Prof Andrew Pollard, a paediatrician working at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and lead investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, were also among the first to be vaccinated. Chief nurse Ms Foster, who administered the first dose, told the BBC it was a ""huge privilege"", saying: ""Every single patient that we have vaccinated over the last couple of weeks have got their own personal stories to the difference it's going to make, so it is no different this morning."" Speaking during a visit to London's Chase Farm Hospital, to meet some of the first people to receive the Oxford vaccine, the prime minister said there were ""tough, tough"" weeks to come. There will now be a ""massive ramp-up"" in vaccination numbers ""in the weeks ahead"", Mr Johnson said, and the number of vaccine doses will amount to ""tens of millions by the end of March"". Asked when the government will be able to vaccinate two million people a week, Mr Johnson said the government will give more details ""in the next few days... as soon as we have better numbers to give"". Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the Oxford vaccine rollout was a ""pivotal moment"" in the fight against coronavirus, saying: ""It's going to be a tough few weeks ahead, but this is the way out."" Asked about reports potential volunteerswere being deterred by the additional training and forms, Mr Hancock said they were going to ""reduce the amount of bureaucracy"". ""For instance there's one of the training programmes about how to tackle terrorism, I don't think that's necessary, we're going to stop that,"" he said. However, he said this was not delaying the delivery of the vaccine, adding that the next delivery of the vaccine will be ""early this week"" to be ""deployed next week"". England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the vaccines ""give us a route out in the medium term"" but warned the NHS was ""under considerable and rising pressure in the short term"". Former health secretary and Conservative chairman of the Commons' health committee Jeremy Hunttweeted,externalthat it was ""time to act"" and the government needed to close schools and borders, ban all household mixing and impose a 12-week national lockdown in England.

Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth agreed that a national lockdown was needed, as well as ""rapidly scaled-up vaccine distribution"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'This way can save more lives' As the recent rise in Covid cases puts increased pressure on the NHS, the UK has accelerated its vaccination rollout by planning to give both doses of the vaccine 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between jabs. The UK's chief medical officers have defended the delay to second doses, saying getting more people vaccinated with the first jab ""is much more preferable"". Make no mistake, the UK is in a race against time. That much is clear from the decision to delay the second dose of the vaccine to focus on giving as many people as possible their first doses. So how fast can the NHS go? Ultimately it wants to get to two million doses a week. That will not be achieved this week. But Monday marks the start of the NHS putting the accelerator to the floor. A rapid increase in the vaccination rate should follow. But how quickly the UK can go is dependent on several complex processes. First, the vaccine has to be manufactured, then it has to be put into vials and packaged up (known as fill and finish). After that each batch has to be checked and certified before being sent to NHS vaccination sites where there needs to be enough vaccinators and support staff to ensure those doses are given as quickly as possible. Problems at any one stage can disrupt how quickly the vaccination programme can be rolled out. While there are millions of doses of each vaccine in the country and a total of 140 million of both vaccines pre-ordered, there are currently just over one million - around 500,000 of each - ready to be given this week. NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: ""The NHS' biggest vaccination programme in history is off to a strong start, thanks to the tremendous efforts of NHS staff who have already delivered more than one million jabs."" He said the Oxford vaccine rollout was ""chalking up another world first that will protect thousands more over the coming weeks"". The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first jab approved in the UK, and more than a million people have had their first one. The first person to get the jabon 8 December, Margaret Keenan, has already had her second dose. This video can not be played Dr Nikita Kanani, NHS England's medical director for primary care, says it's crucial to get more patients the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine The Oxford jab -which was approved for use in late December- can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, making it easier to distribute and store than the Pfizer jab. It is also cheaper per dose. The UK has secured 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for most of the population. Care home residents and staff, people aged over 80, and frontline NHS staff will be first to receive it. GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GPs and local vaccination services have been asked to ensure every care home resident in their local area is vaccinated by the end of January, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Some 730 vaccination sites have already been established across the UK, with the total set to surpass 1,000 later this week, the department added.

"NÃ³ra Quoirin was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder that affects brain development A girl whose body was found in a jungle during a holiday in Malaysia died by misadventure, a coroner has recorded. NÃ³ra Quoirin, 15, from Balham, south-west London, was discovered dead nine days after she went missing from an eco-resort in August 2019. The family said they were ""utterly disappointed"" with the verdict, which ruled out any criminal involvement. They believe ""layers of evidence"" that were heard at the inquest point towards Nora having been abducted. The family were staying in Sora House in Dusun eco-resort near Seremban, about 40 miles (65km) south of Kuala Lumpur, when they reported NÃ³ra missing, the day after they had arrived. NÃ³ra, who was born with holoprosencephaly - a disorder which affects brain development - was eventually found by a group of civilian volunteers in a palm-oil plantation less than two miles from the holiday home. The girl who vanished into a Malaysian jungle The Quoirins, whose lawyers had asked the coroner to record an open verdict, said in a statement after the ruling that they have a number of reasons for the abduction theory. These include: Professionally trained canines were unable to follow NÃ³ra's scent. There was an opened window to the chalet with unidentified fingerprints found on the outside. NÃ³ra had ""neither the cognitive, nor physical means"" to leave the chalet by the window on her own. Hundreds of people relentlessly searched the surrounding area, including where NÃ³ra was found, on the day of or immediately preceding the day of her death. They found no signs of human life. There was a ""lack of major physical damage"" to NÃ³ra's body despite her ""inability to handle terrain as complex as the Seremban jungle"". Search and rescue teams were deployed in an effort to locate Nora In the statement, issued through theLucie Blackman Trust,external, the family said they witnessed 80 slides presented in court as the verdict was given, adding that none of them ""engaged with who NÃ³ra really was - neither her personality nor her intellectual abilities"". They said: ""The coroner made mention several times of her inability to rule on certain points due to not knowing NÃ³ra enough. ""It is indeed our view that to know NÃ³ra would be to know that she was simply incapable of hiding in undergrowth, climbing out a window and making her way out of a fenced resort in the darkness unclothed."" Group 'waited hours' after schoolgirl's body find 'Voice heard' at vanished girl's holiday home Vanished girl's body 'showed no signs of assault' Male DNA 'found near dead schoolgirl' The statement added: ""We believe we have fought not just for NÃ³ra but in honour of all the special needs children in this world who deserve our most committed support and the most careful application of justice. ""This is NÃ³ra's unique legacy and we will never let it go."" Fom the outsetMeabh Quoirin believed her daughter had been abductedbut Malaysian police insisted NÃ³ra's disappearance had always been a missing persons case and ruled out any criminal involvement. The authorities closed the case in January 2020, and NÃ³ra's parents pushed for the inquest. This video can not be played Police played the sound of NÃ³ra's mother's voice through a loudspeaker in the jungle During the inquest, a British pathologist who carried out a second post-mortem examination saidNÃ³ra's body had no injuriesto suggest she was attacked or restrained. On the final day of evidence, an investigating officer who was on duty the morning NÃ³ra was reported missing said he wasconfident there were no criminal elements involvedin her disappearance. Following the coroner's verdict, the Quoirins' legal team have discussed the family's rights moving forward, which include the possibility of applying for a revision of the misadventure verdict at the High Court of Seremban. Louise Azmi, one lawyer for the family, said they had pressed for an open verdict to reflect the lack of positive evidence in the case regarding what happened to Nora. An open verdict would leave open the possibility that a criminal element was involved in Nora's death, Mrs Azmi said. She told the BBC based on everything the family know of Nora, ""they continue to believe it is impossible she would have willingly walked away into the jungle"". The family's legal team say parents Meabh and Sebastien Quoirin are ""disappointed"" with today's verdict. But, Coroner Maimoonah Aid said her verdict was made not on ""theories"" and ""speculation"" surrounding the case, but on the balance of probabilities of the evidence presented before her. With no evidence to the contrary she ruled out foul play. Moving forward, the Quoirin family now have the possibility to apply for a revision of the verdict with the High Court of Seremban. There is precedent of a verdict being overturned in Malaysia before. In 2019, following an appeal, a Malaysian coroner's verdict of misadventure concerning the death of 18-year-old model Ivana Smit was overturned in Kuala Lumpur and reopened as a murder investigation. According to Quoirin family lawyer Sakthy Vell, the family say they now need time to consider their next course of action.

"First Minister Arlene Foster and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill met throughout Monday There will be an extended period of remote learning for schools in Northern Ireland, the executive has said. Ministers met on Monday night asother parts of the UK tightened their coronavirus restrictions. The Stormont executive also plans to give its stay at home guidance legal force, with new restrictions on travel. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said details would be formalised on Tuesday. The health and education ministers will bring separate papers on the issues to the executive at the meeting, she added. Northern Ireland's Education Minister Peter Weir had previously announceda staggered return to school for pupilsduring the month of January. The first transfer test, used by many grammar schools to select pupils, is due to take place on Saturday but there have beencalls from some teaching unions and political partiesfor the test to be cancelled this year, in light of the uncertainty with the pandemic. In England,all schools and colleges will close to most pupilsand switch to remote learning until the middle of February, and end-of-year exams will not take place this summer as normal. Recommendations on exams in Northern Ireland are also expected to be brought forward by the executive on Tuesday. It is understood ministers will update the assembly on Wednesday about their decisions. First Minister Arlene Foster said the new restrictions were unfortunate, but necessary. She said she believed the stay-at-home message will be in place ""for the rest of January, probably into February"". ""We will of course review it, as we're legally bound to do every couple of weeks."" She added that ministers would ""much prefer"" for face-to-face education to continue, but said they had to ""take into account the very serious situation that we find ourselves in tonight."" Both organisations which organise transfer tests will be making announcements on Tuesday, she said. ""We'll wait to hear what they have to say. They do of course have to abide by public health advice, but they are private organisations and they will make their own announcements."" The Irish government is considering a proposal to close schools for the rest of January. On Monday, the Department of Health reported that a further 1,801 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. There have also been 12 more Covid-19 related deaths. These latest figures from the Department of Health bring the total number of deaths to 1,366, while 79,873 people have tested positive for the virus since the pandemic started. More than 12,000 cases have been reported in the past seven days, more than double the week before. The seven-day rate per 100,000 people is now 660 positive cases, compared to 200 per 100,000 two weeks ago. In the Republic of Ireland on Monday, an additional 6,110 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were announced, with six further deaths linked to the virus. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has alreadyannounced a fresh lockdown therefrom midnight, with schools closed until February. Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme, Dr Michael McBride said Scotland's measures were ""prudent and sensible"". Meanwhile,the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine rollout has begun in Northern Ireland. Up to 11,000 people aged over 80 across Northern Ireland are set to receive the this week, with some of the first doses delivered at a GP surgery on the Falls Road in West Belfast on Monday afternoon. Up to 11,000 people aged over 80 across Northern Ireland are set to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca The SDLP has called for the assembly to be recalled on Tuesday to discuss the rolling out of the vaccine. It can be recalled if at least 30 MLAs sign a petition. On Monday, Justice Minister Naomi Long welcomed the opening of Northern Ireland's first Nightingale venue, which will be used for courts and tribunals business. The facility was approved by a meeting of the executive on 17 December, and will sit in the International Convention Centre in Belfast (ICC). Activity at the centre will be phased in, in line with Covid-19 regulations. In other coronavirus-related developments on Monday: Dr Tom Black, chair of the British Medical Association in Northern Ireland, said it was""appalling"" that the Pfizer vaccine was not to be administered in two doses within 21 days as instructed by the company.

"Boris Johnson is expected to announce a set of new national restrictions for England, similar to the March lockdown, in a televised address at 20:00 GMT. The PM is likely to urge the public to follow the new rules from midnight. It is expected people will be told to work from home if possible and schools will close for most pupils. It is not yet clear when the measures will be reviewed, but MPs are likely to be given a vote to approve them retrospectively on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the UK's chief medical officers warned of a ""material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed"" in several areas over the next 21 days. Scotland announceda legal requirement to stay at homefrom midnight, with schools to be closed. Mr Johnson will set out plans for England as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus regulations. Both Wales and Northern Ireland are already under national restrictions. On Monday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the seventh day in a row. As of 08:00 GMT, there were 26,626 Covid-19 patients in hospital in England, according to the latest figures. This is a week-on-week increase of 30%, and a new record high. What could 'tougher' coronavirus measures mean? PM: 'No question' Covid measures will be tightened 82-year-old first to get Oxford Covid vaccine Mr Johnson is expected to tell people to work from home unless they are a key worker, or it is not possible for them to do so, for example if they work on a construction site, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. It is also understood that England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, has told the prime minister the new variant of coronavirus is now spreading throughout the country. Thenew variant- first identified in Kent and since seen across the UK and other parts of the world - has been found tospread much more easily than earlier variants. A No 10 spokesman said the spread of the new variant had led to ""rapidly escalating case numbers across the country"". ""The prime minister is clear that further steps must now be taken to arrest this rise and to protect the NHS and save lives,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - who called for a national lockdown in England within 24 hours on Sunday - said: ""I hope the prime minister has been listening to the clear calls for tough national restrictions."" Hospitals have said they are under ""extreme pressure"" and one of Britain's most senior doctors warned on the weekend that trusts across the UK shouldprepare themselves for a surge in cases. The number of Covid-19 patients in UK hospitals is currently above the level seen in spring 2020. A further 58,784 cases and an additional 407 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported on Monday, though deaths in Scotland were not recorded. What worked before may not work again - even a repeat of the March lockdown may not be enough to contain the new variant. Consider the R number - the number of people each infected person passes the virus onto on average. The March lockdown brought R down to 0.6 and led to a sharp decline in cases. Every 100 infected people passed the virus onto 60 others, who passed it onto 36, then 21, then 12 and so on. But the new variant is thought to be around 50% more transmissible so its R number, in the same lockdown conditions, would be around 0.9. Then 100 infected people would pass the virus onto 90 others, then 81, then 73, then 66 and so on. This is a far slower decline. However, uncertainty around the new variant means there are scenarios where its levels plateau rather than fall during lockdown conditions. It is going to be a tough start to the year. Even with immediate and tough restrictions there are a projected 20,000 additional deaths in the first months of 2021. Now more than ever this is a race between the virus and the vaccine. Mr Johnson's address comes as UK chief medical officers recommendedthe Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level. It means the NHS may soon be unable to handle a further sustained rise in cases, the medical officers said in a joint statement. NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, said hospitals were at a ""critical point"" and that ""immediate and decisive action"" is needed. Previously, the government described level five as requiring stricter social distancing measures. The first lockdown, which began in March 2020, was when the UK was under level four. These Covid threat levels are separate to the regional tier system of restrictions in England. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Announcing tougher measures in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""It is no exaggeration to say that I am more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year."" The new restrictions in Scotland mean it will be a legal requirement to stay at home except for certain essential purposes, similar to the first lockdown last March. Schools will be closed to pupils until February. In Wales, all schools and colleges will move to online learninguntil at least 18 January. Northern Ireland's Stormont Executiveare also meeting to discuss possible new measuresin light of Mr Johnson's televised address - which will air on BBC One andthe BBC iPlayerfrom 19:35 GMT. The prime minister will speak amid continued uncertainty over whether schools will remain open to all pupils in England, after several councilsrequested classrooms stay shut.

""The nurses, doctors and staff today have all been brilliant and I can now really look forward to celebrating my 48th wedding anniversary with my wife Shirley later this year,"" Mr Pinker said.

"This video can not be played PM: 'No question we're going to have to take tougher measures' Boris Johnson has said there is ""no question"" the government will announce stricter measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus ""in due course"". He predicted ""tough, tough"" weeks to come, with more than three-quarters of England's population already under the highest - tier four - restrictions. On Sunday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the sixth day in a row. Labour is calling for new England-wide restrictions to come in immediately. Leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""inevitable"" more schools would have to close to lessen the spread of coronavirus. 82-year-old first to get Oxford Covid vaccine PM: Send children to school on Monday What could 'tougher' coronavirus measures mean? UK coronavirus cases up by 54,990 on Sunday In Scotland, further new restrictions are to come into force at midnight,including a ""legal requirement"" for people to stay at home.except for essential purposes. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland was effectively returning to conditions similar to Spring's nation-wide lockdown, with the curbs in place until at least the end of January. An additional 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported across the UK on Sunday, meaning the total by this measure is now above 75,000. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""old tier system"" in England was ""no longer strong enough"" to contain increasing infections. Hospitals are coming under increasing pressure, as cases mount up. The old tier system is no longer enoughâ¦the figures are only heading in one direction. These are the words of the health secretary and a health minister. Boris Johnson says stricter measures are coming, which immediately sparks the questions ""when?,"" and ""what are you waiting for?"" Downing Street wants to push a tougher message on adherence to the current rules in England while it assesses the latest Christmas data, but is coming under growing pressure to act sooner. With Nicola Sturgeon about to go further in Scotland and the Labour leader calling for an immediate national lockdown, it's difficult to see how the prime minister can wait much longer. Asked what further restrictions would be put in place, Mr Johnson said: ""What we have been waiting for is to see the impact of the tier four measures on the virus and it is a bit unclear, still, at the moment. ""But if you look at the numbers, there is no question that we are going to have to take tougher measures and we will be announcing those in due course."" He said the faster-spreading coronavirus variant that has developed in south-eastern England required ""extra-special vigilance"". BBC science editor David Shukman said new measures could include limits on outdoor exercise and a return to the two-metre (rather than one-metre-plus) social distancing rule, as applied during the first lockdown last year. Speaking on a visit to Chase Farm Hospital in north London, the prime minister argued that closing primary schools must remain a ""last resort"", adding that the ""risk to kids"" was ""very, very small"". Secondary schools in England are currently closed until 18 January, except for pupils in their final GCSE and A-level years, who are due to return on 11 January. Asked whether they could remain closed, Mr Johnson said: ""We are keeping things under review."" But former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged the government to close all schools and UK borders ""right away"", while banning ""all household mixing"". The Conservative MP, who now chairs the Commons Health Committee, said these restrictions should be ""time-limited"" to ""12 weeks or so"", after which the roll-out of vaccines would provide ""light at the end of the tunnel"". More than 500,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine are now available for use, with the Pfizer BioNTech jab having been issued since early last month. The virus is winning at the moment, despite science fighting back with a vaccine. New daily cases of Covid have been rising to record levels, which means hospital numbers and deaths will increase too. Ministers say more measures are coming, but it is not clear yet what that will mean in practice. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are already in lockdown, and most of England is under tier four rules. In recent days the focus has shifted to schools and whether they can be kept open without making the epidemic worse. Experts agree that the risk the virus poses to children is still low, but they can spread the disease. With a new, more transmissible variant of Covid circulating, the government may have to enact this unpalatable ""last resort"" of closing classrooms. Some 78% of the population of England is now in tier four, under which non-essential shops are closed and people can only leave their homes for a certain number of reasons. The Scottish governmentmeets laterto consider ""further action"", with all of mainland Scotland currently under its ownlevel fourrestrictions - only some islands are under less stringent tier three measures. Wales entered a nationwide lockdown on 20 December, while Northern Ireland is in the second week of asix-week lockdownthat began on Boxing Day. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters In another development, an academic has said there is a ""big question mark"" over whether a vaccine developed at Oxford University will be as effective against anew variant of the virusthat has emerged in South Africa. Prof Sir John Bell, Regius professor of medicine at the university, said the team there were currently investigating this question ""right now"". He added it was ""unlikely"" the variant would ""turn off the effect of vaccines entirely"", and in any case it would be possible to tweak the vaccine in around four to six weeks. But Matt Hancock told Today he was ""incredibly worried"" about the South African variant, saying: ""This is a very, very significant problem."" ""We have shown that we are prepared to move incredibly quickly, within 24 hours if we think that is necessary, and we keep these things under review all the time,"" added the health secretary.

"This video can not be played The first minister says the phased return allows local circumstances to be taken into account. Closing schools will be a ""last resort"" that depends on scientific evidence, Wales' health minister has said. Some schools are due to welcome pupils back this week as the Welsh Government comes under fire from teachers' unions. Health minister Vaughan Gething said: ""If the evidence changes then we'll have to take account of that... and that may lead to a different choice."" Evidence is expected shortlyon the new Covid-19 variant, but local authorities have control over schools re-opening. Under a ""flexible"" agreement with the Welsh Governmentsome schools are due to open on Wednesday, local authorities said. First MinisterMark Drakeford has defended this flexibilitythat leaves the decision with local authorities on when to allow children back to school. But,unions have threatened legal actionbecause of concerns about the new variant. At Monday's coronavirus press briefing, Mr Gething said schools will continue with the phased return to face-to-face learning over the first two weeks of the new term unless the ""evidence changes"". ""The plan is for schools to open in a flexible wayâ¦ we made a choice before the Christmas break to have this flexible approach to opening, so we can learn and try to understand more of what is happening,"" he said. ""Now, if we get evidence and advice today, then that is advice we may well need to act upon today or tomorrow."" He stressed that decisions on schools ""are always underpinned by evidence"". Closing primary schools ""has a real impact on people being able to go to work"" and online learning is ""practically more difficult"" for younger pupils, he added. Schools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers while other pupils are taught online until face-to-face teaching resumes. The Trades' Union Congress - the UK's umbrella union body -has called for parents who are juggling their work lives with childcare should be put on furloughas long as schools are closed. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said there had to be as much ""advance warning as possible"" on any plans to change the return to school. ""I feel for students and I feel for teachers and here we are on the first day of term with a lack of assurance of what's coming down the line,"" he said. The Ynys Mon MS said the Welsh Government should make a statement on ""what the impact is"" of the new variant on schools so that schools can plan. ""It cannot be an end to education - it must be a move to full online education"", he added. Education Minister Kirsty Williams moved learning online for secondary schools and further education colleges in early December With Covid-19 cases rising in early December,Education Minister Kirsty Williams announcedall secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales would move to online learning as part of a ""national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus"". The move was criticised by children's commissioner for Wales Sally Holland, who said it was disruptive to education. But many parents had alreadystarted withdrawing their children from school earlydue to fears of having to self-isolate over Christmas. A week later, the Welsh Local Government Associationsaid children would return to school on a staggered basisafter the Christmas break, with a full return expected by 18 January. This sparked outrage from teachers' unions, who said schools would ""yet again"" have to ""pick up the pieces of a last-minute announcement"". Amelie Boyce, a sixth form student at Neath College, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast she had been enjoying online learning and felt ""a bit more worried I think for going back to college than I was maybe last term because obviously the virus is a lot more dangerous now"". But she added it was more difficult working in her bedroom at home as ""that's the place where I relax most of the time, so it's not really a working environment"". Tim Newbould, head teacher at Penycae Community Primary School in Wrexham, said he had mixed feelings about the return to school, but welcomed the flexibility given by the Welsh Government. ""We don't know yet the impact of Christmas Day,"" he said. He added six of his staff had been off following positive Covid tests and ""a number of us have been quite poorly, so we're well aware of the risks."" Mr Newbould said absence from school had an obvious impact on pupils' academic progress, but there was also the effect on socialising with peers, ""which is really important and has an impact on pupils' mental health and wellbeing"". But he stresses ""safety is the key issue"", particularly in light of the new variant of the virus, and that teachers and school staff should receive the vaccine early on. ""We simply don't know whether our risk assessments are adequate for the new variant of the virus,"" he said. ""We're right in front of a large number of pupils at the same time, breathing the same air."" Ceri Reed, from the group Parents Voices in Wales, said many members are worried about the danger of the new variant of the virus. ""I have to admit, we are divided in our group. We represent over 720 parents and carers in Wales, and I think the main concern from those parents who are not considering sending their children into school is because of the new strain,"" she said. ""We are encouraging parents to look at the science, and we need to applaud what the teachers have done from September onwards with things like track and trace. ""They have been absolutely phenomenal and we believe we can do it again."" First Minister Mark Drakeford scrapped a five-day relaxation of lockdown rules over Christmas due to concerns over the new coronavirus variant On 19 December, Mr Drakefordscrapped plans for a five-day relaxation of lockdown rulesover Christmas amid concerns about the spread ofa more virulent variant of coronavirus. Councils pressed on with the plans for a staggered reopening of schools, with the majority of local authorities intending to reopen secondary schools next Monday. Schools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers from this week, and all pupils are expected to take part in remote learning before their schools reopen for face-to-face teaching. On Saturday, theNASUWT teachers' union threatened ""appropriate action""to protect teachers, and the head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said it had taken legal action against the Welsh Government to obtain scientific evidence on the risks of the new variant it said it was ""withholding"". There is ""no evidence that young people get the illness more severely as a result of the variant,"" Mr Drakeford says The National Education Union Cymruhad already called for in-person learning to be delayed until at least 18 January. The unions say more time is needed to assess the risks posed by the new variant and have accused the Welsh Government of ""passing the buck"" to local authorities. On Sunday,a joint statement from nine unionscalled for a national decision on reopening schools rather than leaving it to local councils. In response, Mr Drakeford said there was ""no evidence that young people get the illness more severely as a result of the variant"", adding that the Welsh Government's technical advisory group ""will be looking at all the evidence again early next week"". However Dilwyn Roberts-Young, general secretary of Undeb Cenedlaethol Athrawon Cymru (UCAC), told BBC Wales Breakfast the evidence around transmission rates in schools did not instil confidence. ""We have listened to the first minister's comments about young people getting the illness more severely,"" he said. ""Schools aren't in a vacuum - there are adults in the school, there are older pupils, and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Chris Jones, said just before Christmas that high numbers of incidents continue to be reported, mainly in residential care homes and school settings. ""Looking at the evidence again... it does not give confidence to parents, to staff or to pupils, and if you look at last March, when the education minister talked about the five guiding principles to determine when schools should return to providing education, there was an emphasis on evidence and information, to ensure that any decisions taken are the correct ones.""

"The Scottish cabinet will meet later to consider further measures to help tackle coronavirus, as 2,464 new cases are reported. The Scottish Parliament will then be recalled for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to make an ""urgent statement"". Ms Sturgeon said the ""rapid increase in Covid cases driven by the new variant"" was of ""very serious concern"". ""We are in a race between this faster spreading strain of Covid and the vaccination programme,"" she tweeted. She warned on Friday that the next few weeks could be the most dangerous period for Scotland since March in the fight against Covid. Covid restrictions 'could continue' as cases rise New strain 'accelerating' spread of Covid Hospitals across UK 'must prepare for Covid surge' The latest government figures for coronavirus cases showed that 15.2% of Saturday's 17,328 tests were positive. It is higher than the 2,137 cases reported on Friday, but still lower than Thursday's 2,539 positive results. Figures for hospital admissions and deaths over the holiday weekend will not be published until Tuesday. The cabinet is likely to consider a further delay to the return of Scottish schools and restrictions that are closer to the stay-at-home lockdown in March. ""All decisions just now are tough, with tough impacts,"" Ms Sturgeon wrote on twitter. ""Vaccines give us way out, but this new strain makes the period between now and then the most dangerous since start of pandemic."" The Scottish government's emergency resilience committee heard on Saturday that ""quick and decisive action is needed"" as the new variant of the virus is becoming the dominant one in Scotland. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The even steeper rises and severe pressure on the NHS that is being experienced in some other parts of the UK is a sign of what may lie ahead in Scotland if we do not take all possible steps now to slow the spread of the virus, while the vaccination programme progresses. ""The strong message remains - people should stay at home as much as possible and avoid non-essential interaction with others."" This is just the fifth time the Scottish Parliament has been recalled and the second time within the last week. This video can not be played Prof Linda Bauld says Scots should be prepared a longer period living with level four restrictions Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, from the University of Edinburgh, has said Scotland should be prepared for Covid restrictions to be extended as infection rates continue to rise. She said there were no signs yet that the infection rate was levelling off, having risen suddenly from a daily rate of fewer than 1,000 to more than 2,000 per day in recent days. She told BBC Scotland: ""It definitely is a fragile situation and you can see that we have more cases than we would expect at the current time. ""We may be starting to see some of the impacts of the Christmas mixing, but also we know around four in 10 cases, from recent data, are of the new variant. ""I would imagine that the new variant is playing a role in these higher rates of infection and if these numbers continue to sit at where they are we are going to have more people in hospital in a week or two's time, and that is very worrying."" The new year offers new hope in the struggle against coronavirus with two vaccines now authorised for UK use - but it looks as if the situation will get worse before it gets better. Ministers are worried by the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus during a holiday period when the highest level of restrictions are already in place. They think more needs to be done to suppress the virus, to give the vaccination programme a chance to accelerate and give increasing numbers of people protection. When the Scottish cabinet meets they are likely to consider tightening the current restrictions to something closer to the stay at home lockdown of March 2020. That will almost certainly mean a further delay to the return of schools into February. Ministers will take decisions on Monday morning with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expected to make a statement at Holyrood in the afternoon. Daily confirmed cases in Scotlandreached record highs on the last three days of 2020, rising to to 2,622 on Thursday. Ms Sturgeon warned last week there might be changes to the plans for reopening schools. Children start online learning from 11 January and are set to return to class by 18 January. The education recovery group will meet on Monday. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the situation was ""deteriorating and fast-moving"" but any decision to extend school closures should be clearly explained to parents and teachers. He said: ""We have been here before so if schools remain closed, the Scottish government must show that it has learned from past mistakes in order to minimise disruption to education."" Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the Scottish government should prioritise teachers and school staff as vaccines were rolled out. He added: ""We must be honest and accept that most pupils, teachers and support staff cannot go back to schools until the situation is brought under control."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard called for ministers to publish the evidence behind all of its decisions to ensure public consent and compliance. ""What is clear is that we need to see an acceleration of the vaccine rollout and a step-change in testing,"" he said. ""It is also clear that financial support from government has simply not been nearly sufficient to make up for the damage that lockdown measures have done to jobs, livelihoods and businesses. The SNP government must distribute additional funds to the frontline now."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""With tighter restrictions on movement and in schools comes a greater responsibility on the government to show its workings. ""If we are to restrict people's movement then we need to see what the benefit will be. We need an exit plan to give people hope, as well as to show them what is required to ease the restrictions on our freedoms."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"This video can not be played PM: 'No question we're going to have to take tougher measures' Boris Johnson has said there is ""no question"" the government will announce stricter measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus ""in due course"". He predicted ""tough, tough"" weeks to come, with more than three-quarters of England's population already under the highest - tier four - restrictions. On Sunday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the sixth day in a row. Labour is calling for new England-wide restrictions to come in immediately. Leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""inevitable"" more schools would have to close to lessen the spread of coronavirus. 82-year-old first to get Oxford Covid vaccine PM: Send children to school on Monday What could 'tougher' coronavirus measures mean? UK coronavirus cases up by 54,990 on Sunday In Scotland, further new restrictions are to come into force at midnight,including a ""legal requirement"" for people to stay at home.except for essential purposes. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland was effectively returning to conditions similar to Spring's nation-wide lockdown, with the curbs in place until at least the end of January. An additional 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported across the UK on Sunday, meaning the total by this measure is now above 75,000. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""old tier system"" in England was ""no longer strong enough"" to contain increasing infections. Hospitals are coming under increasing pressure, as cases mount up. The old tier system is no longer enoughâ¦the figures are only heading in one direction. These are the words of the health secretary and a health minister. Boris Johnson says stricter measures are coming, which immediately sparks the questions ""when?,"" and ""what are you waiting for?"" Downing Street wants to push a tougher message on adherence to the current rules in England while it assesses the latest Christmas data, but is coming under growing pressure to act sooner. With Nicola Sturgeon about to go further in Scotland and the Labour leader calling for an immediate national lockdown, it's difficult to see how the prime minister can wait much longer. Asked what further restrictions would be put in place, Mr Johnson said: ""What we have been waiting for is to see the impact of the tier four measures on the virus and it is a bit unclear, still, at the moment. ""But if you look at the numbers, there is no question that we are going to have to take tougher measures and we will be announcing those in due course."" He said the faster-spreading coronavirus variant that has developed in south-eastern England required ""extra-special vigilance"". BBC science editor David Shukman said new measures could include limits on outdoor exercise and a return to the two-metre (rather than one-metre-plus) social distancing rule, as applied during the first lockdown last year. Speaking on a visit to Chase Farm Hospital in north London, the prime minister argued that closing primary schools must remain a ""last resort"", adding that the ""risk to kids"" was ""very, very small"". Secondary schools in England are currently closed until 18 January, except for pupils in their final GCSE and A-level years, who are due to return on 11 January. Asked whether they could remain closed, Mr Johnson said: ""We are keeping things under review."" But former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged the government to close all schools and UK borders ""right away"", while banning ""all household mixing"". The Conservative MP, who now chairs the Commons Health Committee, said these restrictions should be ""time-limited"" to ""12 weeks or so"", after which the roll-out of vaccines would provide ""light at the end of the tunnel"". More than 500,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine are now available for use, with the Pfizer BioNTech jab having been issued since early last month. The virus is winning at the moment, despite science fighting back with a vaccine. New daily cases of Covid have been rising to record levels, which means hospital numbers and deaths will increase too. Ministers say more measures are coming, but it is not clear yet what that will mean in practice. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are already in lockdown, and most of England is under tier four rules. In recent days the focus has shifted to schools and whether they can be kept open without making the epidemic worse. Experts agree that the risk the virus poses to children is still low, but they can spread the disease. With a new, more transmissible variant of Covid circulating, the government may have to enact this unpalatable ""last resort"" of closing classrooms. Some 78% of the population of England is now in tier four, under which non-essential shops are closed and people can only leave their homes for a certain number of reasons. The Scottish governmentmeets laterto consider ""further action"", with all of mainland Scotland currently under its ownlevel fourrestrictions - only some islands are under less stringent tier three measures. Wales entered a nationwide lockdown on 20 December, while Northern Ireland is in the second week of asix-week lockdownthat began on Boxing Day. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters In another development, an academic has said there is a ""big question mark"" over whether a vaccine developed at Oxford University will be as effective against anew variant of the virusthat has emerged in South Africa. Prof Sir John Bell, Regius professor of medicine at the university, said the team there were currently investigating this question ""right now"". He added it was ""unlikely"" the variant would ""turn off the effect of vaccines entirely"", and in any case it would be possible to tweak the vaccine in around four to six weeks. But Matt Hancock told Today he was ""incredibly worried"" about the South African variant, saying: ""This is a very, very significant problem."" ""We have shown that we are prepared to move incredibly quickly, within 24 hours if we think that is necessary, and we keep these things under review all the time,"" added the health secretary.

"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announces stay at home rules in new lockdown Scots are to be ordered to stay at home amid a fresh Covid-19 lockdown which will see schools remain closed to pupils until February. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said new curbs would be introduced at midnight in a bid to contain the new, faster-spreading strain of the virus. New laws will require people to stay at home and work from home where possible. Outdoor gatherings are also to be cut back, with people only allowed to meet one person from one other household. Places of worship are to be closed, group exercise banned, and schools will largely operate via online and remote learning. These rules will apply across the Scottish mainland until at least the end of January, and will be kept under review. Island areas will remain in level three - but Ms Sturgeon said they would be monitored carefully. Live: Latest on Covid-19 in Scotland What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Prime Minister Boris Johnson later announcedsimilar lockdown measures for the whole of Englandwith all schools and colleges closing to most pupils until mid February. A further 1,905 new cases were reported in Scotland on Monday - with 15% of tests returning a positive result, something Ms Sturgeon said ""illustrates the severity and urgency of the situation"". The first minister said she was ""more concerned about the situation we face now than I have been at any time since March last year"", with the new coronavirus strain now accounting for half of new cases. And she said a ""steeply rising trend of infections"" was threatening to put ""significant pressure"" on NHS services, saying hospitals could breach capacity within three to four weeks. The new rules - which will be put down in law - mean Scots will only be allowed to leave home for essential purposes, such as shopping for food and medicine, exercise and caring responsibilities. No limit is to be put on how many times people can go out to exercise, but outdoor meetings are to be limited to a maximum of two people from two households. Everyone who can work from home will be required to, and people in the ""shielding"" category are advised not to go in to work at all. The construction and manufacturing industries will remain open, but Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review. Places of worship are to close, the number of people who can attend weddings is to be cut to five, and funeral wakes will no longer be allowed. Schools are to remain closed to the majority of pupils until February, with Ms Sturgeon saying community transmission of the virus must be brought to a lower level amid concerns that the new variant of the virus spreads more easily among young people. She said she knew remote learning presented ""significant challenges"" for parents, teachers and pupils, adding: ""I want to be clear that it remains our priority to get school buildings open again for all pupils are quickly as possible and then keep them open."" The first minister said she was considering whether teachers could be given the Covid-19 vaccine as a priority. More than 100,000 people have been given a first dose of the vaccine in Scotland, and the government expects to have access to just over 900,000 doses by the end of January. However Ms Sturgeon said the best way to get schools open again was to drive down transmission of the virus - urging Scots to abide by the rules. These are the toughest restrictions Scotland has faced since the lockdown of March 2020. It is - once again - becoming compulsory to stay at home except for essential purposes like food shopping, exercise and medical care. The extended closure of schools to most pupils is something the Scottish government was particularly keen to avoid. These decisions are a measure of how worried ministers are about the rapid spread of the new variant of coronavirus, which is fast becoming the dominant strain. With 225 cases per 100,000 people, Scotland is thought to be about four weeks behind London, which already has four times as many cases and NHS services under considerable pressure. The Scottish government believes that without further action the NHS here would run out of beds for Covid patients within a month. This new alert comes at the start of a new year which also brings new hope for a route out of the pandemic with two vaccines now beginning to offer protection. Around 100,000 doses have already been administered in Scotland but it is likely to take several months to reach all in the most vulnerable groups. The first minister said Scotland was now in ""a race between the vaccine and the virus"". She said: ""The Scottish government will do everything we can to speed up distribution of the vaccine. But all of us must do everything we can to slow down the spread of the virus. ""We can already see - by looking at infection rates in the south of England - some of what could happen here in Scotland. To prevent that, we need to act immediately and firmly. ""For government, that means introducing tough measures - as we have done today. And for all of us, it means sticking to the rules."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson raised concerns about online learning, saying it was vital that pupils had ""equal access to high-quality education"". And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said teachers and working parents would need support to make the remote learning system work. Ms Sturgeon said her government had ""agonised"" over the decision on schools, and said the ""fundamental priority"" was to re-open them in full as soon as possible. She said: ""Just as the last places we ever want to close are schools and nurseries - so it is the case that schools and nurseries will be the first places we want to reopen as we re-emerge from this latest lockdown."" The NHS has coped so far in Scotland - more so than many other parts of the UK. But in places like Glasgow and Lanarkshire it has been very, very tight. And here like everywhere else staff are bracing themselves for the post-Christmas effects of rising cases. The first minister gave some stark figures on hospital and ICU occupancy - suggesting we are just weeks away from reaching limits. There is so little give in the system they will be glad to see everything possible done to prevent stretched services being overwhelmed at a time when we are on our way to getting out the other side. There is real anxiety about what the next few weeks might bring. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"The Queen said she wished Woman's Hour ""continued success"" in the programme's ""important work"" The Queen has sent her ""best wishes"" to Woman's Hour to mark the BBC Radio 4 show's 75th year. The 94-year-old noted that the show had ""played a significant part in the evolving role of women"". ""As you celebrate your 75th year, it is with great pleasure that I send my best wishes to the listeners and all those associated with Woman's Hour,"" she said in a letter sent to the programme. Emma Barnett read out the message on her first day as the show's presenter. ""During this time, you have witnessed and played a significant part in the evolving role of women across society, both here and around the world,"" the Queen added in her message.

Spice Girl Melanie C also performed a rendition of The Beatles track Here Comes the Sun, after presenter Barnett had declared that 2021 ""has to be better"" than the previous year. Later, guest Imelda Staunton, who will play Her Majesty in the upcoming series five of Netflix's royal drama, The Crown, described her as being like ""the original Spice Girl"". ""The Queen, you think, might be an original Spice Girl because girl power is what she is,"" said the actress, who is due to take over the role from Olivia Colman. ""She became the head of state and all that sort of thing. ""It's the continuity of The Queen that has been so important... Whether you're a royalist or not, this person has got up and gone to work every day for 60 years, and I sort of admire that.""

"The Queen said she wished Woman's Hour ""continued success"" in the programme's ""important work"" The Queen has sent her ""best wishes"" to Woman's Hour to mark the BBC Radio 4 show's 75th year. The 94-year-old noted that the show had ""played a significant part in the evolving role of women"". ""As you celebrate your 75th year, it is with great pleasure that I send my best wishes to the listeners and all those associated with Woman's Hour,"" she said in a letter sent to the programme. Emma Barnett read out the message on her first day as the show's presenter. ""During this time, you have witnessed and played a significant part in the evolving role of women across society, both here and around the world,"" the Queen added in her message. This video can not be played Presenter Emma Barnett reads a message from Her Majesty to Woman's Hour listeners. ""In this notable anniversary year, I wish you continued success in your important work as a friend, guide and advocate to women everywhere."" Spice Girl Melanie C also performed a rendition of The Beatles track Here Comes the Sun, after presenter Barnett had declared that 2021 ""has to be better"" than the previous year. Later, guest Imelda Staunton, who will play Her Majesty in the upcoming series five of Netflix's royal drama, The Crown, described her as being like ""the original Spice Girl"". ""The Queen, you think, might be an original Spice Girl because girl power is what she is,"" said the actress, who is due to take over the role from Olivia Colman. ""She became the head of state and all that sort of thing. ""It's the continuity of The Queen that has been so important... Whether you're a royalist or not, this person has got up and gone to work every day for 60 years, and I sort of admire that."" Last month, the Queen used her Christmas Day message to reassure anyone struggling without friends and family this year that they ""are not alone"". This video can not be played Queenâs Christmas Speech 2020: âYou are not aloneâ The message helped to mark a memorable opening day in the hot seat for Barnett, which also saw her discuss Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian under house arrest in Tehran, with her husband Richard and the MP and former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt. Barnett - known for hosting Newsnight and shows on 5 Live - has replaced Jane Garvey,who presented her final edition of Woman's Hourafter 13 years last week, saying the programme ""needs to move on, and now it can"". Garvey's exit came three months after her co-host Dame Jenni Murray also left the long-running show after 33 years. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"NÃ³ra Quoirin was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder that affects brain development A girl whose body was found in a jungle during a holiday in Malaysia died by misadventure, a coroner has recorded. NÃ³ra Quoirin, 15, from Balham, south-west London, was discovered dead nine days after she went missing from an eco-resort in August 2019. The family said they were ""utterly disappointed"" with the verdict, which ruled out any criminal involvement. They believe ""layers of evidence"" that were heard at the inquest point towards Nora having been abducted. The family were staying in Sora House in Dusun eco-resort near Seremban, about 40 miles (65km) south of Kuala Lumpur, when they reported NÃ³ra missing, the day after they had arrived. NÃ³ra, who was born with holoprosencephaly - a disorder which affects brain development - was eventually found by a group of civilian volunteers in a palm-oil plantation less than two miles from the holiday home. The girl who vanished into a Malaysian jungle The Quoirins, whose lawyers had asked the coroner to record an open verdict, said in a statement after the ruling that they have a number of reasons for the abduction theory. These include: Professionally trained canines were unable to follow NÃ³ra's scent. There was an opened window to the chalet with unidentified fingerprints found on the outside. NÃ³ra had ""neither the cognitive, nor physical means"" to leave the chalet by the window on her own. Hundreds of people relentlessly searched the surrounding area, including where NÃ³ra was found, on the day of or immediately preceding the day of her death. They found no signs of human life. There was a ""lack of major physical damage"" to NÃ³ra's body despite her ""inability to handle terrain as complex as the Seremban jungle"". Search and rescue teams were deployed in an effort to locate Nora In the statement, issued through theLucie Blackman Trust,external, the family said they witnessed 80 slides presented in court as the verdict was given, adding that none of them ""engaged with who NÃ³ra really was - neither her personality nor her intellectual abilities"". They said: ""The coroner made mention several times of her inability to rule on certain points due to not knowing NÃ³ra enough. ""It is indeed our view that to know NÃ³ra would be to know that she was simply incapable of hiding in undergrowth, climbing out a window and making her way out of a fenced resort in the darkness unclothed."" Group 'waited hours' after schoolgirl's body find 'Voice heard' at vanished girl's holiday home Vanished girl's body 'showed no signs of assault' Male DNA 'found near dead schoolgirl' The statement added: ""We believe we have fought not just for NÃ³ra but in honour of all the special needs children in this world who deserve our most committed support and the most careful application of justice. ""This is NÃ³ra's unique legacy and we will never let it go."" Fom the outsetMeabh Quoirin believed her daughter had been abductedbut Malaysian police insisted NÃ³ra's disappearance had always been a missing persons case and ruled out any criminal involvement. The authorities closed the case in January 2020, and NÃ³ra's parents pushed for the inquest. This video can not be played Police played the sound of NÃ³ra's mother's voice through a loudspeaker in the jungle During the inquest, a British pathologist who carried out a second post-mortem examination saidNÃ³ra's body had no injuriesto suggest she was attacked or restrained. On the final day of evidence, an investigating officer who was on duty the morning NÃ³ra was reported missing said he wasconfident there were no criminal elements involvedin her disappearance. Following the coroner's verdict, the Quoirins' legal team have discussed the family's rights moving forward, which include the possibility of applying for a revision of the misadventure verdict at the High Court of Seremban. Louise Azmi, one lawyer for the family, said they had pressed for an open verdict to reflect the lack of positive evidence in the case regarding what happened to Nora. An open verdict would leave open the possibility that a criminal element was involved in Nora's death, Mrs Azmi said. She told the BBC based on everything the family know of Nora, ""they continue to believe it is impossible she would have willingly walked away into the jungle"". The family's legal team say parents Meabh and Sebastien Quoirin are ""disappointed"" with today's verdict. But, Coroner Maimoonah Aid said her verdict was made not on ""theories"" and ""speculation"" surrounding the case, but on the balance of probabilities of the evidence presented before her. With no evidence to the contrary she ruled out foul play. Moving forward, the Quoirin family now have the possibility to apply for a revision of the verdict with the High Court of Seremban. There is precedent of a verdict being overturned in Malaysia before. In 2019, following an appeal, a Malaysian coroner's verdict of misadventure concerning the death of 18-year-old model Ivana Smit was overturned in Kuala Lumpur and reopened as a murder investigation. According to Quoirin family lawyer Sakthy Vell, the family say they now need time to consider their next course of action.

"Iran says it suspended its nuclear commitments in response to reinstated US sanctions Iran has resumed enriching uranium to 20% purity, in its most significant breach yet of its 2015 deal with world powers to end nuclear sanctions. The global nuclear watchdog confirmed the process had begun at the underground Fordo plant on Monday. Enriched uranium can be used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear bombs. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% purity. A US state department spokesperson accused Iran of pursuing a ""campaign of nuclear extortion"". This video can not be played What is the Iran nuclear deal? Iran, which insists that its nuclear programme is peaceful, has rolled back a number of commitments under the deal. It has said it is retaliating for the US economic sanctions that were reinstated in 2018 by President Donald Trump when he abandoned the accord, also known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). In a separate development, Iran's Revolutionary Guards said they had seized a South Korean-flagged chemical tanker in the Gulf ""due to the repeated infringement of maritime environmental laws"". South Korea's foreign ministry demanded its immediate release of the Hankuk Chemi and said a South Korean anti-piracy unit stationed in the Strait of Hormuz had been dispatched to the area. Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told mediathe process of enriching uranium to 20% had started at Fordo,external. President Hassan Rouhani had ordered the move because he was ""bound"" by a new law requiring the production and storage of at least 120kg (265lbs) of 20%-enriched uranium annually for peaceful purposes, he said. Iran's parliament passed the law following the assassination in late November of the country's top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, which Iranian leaders blamed on Israel. Later on Monday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed Iran's move in a report to member states. ""Iran today began feeding uranium already enriched up to 4.1% U-235 into six centrifuge cascades at the Fordo Fuel Enrichment Plant for further enrichment up to 20%,"" a statement said. Some experts see the announcement as an attempt to put pressure on Joe Biden, who is due to succeed Mr Trump as president on 20 January. Mr Biden has said he will consider rejoining the nuclear deal so long as Iran returns to full compliance and commits to further negotiations. The state department spokesperson said: ""Iran enriching uranium to 20% at Fordow is a clear attempt to increase its campaign of nuclear extortion, an attempt that will continue to fail."" EU spokesman Peter Stano said Iran's move constituted ""a considerable departure from Iran's nuclear commitments under the JCPOA with serious nuclear non-proliferation implications"". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, one of Iran's main opponents in the Middle East,said,externalthe Iranian decision could not be ""explained in any way except as continued realisation of its intention to develop a military nuclear programme"". ""Israel will not allow Iran to manufacture nuclear weapons,"" he added. Why was a top Iranian scientist assassinated? Iran's enriched uranium stockpile '12 times limit' Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? Iran's parliament passed a law requiring 20% enrichment after the killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh Enriched uranium is produced by feeding uranium hexafluoride gas into centrifuges to separate out the most suitable isotope for nuclear fission, called U-235. Low-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% purity of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Highly enriched uranium has a concentration of 20% or more and is used in research reactors. Under the nuclear deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium only up to a 3.67% purity; to stockpile no more than 300kg (660lbs) of the material; to operate no more than 5,060 of its oldest and least efficient centrifuges; and was required to cease enrichment at Fordo altogether. But Iran has taken steps to ""reduce"" those commitments since Mr Trump reinstated US sanctions to compel it to negotiate a replacement of an agreement he said was ""defective at its core"". The steps have included building up the stockpile of low-enriched uranium, producing 4.5%-enriched uranium, restarting advanced centrifuges, and resuming enrichment activities at Fordo. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif stressed on Monday that the measures were ""fully reversible upon full compliance by all"" parties. Allow Twitter content?

Experts at the Arms Control Association said last month that120kg of uranium enriched to 20% was about half the amount of uranium that, when enriched to weapons-grade (90% or more), was necessary for one bomb,external. They also warned that the production of highly enriched uranium would pose a more serious near-term proliferation risk. That is because going from uranium's natural state of 0.7% concentration of U-235 to 20% takes about 90% of the total effort required to get to weapons-grade. Before the nuclear deal, Iran had a sufficient amount of 20%-enriched uranium and number of centrifuges that its ""break-out time"" was estimated to be about two to three months. The agreement slowed the ""break-out time"" to at least a year. Why was a top Iranian scientist assassinated?

"The number of babies born in 2020 has fallen drastically South Korea recorded more deaths than births in 2020 for the first time ever, raising fresh alarm in the country which already has the world's lowest birth rate. Only 275,800 babies were born last year, down 10% from 2019. Around 307,764 people died. The figures prompted the interior ministry to call for ""fundamental changes"" to its policies. A declining population puts immense strain on a country. Apart from increased pressure on public spending as demand for healthcare systems and pensions rise, a declining youth population also leads to labour shortages that have a direct impact on the economy. An aging population puts massive pressure on a country Last month, President Moon Jae-in launched several policies aimed at addressing the low birth rate, including cash incentives for families. Under the scheme, from 2022, every child born will receive a cash bonus of 2 million won ($1,850; Â£1,350) to help cover prenatal expenses, on top of a monthly payout of 300,000 won handed out until the baby turns one. The incentive will increase to 500,000 won every month from 2025. Julie Yoon, BBC Korean South Korea's employment policies are not conducive to women who want to have children Largely, it's because in South Korea, women struggle to achieve a balance between work and other life demands. Hyun-yu Kim is one of them. The oldest of four, she dreamed of having a big family of her own. But faced with conditions that are not family friendly in South Korea, she is reconsidering her plans to have children.

"US casino giant MGM Resorts has made an $11bn (Â£8.1bn) offer for British gaming company Entain, which owns Ladbrokes. The move is the latest attempt by a casino operator to move into the online gambling business. In addition to its chain of High Street betting shops, UK-based Entain also owns a number of online sports betting and gambling sites. Entain confirmed the offer, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, but said the price was too low. It had recently rebuffed an earlier $10bn (Â£7.3bn) all-cash approach from MGM, the newspaper said. In a statement,external, Entain said the latest bid approach ""significantly undervalues the company and its prospects"". MGM Resorts, which runs the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas, now has until the beginning of next month to decide whether to make a formal bid or to walk away. FTSE 100-listed Entain. which renamed itself from GVC Holdings last month, describes itself as ""one of the world's largest sports betting and gaming groups operating in the online and retail sector"". Along with Ladbrokes, it also owns brands such as Bwin, Partypoker, Coral, Eurobet, Gala and Foxy Bingo. Government to review sports betting laws Caesars owner strikes Â£2.9bn William Hill deal World's biggest gambling hub reopens for business After news of the latest offer for the firm, investors started betting on Entain, pushing its share price up by more than 25% to Â£14.30 a share - above MGM's offer of roughly Â£13.83 a share - a sign that market watchers are expecting a higher bid. If the two firms do reach an agreement, it would follow another deal in September when MGM rival Caesars Entertainment agreed to buy UK-based William Hill for $3.7bn (Â£2.9bn). ""Following Caesar's offer for William Hill last year, a bid by MGM for Ladbroke's owner Entain isn't exactly a surprise,"" said Nicholas Hyett an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The two are working together to take advantage of the recent legalisation of sports betting in the US, a market worth many billions of dollars a year."" Predictions about the stockmarket have a habit of making the person trying to guess the future look foolish. No such problem for Laura Foll, a fund manager at the investment firm Janus Henderson. On the Today programme on Monday, she forecast more takeover offers for household names in Britain, noting that the UK markets remained unloved by investors and so - perhaps - undervalued. An hour after the prediction a big offer duly landed, with Entain, the London-listed company that owns Ladbrokes and other gambling brands, saying it had received a takeover proposal from MGM Resorts, an American rival. The US company is offering to pay shareholders in Entain not in cash, but in new MGM shares - an obvious move given the sky-high rating of US shares compared to those listed in London. It looks a carbon copy of last year's deal where Caesars, best known for its Las Vegas properties, bought another venerable name in British bookmaking, William Hill. Get ready for more acquisitive foreign companies looking for deals in bargain basement London. The new bid for Entain comes with financial backing from MGM's largest shareholder, InterActiveCorp (IAC), which took a 12% stake in MGM Resorts last August. At the time, IAC's chief executive Barry Diller said it planned to work with MGM to expand its online gambling portfolio. The attempted acquisition comes as the casino industry faces headwinds from the Covid-19 pandemic. Bricks-and-mortar casino operators have struggled under travel restrictions. The economy of Asian casino hub Macau shrank 49% in the first quarter of this year, while unemployment in Las Vegas reached 30% earlier in the year and remains well above the US average. MGM Resorts, which is the operator of the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas, laid off 18,000 furloughed employees in the US in August. Many online gambling companies, by contrast, saw a boost during Covid-19 restrictions, prompting many casino owners to pivot their businesses towards online.

"Pupils going back to school for a new term in Cheshire Thousands of pupils have not started primary school as expected - with local closures in several parts of England. Head teachers warned of a ""confusing picture"" with some schools staying shut after teachers' union safety warnings about the risk of Covid infections. A joint letter from education unions called for a ""pause"" in reopening schools, accusing the government of ""creating chaos"". The Department for Education said closing should only be a ""last resort"". Adding to the uncertainty, some local authorities have argued against reopening and some individual primary schools have remained closed for most pupils - in addition to those schools already required to stay shut because of high coronavirus levels. There are so far no official national figures for how many schools have not have fully opened, apart from for vulnerable and key workers' children - but local reports include: more than 130 schools in Norfolk, many citing staff shortages more than 40 in Durham 21 in North Tyneside 26 in Newcastle 10 in Reading nine in Northumberland five in Oldham Health Secretary Matt Hancock said school was the ""right place"" for children, wherever possible. ""When it comes to schools, we've taken the decision not to reopen schools in some of the most affected areas. ""But these are difficult balances - and people will have very mixed emotions,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. If schools are closed, Labour shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds has called for support for parents unable to work because of childcare problems. PM urges parents to send children to school Parents react to primaries in England reopening All London primary schools to stay closed Head teacher warns of stress of Covid on staff Council leaders question return to school Vicky Smith from Hertfordshire faces an anxious personal dilemma about sending her daughter back to primary school - as she is worried about the risk of infection to her seriously ill father, who also lives with them. ""I want to send my kids to school because all her friends are there, but what if she brings it home?,"" she says. ""Chances are if she gives it to her granddad, she might not have a granddad. It's not so much we think our children are in danger - it's the people they are going to bring it down to."" Vicky also says even in Tier 4 the current restrictions do not seem to be particularly strict. ""You can still go to work and go to school, it doesn't feel safe. ""My dad is quite happy for her to go to school, but how is she going to feel if she gives it to her granddad. I don't know what to do. ""I don't want to get a big fine and I don't want to stop her learning. But I also feelâ¦ I just don't know what to do."" Secondary schools are staying closed this week except for vulnerable and key workers' children - and in local authorities with high levels of coronavirus, including across London, primary schools are also not open to most pupils. But reopening primary schools in other areas, including for some in Tier 4, has been challenged, with the biggest teachers' union, the National Education Union, calling for teaching to be moved online for the first two weeks of term. The NEU has advised teachers they can say they are not going to teach classes in school because of concerns over safety. A joint letter from education unions, including teachers and support staff, says bringing pupils back to school ""risks increasing the infection rate"" and means exposing school staff to ""serious risk of ill-health"". The letter, co-ordinated by the TUC, calls for priority access to Covid vaccines for school staff and to move lessons online ""while Covid-secure working arrangements are reviewed"". Any school closures should be kept to an ""absolute minimum"", said Amanda Spielman, head of the Ofsted education watchdog, because ""children's lives can't just be put on hold while we wait for vaccination programmes"". But the wife of a primary school teacher in Harrow who caught Covid towards the end of last term, and was hospitalised over Christmas, said protecting staff had to be a priority. ""Teachers are passionate and loyal but somebody needs to fight for them,"" she told the BBC. Mungo Sheppard, head teacher of Ash Green primary school in Calderdale, says his school opened as planned on Monday - without staff staying away, but with higher than usual numbers of missing pupils. Of the school's 500 pupils, Mr Sheppard says 75 are off, mostly with ""Covid-related"" issues, compared with 15 absent at the end of last term. ""We also have, for the first time since September, children whose parents have taken the decision to keep them at home due to anxieties linked to the new variant and rising rates,"" he said. But the head teacher says their efforts have been hampered by last-minute decisions at a national level. ""It has been incredibly difficult to make these decisions and communicate them in a tiny timeframe and within a holiday,"" says Mr Sheppard. Unions have warned of safety risks to teachers as coronavirus cases rise across the country Some local authorities have backed schools deciding not to open - and others have questioned the decision to keep schools open in some areas, when other nearby schools have been told to shut. Kent County Council called for a delay in reopening primary schools in four parts of the county. But a message on Twitter from the Conservative MP for Folkestone and Hythe, Damian Collins, suggested further changes were on the way. After a meeting with School Standards Minister Nick Gibb, Mr Collins said the ""decision about which schools will be required to stay open will be reviewed in the next few days by the Department for Education"". Julian Rose, head of West Chiltington School in West Sussex, has an inset day on Monday and is expecting to open on Tuesday. He says ""some very anxious"" parents have been in touch about children going back when the area is in Tier 4. ""I think many feel astonished that we are still open when operating under Tier 4,"" says Mr Rose. And he says the school will ""not have a full complement of staff in attendance"". A Department for Education spokesman said: ""Children's education has consistently been a national priority, which is why we want classrooms to reopen wherever possible in the new term. ""Schools will continue to implement appropriate safety measures to help mitigate the risk of transmission."" GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there?

"This video can not be played Olly Stephens was pronounced dead in Bugs Bottom fields in Emmer Green, Reading Four boys and a girl have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder after a 13-year-old boy was stabbed to death in Reading. Oliver Stephens, known as Olly, was pronounced dead at Bugs Bottom fields, Emmer Green, on Sunday. The five teenagers, all aged 13 or 14, remain in custody, according to Thames Valley Police. Det Supt Kevin Brown said: ""Our thoughts remain with Olly's family at this incredibly difficult time."" He added: ""This is a tragic and shocking incident which has resulted in the death of a young boy."" The victim's family are being supported by specially trained officers. Floral tributes to Olly have been left outside Highdown School Highdown School and Sixth Form Centre said it was ""reeling from the tragic news"". In a statement, head teacher Rachel Cave said: ""This student was part of our community and many students and staff knew him well. ""For a life to be ended at such a young age is a total tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family."" The school, in Emmer Green, said it was arranging counselling support for students and setting up an electronic book of condolence. Thames Valley Police said a ""considerable police presence"" would be in place in the area for several days Officers were called just before 16:00 GMT on Sunday following reports of an attack. Officers are appealing for anyone who was in the area between 15:00 and 16:30 who might have taken photos or camera footage to contact them if they notice anything suspicious. Det Supt Brown said he believed there would have been witnesses to the ""dreadful incident"" as the area is popular with dog walkers. A man said his wife was walking their dog through the park on Sunday afternoon when she saw a boy on the ground with several people around him trying to give him first aid. Another dog walker said she saw a group of young people standing in the woods in Bugs Bottom fields at about 15:30 and described it as ""slightly unusual"". Reading East MP Matt Rodda has offered his ""deepest condolences"" to the boy's family. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played 82-year-old Brian Pinker is given the Oxford vaccine at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford Dialysis patient Brian Pinker, 82, has become the first person to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. The retired maintenance manager got the jab at 7:30 GMT from nurse Sam Foster at Oxford's Churchill Hospital. More than half a million doses of the vaccine are ready for use on Monday. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was a ""pivotal moment"" in the UK's fight against the virus, as vaccines will help curb infections and then allow restrictions to be lifted. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Mondaythere was ""no question we will have to take tougher measures"", which will be announced in ""due course"", as the UK struggles to control a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus. On Sunday more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases were recorded in the UK for the sixth day running, prompting Labour to call for a third national lockdown in England. Northern IrelandandWalescurrently have their own lockdowns in place and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a fresh lockdown will beginin Scotlandfrom 00:01 on Tuesday. The rollout comes asrows continue over whether pupils should return to schoolwith the current high levels of Covid infections. PM expects 'tens of millions' of jabs by April When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What could 'tougher' coronavirus measures mean? PM: 'No question' tougher Covid measures will happen Six hospital trusts - in Oxford, London, Sussex, Lancashire and Warwickshire - have begun administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, with 530,000 doses ready for use. Most other available doses will be sent to hundreds of GP-led services and care homes across the UK later in the week, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Mr Pinker, who has been having dialysis for kidney disease at the Churchill Hospital for a number of years, said he was ""really proud"" the vaccine was developed in Oxford. ""The nurses, doctors and staff today have all been brilliant and I can now really look forward to celebrating my 48th wedding anniversary with my wife Shirley later this year,"" he said. Father-of-three Trevor Cowlett, 88, also received the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine Music teacher and father-of-three Trevor Cowlett, 88, and Prof Andrew Pollard, a paediatrician working at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and lead investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, were also among the first to be vaccinated. Chief nurse Ms Foster, who administered the first dose, told the BBC it was a ""huge privilege"", saying: ""Every single patient that we have vaccinated over the last couple of weeks have got their own personal stories to the difference it's going to make, so it is no different this morning."" Speaking during a visit to London's Chase Farm Hospital, to meet some of the first people to receive the Oxford vaccine, the prime minister said there were ""tough, tough"" weeks to come. There will now be a ""massive ramp-up"" in vaccination numbers ""in the weeks ahead"", Mr Johnson said, and the number of vaccine doses will amount to ""tens of millions by the end of March"". Asked when the government will be able to vaccinate two million people a week, Mr Johnson said the government will give more details ""in the next few days... as soon as we have better numbers to give"". Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the Oxford vaccine rollout was a ""pivotal moment"" in the fight against coronavirus, saying: ""It's going to be a tough few weeks ahead, but this is the way out."" Asked about reports potential volunteerswere being deterred by the additional training and forms, Mr Hancock said they were going to ""reduce the amount of bureaucracy"". ""For instance there's one of the training programmes about how to tackle terrorism, I don't think that's necessary, we're going to stop that,"" he said. However, he said this was not delaying the delivery of the vaccine, adding that the next delivery of the vaccine will be ""early this week"" to be ""deployed next week"". England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the vaccines ""give us a route out in the medium term"" but warned the NHS was ""under considerable and rising pressure in the short term"". Former health secretary and Conservative chairman of the Commons' health committee Jeremy Hunttweeted,externalthat it was ""time to act"" and the government needed to close schools and borders, ban all household mixing and impose a 12-week national lockdown in England.

Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth agreed that a national lockdown was needed, as well as ""rapidly scaled-up vaccine distribution"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'This way can save more lives' As the recent rise in Covid cases puts increased pressure on the NHS, the UK has accelerated its vaccination rollout by planning to give both doses of the vaccine 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between jabs. The UK's chief medical officers have defended the delay to second doses, saying getting more people vaccinated with the first jab ""is much more preferable"". Make no mistake, the UK is in a race against time. That much is clear from the decision to delay the second dose of the vaccine to focus on giving as many people as possible their first doses. So how fast can the NHS go? Ultimately it wants to get to two million doses a week. That will not be achieved this week. But Monday marks the start of the NHS putting the accelerator to the floor. A rapid increase in the vaccination rate should follow. But how quickly the UK can go is dependent on several complex processes. First, the vaccine has to be manufactured, then it has to be put into vials and packaged up (known as fill and finish). After that each batch has to be checked and certified before being sent to NHS vaccination sites where there needs to be enough vaccinators and support staff to ensure those doses are given as quickly as possible. Problems at any one stage can disrupt how quickly the vaccination programme can be rolled out. While there are millions of doses of each vaccine in the country and a total of 140 million of both vaccines pre-ordered, there are currently just over one million - around 500,000 of each - ready to be given this week. NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: ""The NHS' biggest vaccination programme in history is off to a strong start, thanks to the tremendous efforts of NHS staff who have already delivered more than one million jabs."" He said the Oxford vaccine rollout was ""chalking up another world first that will protect thousands more over the coming weeks"". The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first jab approved in the UK, and more than a million people have had their first one. The first person to get the jabon 8 December, Margaret Keenan, has already had her second dose. This video can not be played Dr Nikita Kanani, NHS England's medical director for primary care, says it's crucial to get more patients the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine The Oxford jab -which was approved for use in late December- can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, making it easier to distribute and store than the Pfizer jab. It is also cheaper per dose. The UK has secured 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for most of the population. Care home residents and staff, people aged over 80, and frontline NHS staff will be first to receive it. GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GPs and local vaccination services have been asked to ensure every care home resident in their local area is vaccinated by the end of January, the Department of Health and Social Care said.

"PM Boris Johnson announces new lockdown for England in a televised address People in England are told to work from home after a sharp rise in coronavirus cases All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesday with remote learning until February half term End-of-year exams will not take place this summer as normal PM suggests England could ""steadily"" move out of lockdown from mid-February People in Scotland will also be legally required to stay at home - except for essential purposes - from midnight tonight Most schools in Scotland will remain closed until 1 February ""Material risk"" of NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days say chief medical officers The newly-approved coronavirus vaccine created by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is being rolled out across the UK today Globally more than 85 million cases of Covid have been reported and 1.84 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Vanessa Barford and Sarah Fowler Thanks for joining us. Updates were brought to you today by Claire Heald, Vanessa Barford, James Clarke, Doug Faulkner, Becky Morton, Mary
OâConnor, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Jen Meierhans, George Wright, Katie Wright, Victoria Bisset and Sarah Fowler. We're about to close the live page now, but before we go, here's a quick re-cap of the key points from Boris Johnson's speech:  Business leaders are reacting with concern to the fresh lockdown announced by Boris Johnson amid fears that companies may not last until the spring. British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall says: ""Businesses will understand why the prime minister has felt compelled to act on the spiralling threat to public health, but they will be baffled and disappointed by the fact that he did not announce additional support for affected businesses alongside these new restrictions. Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of London First, says: ""The Government must now extend business rates and VAT relief throughout 2021 and stand ready to pump further direct support to businesses forced to close.""  Now for some more reaction to the news that schools will be moving to remote learning for most pupils under England's new lockdown measures. Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union: âNo one wanted schools and colleges to be shut again but the evidence clearly pointed to the necessity for this to happen weeks ago. ""Why Boris Johnson allowed such confusion and chaos to build up around school openings before making this belated, blindingly obvious decision is beyond belief. ""Government must take responsibility for this closure because it has allowed Covid-19 to become, again, out of control.â Reality Check Boris
Johnson said that the UK has vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe
combined. As of 27
December, 944,539 people in the UK had received the first dose of the Covid-19
vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. The latest
data from 22 of the EU's 27 member states, collected by Our World in Data, shows 682,279 vaccinations have
been carried out so far. As each EU
member state publishes its own statistics, some of this data goes up to early
January but some only to late December. Germany is
leading the EU, having vaccinated 265,610 people as of 3 January. France though
had only vaccinated 516 citizens by 1 January and the Netherlands won't begin
vaccinations till 8 January. The UK
started vaccinating citizens with the Pfizer jab on 8 December, while the EU vaccine
rollout began on 27 December. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Egyptian authorities
are denying claims that at least six Covid-19 patients died in two government
hospitals over the past two days due to a lack of oxygen. It follows anger aftera video of nurses in intensive care units struggling to keep patients alive,externalwas
widely shared on social media. At one point, a nurse in
blue PPE can be seen crumpled over on the floor in apparent shock. The voice of
the person filming repeats: âAll those in the intensive care are dead... there is
no oxygen.â In a statement on Facebook,external, Egyptâs health ministry spokesman said there were sufficient oxygen supplies at all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. He said that most of the deaths at two hospitals in the north of the country - Al-Husseiniya and Zefta - were patients already suffering from chronic diseases. The ministry spokesman called on the media not to spread âinaccurate or false information that may cause panic among people"". In Egypt, there have been 142,187 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 7,805 deaths. However, many experts suspect the actual figures are far higher. The government has now publishedfull guidance,externalon what people are allowed to do in England under the new national lockdown. Here's a quick summary of the new rules: Cyprus and Brazil  have become the latest countries to identify the new coronavirus variant, which was first discovered in the UK. In total, more than 30 countries around the world have seen cases involving the new strain, including: Sir Keir Starmer said the most important thing is the messaging about 'stay at home' and going back to the spirit of March ""because a lot is now going to depend on the willingness of people to comply and I urge everyone to comply"". He adds: ""We have to rekindle that spirit and I think that in a way we need to remake that contract with the British people, in return for you enduring these measures now for the coming weeks the vaccine must be rolled out at speed. We need this to be mission critical. We were the first country to get the vaccine and we need to be the first country to have the vaccine programme rolled out."" Reality Check We know that the UK is going to
threat level 5, the highest level, which means there is a danger of the NHS
being overwhelmed within 21 days. When the prime minister announced
these threat levels in May he was clear that during the first lockdown the country
had only been in level four. At the time he also said:,externalâThe
higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.â So on that basis should we have expected tighter restrictions in England than we saw during the
first lockdown in March? If anything, the restrictions
appear slightly less severe. For example, support bubbles and childcare bubbles
exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds will be open when they were closed
last time. Communal worship is still
allowed as long as social distancing is observed. One significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops, public transport or places of worship. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The lockdown announcement
contained the clearest indication yet of how quickly the government hopes to
vaccinate the at risk groups. A target of mid February for
vaccinating all the over 70s and those deemed extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care
staff opens up a pathway to a significant easing of restrictions by the start of
March. But it will require a rapid
acceleration in vaccination rates. So far nearly one million
people have been vaccinated. By the end of the week that
number is expected to double. The hope is that later in
January two million doses a week will be given. That will be the minimum needed
â there are around 12 million in those priority groups. By vaccinating them, there is
the potential to prevent close to nine in 10 deaths. But achieving that requires a
lot to go right. There is enough vaccine in
the country to vaccinate that many people, but not all of it has been through
the final âfill and finishâ process which involves packaging it in glass vials
(and there is a shortage of those) and then the batches have to be checked and
signed off by the regulator â a process that is taking weeks at the moment. And all of that is before it
is sent out to the NHS vaccination centres to inject it into peopleâs arms. The Labour leader say it's time for everyone to pull together. Sir Keir Starmer says: ""The situation we are in is obviously very serious, the figures are very stark and these measures are necessary, sadly, and therefore we support the packages of measures that the prime minister has just outlined. ""And I think whatever our criticisms and challenges of the government we've all got to pull together now to make this work over the next few weeks and months. ""It's going to be a very, very difficult period, there are questions about the timing of decisions etc but now is the time to support this package, pull together and try do everything we can to try and make this work."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Itâs a familiar mantra but one that many hoped had been left in
the past.Stay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives.That was the key,
simple message when the first lockdown was introduced back in March. It was
well understood and big news in England when the government decided to modify
it. But now, itâs back. And, as in Tier 4, the Stay at Home message will be
legally enforceable. While saying that the new
variant means there needs to be another lockdown, the prime minister is also
trying to emphasise a hope that didnât exist before, back in March. Specifically, the vaccine. Significantly, heâs outlined an ambition that the
top four priority groups will have received their first dose by mid-February.
However, as weâve learnt so many times, caution can be the watchword when it
comes to coronavirus. But ministers do want to keep emphasising that there is
hope, amidst all the gloom. The prime minister says by the middle of February, ""if things go well"", the government expects to have
offered a first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups. This includes vaccinating all residents in a care home for
older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70 and all frontline health
and social care workers If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups âwe will have removed
huge numbers of people from the path of the virus"", he says. ""That will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have
endured for so long."" Johnson stresses there will remain a time lag of two to
three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity, and there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted. ""So we
should remain cautious about the timetable ahead,"" he adds. ""But if
our understanding of the virus doesnât change dramatically once again, if the
rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful, if
deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect, and,
critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules, then I
hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February
half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers."" The PM says the weeks ahead ""will be the hardest yet"". ""But I really do believe we are entering the last phase of the struggle because with every jab that goes into our arms we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people,"" he says. ""Thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight but we know exactly how we are going to get there."" The PM addresses people across the UK, saying he knows how ""tough this is"" and how ""frustrated"" people are. But he says ""now, more than ever, we must pull together"". Mr Johnson says people should follow the new rules from now, which  will become law in the early hours of Wednesday
morning and parliament will meet remotely later that day. He says the governments of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland
share his ""conviction"" that this is a ""pivotal moment"" and were taking similar steps to contain the spread of the virus. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Once again it
is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. In England
there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid
since Christmas day. To put that
into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled. Currently around
three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease. In some
hospitals it is more than six in 10. But what is
worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to
increase. In the spring
it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak. The last six
days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the
UK â a number of these infections are next weekâs hospital admissions. It is why the
UKâs chief medical officers were warning there was a âmaterial riskâ of some
hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change. The PM repeats the advice of the UK's chief medical officers that the nation's Covid alert level should move to level 5 - ""meaning that if action is not taken, NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days"". He adds though, that there is ""one huge difference"" compared to last time, saying the UK is ""rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in its history"" and had so far ""vaccinated more people than in the rest of Europe combined"". He says the ""pace of vaccination is accelerating"" thanks to the arrival of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which patients began receiving earlier today.  The prime minister says he ""completely understands the inconvenience and distress"" the disruption to education will cause parents and pupils. But he says the government has been doing ""everything in our power to keep schools
openâ because of the importance of education to childrenâs
life chances. ""The problem is not that schools are unsafe for children,"" he says, adding that children are still very unlikely to be severely affected even by the new variant of Covid. But he says schools may act as ""vectors for transmission"", causing the virus to spread between households. The prime minister adds that given the alarming figures, it had become ""clear that we need to do more"" to bring the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant ""under control"" and help the vaccination roll-out in the UK. He says we must therefore go into a national lockdown, with the government once more telling people to stay at home, except for specific reasons, including essential shopping, to work, if you cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical help, and to escape domestic abuse. He says the government will be advising clinical extremely people to begin shielding again. Primary and secondary schools must move to remote learning from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and those of key workers, he adds. Given this, it is not ""fair"" for all exams to go ahead this summer, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ralph Evans receiving the Oxford vaccine in Merthyr Tydfil It has been described as a ""momentous day"" in the fight against Covid-19 as the rollout of the second Covid vaccine begins in Wales. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the start of theOxford-AstraZeneca vaccineprogramme was ""a key milestone"" in the fight against Covid. The Welsh Government said 40,000 doses will be available within the first two weeks - with 22,000 jabs this week. More than 35,000 people in Wales have had aPfizer-BioNTechvaccine dose. The number of mass vaccination centres in Wales will be increased to 22 and more than 60 GP surgeries will offer the Oxford vaccine - mobile units will also be set up throughout Wales. This video can not be played Derek Games says he was ""shocked"" to get a phone call asking him to go to the surgery for the jab. One of the first people to receive the vaccine on Monday was Ralph Evans, 88, who was vaccinated at the Pontcae medical practice in Merthyr Tydfil. He was one of eight people there to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Mr Evans said he was ""very grateful"" to be getting it. He was followed by 86-year-old Derek Games, former mayor of Merthyr, who said: ""I'm delighted, I'm very privileged to have it."" The medical centre hopes to vaccinate 1,000 people by the end of January after being contacted on New Year's Eve about starting vaccinations. ""We received a hundred vaccines at lunchtime today,"" practice manager Kevin Rogers said. ""We hope to get through the hundred this week."" Mr Rogers said they would be asking staff to work additional hours on weekends to help reach the target of 1,000 people over the coming weeks. This video can not be played Cases have fallen below England's but the new variant is spreading fast, Wales' health minister says Q&A: When will I get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Medics complain of 'bureaucracy' in vaccine effort Army to be deployed in Wales for vaccine rollout The Welsh Government's priority is to vaccinate front-line health and social care staff, care home residents and staff, and people over 80. Plaid Cymru said ""serious questions"" remained about the roll-out plans, while a professor in palliative medicine said she was concerned ""at the very slow apparent roll out"" for those aged over 85. Mari Lloyd Williams, from the University of Liverpool, said ""huge numbers have self-shielded since March"". ""Apart from intense loneliness this leads to loss of confidence and reduction in both physical and mental and cognitive well-being, meaning that some may need to enter full time care sooner,"" she said. ""We need to be vaccinating 24/7 in order to get this under control and to protect our most vulnerable."" The Pfizer vaccine has to be kept at -70C, but the Oxford jab can be stored at standard fridge temperatures so can be administered in doctors surgeries, pharmacies and care homes. Dialysis patient Brian Pinker, 82, wasthe first person to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19vaccine in Oxford. ""It is an absolutely momentous day,"" said Dr Gillian Richardson, who is leading the Covid vaccination programme in Wales. ""The vaccine has been prioritised for those groups where it has been harder to reach with the Pfizer vaccine - so we're prioritising the over 80s and care home staff and residents."" Ms Richardson said the pace of the rollout ""will be governed by supply"" and ""will start slowly this week but build vastly over the coming weeks and months."" Both vaccines require two doses to be administered with an interval of between four and 12 weeks - achange from the previous advice of four weeksbetween jabs. The change has been ""very controversial"", according to one GP who will administer the Oxford vaccine, but she agrees with the decision. ""The evidence suggests that a longer time period between first dose and second booster gives you better immunity,"" said Dr Rowena Christmas, a Monmouthshire GP whose surgery is part of the rollout pilot. ""The key thing is we need to protect people. If we gave 1,000 second doses of the Pfizer vaccine next week then that's 1,000 people who won't get the first protection. Wales' health minister said Covid case rates were falling during the country's lockdown ""As soon as you have the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, within about 10 days you've got 70% protection from coronavirus. ""But if you are in the 30% that does catch it, you're much less likely to get severely ill and much less likely to go to hospital. ""We are in a crisis situation and we have to protect as many people as we possibly can."" This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine matters Wales is under""stay at home"" lockdown restrictionsafter a rise in Covid-19 cases - with more than 31,000 cases in Wales in the two weeks over the Christmas period. There are almost 2,700 people with coronavirus symptoms in Welsh hospitals - with ""more than half"" of the 208 critical care patients having Covid. But Mr Gething said Wales' overall Covid incidence rate had fallen from a high of 636 cases per 100,000 people before the lockdown started to446 cases on Monday. Wales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas with nine out of the top 10 of the UK's most infected counties in Wales. Latest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK. ""Cases of the virus remain very high"" although rates had fallen back from the incredibly high levels from just before Christmas,"" said Mr Gething. The British Medical Association in Wales said there wasconcern among staffthat a 12-week gap between doses could lead to ""sacrificing some immunity"" because trials had involved a shorter gap. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said the longer time between doses and the rollout of a second jab would see the pace of vaccinations increase. ""By the end of the month we will be doing in a day what we've been able to do in a week prior to Christmas, maybe more than that,"" he said. Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures so will have fewer storage and transport issues, making it much easier to use in care homes and GP surgeries. This video can not be played Brian Pinker, 82, is given the Oxford vaccine at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford ""This is a game changer in the fight against Covid, it's absolutely huge,"" Dr Christmas, principal GP at the Wye Valley Practice,told BBC Radio Wales. ""We need this vaccine because it's easy to give. We can now all get involved and start this rollout of this crucial vaccination programme."" The Welsh Government said every health board in Wales will receive its allocation in proportion to the size of its priority population and ability to deliver. Residents in Wales vaccinated by health board, to 27 December 5,487Aneurin Bevan 4,604Betsi Cadwaladr 5,706Cardiff & Vale 4,789Cwm Taf Morgannwg 5,276 + 3,250Hywel Dda and Powys 5,285Swansea Bay But it warned the effects of the vaccines may not be seen nationally for many months and the advice remained to keep contacts with others to a minimum, keep a two-metre distance from others, wash hands regularly, wear a face covering where required and avoid touching surfaces others have touched. People have also been asked not to phone their GP, pharmacy or hospital to ask when they will get a vaccine and wait for a letter which ""will provide people with a measure of assurance"" and will explain how they will be contacted. Mr Gething said: ""Today marks a key milestone in our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Its approval will help us to speed up our vaccination programme and run more clinics closer to people's homes"". While Plaid Cymru are ""pleased"" with the second vaccine rollout, health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Wales has been behind every other UK nation in terms of numbers vaccinated and there's far too much variation from region to region - Welsh Government must not allow a postcode lottery."" The Welsh Conservatives previouslycriticised the speed of the first vaccine rollout,saying hope had ""dropped away"" for many over 80 who were ""desperately waiting for their appointment"". The rollout of the new vaccine will be another injection of hope at a time when it's so desperately needed. At least 22,000 doses will be available in Wales this week followed at least another 20,000 next week. The hope is then to ramp up its distribution as supplies arrive, so that around 1.5 million people in Wales at greatest risk of getting really ill from Covid, for example older people or those who have long term health conditions,  can get a jab within the next few months. Because it can be stored for much longer in a normal fridge, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is easier to deliver in places like GP surgeries and care homes than the other Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

"This video can not be played The first minister says the phased return allows local circumstances to be taken into account. Closing schools will be a ""last resort"" that depends on scientific evidence, Wales' health minister has said. Some schools are due to welcome pupils back this week as the Welsh Government comes under fire from teachers' unions. Health minister Vaughan Gething said: ""If the evidence changes then we'll have to take account of that... and that may lead to a different choice."" Evidence is expected shortlyon the new Covid-19 variant, but local authorities have control over schools re-opening. Under a ""flexible"" agreement with the Welsh Governmentsome schools are due to open on Wednesday, local authorities said. First MinisterMark Drakeford has defended this flexibilitythat leaves the decision with local authorities on when to allow children back to school. But,unions have threatened legal actionbecause of concerns about the new variant. At Monday's coronavirus press briefing, Mr Gething said schools will continue with the phased return to face-to-face learning over the first two weeks of the new term unless the ""evidence changes"". ""The plan is for schools to open in a flexible wayâ¦ we made a choice before the Christmas break to have this flexible approach to opening, so we can learn and try to understand more of what is happening,"" he said. ""Now, if we get evidence and advice today, then that is advice we may well need to act upon today or tomorrow."" He stressed that decisions on schools ""are always underpinned by evidence"". Closing primary schools ""has a real impact on people being able to go to work"" and online learning is ""practically more difficult"" for younger pupils, he added. Schools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers while other pupils are taught online until face-to-face teaching resumes. The Trades' Union Congress - the UK's umbrella union body -has called for parents who are juggling their work lives with childcare should be put on furloughas long as schools are closed. Plaid Cymru's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said there had to be as much ""advance warning as possible"" on any plans to change the return to school. ""I feel for students and I feel for teachers and here we are on the first day of term with a lack of assurance of what's coming down the line,"" he said. The Ynys Mon MS said the Welsh Government should make a statement on ""what the impact is"" of the new variant on schools so that schools can plan. ""It cannot be an end to education - it must be a move to full online education"", he added. Education Minister Kirsty Williams moved learning online for secondary schools and further education colleges in early December With Covid-19 cases rising in early December,Education Minister Kirsty Williams announcedall secondary schools and further education colleges in Wales would move to online learning as part of a ""national effort to reduce transmission of coronavirus"". The move was criticised by children's commissioner for Wales Sally Holland, who said it was disruptive to education. But many parents had alreadystarted withdrawing their children from school earlydue to fears of having to self-isolate over Christmas. A week later, the Welsh Local Government Associationsaid children would return to school on a staggered basisafter the Christmas break, with a full return expected by 18 January. This sparked outrage from teachers' unions, who said schools would ""yet again"" have to ""pick up the pieces of a last-minute announcement"". Amelie Boyce, a sixth form student at Neath College, told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast she had been enjoying online learning and felt ""a bit more worried I think for going back to college than I was maybe last term because obviously the virus is a lot more dangerous now"". But she added it was more difficult working in her bedroom at home as ""that's the place where I relax most of the time, so it's not really a working environment"". Tim Newbould, head teacher at Penycae Community Primary School in Wrexham, said he had mixed feelings about the return to school, but welcomed the flexibility given by the Welsh Government. ""We don't know yet the impact of Christmas Day,"" he said. He added six of his staff had been off following positive Covid tests and ""a number of us have been quite poorly, so we're well aware of the risks."" Mr Newbould said absence from school had an obvious impact on pupils' academic progress, but there was also the effect on socialising with peers, ""which is really important and has an impact on pupils' mental health and wellbeing"". But he stresses ""safety is the key issue"", particularly in light of the new variant of the virus, and that teachers and school staff should receive the vaccine early on. ""We simply don't know whether our risk assessments are adequate for the new variant of the virus,"" he said. ""We're right in front of a large number of pupils at the same time, breathing the same air."" Ceri Reed, from the group Parents Voices in Wales, said many members are worried about the danger of the new variant of the virus. ""I have to admit, we are divided in our group. We represent over 720 parents and carers in Wales, and I think the main concern from those parents who are not considering sending their children into school is because of the new strain,"" she said. ""We are encouraging parents to look at the science, and we need to applaud what the teachers have done from September onwards with things like track and trace. ""They have been absolutely phenomenal and we believe we can do it again."" First Minister Mark Drakeford scrapped a five-day relaxation of lockdown rules over Christmas due to concerns over the new coronavirus variant On 19 December, Mr Drakefordscrapped plans for a five-day relaxation of lockdown rulesover Christmas amid concerns about the spread ofa more virulent variant of coronavirus. Councils pressed on with the plans for a staggered reopening of schools, with the majority of local authorities intending to reopen secondary schools next Monday. Schools have been asked to make provision for vulnerable children and children of key workers from this week, and all pupils are expected to take part in remote learning before their schools reopen for face-to-face teaching. On Saturday, theNASUWT teachers' union threatened ""appropriate action""to protect teachers, and the head teachers' union NAHT Cymru said it had taken legal action against the Welsh Government to obtain scientific evidence on the risks of the new variant it said it was ""withholding"". There is ""no evidence that young people get the illness more severely as a result of the variant,"" Mr Drakeford says The National Education Union Cymruhad already called for in-person learning to be delayed until at least 18 January. The unions say more time is needed to assess the risks posed by the new variant and have accused the Welsh Government of ""passing the buck"" to local authorities. On Sunday,a joint statement from nine unionscalled for a national decision on reopening schools rather than leaving it to local councils. In response, Mr Drakeford said there was ""no evidence that young people get the illness more severely as a result of the variant"", adding that the Welsh Government's technical advisory group ""will be looking at all the evidence again early next week"". However Dilwyn Roberts-Young, general secretary of Undeb Cenedlaethol Athrawon Cymru (UCAC), told BBC Wales Breakfast the evidence around transmission rates in schools did not instil confidence. ""We have listened to the first minister's comments about young people getting the illness more severely,"" he said. ""Schools aren't in a vacuum - there are adults in the school, there are older pupils, and the Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Chris Jones, said just before Christmas that high numbers of incidents continue to be reported, mainly in residential care homes and school settings. ""Looking at the evidence again... it does not give confidence to parents, to staff or to pupils, and if you look at last March, when the education minister talked about the five guiding principles to determine when schools should return to providing education, there was an emphasis on evidence and information, to ensure that any decisions taken are the correct ones.""

On Sunday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the sixth day in a row. Labour is calling for new England-wide restrictions to come in immediately.

An additional 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported across the UK on Sunday, meaning the total by this measure is now above 75,000.

Hospitals are coming under increasing pressure, as cases mount up. The old tier system is no longer enoughâ¦the figures are only heading in one direction. These are the words of the health secretary and a health minister. Boris Johnson says stricter measures are coming, which immediately sparks the questions ""when?,"" and ""what are you waiting for?"" Downing Street wants to push a tougher message on adherence to the current rules in England while it assesses the latest Christmas data, but is coming under growing pressure to act sooner. With Nicola Sturgeon about to go further in Scotland and the Labour leader calling for an immediate national lockdown, it's difficult to see how the prime minister can wait much longer. Asked what further restrictions would be put in place, Mr Johnson said: ""What we have been waiting for is to see the impact of the tier four measures on the virus and it is a bit unclear, still, at the moment. ""But if you look at the numbers, there is no question that we are going to have to take tougher measures and we will be announcing those in due course."" He said the faster-spreading coronavirus variant that has developed in south-eastern England required ""extra-special vigilance"". BBC science editor David Shukman said new measures could include limits on outdoor exercise and a return to the two-metre (rather than one-metre-plus) social distancing rule, as applied during the first lockdown last year. Speaking on a visit to Chase Farm Hospital in north London, the prime minister argued that closing primary schools must remain a ""last resort"", adding that the ""risk to kids"" was ""very, very small"". Secondary schools in England are currently closed until 18 January, except for pupils in their final GCSE and A-level years, who are due to return on 11 January. Asked whether they could remain closed, Mr Johnson said: ""We are keeping things under review."" But former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged the government to close all schools and UK borders ""right away"", while banning ""all household mixing"". The Conservative MP, who now chairs the Commons Health Committee, said these restrictions should be ""time-limited"" to ""12 weeks or so"", after which the roll-out of vaccines would provide ""light at the end of the tunnel"". More than 500,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine are now available for use, with the Pfizer BioNTech jab having been issued since early last month. The virus is winning at the moment, despite science fighting back with a vaccine. New daily cases of Covid have been rising to record levels, which means hospital numbers and deaths will increase too. Ministers say more measures are coming, but it is not clear yet what that will mean in practice. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are already in lockdown, and most of England is under tier four rules. In recent days the focus has shifted to schools and whether they can be kept open without making the epidemic worse. Experts agree that the risk the virus poses to children is still low, but they can spread the disease. With a new, more transmissible variant of Covid circulating, the government may have to enact this unpalatable ""last resort"" of closing classrooms.

But Matt Hancock told Today he was ""incredibly worried"" about the South African variant, saying: ""This is a very, very significant problem."" ""We have shown that we are prepared to move incredibly quickly, within 24 hours if we think that is necessary, and we keep these things under review all the time,"" added the health secretary.

"PM Boris Johnson announces new lockdown for England in a televised address People in England are told to work from home after a sharp rise in coronavirus cases All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesday with remote learning until February half term End-of-year exams will not take place this summer as normal PM suggests England could ""steadily"" move out of lockdown from mid-February People in Scotland will also be legally required to stay at home - except for essential purposes - from midnight tonight Most schools in Scotland will remain closed until 1 February ""Material risk"" of NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days say chief medical officers The newly-approved coronavirus vaccine created by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is being rolled out across the UK today Globally more than 85 million cases of Covid have been reported and 1.84 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Vanessa Barford and Sarah Fowler Thanks for joining us. Updates were brought to you today by Claire Heald, Vanessa Barford, James Clarke, Doug Faulkner, Becky Morton, Mary
OâConnor, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Jen Meierhans, George Wright, Katie Wright, Victoria Bisset and Sarah Fowler. We're about to close the live page now, but before we go, here's a quick re-cap of the key points from Boris Johnson's speech:  Business leaders are reacting with concern to the fresh lockdown announced by Boris Johnson amid fears that companies may not last until the spring. British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall says: ""Businesses will understand why the prime minister has felt compelled to act on the spiralling threat to public health, but they will be baffled and disappointed by the fact that he did not announce additional support for affected businesses alongside these new restrictions. Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of London First, says: ""The Government must now extend business rates and VAT relief throughout 2021 and stand ready to pump further direct support to businesses forced to close.""  Now for some more reaction to the news that schools will be moving to remote learning for most pupils under England's new lockdown measures. Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union: âNo one wanted schools and colleges to be shut again but the evidence clearly pointed to the necessity for this to happen weeks ago. ""Why Boris Johnson allowed such confusion and chaos to build up around school openings before making this belated, blindingly obvious decision is beyond belief. ""Government must take responsibility for this closure because it has allowed Covid-19 to become, again, out of control.â Reality Check Boris
Johnson said that the UK has vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe
combined. As of 27
December, 944,539 people in the UK had received the first dose of the Covid-19
vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. The latest
data from 22 of the EU's 27 member states, collected by Our World in Data, shows 682,279 vaccinations have
been carried out so far. As each EU
member state publishes its own statistics, some of this data goes up to early
January but some only to late December. Germany is
leading the EU, having vaccinated 265,610 people as of 3 January. France though
had only vaccinated 516 citizens by 1 January and the Netherlands won't begin
vaccinations till 8 January. The UK
started vaccinating citizens with the Pfizer jab on 8 December, while the EU vaccine
rollout began on 27 December. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Egyptian authorities
are denying claims that at least six Covid-19 patients died in two government
hospitals over the past two days due to a lack of oxygen. It follows anger aftera video of nurses in intensive care units struggling to keep patients alive,externalwas
widely shared on social media. At one point, a nurse in
blue PPE can be seen crumpled over on the floor in apparent shock. The voice of
the person filming repeats: âAll those in the intensive care are dead... there is
no oxygen.â In a statement on Facebook,external, Egyptâs health ministry spokesman said there were sufficient oxygen supplies at all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. He said that most of the deaths at two hospitals in the north of the country - Al-Husseiniya and Zefta - were patients already suffering from chronic diseases. The ministry spokesman called on the media not to spread âinaccurate or false information that may cause panic among people"". In Egypt, there have been 142,187 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 7,805 deaths. However, many experts suspect the actual figures are far higher. The government has now publishedfull guidance,externalon what people are allowed to do in England under the new national lockdown. Here's a quick summary of the new rules: Cyprus and Brazil  have become the latest countries to identify the new coronavirus variant, which was first discovered in the UK. In total, more than 30 countries around the world have seen cases involving the new strain, including: Sir Keir Starmer said the most important thing is the messaging about 'stay at home' and going back to the spirit of March ""because a lot is now going to depend on the willingness of people to comply and I urge everyone to comply"". He adds: ""We have to rekindle that spirit and I think that in a way we need to remake that contract with the British people, in return for you enduring these measures now for the coming weeks the vaccine must be rolled out at speed. We need this to be mission critical. We were the first country to get the vaccine and we need to be the first country to have the vaccine programme rolled out."" Reality Check We know that the UK is going to
threat level 5, the highest level, which means there is a danger of the NHS
being overwhelmed within 21 days. When the prime minister announced
these threat levels in May he was clear that during the first lockdown the country
had only been in level four. At the time he also said:,externalâThe
higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.â So on that basis should we have expected tighter restrictions in England than we saw during the
first lockdown in March? If anything, the restrictions
appear slightly less severe. For example, support bubbles and childcare bubbles
exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds will be open when they were closed
last time. Communal worship is still
allowed as long as social distancing is observed. One significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops, public transport or places of worship. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The lockdown announcement
contained the clearest indication yet of how quickly the government hopes to
vaccinate the at risk groups. A target of mid February for
vaccinating all the over 70s and those deemed extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care
staff opens up a pathway to a significant easing of restrictions by the start of
March. But it will require a rapid
acceleration in vaccination rates. So far nearly one million
people have been vaccinated. By the end of the week that
number is expected to double. The hope is that later in
January two million doses a week will be given. That will be the minimum needed
â there are around 12 million in those priority groups. By vaccinating them, there is
the potential to prevent close to nine in 10 deaths. But achieving that requires a
lot to go right. There is enough vaccine in
the country to vaccinate that many people, but not all of it has been through
the final âfill and finishâ process which involves packaging it in glass vials
(and there is a shortage of those) and then the batches have to be checked and
signed off by the regulator â a process that is taking weeks at the moment. And all of that is before it
is sent out to the NHS vaccination centres to inject it into peopleâs arms. The Labour leader say it's time for everyone to pull together. Sir Keir Starmer says: ""The situation we are in is obviously very serious, the figures are very stark and these measures are necessary, sadly, and therefore we support the packages of measures that the prime minister has just outlined. ""And I think whatever our criticisms and challenges of the government we've all got to pull together now to make this work over the next few weeks and months. ""It's going to be a very, very difficult period, there are questions about the timing of decisions etc but now is the time to support this package, pull together and try do everything we can to try and make this work."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Itâs a familiar mantra but one that many hoped had been left in
the past.Stay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives.That was the key,
simple message when the first lockdown was introduced back in March. It was
well understood and big news in England when the government decided to modify
it. But now, itâs back. And, as in Tier 4, the Stay at Home message will be
legally enforceable. While saying that the new
variant means there needs to be another lockdown, the prime minister is also
trying to emphasise a hope that didnât exist before, back in March. Specifically, the vaccine. Significantly, heâs outlined an ambition that the
top four priority groups will have received their first dose by mid-February.
However, as weâve learnt so many times, caution can be the watchword when it
comes to coronavirus. But ministers do want to keep emphasising that there is
hope, amidst all the gloom. The prime minister says by the middle of February, ""if things go well"", the government expects to have
offered a first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups. This includes vaccinating all residents in a care home for
older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70 and all frontline health
and social care workers If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups âwe will have removed
huge numbers of people from the path of the virus"", he says. ""That will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have
endured for so long."" Johnson stresses there will remain a time lag of two to
three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity, and there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted. ""So we
should remain cautious about the timetable ahead,"" he adds. ""But if
our understanding of the virus doesnât change dramatically once again, if the
rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful, if
deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect, and,
critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules, then I
hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February
half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers."" The PM says the weeks ahead ""will be the hardest yet"". ""But I really do believe we are entering the last phase of the struggle because with every jab that goes into our arms we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people,"" he says. ""Thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight but we know exactly how we are going to get there."" The PM addresses people across the UK, saying he knows how ""tough this is"" and how ""frustrated"" people are. But he says ""now, more than ever, we must pull together"". Mr Johnson says people should follow the new rules from now, which  will become law in the early hours of Wednesday
morning and parliament will meet remotely later that day. He says the governments of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland
share his ""conviction"" that this is a ""pivotal moment"" and were taking similar steps to contain the spread of the virus. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Once again it
is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. In England
there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid
since Christmas day. To put that
into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled. Currently around
three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease. In some
hospitals it is more than six in 10. But what is
worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to
increase. In the spring
it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak. The last six
days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the
UK â a number of these infections are next weekâs hospital admissions. It is why the
UKâs chief medical officers were warning there was a âmaterial riskâ of some
hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change. The PM repeats the advice of the UK's chief medical officers that the nation's Covid alert level should move to level 5 - ""meaning that if action is not taken, NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days"". He adds though, that there is ""one huge difference"" compared to last time, saying the UK is ""rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in its history"" and had so far ""vaccinated more people than in the rest of Europe combined"". He says the ""pace of vaccination is accelerating"" thanks to the arrival of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which patients began receiving earlier today.  The prime minister says he ""completely understands the inconvenience and distress"" the disruption to education will cause parents and pupils. But he says the government has been doing ""everything in our power to keep schools
openâ because of the importance of education to childrenâs
life chances. ""The problem is not that schools are unsafe for children,"" he says, adding that children are still very unlikely to be severely affected even by the new variant of Covid. But he says schools may act as ""vectors for transmission"", causing the virus to spread between households. The prime minister adds that given the alarming figures, it had become ""clear that we need to do more"" to bring the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant ""under control"" and help the vaccination roll-out in the UK. He says we must therefore go into a national lockdown, with the government once more telling people to stay at home, except for specific reasons, including essential shopping, to work, if you cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical help, and to escape domestic abuse. He says the government will be advising clinical extremely people to begin shielding again. Primary and secondary schools must move to remote learning from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and those of key workers, he adds. Given this, it is not ""fair"" for all exams to go ahead this summer, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

"This video can not be played PM: 'No question we're going to have to take tougher measures' Boris Johnson has said there is ""no question"" the government will announce stricter measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus ""in due course"". He predicted ""tough, tough"" weeks to come, with more than three-quarters of England's population already under the highest - tier four - restrictions. On Sunday, the UK recorded more than 50,000 new confirmed Covid cases for the sixth day in a row. Labour is calling for new England-wide restrictions to come in immediately. Leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""inevitable"" more schools would have to close to lessen the spread of coronavirus. 82-year-old first to get Oxford Covid vaccine PM: Send children to school on Monday What could 'tougher' coronavirus measures mean? UK coronavirus cases up by 54,990 on Sunday In Scotland, further new restrictions are to come into force at midnight,including a ""legal requirement"" for people to stay at home.except for essential purposes. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Scotland was effectively returning to conditions similar to Spring's nation-wide lockdown, with the curbs in place until at least the end of January. An additional 454 deaths within 28 days of a positive test result were reported across the UK on Sunday, meaning the total by this measure is now above 75,000. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""old tier system"" in England was ""no longer strong enough"" to contain increasing infections. Hospitals are coming under increasing pressure, as cases mount up. The old tier system is no longer enoughâ¦the figures are only heading in one direction. These are the words of the health secretary and a health minister. Boris Johnson says stricter measures are coming, which immediately sparks the questions ""when?,"" and ""what are you waiting for?"" Downing Street wants to push a tougher message on adherence to the current rules in England while it assesses the latest Christmas data, but is coming under growing pressure to act sooner. With Nicola Sturgeon about to go further in Scotland and the Labour leader calling for an immediate national lockdown, it's difficult to see how the prime minister can wait much longer. Asked what further restrictions would be put in place, Mr Johnson said: ""What we have been waiting for is to see the impact of the tier four measures on the virus and it is a bit unclear, still, at the moment. ""But if you look at the numbers, there is no question that we are going to have to take tougher measures and we will be announcing those in due course."" He said the faster-spreading coronavirus variant that has developed in south-eastern England required ""extra-special vigilance"". BBC science editor David Shukman said new measures could include limits on outdoor exercise and a return to the two-metre (rather than one-metre-plus) social distancing rule, as applied during the first lockdown last year. Speaking on a visit to Chase Farm Hospital in north London, the prime minister argued that closing primary schools must remain a ""last resort"", adding that the ""risk to kids"" was ""very, very small"". Secondary schools in England are currently closed until 18 January, except for pupils in their final GCSE and A-level years, who are due to return on 11 January. Asked whether they could remain closed, Mr Johnson said: ""We are keeping things under review."" But former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt urged the government to close all schools and UK borders ""right away"", while banning ""all household mixing"". The Conservative MP, who now chairs the Commons Health Committee, said these restrictions should be ""time-limited"" to ""12 weeks or so"", after which the roll-out of vaccines would provide ""light at the end of the tunnel"". More than 500,000 doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine are now available for use, with the Pfizer BioNTech jab having been issued since early last month. The virus is winning at the moment, despite science fighting back with a vaccine. New daily cases of Covid have been rising to record levels, which means hospital numbers and deaths will increase too. Ministers say more measures are coming, but it is not clear yet what that will mean in practice. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are already in lockdown, and most of England is under tier four rules. In recent days the focus has shifted to schools and whether they can be kept open without making the epidemic worse. Experts agree that the risk the virus poses to children is still low, but they can spread the disease. With a new, more transmissible variant of Covid circulating, the government may have to enact this unpalatable ""last resort"" of closing classrooms. Some 78% of the population of England is now in tier four, under which non-essential shops are closed and people can only leave their homes for a certain number of reasons. The Scottish governmentmeets laterto consider ""further action"", with all of mainland Scotland currently under its ownlevel fourrestrictions - only some islands are under less stringent tier three measures. Wales entered a nationwide lockdown on 20 December, while Northern Ireland is in the second week of asix-week lockdownthat began on Boxing Day. SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters In another development, an academic has said there is a ""big question mark"" over whether a vaccine developed at Oxford University will be as effective against anew variant of the virusthat has emerged in South Africa. Prof Sir John Bell, Regius professor of medicine at the university, said the team there were currently investigating this question ""right now"". He added it was ""unlikely"" the variant would ""turn off the effect of vaccines entirely"", and in any case it would be possible to tweak the vaccine in around four to six weeks. But Matt Hancock told Today he was ""incredibly worried"" about the South African variant, saying: ""This is a very, very significant problem."" ""We have shown that we are prepared to move incredibly quickly, within 24 hours if we think that is necessary, and we keep these things under review all the time,"" added the health secretary.

"Experts have raised concerns over India's emergency approval of a locally-produced coronavirus vaccine before the completion of trials. On Sunday, Delhi approved the vaccine - known as Covaxin - as well as the global AstraZeneca Oxford jab, which is also being manufactured in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi touted the approval as a ""game changer"". The head of Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, defended the approval process, but health experts warn it was rushed. Health watchdogAll India Drug Action Network said it was ""shocked"",external. It said that there were ""intense concerns arising from the absence of the efficacy data"" as well a lack of transparency that would ""raise more questions than answers and likely will not reinforce faith in our scientific decision making bodies"". The statement came after India's Drugs Controller General, VG Somani, insisted Covaxin was ""safe and provides a robust immune response"". He added the vaccines had been approved for restricted use in ""public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains"". ""The vaccines are 100% safe,"" he said, adding that side effects such as ""mild fever, pain and allergy are common for every vaccine"". How do you vaccinate a billion people? How a 'warm vaccine' could help India tackle Covid The All India Drug Action Network, however, said it was ""baffled to understand the scientific logic"" to approve ""an incompletely studied vaccine"". One of India's most eminent medical experts, Dr Gagandeep Kang,told the Times of India newspaper,externalthat she had ""not seen anything like this before"". She added that ""there is absolutely no efficacy data that has been presented or published"". Even social media users were quick to point out that approving the vaccine before trials were complete was a matter of concern irrespective of how safe or effective the vaccine eventually turned out to be.

But Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech, met reporters on Monday and said the approval of Covaxin had not been rushed. He cited previous examples where emergency authorisation approvals had been given based only on immunogenicity data. ""Under Indian laws we can get emergency approval for the vaccine based on fulfilling five parameters after Phase 2 trails. That is what has happened with our vaccine. So it is not a premature approval,"" he said. ""We will complete the Phase 3 trials soon and provide the efficacy data for the vaccine by February."" The company currently has 20 million doses available and plans to produce about 700 million doses this year, Dr Ella said. ""We have four facilities coming up and we are planning [to make] around 200 million doses in Hyderabad, 500 million doses in other cities."" Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi Many scientists and opposition politicians have raised questions over what they say is the hasty authorisation of Covaxin. Bharat Biotech has developed the vaccine with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research - and the effort has been touted as an example of India's might in vaccine development and production. Regulators say the vaccine is safe and effective. The firm says phase 1 and phase 2 trials have shown good results. But scientists say that the government's decision not to release data on the vaccine's efficacy for peer review has raised concerns. Mr Modi has welcomed the approval, saying Covaxin is a shining example of his ambitious Atmnirbhar (self-reliance) India campaign. But experts worry that questions over the approval process don't bode well for the campaign. And there could be deeper issues. Many believe that the government needs to be more transparent about the authorisation process because the success of the Covid-19 vaccine programme depends on public trust. The emergency authorisation also sparked a fierce debate on Indian Twitter on Sunday night between ministers and opposition leaders. India's health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan called out opposition leaders for failing to ""applaud"" the country's ""prowess""  in locally producing a vaccine. India makes about 60% of vaccines globally. Members of the main opposition Congress party, Shashi Tharoor and Jairam Ramesh, and former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, Akhilesh Yadav, were among those who raised concerns about the manner in which Covaxin was approved.

The approval comes as India gears up to vaccinate its population of more than 1.3 billon people. Amid fears that richer countries are buying up much of the vaccine supply, India too appears to be stockpiling vaccines. In aninterview with the Associated Press,external, Adar Poonawalla, whose Serum Institute of India (SII) is manufacturing the  AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, said the jab was given emergency authorisation on the condition that it would not be exported outside India. Mr Poonawalla said his company, the world's largest vaccine maker, was also not allowed to sell the shot in the private market. This has raised concerns in India's neighbouring countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh, which were primarily depending on the SII to start vaccinating their populations. Bangladesh had already ordered 30 million doses of the vaccine in the first phase,Reuters reported,external, but now the fate of the order is unclear. The country's health secretary told local media in December that it expected thefirst batch of the jab by February,external. India plans to vaccinate some 300 million people on a priority list by August. It has recorded the second-highest number of infections in the world, with more than 10.3 million confirmed cases to date. Nearly 150,000 people have died. Both vaccines approved on Sunday can be transported and stored at normal refrigeration temperatures.

"Working parents trying to balance work and childcare should be put on furlough while schools are closed, the umbrella body for UK trades unions says. Bosses may not be aware that they can use the scheme to support parents, according to the Trades Union Congress. Many families would be ""frantically"" looking for a solution, the TUC said, after the decision to start the new term late or online for many pupils. Employers must ""do the right thing and furlough mums and dads"", the TUC said. All secondary schools will remain closed to students this week, except for the children of key workers such as NHS staff. Students are expected to return on a staggered basis from 11 January. Most primary schools are open to pupils from Monday, except in London and parts of the south east of England where the spread of a new, more infectious, strain of coronavirus is already high. However, decisions over whether it was safe for pupils to return to school in person were still being discussed over the New Year holiday weekend, leaving parents with little time to find support. ""Without further action, many will have no choice but to cut their hours or take unpaid leave from work,"" said Frances Grady, general secretary of the TUC. ""This will lead to further hardship and will hit mums and single parents hardest."" According to the rules of the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, first introduced nine months ago, firms can furlough parents unable to work due to a lack of childcare. Can I go back on furlough? The TUC 's Frances O'Grady is also calling for permanent changes to employees rights The TUC said its research showed that in March, when schools were closed during the first period of lockdown, one in six mothers reduced their working hours due to school and nursery closures. It said single parents were also more likely to be affected. Self-employed parents should also be given support through access to the self-employed income support scheme, the TUC said. It is calling for employees to be given a right to paid parental leave and flexible working beyond the current crisis. Employers aren't obliged to furlough staff, says employment lawyer Sarah Chilton.""You might think, why wouldn't they? But there are some costs associated with it,"" she said. Firms in sectors that have lost business due to the virus are more likely to agree than those that have plenty of work for staff to do. If you aren't furloughed, there are alternatives: Ask for flexible working. Employees (but not freelancers or gig economy workers) have the right to request flexible working, although your employer can still say no Take emergency time off. Everyone has a right to this, whether its is to care for a child or another dependent, such as an elderly relative. But it is only for short periods, for problems you couldn't foresee, and is unpaid If you've been with your employer for more than a year you can claim statutory parental leave up to 18 weeks for each child, but you have to discuss the timing with your employer. Firms usually require several weeks' notice and the leave is also unpaid You can ask for unpaid leave. If business is slow your employer may be ready to agree a temporary absence. You can use your annual leave, as long as your employer doesn't require more notice. However, most firms will have their own policies in place in addition to those laid out in law, said Ms Chilton, so it is sensible first to check with your boss. One of the arguments for keeping schools open, rather than switching to remote learning, is to allow parents to continue to work. However, there is a growing debate over whether the new coronavirus strain, which issignificantly more infectiousthan the original strain of the virus, can be contained without closing schools for longer. Pressure growing for English schools to stay shut Furlough extension buys time as vaccine is rolled out Redundancy plans fall after furlough extension While cases of the virus are increasing in almost all age groups, the percentage testing positive is highest among secondary school age children, according to the Office for National Statistics. While schools practice social distancing where possible, students continue to mix with others within their bubbles. ""The health and safety of school staff, children and parents and the wider community must come first,"" said Ms O'Grady. Boris Johnson, interviewed on the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday, said there was ""no doubt in [his] mind that schools are safe"". Butthe prime minister did not rule out further closures. Teaching unions have told staff at primary schools it is unsafe to return to work and are calling forremote learning to be introduced across all primary schools. Somelocal authorities have also expressed concerns. Mr Johnson said that while school closures would be kept ""under constant review"", the government would be ""driven by public health considerations and by the massive importance of education"". A government spokesperson said it would be ""socially responsible"" for employers to take account of a person's childcare responsibilities and individual circumstances. ""We encourage both employers and employees to be as flexible as possible during this difficult time, to support colleagues with childcare responsibilities. ""That includes providing flexible working and home working arrangements, as well as considering requests from parents to be furloughed, which is at the employer's discretion,"" the spokesperson said.

"The Queen's 95th birthday will be commemorated on one of five new coins released this year, the Royal Mint has announced. The 2021 British coin collection will also mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of novelist Sir Walter Scott, and the 75th anniversary of the death of author HG Wells. The release of a Â£5 coin is typically reserved for significant royal events. In April the Queen will become the first UK monarch to reach 95. The new Â£5 coin depicts the royal cypher ""EIIR"", above the words ""my heart and my devotion"", a nod to part of her 1957 Christmas broadcast, which was the first to be televised. David Bowie coin launched high above Earth Royal Mint celebrates its history with new coin BAME people set to feature on British money During that speech, the Queen told the nation: ""In the old days the monarch led his soldiers on the battlefield and his leadership at all times was close and personal. ""Today things are very different. I cannot lead you into battle, I do not give you laws or administer justice, but I can do something else, I can give you my heart and my devotion to these old islands and to all the peoples of our brotherhood of nations."" The anniversary of the birth of Sir Walter Scott, who wrote the novels Waverley, Rob Roy and Ivanhoe and is considered one of Scotland's most famous figures, will be celebrated with a Â£2 coin. The 75th anniversary of the death of science fiction author HG Wells, who penned works such as The Time Machine and The War Of The Worlds, will also be marked on a Â£2 coin, with a depiction of images from his novels. The 50th anniversary of decimalisation, when Britain's modern coins came into force, will be featured on a 50p coin. The 75th anniversary of the death of the inventor John Logie Baird, famous for his early prototypes of the television, will be commemorated on another new 50p coin. As the Queen's head already appears on one side of all coins in circulation, these five coins will each offer a different depiction from the various stages of her reign. Clare Maclennan, of the consumer division at the Royal Mint, said this year's commemorative coins marked ""some of the biggest anniversaries in 2021"", with each coin ""a miniature work of art"" designed as ""a treasured keepsake or gift"". The commemorative set will be available to purchase from the Royal Mint website.

"Security has been stepped up in Niger's TillabÃ©ri region, where the two villages are situated Niger's prime minister says 100 people are now known to have been killed in Saturday's attacks by suspected jihadists on two villages. Brigi Rafini said 70 people were killed in the village of Tchombangou and 30 others in Zaroumdareye - both near Niger's border with Mali. It was one of the deadliest days in living memory, as Niger grapples with ethnic violence and Islamist militancy. No group has said it carried out the attacks. According to local mayor Almou Hassane, those responsible travelled on ""about 100 motorcycles,"" AFP news agency reports. They split into two groups and carried out the attacks simultaneously. How West Africa is under threat from Islamist militants Africa's Sahel becomes latest al-Qaeda-IS battleground Former minister Issoufou Issaka told AFP that jihadists launched the assaults after villagers killed two of their group members, though this hasn't been officially confirmed. Mayor Hassane said 75 other villagers were left wounded in the aftermath, and some have been evacuated for treatment in Ouallam and the capital, Niamey. Prime Minister Rafini visited both of the villages on Sunday. ""This situation is simply horrible... but investigations will be conducted so that this crime does not go unpunished,"" he told reporters. Niger's TillabÃ©ri region lies within the so-called tri-border area between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, which has been plagued by jihadist attacks for many years. Niger's Prime Minister Brigi Rafini visited the two villages on Sunday Last month, seven Nigerien soldiers were killed in an ambush in the region. Areas of Niger are also facing repeated attacks by jihadists from neighbouring Nigeria, where the government is fighting an insurgency by Boko Haram. As part of efforts to quell the violence, France has been leading a coalition of West African and European allies against Islamist militants in the Sahel. Coalition forces have become targets, and last week five French soldiers were killed in two separate incidents in Mali. The latest attacks in TillabÃ©ri also come amid national elections in Niger, as President Mahamadou Issoufou steps down after two five-year terms. Election officials announced provisional results on Saturday, showing a lead for Mohamed Bazoum - a former minister and a member of Niger's ruling party. A second round of votes is expected to be held on 21 February, once ballots have been validated by the country's constitutional court.

"PM Boris Johnson announces new lockdown for England in a televised address People in England are told to work from home after a sharp rise in coronavirus cases All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesday with remote learning until February half term End-of-year exams will not take place this summer as normal PM suggests England could ""steadily"" move out of lockdown from mid-February People in Scotland will also be legally required to stay at home - except for essential purposes - from midnight tonight Most schools in Scotland will remain closed until 1 February ""Material risk"" of NHS in several areas being overwhelmed over the next 21 days say chief medical officers The newly-approved coronavirus vaccine created by Oxford University and AstraZeneca is being rolled out across the UK today Globally more than 85 million cases of Covid have been reported and 1.84 million deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Vanessa Barford and Sarah Fowler Thanks for joining us. Updates were brought to you today by Claire Heald, Vanessa Barford, James Clarke, Doug Faulkner, Becky Morton, Mary
OâConnor, Jasmine Taylor-Coleman, Jen Meierhans, George Wright, Katie Wright, Victoria Bisset and Sarah Fowler. We're about to close the live page now, but before we go, here's a quick re-cap of the key points from Boris Johnson's speech:  Business leaders are reacting with concern to the fresh lockdown announced by Boris Johnson amid fears that companies may not last until the spring. British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall says: ""Businesses will understand why the prime minister has felt compelled to act on the spiralling threat to public health, but they will be baffled and disappointed by the fact that he did not announce additional support for affected businesses alongside these new restrictions. Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of London First, says: ""The Government must now extend business rates and VAT relief throughout 2021 and stand ready to pump further direct support to businesses forced to close.""  Now for some more reaction to the news that schools will be moving to remote learning for most pupils under England's new lockdown measures. Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union: âNo one wanted schools and colleges to be shut again but the evidence clearly pointed to the necessity for this to happen weeks ago. ""Why Boris Johnson allowed such confusion and chaos to build up around school openings before making this belated, blindingly obvious decision is beyond belief. ""Government must take responsibility for this closure because it has allowed Covid-19 to become, again, out of control.â Reality Check Boris
Johnson said that the UK has vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe
combined. As of 27
December, 944,539 people in the UK had received the first dose of the Covid-19
vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. The latest
data from 22 of the EU's 27 member states, collected by Our World in Data, shows 682,279 vaccinations have
been carried out so far. As each EU
member state publishes its own statistics, some of this data goes up to early
January but some only to late December. Germany is
leading the EU, having vaccinated 265,610 people as of 3 January. France though
had only vaccinated 516 citizens by 1 January and the Netherlands won't begin
vaccinations till 8 January. The UK
started vaccinating citizens with the Pfizer jab on 8 December, while the EU vaccine
rollout began on 27 December. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Egyptian authorities
are denying claims that at least six Covid-19 patients died in two government
hospitals over the past two days due to a lack of oxygen. It follows anger aftera video of nurses in intensive care units struggling to keep patients alive,externalwas
widely shared on social media. At one point, a nurse in
blue PPE can be seen crumpled over on the floor in apparent shock. The voice of
the person filming repeats: âAll those in the intensive care are dead... there is
no oxygen.â In a statement on Facebook,external, Egyptâs health ministry spokesman said there were sufficient oxygen supplies at all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. He said that most of the deaths at two hospitals in the north of the country - Al-Husseiniya and Zefta - were patients already suffering from chronic diseases. The ministry spokesman called on the media not to spread âinaccurate or false information that may cause panic among people"". In Egypt, there have been 142,187 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 7,805 deaths. However, many experts suspect the actual figures are far higher. The government has now publishedfull guidance,externalon what people are allowed to do in England under the new national lockdown. Here's a quick summary of the new rules: Cyprus and Brazil  have become the latest countries to identify the new coronavirus variant, which was first discovered in the UK. In total, more than 30 countries around the world have seen cases involving the new strain, including: Sir Keir Starmer said the most important thing is the messaging about 'stay at home' and going back to the spirit of March ""because a lot is now going to depend on the willingness of people to comply and I urge everyone to comply"". He adds: ""We have to rekindle that spirit and I think that in a way we need to remake that contract with the British people, in return for you enduring these measures now for the coming weeks the vaccine must be rolled out at speed. We need this to be mission critical. We were the first country to get the vaccine and we need to be the first country to have the vaccine programme rolled out."" Reality Check We know that the UK is going to
threat level 5, the highest level, which means there is a danger of the NHS
being overwhelmed within 21 days. When the prime minister announced
these threat levels in May he was clear that during the first lockdown the country
had only been in level four. At the time he also said:,externalâThe
higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.â So on that basis should we have expected tighter restrictions in England than we saw during the
first lockdown in March? If anything, the restrictions
appear slightly less severe. For example, support bubbles and childcare bubbles
exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds will be open when they were closed
last time. Communal worship is still
allowed as long as social distancing is observed. One significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops, public transport or places of worship. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The lockdown announcement
contained the clearest indication yet of how quickly the government hopes to
vaccinate the at risk groups. A target of mid February for
vaccinating all the over 70s and those deemed extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care
staff opens up a pathway to a significant easing of restrictions by the start of
March. But it will require a rapid
acceleration in vaccination rates. So far nearly one million
people have been vaccinated. By the end of the week that
number is expected to double. The hope is that later in
January two million doses a week will be given. That will be the minimum needed
â there are around 12 million in those priority groups. By vaccinating them, there is
the potential to prevent close to nine in 10 deaths. But achieving that requires a
lot to go right. There is enough vaccine in
the country to vaccinate that many people, but not all of it has been through
the final âfill and finishâ process which involves packaging it in glass vials
(and there is a shortage of those) and then the batches have to be checked and
signed off by the regulator â a process that is taking weeks at the moment. And all of that is before it
is sent out to the NHS vaccination centres to inject it into peopleâs arms. The Labour leader say it's time for everyone to pull together. Sir Keir Starmer says: ""The situation we are in is obviously very serious, the figures are very stark and these measures are necessary, sadly, and therefore we support the packages of measures that the prime minister has just outlined. ""And I think whatever our criticisms and challenges of the government we've all got to pull together now to make this work over the next few weeks and months. ""It's going to be a very, very difficult period, there are questions about the timing of decisions etc but now is the time to support this package, pull together and try do everything we can to try and make this work."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Itâs a familiar mantra but one that many hoped had been left in
the past.Stay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives.That was the key,
simple message when the first lockdown was introduced back in March. It was
well understood and big news in England when the government decided to modify
it. But now, itâs back. And, as in Tier 4, the Stay at Home message will be
legally enforceable. While saying that the new
variant means there needs to be another lockdown, the prime minister is also
trying to emphasise a hope that didnât exist before, back in March. Specifically, the vaccine. Significantly, heâs outlined an ambition that the
top four priority groups will have received their first dose by mid-February.
However, as weâve learnt so many times, caution can be the watchword when it
comes to coronavirus. But ministers do want to keep emphasising that there is
hope, amidst all the gloom. The prime minister says by the middle of February, ""if things go well"", the government expects to have
offered a first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups. This includes vaccinating all residents in a care home for
older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70 and all frontline health
and social care workers If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups âwe will have removed
huge numbers of people from the path of the virus"", he says. ""That will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have
endured for so long."" Johnson stresses there will remain a time lag of two to
three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity, and there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted. ""So we
should remain cautious about the timetable ahead,"" he adds. ""But if
our understanding of the virus doesnât change dramatically once again, if the
rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful, if
deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect, and,
critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules, then I
hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February
half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers."" The PM says the weeks ahead ""will be the hardest yet"". ""But I really do believe we are entering the last phase of the struggle because with every jab that goes into our arms we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people,"" he says. ""Thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight but we know exactly how we are going to get there."" The PM addresses people across the UK, saying he knows how ""tough this is"" and how ""frustrated"" people are. But he says ""now, more than ever, we must pull together"". Mr Johnson says people should follow the new rules from now, which  will become law in the early hours of Wednesday
morning and parliament will meet remotely later that day. He says the governments of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland
share his ""conviction"" that this is a ""pivotal moment"" and were taking similar steps to contain the spread of the virus. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Once again it
is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. In England
there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid
since Christmas day. To put that
into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled. Currently around
three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease. In some
hospitals it is more than six in 10. But what is
worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to
increase. In the spring
it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak. The last six
days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the
UK â a number of these infections are next weekâs hospital admissions. It is why the
UKâs chief medical officers were warning there was a âmaterial riskâ of some
hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change. The PM repeats the advice of the UK's chief medical officers that the nation's Covid alert level should move to level 5 - ""meaning that if action is not taken, NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days"". He adds though, that there is ""one huge difference"" compared to last time, saying the UK is ""rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in its history"" and had so far ""vaccinated more people than in the rest of Europe combined"". He says the ""pace of vaccination is accelerating"" thanks to the arrival of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which patients began receiving earlier today.  The prime minister says he ""completely understands the inconvenience and distress"" the disruption to education will cause parents and pupils. But he says the government has been doing ""everything in our power to keep schools
openâ because of the importance of education to childrenâs
life chances. ""The problem is not that schools are unsafe for children,"" he says, adding that children are still very unlikely to be severely affected even by the new variant of Covid. But he says schools may act as ""vectors for transmission"", causing the virus to spread between households. The prime minister adds that given the alarming figures, it had become ""clear that we need to do more"" to bring the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant ""under control"" and help the vaccination roll-out in the UK. He says we must therefore go into a national lockdown, with the government once more telling people to stay at home, except for specific reasons, including essential shopping, to work, if you cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical help, and to escape domestic abuse. He says the government will be advising clinical extremely people to begin shielding again. Primary and secondary schools must move to remote learning from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and those of key workers, he adds. Given this, it is not ""fair"" for all exams to go ahead this summer, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall says: ""Businesses will understand why the prime minister has felt compelled to act on the spiralling threat to public health, but they will be baffled and disappointed by the fact that he did not announce additional support for affected businesses alongside these new restrictions. Jasmine Whitbread, chief executive of London First, says: ""The Government must now extend business rates and VAT relief throughout 2021 and stand ready to pump further direct support to businesses forced to close.""  Now for some more reaction to the news that schools will be moving to remote learning for most pupils under England's new lockdown measures. Dr Mary Bousted, Joint General Secretary of the National Education Union: âNo one wanted schools and colleges to be shut again but the evidence clearly pointed to the necessity for this to happen weeks ago. ""Why Boris Johnson allowed such confusion and chaos to build up around school openings before making this belated, blindingly obvious decision is beyond belief. ""Government must take responsibility for this closure because it has allowed Covid-19 to become, again, out of control.â Reality Check Boris
Johnson said that the UK has vaccinated more people than the rest of Europe
combined. As of 27
December, 944,539 people in the UK had received the first dose of the Covid-19
vaccine produced by Pfizer and BioNTech. The latest
data from 22 of the EU's 27 member states, collected by Our World in Data, shows 682,279 vaccinations have
been carried out so far. As each EU
member state publishes its own statistics, some of this data goes up to early
January but some only to late December. Germany is
leading the EU, having vaccinated 265,610 people as of 3 January. France though
had only vaccinated 516 citizens by 1 January and the Netherlands won't begin
vaccinations till 8 January. The UK
started vaccinating citizens with the Pfizer jab on 8 December, while the EU vaccine
rollout began on 27 December. Yolande KnellBBC Middle East correspondent, Jerusalem The Egyptian authorities
are denying claims that at least six Covid-19 patients died in two government
hospitals over the past two days due to a lack of oxygen. It follows anger aftera video of nurses in intensive care units struggling to keep patients alive,externalwas
widely shared on social media. At one point, a nurse in
blue PPE can be seen crumpled over on the floor in apparent shock. The voice of
the person filming repeats: âAll those in the intensive care are dead... there is
no oxygen.â In a statement on Facebook,external, Egyptâs health ministry spokesman said there were sufficient oxygen supplies at all hospitals treating Covid-19 patients. He said that most of the deaths at two hospitals in the north of the country - Al-Husseiniya and Zefta - were patients already suffering from chronic diseases. The ministry spokesman called on the media not to spread âinaccurate or false information that may cause panic among people"". In Egypt, there have been 142,187 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 7,805 deaths. However, many experts suspect the actual figures are far higher. The government has now publishedfull guidance,externalon what people are allowed to do in England under the new national lockdown. Here's a quick summary of the new rules: Cyprus and Brazil  have become the latest countries to identify the new coronavirus variant, which was first discovered in the UK. In total, more than 30 countries around the world have seen cases involving the new strain, including: Sir Keir Starmer said the most important thing is the messaging about 'stay at home' and going back to the spirit of March ""because a lot is now going to depend on the willingness of people to comply and I urge everyone to comply"". He adds: ""We have to rekindle that spirit and I think that in a way we need to remake that contract with the British people, in return for you enduring these measures now for the coming weeks the vaccine must be rolled out at speed. We need this to be mission critical. We were the first country to get the vaccine and we need to be the first country to have the vaccine programme rolled out."" Reality Check We know that the UK is going to
threat level 5, the highest level, which means there is a danger of the NHS
being overwhelmed within 21 days. When the prime minister announced
these threat levels in May he was clear that during the first lockdown the country
had only been in level four. At the time he also said:,externalâThe
higher the level, the tougher and stricter we will have to be.â So on that basis should we have expected tighter restrictions in England than we saw during the
first lockdown in March? If anything, the restrictions
appear slightly less severe. For example, support bubbles and childcare bubbles
exist this time. Also, outdoor playgrounds will be open when they were closed
last time. Communal worship is still
allowed as long as social distancing is observed. One significant change since
March is that face coverings are compulsory in indoor public settings such as
shops, public transport or places of worship. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The lockdown announcement
contained the clearest indication yet of how quickly the government hopes to
vaccinate the at risk groups. A target of mid February for
vaccinating all the over 70s and those deemed extremely clinically vulnerable and frontline health and care
staff opens up a pathway to a significant easing of restrictions by the start of
March. But it will require a rapid
acceleration in vaccination rates. So far nearly one million
people have been vaccinated. By the end of the week that
number is expected to double. The hope is that later in
January two million doses a week will be given. That will be the minimum needed
â there are around 12 million in those priority groups. By vaccinating them, there is
the potential to prevent close to nine in 10 deaths. But achieving that requires a
lot to go right. There is enough vaccine in
the country to vaccinate that many people, but not all of it has been through
the final âfill and finishâ process which involves packaging it in glass vials
(and there is a shortage of those) and then the batches have to be checked and
signed off by the regulator â a process that is taking weeks at the moment. And all of that is before it
is sent out to the NHS vaccination centres to inject it into peopleâs arms. The Labour leader say it's time for everyone to pull together. Sir Keir Starmer says: ""The situation we are in is obviously very serious, the figures are very stark and these measures are necessary, sadly, and therefore we support the packages of measures that the prime minister has just outlined. ""And I think whatever our criticisms and challenges of the government we've all got to pull together now to make this work over the next few weeks and months. ""It's going to be a very, very difficult period, there are questions about the timing of decisions etc but now is the time to support this package, pull together and try do everything we can to try and make this work."" Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent Itâs a familiar mantra but one that many hoped had been left in
the past.Stay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives.That was the key,
simple message when the first lockdown was introduced back in March. It was
well understood and big news in England when the government decided to modify
it. But now, itâs back. And, as in Tier 4, the Stay at Home message will be
legally enforceable. While saying that the new
variant means there needs to be another lockdown, the prime minister is also
trying to emphasise a hope that didnât exist before, back in March. Specifically, the vaccine. Significantly, heâs outlined an ambition that the
top four priority groups will have received their first dose by mid-February.
However, as weâve learnt so many times, caution can be the watchword when it
comes to coronavirus. But ministers do want to keep emphasising that there is
hope, amidst all the gloom. The prime minister says by the middle of February, ""if things go well"", the government expects to have
offered a first vaccine dose to everyone in the four top priority groups. This includes vaccinating all residents in a care home for
older adults and their carers, everyone over the age of 70 and all frontline health
and social care workers If we succeed in vaccinating all those groups âwe will have removed
huge numbers of people from the path of the virus"", he says. ""That will eventually enable us to lift many of the restrictions we have
endured for so long."" Johnson stresses there will remain a time lag of two to
three weeks from getting a jab to receiving immunity, and there will be a further time lag before the pressure on the NHS is lifted. ""So we
should remain cautious about the timetable ahead,"" he adds. ""But if
our understanding of the virus doesnât change dramatically once again, if the
rollout of the vaccine programme continues to be successful, if
deaths start to fall as the vaccine takes effect, and,
critically, if everyone plays their part by following the rules, then I
hope we can steadily move out of lockdown, reopening schools after the February
half term and starting, cautiously, to move regions down the tiers."" The PM says the weeks ahead ""will be the hardest yet"". ""But I really do believe we are entering the last phase of the struggle because with every jab that goes into our arms we are tilting the odds against Covid and in favour of the British people,"" he says. ""Thanks to the miracle of science, not only is the end in sight but we know exactly how we are going to get there."" The PM addresses people across the UK, saying he knows how ""tough this is"" and how ""frustrated"" people are. But he says ""now, more than ever, we must pull together"". Mr Johnson says people should follow the new rules from now, which  will become law in the early hours of Wednesday
morning and parliament will meet remotely later that day. He says the governments of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland
share his ""conviction"" that this is a ""pivotal moment"" and were taking similar steps to contain the spread of the virus. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Once again it
is the threat to the NHS that has forced the hand of ministers. In England
there has been a 50% rise in the number of patients in hospital with Covid
since Christmas day. To put that
into context, it equates to 18 hospitals being filled. Currently around
three out of 10 beds are occupied by patients with the disease. In some
hospitals it is more than six in 10. But what is
worrying ministers and NHS leaders is that the number is just going to
increase. In the spring
it took nearly three weeks after lockdown for hospital cases to peak. The last six
days have seen in excess of 50,000 new infections confirmed each day across the
UK â a number of these infections are next weekâs hospital admissions. It is why the
UKâs chief medical officers were warning there was a âmaterial riskâ of some
hospitals being overwhelmed if something did not change. The PM repeats the advice of the UK's chief medical officers that the nation's Covid alert level should move to level 5 - ""meaning that if action is not taken, NHS capacity may be overwhelmed within 21 days"". He adds though, that there is ""one huge difference"" compared to last time, saying the UK is ""rolling out the biggest vaccination programme in its history"" and had so far ""vaccinated more people than in the rest of Europe combined"". He says the ""pace of vaccination is accelerating"" thanks to the arrival of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which patients began receiving earlier today.  The prime minister says he ""completely understands the inconvenience and distress"" the disruption to education will cause parents and pupils. But he says the government has been doing ""everything in our power to keep schools
openâ because of the importance of education to childrenâs
life chances. ""The problem is not that schools are unsafe for children,"" he says, adding that children are still very unlikely to be severely affected even by the new variant of Covid. But he says schools may act as ""vectors for transmission"", causing the virus to spread between households. The prime minister adds that given the alarming figures, it had become ""clear that we need to do more"" to bring the new fast-spreading coronavirus variant ""under control"" and help the vaccination roll-out in the UK. He says we must therefore go into a national lockdown, with the government once more telling people to stay at home, except for specific reasons, including essential shopping, to work, if you cannot work from home, to exercise, to seek medical help, and to escape domestic abuse. He says the government will be advising clinical extremely people to begin shielding again. Primary and secondary schools must move to remote learning from tomorrow, except for vulnerable children and those of key workers, he adds. Given this, it is not ""fair"" for all exams to go ahead this summer, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Gerry Marsden was awarded an MBE in 2003 for services to Liverpudlian Charities. Gerry and the Pacemakers singer Gerry Marsden, whose version of You'll Never Walk Alone became a football terrace anthem for his hometown club of Liverpool, has died at the age of 78. His family said he died on Sunday after a short illness not linked to Covid-19. Marsden's band was one of the biggest success stories of the Merseybeat era, and in 1963 became the first to have their first three songs top the chart. The band's other best known hit, Ferry Cross The Mersey, came in 1964. It was written by Marsden himself as a tribute to his city, and reached number eight. Marsdenwas made an MBE in 2003,externalfor services to charity after supporting victims of the Hillsborough disaster. At the time, he said he was ""over the moon"" to have received the honour, following his support for numerous charities across Merseyside and beyond. Gerry Marsden in 2009 on the Mersey ferry, which he made famous with his song Ferry Cross The Mersey, as he received the Freedom of the City in Liverpool Marsden's daughter, Yvette Marbeck, said he went into hospital on Boxing Day after tests showed he had a serious blood infection that had travelled to his heart. Ms Marbeck told the PA news agency: ""It was a very short illness and too quick to comprehend really."" He died in hospital, Ms Marbeck said, adding: ""He was our dad, our hero, warm, funny and what you see is what you got.""

Epstein gave Marsden's group the song How Do You Do It, which had been turned down by The Beatles and Adam Faith, for their debut single.

In many interviews over the years, he explained how fate played a part in his band ever recording the song.

I was at the game and the fans started singing it. ""When it went out of the top 10 they took the song off the playlist and then for the next match the Kop were shouting 'Where's our song?' So they had to put it back on. ""Now, every time I go to the game I still get goose pimples when the song comes on and I sing my head off."" Sir Kenny Dalglish, who managed Liverpool at the time of the Hillsborough tragedy, tweeted that he was ""saddened"" by the news of Marsden's death, and that You'll Never Walk Alone was an ""integral part of Liverpool Football Club, and never more so than now"".

By BBC Radio Merseyside's Spencer Leigh Gerry was an entertainer. He loved being an entertainer; he loved people seeing him in the street and asking him for his autograph and the like. He had a very distinctive voice, and that is terribly important. You knew instantly it was him on those records. He was best on those ballads. I think he really did them very well indeed. You'll Never Walk Alone was a big show song that had been around for years and years, and lots of people had done it. Just before Gerry brought his version out, Johnny Mathis brought his out. If that version had been played on the Kop, I don't think the Kop would have taken to it because you couldn't sing along with Johnny Mathis - he had too big a range and too perfect a voice. But Gerry sounded like everyman and it was absolutely perfect for the Kop. I think it's the greatest football anthem of the lot. As well as being a Liverpool anthem, You'll Never Walk Alone has also been adopted by fans at both Celtic in Scotland and Borussia Dortmund in Germany.

"Gerry Marsden was awarded an MBE in 2003 for services to Liverpudlian Charities. Gerry and the Pacemakers singer Gerry Marsden, whose version of You'll Never Walk Alone became a football terrace anthem for his hometown club of Liverpool, has died at the age of 78. His family said he died on Sunday after a short illness not linked to Covid-19. Marsden's band was one of the biggest success stories of the Merseybeat era, and in 1963 became the first to have their first three songs top the chart. The band's other best known hit, Ferry Cross The Mersey, came in 1964. It was written by Marsden himself as a tribute to his city, and reached number eight. Marsdenwas made an MBE in 2003,externalfor services to charity after supporting victims of the Hillsborough disaster. At the time, he said he was ""over the moon"" to have received the honour, following his support for numerous charities across Merseyside and beyond. Gerry Marsden in 2009 on the Mersey ferry, which he made famous with his song Ferry Cross The Mersey, as he received the Freedom of the City in Liverpool Marsden's daughter, Yvette Marbeck, said he went into hospital on Boxing Day after tests showed he had a serious blood infection that had travelled to his heart. Ms Marbeck told the PA news agency: ""It was a very short illness and too quick to comprehend really."" He died in hospital, Ms Marbeck said, adding: ""He was our dad, our hero, warm, funny and what you see is what you got."" Liverpool FC posted on social media that Marsden's words would ""live on forever with us"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Gerry and the Pacemakers worked the same Liverpool club circuit as The Beatles in the 1960s and were signed by the Fab Four's manager Brian Epstein. Epstein gave Marsden's group the song How Do You Do It, which had been turned down by The Beatles and Adam Faith, for their debut single. Sir Paul McCartney described Gerry and the Pacemakers as The Beatles's ""biggest rivals"" on the Merseyside scene. ""I'll always remember you with a smile,"" Sir Paul said in his tribute to Marsden.

And the other surviving Beatle, Sir Ringo Starr, sent ""peace and love"" to Marsden's family ina tribute on Twitter.,external While Marsden was a songwriter as well as a singer, his most enduring hit was actually a cover of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical number from 1945, which he had to convince his bandmates to record as their third single. In many interviews over the years, he explained how fate played a part in his band ever recording the song. He was watching a Laurel and Hardy movie at Liverpool's Odeon cinema in the early 1960s and, only because it was raining, he decided to stay for the second part of a double feature. Photos celebrate Liverpool's black music scene How The Beatles still grip Liverpool Beatles venue Cavern Club in 'fight for survival' That turned out to be the film Carousel - which featured that song on its soundtrack - and Marsden was so moved by the lyrics that he became determined that it should become part of his band's repertoire. Gerry Marsden performing in 1964 In a 2013 interview, Marsden told theLiverpool FC website,externalhow You'll Never Walk Alone was adopted by the club's fans as soon as it topped the chart in 1963: ""I remember being at Anfield and before every kick off they used to play the top 10 from number 10 to number one, and so You'll Never Walk Alone was played before the match. I was at the game and the fans started singing it. ""When it went out of the top 10 they took the song off the playlist and then for the next match the Kop were shouting 'Where's our song?' So they had to put it back on. ""Now, every time I go to the game I still get goose pimples when the song comes on and I sing my head off."" Sir Kenny Dalglish, who managed Liverpool at the time of the Hillsborough tragedy, tweeted that he was ""saddened"" by the news of Marsden's death, and that You'll Never Walk Alone was an ""integral part of Liverpool Football Club, and never more so than now"". Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram posted a tribute on Twitter, saying he was ""devastated"" by the news. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By BBC Radio Merseyside's Spencer Leigh Gerry was an entertainer. He loved being an entertainer; he loved people seeing him in the street and asking him for his autograph and the like. He had a very distinctive voice, and that is terribly important. You knew instantly it was him on those records. He was best on those ballads. I think he really did them very well indeed. You'll Never Walk Alone was a big show song that had been around for years and years, and lots of people had done it. Just before Gerry brought his version out, Johnny Mathis brought his out. If that version had been played on the Kop, I don't think the Kop would have taken to it because you couldn't sing along with Johnny Mathis - he had too big a range and too perfect a voice. But Gerry sounded like everyman and it was absolutely perfect for the Kop. I think it's the greatest football anthem of the lot. As well as being a Liverpool anthem, You'll Never Walk Alone has also been adopted by fans at both Celtic in Scotland and Borussia Dortmund in Germany. Marsden's career began at legendary live music venue, The Cavern Club, where The Pacemakers played nearly 200 times. The club said on Twitter that Marsden was ""not only a legend, but also a very good friend of The Cavern"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The Scottish cabinet will meet later to consider further measures to help tackle coronavirus, as 2,464 new cases are reported. The Scottish Parliament will then be recalled for First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to make an ""urgent statement"". Ms Sturgeon said the ""rapid increase in Covid cases driven by the new variant"" was of ""very serious concern"". ""We are in a race between this faster spreading strain of Covid and the vaccination programme,"" she tweeted. She warned on Friday that the next few weeks could be the most dangerous period for Scotland since March in the fight against Covid. Covid restrictions 'could continue' as cases rise New strain 'accelerating' spread of Covid Hospitals across UK 'must prepare for Covid surge' The latest government figures for coronavirus cases showed that 15.2% of Saturday's 17,328 tests were positive. It is higher than the 2,137 cases reported on Friday, but still lower than Thursday's 2,539 positive results. Figures for hospital admissions and deaths over the holiday weekend will not be published until Tuesday. The cabinet is likely to consider a further delay to the return of Scottish schools and restrictions that are closer to the stay-at-home lockdown in March. ""All decisions just now are tough, with tough impacts,"" Ms Sturgeon wrote on twitter. ""Vaccines give us way out, but this new strain makes the period between now and then the most dangerous since start of pandemic."" The Scottish government's emergency resilience committee heard on Saturday that ""quick and decisive action is needed"" as the new variant of the virus is becoming the dominant one in Scotland. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The even steeper rises and severe pressure on the NHS that is being experienced in some other parts of the UK is a sign of what may lie ahead in Scotland if we do not take all possible steps now to slow the spread of the virus, while the vaccination programme progresses. ""The strong message remains - people should stay at home as much as possible and avoid non-essential interaction with others."" This is just the fifth time the Scottish Parliament has been recalled and the second time within the last week. This video can not be played Prof Linda Bauld says Scots should be prepared a longer period living with level four restrictions Public health expert Prof Linda Bauld, from the University of Edinburgh, has said Scotland should be prepared for Covid restrictions to be extended as infection rates continue to rise. She said there were no signs yet that the infection rate was levelling off, having risen suddenly from a daily rate of fewer than 1,000 to more than 2,000 per day in recent days. She told BBC Scotland: ""It definitely is a fragile situation and you can see that we have more cases than we would expect at the current time. ""We may be starting to see some of the impacts of the Christmas mixing, but also we know around four in 10 cases, from recent data, are of the new variant. ""I would imagine that the new variant is playing a role in these higher rates of infection and if these numbers continue to sit at where they are we are going to have more people in hospital in a week or two's time, and that is very worrying."" The new year offers new hope in the struggle against coronavirus with two vaccines now authorised for UK use - but it looks as if the situation will get worse before it gets better. Ministers are worried by the rapid spread of the new strain of coronavirus during a holiday period when the highest level of restrictions are already in place. They think more needs to be done to suppress the virus, to give the vaccination programme a chance to accelerate and give increasing numbers of people protection. When the Scottish cabinet meets they are likely to consider tightening the current restrictions to something closer to the stay at home lockdown of March 2020. That will almost certainly mean a further delay to the return of schools into February. Ministers will take decisions on Monday morning with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon expected to make a statement at Holyrood in the afternoon. Daily confirmed cases in Scotlandreached record highs on the last three days of 2020, rising to to 2,622 on Thursday. Ms Sturgeon warned last week there might be changes to the plans for reopening schools. Children start online learning from 11 January and are set to return to class by 18 January. The education recovery group will meet on Monday. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the situation was ""deteriorating and fast-moving"" but any decision to extend school closures should be clearly explained to parents and teachers. He said: ""We have been here before so if schools remain closed, the Scottish government must show that it has learned from past mistakes in order to minimise disruption to education."" Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the Scottish government should prioritise teachers and school staff as vaccines were rolled out. He added: ""We must be honest and accept that most pupils, teachers and support staff cannot go back to schools until the situation is brought under control."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard called for ministers to publish the evidence behind all of its decisions to ensure public consent and compliance. ""What is clear is that we need to see an acceleration of the vaccine rollout and a step-change in testing,"" he said. ""It is also clear that financial support from government has simply not been nearly sufficient to make up for the damage that lockdown measures have done to jobs, livelihoods and businesses. The SNP government must distribute additional funds to the frontline now."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""With tighter restrictions on movement and in schools comes a greater responsibility on the government to show its workings. ""If we are to restrict people's movement then we need to see what the benefit will be. We need an exit plan to give people hope, as well as to show them what is required to ease the restrictions on our freedoms."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"The Queen's 95th birthday will be commemorated on one of five new coins released this year, the Royal Mint has announced. The 2021 British coin collection will also mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of novelist Sir Walter Scott, and the 75th anniversary of the death of author HG Wells. The release of a Â£5 coin is typically reserved for significant royal events. In April the Queen will become the first UK monarch to reach 95. The new Â£5 coin depicts the royal cypher ""EIIR"", above the words ""my heart and my devotion"", a nod to part of her 1957 Christmas broadcast, which was the first to be televised. David Bowie coin launched high above Earth Royal Mint celebrates its history with new coin BAME people set to feature on British money During that speech, the Queen told the nation: ""In the old days the monarch led his soldiers on the battlefield and his leadership at all times was close and personal. ""Today things are very different. I cannot lead you into battle, I do not give you laws or administer justice, but I can do something else, I can give you my heart and my devotion to these old islands and to all the peoples of our brotherhood of nations."" The anniversary of the birth of Sir Walter Scott, who wrote the novels Waverley, Rob Roy and Ivanhoe and is considered one of Scotland's most famous figures, will be celebrated with a Â£2 coin. The 75th anniversary of the death of science fiction author HG Wells, who penned works such as The Time Machine and The War Of The Worlds, will also be marked on a Â£2 coin, with a depiction of images from his novels. The 50th anniversary of decimalisation, when Britain's modern coins came into force, will be featured on a 50p coin. The 75th anniversary of the death of the inventor John Logie Baird, famous for his early prototypes of the television, will be commemorated on another new 50p coin. As the Queen's head already appears on one side of all coins in circulation, these five coins will each offer a different depiction from the various stages of her reign. Clare Maclennan, of the consumer division at the Royal Mint, said this year's commemorative coins marked ""some of the biggest anniversaries in 2021"", with each coin ""a miniature work of art"" designed as ""a treasured keepsake or gift"".

"The UK completed its separation from the European Union (EU) on New Year's Eve at 23:00 GMT New year celebrations mean border crossings have been quiet so far Monday marks the first day ports and the Channel Tunnel will deal with large numbers under the new rules Markets are also expected to react as trade gets under way The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, by a margin of 52% to 48% Georgina Pattinson That's where we will leave our coverage of the first working day after post-Brexit rules came into force. Of course some new rules and regulations will be phased in - including checks for supermarkets moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. And on fishing - that key sticking point in the negotiations - the new terms of trade will be brought in gradually over a transition period of five-and-a-half years. So there will be more Brexit news in the months to come. In the meantime, thank you for joining us this morning. Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent Orange and green lanes for entry into France and the EU on the road at Eurotunnel terminal in Coquelles, near Calais, France ""Delays or disruptions have certainly not manifested themselves on the European side in Calais so far. ""So far, so good is the message we are getting. ""It is worth stressing a lot of businesses got a lot of their goods through in the final weeks of last year and many companies are taking a wait and see approach to the new borders, trying to see if queues do build up. ""In terms of the full impact of our relationship with Brexit, it is going to be weeks, months even years before we see the impact of how things have changed."" Manufacturers in the eurozone ended 2020 on a high, with activity increasing at its fastest rate since mid-2018, according to a survey. IHS Markit, which gathered the data, said production continued to rise while goods manufacturers reported âstrong optimismâ. Germany was the main driving force as factories in the country have mostly remained open throughout coronavirus-related lockdowns. IHS Markitâs final Manufacturing Purchasing Managersâ Index (PMI) rose to 55.2 in December from Novemberâs 53.8, although that was below the initial 55.5 âflashâ estimate. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, and December was the highest since May 2018. ""While robust expansions were also seen in the Netherlands and Ireland, these in part reflected a temporary spike in UK demand prior to the end of the Brexit transition period,"" said Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business economist. Lorries arrive at the port of Dover in Britain on New Year's Day BBC correspondent Simon Jones has been in Dover this morning. ""Today is set to be the first real test of the new system post-Brexit,"" he says. ""Any lorry driver has to have the right custom declarations - they also have to have a negative coronavirus test if they are heading to France. ""Traffic has been pretty quiet and things have been running fairly smoothly. ""Ferry company DFDS told me that in first two days of this year, 13,000 lorries ran through the port - that was half the number we saw in the same period last year. ""On a busy day you can get 10,000 lorries passing through a port. ""As traffic begins to increase in the coming weeks that is when we could see problems."" The UK-EU trade agreement, which contains new rules for living, working and trading together, took effect from 23:00 GMT on 31 December. The full complicated agreement is more than 1,200 pages long and covers issues such as fishing, travel and the future governance of disputes. But what are the key points on trade?  Read more on the deal here. Writing in The Sunday Telegraph,,externalHome Secretary Priti Patel said the UK will be a safer country to live in now it has left the EU. She argued that leaving the EU would enable the UK to ban foreign criminals who have served more than a year in jail from entering the UK. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former head of the Metropolitan Police Sir Ian Blair disagreed with the home secretary arguing that Brexit would make the UK ""less safe"". He said the UK had lost powers including use of the European Arrest Warrant and access to the ""Europe-wide real-time interrogatable databases"". ""What the home secretary has been doing is concentrating on illegal immigration, forgetting the real practical issues police officers face in their cars."" Lorries board a ferry at the Port of Larne in Northern Ireland As part of a hard-won peace deal between Ireland and the UK, both governments agreed that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland should be practically invisible - no cameras, no border posts. Post Brexit, Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules, meaning that lorries can continue to drive across the border without having to be inspected. Instead, there will be a new ""regulatory"" border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). So from 1 January some food products arriving in Northern Ireland from
GB have been checked to ensure they meet EU
standards. However, in order to reduce any potential disruption and give time for traders to adapt, supermarkets will be given an
initial three-month ""grace period"" where the
rules will not be enforced on the food they bring into Northern Ireland. You can read about this in more detail here. The FTSE 100 index of shares in London has seen a âsprightly startâ on the first
full day of trading of 2021. The blue-chip index is currently up 1.73%, or 111.77 points,
at 6,572.29 The wider FTSE 250 index is up 0.98%, or 199.83 points, at
20,688.13. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at Interactive Investor,
said: âThe UK marketâs first opportunity to react to the Brexit deal has led to
a sprightly start to the New Year. âThe move builds on a rally of around 16% since the
beginning of November, although the spike was not enough to prevent an overall
decline of 14.3% during 2020. âThe finer implications of the UKâs exit remain to be seen,
but the fact that a deal was agreed prior to the deadline removes some of the
overhang which had been haunting the index for some time.â Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr show how ""ordinary voters"" in a place such as Leigh in Greater Manchester (which voted Conservative in the 2019 election) would benefit from Brexit. Here's one example the prime minister gave... ""They've already got substantial amounts of money coming back into this country, as a result of leaving the EU"" We're not sure which money he's referring to here (we asked the government, but it did not clarify this). The UK was making its regular contributions to the EU budget until the end of 2020 (as the two sides were still in a transition period), so the amount saved since will not be huge. Also, the UK isstill paying moneyto the EU as part of the divorce bill. TheOffice for Budget Responsibility expects,externalthat the UK will be contributing about Â£7.1bn this year, down from last year's contribution of Â£8.2bn. That's an average saving of about Â£3m a day this year - so Â£9m so far. Read more here. BBC's economics editor looks back at the history of the UK in the EU Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Nearly half a century of the UK's membership of the European Union and its predecessor organisations ended in January - but what has ended now is the UK's economic membership of the bloc. The creation of the single market served the UK's economic interests, as it grew the home domestic market available for British exporters without tariff or non-tariff barriers, eventually to nearly half a billion Europeans. Read more from Faisal Islam here. There were months of increasingly tense negotiations between the UK and the EU last year. For a while it looked like there wouldn't be a deal between the two sides at all, with disagreements on access to fishing waters and level playing field rules threatening to scupper the talks. It was on Christmas Eve that Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced an agreement had been reached. (You can read about what is in the deal here.) Parliament still needed to approve the deal - and on 30 December, MPs and Lords return (in some cases via video link) to Westminster. The bill which implemented the deal in law was backed in the House of Commons by 521 to 73 votes on Wednesday - with the Conservatives and Labour voting in favour. This meant that at 23:00 GMT on 31 December, the UK stopped following EU rules and replacement arrangements for travel, trade, immigration and security co-operation came into force. In light of Brexit,UK ministers are preparing a Â£100m ($137m) package,externalto rebuild Britain's fishing fleet. The financial package is being set up to allow crews to expand their fleets as the EUrelinquishes some of its fishing quotas over the next five-and-a-half years. It will also be used to bolster the fish processing industry to help with the increasing number of catches. A senior government sourcetold The Times,externalthat the idea of a fund had been discussed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak. âWe took the view that the fishing fleet needed to be rebuilt to take advantage of the new access,â the source said. âWe needed to invest a lot more into it if we were actually going to be able to catch the fish that we will be entitled to,"" they added. BBC Radio 5 LiveWake Up to Money One of the big objectives of the Brexit negotiations was
to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. As
a result, Northern Ireland has remained in the EU single market for goods and
will apply EU customs rules at its ports. So what does that mean for businesses? Declan Billington is the boss of John Thompson and Sons,
Northern Ireland's largest animal feed processor, which employs nearly 200
people. He told BBC 5Liveâs Wake Up to Money that he feels as though
the firm is âhalf in and half outâ of the single market. âAll of the rules that apply to Europe will apply to
moving goods to Northern Ireland. But then, thereâs a whole suite of exemptions
that we also have to get on top of to figure out how to move things from
England. âWeâre very much
finding our feetâ¦ In the meantime, you just avoid buying things from the places
that could create problems, you build stock and weâll be testing goods
movements slowly and carefully.â Tim McDonaldBBC Business European shares are expected to be a mixed bag when the region's exchanges open for the first session of the year. London's FTSE is expected to edge higher after closing out its worst year since 2008, while Germany's DAX will be little changed and France and Italy's indexes will be slightly lower, according to IG. Brexit could force the biggest transfer of share trading in more than two
decades, as the EU tries to shift to more euro-denominated trading within the bloc and to reduce its reliance on the City of London for financial services.

The first lorries to cross the sea borderarrived into Belfast and Larne on Friday. There has been at least one teething problem so far. Some vehicles carrying food products did not have the right documentsand faced a long wait in the new border control posts as that was sorted out. The amount of freight moving through the ports should start to increase from Monday as business picks up after the Christmas break. Haulage firms say that one of their main concerns is that firms in Great Britain which are sending goods to Northern Ireland will not be fully prepared for the required new processes and paperwork. If you have been following Brexit negotiations over the last year, you will have heard a lot about level playing fields. Simply put, it's a trade-policy term for a set of common rules and standards that prevent businesses in one country from gaining a competitive advantage over those operating in other countries. Chris Morris from BBC Reality Check has looked atwhat has been decided on the level playing field between the UK and the EUand how it will all work moving forward. From family holiday plans to traveling with pets, BBC readers have been getting in touch with questions on how the UK's new relationship with the EU will impact them. You canread some of their questions and ask your own here. This video can not be played Arlene Foster: Brexit is a 'gateway of opportunity' Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has said there ""is a gateway of opportunity"" for the UK and Northern Ireland after Brexit. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the trade deal also tackled ""some of the great difficulties that there are with the (Northern Ireland) Protocol"". The purpose ofthe Protocolis to prevent a hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and by having Northern Ireland apply EU customs rules at its ports. As a result, an'Irish Sea border'now exists, with most commercial goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain requiring a customs declaration. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which Mrs Foster leads, opposed the protocol and had criticised the establishment of such a border. She told The Andrew Marr show that her party ""didn't want the protocol but it is here"". ""I have to mitigate against that and my job from now on is to mitigate against those excesses and to hold the government to account,"" Mrs Foster added. Read more here. Jay SavageBBC News, Sydney Sydney has been preoccupied with containing a recent Covid outbreak, though infections remain low While Australian interest in Brexit was initially very high, issues closer to home - including the devastating bushfires of 2020-21 and the pandemic - have meant this interest has somewhat waned over the past year. But for political, economic and historical reasons, Australia does maintain a stake in the ongoing Brexit developments. Australian nationals, especially those under 30, have long enjoyed access to temporary residence visas in the UK. As such, some Australians fear that Britain's departure from the EU will mean that free travel within Europe for Australians living or working in the UK will be compromised. A broader fear is that Australiaâs own trade relationship with Europe could suffer. But, with Covid travel bans and other concerns, these anxieties are not hugely resonating at present. The UK's trade representatives have been scrambling to replace about 40 trade deals it was automatically a party to under the EU, and to potentially negotiate some others. The UK has negotiated replacement agreements for60 of the 70 countriescovered under those 40 EU agreements, but analysts say more are needed to fuel economic growth. ""That growth is going to come from Asia, primarily,"" Angela Mancini from the consultancy Control Risks told the BBC. She said the UK might also consider a separate deal with Australia, or even consider joining the eleven member pacific trade pact known as the CPTPP. But there are two agreements that could be even more significant. ""The big ones to look at though will be India and China because those are not yet on the dock,"" she said.   Â© 2025 BBC.

"Experts have raised concerns over India's emergency approval of a locally-produced coronavirus vaccine before the completion of trials. On Sunday, Delhi approved the vaccine - known as Covaxin - as well as the global AstraZeneca Oxford jab, which is also being manufactured in India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi touted the approval as a ""game changer"". The head of Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, defended the approval process, but health experts warn it was rushed. Health watchdogAll India Drug Action Network said it was ""shocked"",external. It said that there were ""intense concerns arising from the absence of the efficacy data"" as well a lack of transparency that would ""raise more questions than answers and likely will not reinforce faith in our scientific decision making bodies"". The statement came after India's Drugs Controller General, VG Somani, insisted Covaxin was ""safe and provides a robust immune response"". He added the vaccines had been approved for restricted use in ""public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains"". ""The vaccines are 100% safe,"" he said, adding that side effects such as ""mild fever, pain and allergy are common for every vaccine"". How do you vaccinate a billion people? How a 'warm vaccine' could help India tackle Covid The All India Drug Action Network, however, said it was ""baffled to understand the scientific logic"" to approve ""an incompletely studied vaccine"". One of India's most eminent medical experts, Dr Gagandeep Kang,told the Times of India newspaper,externalthat she had ""not seen anything like this before"". She added that ""there is absolutely no efficacy data that has been presented or published"". Even social media users were quick to point out that approving the vaccine before trials were complete was a matter of concern irrespective of how safe or effective the vaccine eventually turned out to be.

But Krishna Ella, chairman of Bharat Biotech, met reporters on Monday and said the approval of Covaxin had not been rushed. He cited previous examples where emergency authorisation approvals had been given based only on immunogenicity data. ""Under Indian laws we can get emergency approval for the vaccine based on fulfilling five parameters after Phase 2 trails. That is what has happened with our vaccine. So it is not a premature approval,"" he said. ""We will complete the Phase 3 trials soon and provide the efficacy data for the vaccine by February."" The company currently has 20 million doses available and plans to produce about 700 million doses this year, Dr Ella said. ""We have four facilities coming up and we are planning [to make] around 200 million doses in Hyderabad, 500 million doses in other cities."" Vikas Pandey, BBC News, Delhi Many scientists and opposition politicians have raised questions over what they say is the hasty authorisation of Covaxin. Bharat Biotech has developed the vaccine with the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research - and the effort has been touted as an example of India's might in vaccine development and production. Regulators say the vaccine is safe and effective. The firm says phase 1 and phase 2 trials have shown good results. But scientists say that the government's decision not to release data on the vaccine's efficacy for peer review has raised concerns. Mr Modi has welcomed the approval, saying Covaxin is a shining example of his ambitious Atmnirbhar (self-reliance) India campaign. But experts worry that questions over the approval process don't bode well for the campaign. And there could be deeper issues. Many believe that the government needs to be more transparent about the authorisation process because the success of the Covid-19 vaccine programme depends on public trust. The emergency authorisation also sparked a fierce debate on Indian Twitter on Sunday night between ministers and opposition leaders. India's health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan called out opposition leaders for failing to ""applaud"" the country's ""prowess""  in locally producing a vaccine. India makes about 60% of vaccines globally. Members of the main opposition Congress party, Shashi Tharoor and Jairam Ramesh, and former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, Akhilesh Yadav, were among those who raised concerns about the manner in which Covaxin was approved.

The approval comes as India gears up to vaccinate its population of more than 1.3 billon people. Amid fears that richer countries are buying up much of the vaccine supply, India too appears to be stockpiling vaccines. In aninterview with the Associated Press,external, Adar Poonawalla, whose Serum Institute of India (SII) is manufacturing the  AstraZeneca Oxford vaccine, said the jab was given emergency authorisation on the condition that it would not be exported outside India. Mr Poonawalla said his company, the world's largest vaccine maker, was also not allowed to sell the shot in the private market. This has raised concerns in India's neighbouring countries, including Nepal and Bangladesh, which were primarily depending on the SII to start vaccinating their populations. Bangladesh had already ordered 30 million doses of the vaccine in the first phase,Reuters reported,external, but now the fate of the order is unclear. The country's health secretary told local media in December that it expected thefirst batch of the jab by February,external. India plans to vaccinate some 300 million people on a priority list by August. It has recorded the second-highest number of infections in the world, with more than 10.3 million confirmed cases to date. Nearly 150,000 people have died.

"US casino giant MGM Resorts has made an $11bn (Â£8.1bn) offer for British gaming company Entain, which owns Ladbrokes. The move is the latest attempt by a casino operator to move into the online gambling business. In addition to its chain of High Street betting shops, UK-based Entain also owns a number of online sports betting and gambling sites. Entain confirmed the offer, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, but said the price was too low. It had recently rebuffed an earlier $10bn (Â£7.3bn) all-cash approach from MGM, the newspaper said. In a statement,external, Entain said the latest bid approach ""significantly undervalues the company and its prospects"". MGM Resorts, which runs the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas, now has until the beginning of next month to decide whether to make a formal bid or to walk away. FTSE 100-listed Entain. which renamed itself from GVC Holdings last month, describes itself as ""one of the world's largest sports betting and gaming groups operating in the online and retail sector"". Along with Ladbrokes, it also owns brands such as Bwin, Partypoker, Coral, Eurobet, Gala and Foxy Bingo. Government to review sports betting laws Caesars owner strikes Â£2.9bn William Hill deal World's biggest gambling hub reopens for business After news of the latest offer for the firm, investors started betting on Entain, pushing its share price up by more than 25% to Â£14.30 a share - above MGM's offer of roughly Â£13.83 a share - a sign that market watchers are expecting a higher bid. If the two firms do reach an agreement, it would follow another deal in September when MGM rival Caesars Entertainment agreed to buy UK-based William Hill for $3.7bn (Â£2.9bn). ""Following Caesar's offer for William Hill last year, a bid by MGM for Ladbroke's owner Entain isn't exactly a surprise,"" said Nicholas Hyett an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""The two are working together to take advantage of the recent legalisation of sports betting in the US, a market worth many billions of dollars a year."" Predictions about the stockmarket have a habit of making the person trying to guess the future look foolish. No such problem for Laura Foll, a fund manager at the investment firm Janus Henderson. On the Today programme on Monday, she forecast more takeover offers for household names in Britain, noting that the UK markets remained unloved by investors and so - perhaps - undervalued. An hour after the prediction a big offer duly landed, with Entain, the London-listed company that owns Ladbrokes and other gambling brands, saying it had received a takeover proposal from MGM Resorts, an American rival. The US company is offering to pay shareholders in Entain not in cash, but in new MGM shares - an obvious move given the sky-high rating of US shares compared to those listed in London. It looks a carbon copy of last year's deal where Caesars, best known for its Las Vegas properties, bought another venerable name in British bookmaking, William Hill. Get ready for more acquisitive foreign companies looking for deals in bargain basement London. The new bid for Entain comes with financial backing from MGM's largest shareholder, InterActiveCorp (IAC), which took a 12% stake in MGM Resorts last August. At the time, IAC's chief executive Barry Diller said it planned to work with MGM to expand its online gambling portfolio. The attempted acquisition comes as the casino industry faces headwinds from the Covid-19 pandemic. Bricks-and-mortar casino operators have struggled under travel restrictions. The economy of Asian casino hub Macau shrank 49% in the first quarter of this year, while unemployment in Las Vegas reached 30% earlier in the year and remains well above the US average. MGM Resorts, which is the operator of the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas, laid off 18,000 furloughed employees in the US in August. Many online gambling companies, by contrast, saw a boost during Covid-19 restrictions, prompting many casino owners to pivot their businesses towards online.

"This video can not be played Olly Stephens was pronounced dead in Bugs Bottom fields in Emmer Green, Reading Four boys and a girl have been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder after a 13-year-old boy was stabbed to death in Reading. Oliver Stephens, known as Olly, was pronounced dead at Bugs Bottom fields, Emmer Green, on Sunday. The five teenagers, all aged 13 or 14, remain in custody, according to Thames Valley Police. Det Supt Kevin Brown said: ""Our thoughts remain with Olly's family at this incredibly difficult time."" He added: ""This is a tragic and shocking incident which has resulted in the death of a young boy."" The victim's family are being supported by specially trained officers. Floral tributes to Olly have been left outside Highdown School Highdown School and Sixth Form Centre said it was ""reeling from the tragic news"". In a statement, head teacher Rachel Cave said: ""This student was part of our community and many students and staff knew him well. ""For a life to be ended at such a young age is a total tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family."" The school, in Emmer Green, said it was arranging counselling support for students and setting up an electronic book of condolence. Thames Valley Police said a ""considerable police presence"" would be in place in the area for several days Officers were called just before 16:00 GMT on Sunday following reports of an attack. Officers are appealing for anyone who was in the area between 15:00 and 16:30 who might have taken photos or camera footage to contact them if they notice anything suspicious. Det Supt Brown said he believed there would have been witnesses to the ""dreadful incident"" as the area is popular with dog walkers. A man said his wife was walking their dog through the park on Sunday afternoon when she saw a boy on the ground with several people around him trying to give him first aid. Another dog walker said she saw a group of young people standing in the woods in Bugs Bottom fields at about 15:30 and described it as ""slightly unusual"". Reading East MP Matt Rodda has offered his ""deepest condolences"" to the boy's family. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The UK completed its separation from the European Union (EU) on New Year's Eve at 23:00 GMT New year celebrations mean border crossings have been quiet so far Monday marks the first day ports and the Channel Tunnel will deal with large numbers under the new rules Markets are also expected to react as trade gets under way The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, by a margin of 52% to 48% Georgina Pattinson That's where we will leave our coverage of the first working day after post-Brexit rules came into force. Of course some new rules and regulations will be phased in - including checks for supermarkets moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. And on fishing - that key sticking point in the negotiations - the new terms of trade will be brought in gradually over a transition period of five-and-a-half years. So there will be more Brexit news in the months to come. In the meantime, thank you for joining us this morning. Nick BeakeBrussels Corrspondent Orange and green lanes for entry into France and the EU on the road at Eurotunnel terminal in Coquelles, near Calais, France ""Delays or disruptions have certainly not manifested themselves on the European side in Calais so far. ""So far, so good is the message we are getting. ""It is worth stressing a lot of businesses got a lot of their goods through in the final weeks of last year and many companies are taking a wait and see approach to the new borders, trying to see if queues do build up. ""In terms of the full impact of our relationship with Brexit, it is going to be weeks, months even years before we see the impact of how things have changed."" Manufacturers in the eurozone ended 2020 on a high, with activity increasing at its fastest rate since mid-2018, according to a survey. IHS Markit, which gathered the data, said production continued to rise while goods manufacturers reported âstrong optimismâ. Germany was the main driving force as factories in the country have mostly remained open throughout coronavirus-related lockdowns. IHS Markitâs final Manufacturing Purchasing Managersâ Index (PMI) rose to 55.2 in December from Novemberâs 53.8, although that was below the initial 55.5 âflashâ estimate. Any reading above 50 indicates growth, and December was the highest since May 2018. ""While robust expansions were also seen in the Netherlands and Ireland, these in part reflected a temporary spike in UK demand prior to the end of the Brexit transition period,"" said Chris Williamson, IHS Markit's chief business economist. Lorries arrive at the port of Dover in Britain on New Year's Day BBC correspondent Simon Jones has been in Dover this morning. ""Today is set to be the first real test of the new system post-Brexit,"" he says. ""Any lorry driver has to have the right custom declarations - they also have to have a negative coronavirus test if they are heading to France. ""Traffic has been pretty quiet and things have been running fairly smoothly. ""Ferry company DFDS told me that in first two days of this year, 13,000 lorries ran through the port - that was half the number we saw in the same period last year. ""On a busy day you can get 10,000 lorries passing through a port. ""As traffic begins to increase in the coming weeks that is when we could see problems."" The UK-EU trade agreement, which contains new rules for living, working and trading together, took effect from 23:00 GMT on 31 December. The full complicated agreement is more than 1,200 pages long and covers issues such as fishing, travel and the future governance of disputes. But what are the key points on trade?  Read more on the deal here. Writing in The Sunday Telegraph,,externalHome Secretary Priti Patel said the UK will be a safer country to live in now it has left the EU. She argued that leaving the EU would enable the UK to ban foreign criminals who have served more than a year in jail from entering the UK. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former head of the Metropolitan Police Sir Ian Blair disagreed with the home secretary arguing that Brexit would make the UK ""less safe"". He said the UK had lost powers including use of the European Arrest Warrant and access to the ""Europe-wide real-time interrogatable databases"". ""What the home secretary has been doing is concentrating on illegal immigration, forgetting the real practical issues police officers face in their cars."" Lorries board a ferry at the Port of Larne in Northern Ireland As part of a hard-won peace deal between Ireland and the UK, both governments agreed that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland should be practically invisible - no cameras, no border posts. Post Brexit, Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules, meaning that lorries can continue to drive across the border without having to be inspected. Instead, there will be a new ""regulatory"" border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). So from 1 January some food products arriving in Northern Ireland from
GB have been checked to ensure they meet EU
standards. However, in order to reduce any potential disruption and give time for traders to adapt, supermarkets will be given an
initial three-month ""grace period"" where the
rules will not be enforced on the food they bring into Northern Ireland. You can read about this in more detail here. The FTSE 100 index of shares in London has seen a âsprightly startâ on the first
full day of trading of 2021. The blue-chip index is currently up 1.73%, or 111.77 points,
at 6,572.29 The wider FTSE 250 index is up 0.98%, or 199.83 points, at
20,688.13. Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at Interactive Investor,
said: âThe UK marketâs first opportunity to react to the Brexit deal has led to
a sprightly start to the New Year. âThe move builds on a rally of around 16% since the
beginning of November, although the spike was not enough to prevent an overall
decline of 14.3% during 2020. âThe finer implications of the UKâs exit remain to be seen,
but the fact that a deal was agreed prior to the deadline removes some of the
overhang which had been haunting the index for some time.â Reality Check Boris Johnson was asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr show how ""ordinary voters"" in a place such as Leigh in Greater Manchester (which voted Conservative in the 2019 election) would benefit from Brexit. Here's one example the prime minister gave... ""They've already got substantial amounts of money coming back into this country, as a result of leaving the EU"" We're not sure which money he's referring to here (we asked the government, but it did not clarify this). The UK was making its regular contributions to the EU budget until the end of 2020 (as the two sides were still in a transition period), so the amount saved since will not be huge. Also, the UK isstill paying moneyto the EU as part of the divorce bill. TheOffice for Budget Responsibility expects,externalthat the UK will be contributing about Â£7.1bn this year, down from last year's contribution of Â£8.2bn. That's an average saving of about Â£3m a day this year - so Â£9m so far. Read more here. BBC's economics editor looks back at the history of the UK in the EU Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor Nearly half a century of the UK's membership of the European Union and its predecessor organisations ended in January - but what has ended now is the UK's economic membership of the bloc. The creation of the single market served the UK's economic interests, as it grew the home domestic market available for British exporters without tariff or non-tariff barriers, eventually to nearly half a billion Europeans. Read more from Faisal Islam here. There were months of increasingly tense negotiations between the UK and the EU last year. For a while it looked like there wouldn't be a deal between the two sides at all, with disagreements on access to fishing waters and level playing field rules threatening to scupper the talks. It was on Christmas Eve that Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced an agreement had been reached. (You can read about what is in the deal here.) Parliament still needed to approve the deal - and on 30 December, MPs and Lords return (in some cases via video link) to Westminster. The bill which implemented the deal in law was backed in the House of Commons by 521 to 73 votes on Wednesday - with the Conservatives and Labour voting in favour. This meant that at 23:00 GMT on 31 December, the UK stopped following EU rules and replacement arrangements for travel, trade, immigration and security co-operation came into force. In light of Brexit,UK ministers are preparing a Â£100m ($137m) package,externalto rebuild Britain's fishing fleet. The financial package is being set up to allow crews to expand their fleets as the EUrelinquishes some of its fishing quotas over the next five-and-a-half years. It will also be used to bolster the fish processing industry to help with the increasing number of catches. A senior government sourcetold The Times,externalthat the idea of a fund had been discussed by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak. âWe took the view that the fishing fleet needed to be rebuilt to take advantage of the new access,â the source said. âWe needed to invest a lot more into it if we were actually going to be able to catch the fish that we will be entitled to,"" they added. BBC Radio 5 LiveWake Up to Money One of the big objectives of the Brexit negotiations was
to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland. As
a result, Northern Ireland has remained in the EU single market for goods and
will apply EU customs rules at its ports. So what does that mean for businesses? Declan Billington is the boss of John Thompson and Sons,
Northern Ireland's largest animal feed processor, which employs nearly 200
people. He told BBC 5Liveâs Wake Up to Money that he feels as though
the firm is âhalf in and half outâ of the single market. âAll of the rules that apply to Europe will apply to
moving goods to Northern Ireland. But then, thereâs a whole suite of exemptions
that we also have to get on top of to figure out how to move things from
England. âWeâre very much
finding our feetâ¦ In the meantime, you just avoid buying things from the places
that could create problems, you build stock and weâll be testing goods
movements slowly and carefully.â Tim McDonaldBBC Business European shares are expected to be a mixed bag when the region's exchanges open for the first session of the year. London's FTSE is expected to edge higher after closing out its worst year since 2008, while Germany's DAX will be little changed and France and Italy's indexes will be slightly lower, according to IG. Brexit could force the biggest transfer of share trading in more than two
decades, as the EU tries to shift to more euro-denominated trading within the bloc and to reduce its reliance on the City of London for financial services.

This video can not be played Arlene Foster: Brexit is a 'gateway of opportunity' Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster has said there ""is a gateway of opportunity"" for the UK and Northern Ireland after Brexit. She told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that the trade deal also tackled ""some of the great difficulties that there are with the (Northern Ireland) Protocol"". The purpose ofthe Protocolis to prevent a hardening of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and by having Northern Ireland apply EU customs rules at its ports. As a result, an'Irish Sea border'now exists, with most commercial goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain requiring a customs declaration. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), which Mrs Foster leads, opposed the protocol and had criticised the establishment of such a border. She told The Andrew Marr show that her party ""didn't want the protocol but it is here"". ""I have to mitigate against that and my job from now on is to mitigate against those excesses and to hold the government to account,"" Mrs Foster added. Read more here. Jay SavageBBC News, Sydney Sydney has been preoccupied with containing a recent Covid outbreak, though infections remain low While Australian interest in Brexit was initially very high, issues closer to home - including the devastating bushfires of 2020-21 and the pandemic - have meant this interest has somewhat waned over the past year. But for political, economic and historical reasons, Australia does maintain a stake in the ongoing Brexit developments. Australian nationals, especially those under 30, have long enjoyed access to temporary residence visas in the UK. As such, some Australians fear that Britain's departure from the EU will mean that free travel within Europe for Australians living or working in the UK will be compromised. A broader fear is that Australiaâs own trade relationship with Europe could suffer. But, with Covid travel bans and other concerns, these anxieties are not hugely resonating at present. The UK's trade representatives have been scrambling to replace about 40 trade deals it was automatically a party to under the EU, and to potentially negotiate some others. The UK has negotiated replacement agreements for60 of the 70 countriescovered under those 40 EU agreements, but analysts say more are needed to fuel economic growth. ""That growth is going to come from Asia, primarily,"" Angela Mancini from the consultancy Control Risks told the BBC. She said the UK might also consider a separate deal with Australia, or even consider joining the eleven member pacific trade pact known as the CPTPP. But there are two agreements that could be even more significant. ""The big ones to look at though will be India and China because those are not yet on the dock,"" she said.   Â© 2025 BBC.

"Security has been stepped up in Niger's TillabÃ©ri region, where the two villages are situated Niger's prime minister says 100 people are now known to have been killed in Saturday's attacks by suspected jihadists on two villages. Brigi Rafini said 70 people were killed in the village of Tchombangou and 30 others in Zaroumdareye - both near Niger's border with Mali. It was one of the deadliest days in living memory, as Niger grapples with ethnic violence and Islamist militancy. No group has said it carried out the attacks. According to local mayor Almou Hassane, those responsible travelled on ""about 100 motorcycles,"" AFP news agency reports. They split into two groups and carried out the attacks simultaneously. How West Africa is under threat from Islamist militants Africa's Sahel becomes latest al-Qaeda-IS battleground Former minister Issoufou Issaka told AFP that jihadists launched the assaults after villagers killed two of their group members, though this hasn't been officially confirmed. Mayor Hassane said 75 other villagers were left wounded in the aftermath, and some have been evacuated for treatment in Ouallam and the capital, Niamey. Prime Minister Rafini visited both of the villages on Sunday. ""This situation is simply horrible... but investigations will be conducted so that this crime does not go unpunished,"" he told reporters. Niger's TillabÃ©ri region lies within the so-called tri-border area between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso, which has been plagued by jihadist attacks for many years. Niger's Prime Minister Brigi Rafini visited the two villages on Sunday Last month, seven Nigerien soldiers were killed in an ambush in the region. Areas of Niger are also facing repeated attacks by jihadists from neighbouring Nigeria, where the government is fighting an insurgency by Boko Haram. As part of efforts to quell the violence, France has been leading a coalition of West African and European allies against Islamist militants in the Sahel. Coalition forces have become targets, and last week five French soldiers were killed in two separate incidents in Mali. The latest attacks in TillabÃ©ri also come amid national elections in Niger, as President Mahamadou Issoufou steps down after two five-year terms. Election officials announced provisional results on Saturday, showing a lead for Mohamed Bazoum - a former minister and a member of Niger's ruling party. A second round of votes is expected to be held on 21 February, once ballots have been validated by the country's constitutional court.

"Candles burned for those who have died in the landslide at Ask Seven bodies have now been found in the search for the missing after a massive landslide that destroyed homes in Norway last week, police have said. Four bodies were discovered on Friday and Saturday, and another three on Sunday. The first victim to be found was named as Eirik GrÃ¸nole, 31. Several people remain missing following the hillside collapse that sent mud into the village of Ask on Wednesday. Rescuers are working to find survivors, but chances of this are fading. Police said the latest body was recovered near where two others had been found, but they gave no further details. Five of the victims have been identified, including a 40-year-old man and his two-year-old daughter. Another 10 people were injured. The king and queen of Norway visited the site of the landslide on Sunday. Queen Sonja and King Harald lit candles in Gjerdrum Church in memory of the victims ""I'm having trouble finding something to say, because it's absolutely horrible,"" King Harald said after the visit. ""This terrible event impacts us all. I sympathise with you who are beginning the new year with sadness and uncertainty,"" he said. A shortage of daylight in the Norwegian winter has proved one of the challenges at the scene in Gjerdrum municipality, 25km (15 miles) north-east of Oslo. Rescuers are also contending with freezing temperatures and the clay ground proving too unstable for emergency workers to walk on. Helicopters and drones spent two days searching the area before Police Commander Roy Alkvist said one or two houses appeared safe to enter. Rescuers began moving into the danger zone on Styrofoam boards; the bright orange boards were laid down on the mud in a domino-effect as rescuers tried to reach the wrecked homes. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the scale of the landslide Residents of Ask began calling emergency services at around 04:00 local time on Wednesday telling them that their houses were moving, police said. ""There were two massive tremors that lasted for a long while and I assumed it was snow being cleared or something like that,"" Oeystein Gjerdrum, 68, told broadcaster NRK. ""Then the power suddenly went out, and a neighbour came to the door and said we needed to evacuate, so I woke up my three grandchildren and told them to get dressed quickly."" More than 30 homes were destroyed, with others teetering on the edges of the deep crater that was left by the landslide. At least 1,000 residents were evacuated from the area. The landslide was a so-called ""quick clay slide"" measuring about 300m by 700m (985ft by 2,300ft), a spokeswoman for the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate (NVE) told AFP. Quick clay is a kind of clay found in Norway and Sweden that can collapse and behave as a fluid when it comes under stress. Broadcaster NRK said heavy rainfall may have made the soil unstable, but questions have since emerged over why construction was permitted in the area. A 2005 geological survey labelled the area as at high risk of landslides, according to a report seen by the broadcaster TV2. Despite this, the homes were built there three years later.

"Ralph Evans receiving the Oxford vaccine in Merthyr Tydfil It has been described as a ""momentous day"" in the fight against Covid-19 as the rollout of the second Covid vaccine begins in Wales. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the start of theOxford-AstraZeneca vaccineprogramme was ""a key milestone"" in the fight against Covid. The Welsh Government said 40,000 doses will be available within the first two weeks - with 22,000 jabs this week. More than 35,000 people in Wales have had aPfizer-BioNTechvaccine dose. The number of mass vaccination centres in Wales will be increased to 22 and more than 60 GP surgeries will offer the Oxford vaccine - mobile units will also be set up throughout Wales. This video can not be played Derek Games says he was ""shocked"" to get a phone call asking him to go to the surgery for the jab. One of the first people to receive the vaccine on Monday was Ralph Evans, 88, who was vaccinated at the Pontcae medical practice in Merthyr Tydfil. He was one of eight people there to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. Mr Evans said he was ""very grateful"" to be getting it. He was followed by 86-year-old Derek Games, former mayor of Merthyr, who said: ""I'm delighted, I'm very privileged to have it."" The medical centre hopes to vaccinate 1,000 people by the end of January after being contacted on New Year's Eve about starting vaccinations. ""We received a hundred vaccines at lunchtime today,"" practice manager Kevin Rogers said. ""We hope to get through the hundred this week."" Mr Rogers said they would be asking staff to work additional hours on weekends to help reach the target of 1,000 people over the coming weeks. This video can not be played Cases have fallen below England's but the new variant is spreading fast, Wales' health minister says Q&A: When will I get the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Medics complain of 'bureaucracy' in vaccine effort Army to be deployed in Wales for vaccine rollout The Welsh Government's priority is to vaccinate front-line health and social care staff, care home residents and staff, and people over 80. Plaid Cymru said ""serious questions"" remained about the roll-out plans, while a professor in palliative medicine said she was concerned ""at the very slow apparent roll out"" for those aged over 85. Mari Lloyd Williams, from the University of Liverpool, said ""huge numbers have self-shielded since March"". ""Apart from intense loneliness this leads to loss of confidence and reduction in both physical and mental and cognitive well-being, meaning that some may need to enter full time care sooner,"" she said. ""We need to be vaccinating 24/7 in order to get this under control and to protect our most vulnerable."" The Pfizer vaccine has to be kept at -70C, but the Oxford jab can be stored at standard fridge temperatures so can be administered in doctors surgeries, pharmacies and care homes. Dialysis patient Brian Pinker, 82, wasthe first person to receive the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19vaccine in Oxford. ""It is an absolutely momentous day,"" said Dr Gillian Richardson, who is leading the Covid vaccination programme in Wales. ""The vaccine has been prioritised for those groups where it has been harder to reach with the Pfizer vaccine - so we're prioritising the over 80s and care home staff and residents."" Ms Richardson said the pace of the rollout ""will be governed by supply"" and ""will start slowly this week but build vastly over the coming weeks and months."" Both vaccines require two doses to be administered with an interval of between four and 12 weeks - achange from the previous advice of four weeksbetween jabs. The change has been ""very controversial"", according to one GP who will administer the Oxford vaccine, but she agrees with the decision. ""The evidence suggests that a longer time period between first dose and second booster gives you better immunity,"" said Dr Rowena Christmas, a Monmouthshire GP whose surgery is part of the rollout pilot. ""The key thing is we need to protect people. If we gave 1,000 second doses of the Pfizer vaccine next week then that's 1,000 people who won't get the first protection. Wales' health minister said Covid case rates were falling during the country's lockdown ""As soon as you have the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, within about 10 days you've got 70% protection from coronavirus. ""But if you are in the 30% that does catch it, you're much less likely to get severely ill and much less likely to go to hospital. ""We are in a crisis situation and we have to protect as many people as we possibly can."" This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine matters Wales is under""stay at home"" lockdown restrictionsafter a rise in Covid-19 cases - with more than 31,000 cases in Wales in the two weeks over the Christmas period. There are almost 2,700 people with coronavirus symptoms in Welsh hospitals - with ""more than half"" of the 208 critical care patients having Covid. But Mr Gething said Wales' overall Covid incidence rate had fallen from a high of 636 cases per 100,000 people before the lockdown started to446 cases on Monday. Wales had the highest Covid case rate in the UK before Christmas with nine out of the top 10 of the UK's most infected counties in Wales. Latest available data shows England's Covid case rate has risen above Wales for the first time in about a month - with Gwynedd having the lowest infection rate in the UK. ""Cases of the virus remain very high"" although rates had fallen back from the incredibly high levels from just before Christmas,"" said Mr Gething. The British Medical Association in Wales said there wasconcern among staffthat a 12-week gap between doses could lead to ""sacrificing some immunity"" because trials had involved a shorter gap. But First Minister Mark Drakeford said the longer time between doses and the rollout of a second jab would see the pace of vaccinations increase. ""By the end of the month we will be doing in a day what we've been able to do in a week prior to Christmas, maybe more than that,"" he said. Unlike the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is stored at normal vaccine fridge temperatures so will have fewer storage and transport issues, making it much easier to use in care homes and GP surgeries. This video can not be played Brian Pinker, 82, is given the Oxford vaccine at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford ""This is a game changer in the fight against Covid, it's absolutely huge,"" Dr Christmas, principal GP at the Wye Valley Practice,told BBC Radio Wales. ""We need this vaccine because it's easy to give. We can now all get involved and start this rollout of this crucial vaccination programme."" The Welsh Government said every health board in Wales will receive its allocation in proportion to the size of its priority population and ability to deliver. Residents in Wales vaccinated by health board, to 27 December 5,487Aneurin Bevan 4,604Betsi Cadwaladr 5,706Cardiff & Vale 4,789Cwm Taf Morgannwg 5,276 + 3,250Hywel Dda and Powys 5,285Swansea Bay But it warned the effects of the vaccines may not be seen nationally for many months and the advice remained to keep contacts with others to a minimum, keep a two-metre distance from others, wash hands regularly, wear a face covering where required and avoid touching surfaces others have touched. People have also been asked not to phone their GP, pharmacy or hospital to ask when they will get a vaccine and wait for a letter which ""will provide people with a measure of assurance"" and will explain how they will be contacted. Mr Gething said: ""Today marks a key milestone in our fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. ""Its approval will help us to speed up our vaccination programme and run more clinics closer to people's homes"". While Plaid Cymru are ""pleased"" with the second vaccine rollout, health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""Wales has been behind every other UK nation in terms of numbers vaccinated and there's far too much variation from region to region - Welsh Government must not allow a postcode lottery."" The Welsh Conservatives previouslycriticised the speed of the first vaccine rollout,saying hope had ""dropped away"" for many over 80 who were ""desperately waiting for their appointment"". The rollout of the new vaccine will be another injection of hope at a time when it's so desperately needed. At least 22,000 doses will be available in Wales this week followed at least another 20,000 next week. The hope is then to ramp up its distribution as supplies arrive, so that around 1.5 million people in Wales at greatest risk of getting really ill from Covid, for example older people or those who have long term health conditions,  can get a jab within the next few months. Because it can be stored for much longer in a normal fridge, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is easier to deliver in places like GP surgeries and care homes than the other Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was a ""pivotal moment"" in the UK's fight against the virus, as vaccines will help curb infections and then allow restrictions to be lifted. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Mondaythere was ""no question we will have to take tougher measures"", which will be announced in ""due course"", as the UK struggles to control a new, fast-spreading variant of the virus.

PM: 'No question' tougher Covid measures will happen Six hospital trusts - in Oxford, London, Sussex, Lancashire and Warwickshire - have begun administering the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, with 530,000 doses ready for use. Most other available doses will be sent to hundreds of GP-led services and care homes across the UK later in the week, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Mr Pinker, who has been having dialysis for kidney disease at the Churchill Hospital for a number of years, said he was ""really proud"" the vaccine was developed in Oxford. ""The nurses, doctors and staff today have all been brilliant and I can now really look forward to celebrating my 48th wedding anniversary with my wife Shirley later this year,"" he said. Father-of-three Trevor Cowlett, 88, also received the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine Music teacher and father-of-three Trevor Cowlett, 88, and Prof Andrew Pollard, a paediatrician working at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and lead investigator of the Oxford vaccine trial, were also among the first to be vaccinated. Chief nurse Ms Foster, who administered the first dose, told the BBC it was a ""huge privilege"", saying: ""Every single patient that we have vaccinated over the last couple of weeks have got their own personal stories to the difference it's going to make, so it is no different this morning."" Speaking during a visit to London's Chase Farm Hospital, to meet some of the first people to receive the Oxford vaccine, the prime minister said there were ""tough, tough"" weeks to come. There will now be a ""massive ramp-up"" in vaccination numbers ""in the weeks ahead"", Mr Johnson said, and the number of vaccine doses will amount to ""tens of millions by the end of March"". Asked when the government will be able to vaccinate two million people a week, Mr Johnson said the government will give more details ""in the next few days... as soon as we have better numbers to give"". Mr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the Oxford vaccine rollout was a ""pivotal moment"" in the fight against coronavirus, saying: ""It's going to be a tough few weeks ahead, but this is the way out."" Asked about reports potential volunteerswere being deterred by the additional training and forms, Mr Hancock said they were going to ""reduce the amount of bureaucracy"". ""For instance there's one of the training programmes about how to tackle terrorism, I don't think that's necessary, we're going to stop that,"" he said. However, he said this was not delaying the delivery of the vaccine, adding that the next delivery of the vaccine will be ""early this week"" to be ""deployed next week"". England's chief medical officer Chris Whitty said the vaccines ""give us a route out in the medium term"" but warned the NHS was ""under considerable and rising pressure in the short term"". Former health secretary and Conservative chairman of the Commons' health committee Jeremy Hunttweeted,externalthat it was ""time to act"" and the government needed to close schools and borders, ban all household mixing and impose a 12-week national lockdown in England.

Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth agreed that a national lockdown was needed, as well as ""rapidly scaled-up vaccine distribution"". This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'This way can save more lives' As the recent rise in Covid cases puts increased pressure on the NHS, the UK has accelerated its vaccination rollout by planning to give both doses of the vaccine 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between jabs. The UK's chief medical officers have defended the delay to second doses, saying getting more people vaccinated with the first jab ""is much more preferable"". Make no mistake, the UK is in a race against time. That much is clear from the decision to delay the second dose of the vaccine to focus on giving as many people as possible their first doses. So how fast can the NHS go? Ultimately it wants to get to two million doses a week. That will not be achieved this week. But Monday marks the start of the NHS putting the accelerator to the floor. A rapid increase in the vaccination rate should follow. But how quickly the UK can go is dependent on several complex processes. First, the vaccine has to be manufactured, then it has to be put into vials and packaged up (known as fill and finish). After that each batch has to be checked and certified before being sent to NHS vaccination sites where there needs to be enough vaccinators and support staff to ensure those doses are given as quickly as possible. Problems at any one stage can disrupt how quickly the vaccination programme can be rolled out. While there are millions of doses of each vaccine in the country and a total of 140 million of both vaccines pre-ordered, there are currently just over one million - around 500,000 of each - ready to be given this week. NHS medical director Professor Stephen Powis said: ""The NHS' biggest vaccination programme in history is off to a strong start, thanks to the tremendous efforts of NHS staff who have already delivered more than one million jabs."" He said the Oxford vaccine rollout was ""chalking up another world first that will protect thousands more over the coming weeks"". The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first jab approved in the UK, and more than a million people have had their first one. The first person to get the jabon 8 December, Margaret Keenan, has already had her second dose. This video can not be played Dr Nikita Kanani, NHS England's medical director for primary care, says it's crucial to get more patients the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine The Oxford jab -which was approved for use in late December- can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, making it easier to distribute and store than the Pfizer jab. It is also cheaper per dose. The UK has secured 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, enough for most of the population. Care home residents and staff, people aged over 80, and frontline NHS staff will be first to receive it. GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GPs and local vaccination services have been asked to ensure every care home resident in their local area is vaccinated by the end of January, the Department of Health and Social Care said. Some 730 vaccination sites have already been established across the UK, with the total set to surpass 1,000 later this week, the department added.

"The Queen's 95th birthday will be commemorated on one of five new coins released this year, the Royal Mint has announced. The 2021 British coin collection will also mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of novelist Sir Walter Scott, and the 75th anniversary of the death of author HG Wells. The release of a Â£5 coin is typically reserved for significant royal events. In April the Queen will become the first UK monarch to reach 95. The new Â£5 coin depicts the royal cypher ""EIIR"", above the words ""my heart and my devotion"", a nod to part of her 1957 Christmas broadcast, which was the first to be televised. David Bowie coin launched high above Earth Royal Mint celebrates its history with new coin BAME people set to feature on British money During that speech, the Queen told the nation: ""In the old days the monarch led his soldiers on the battlefield and his leadership at all times was close and personal. ""Today things are very different. I cannot lead you into battle, I do not give you laws or administer justice, but I can do something else, I can give you my heart and my devotion to these old islands and to all the peoples of our brotherhood of nations."" The anniversary of the birth of Sir Walter Scott, who wrote the novels Waverley, Rob Roy and Ivanhoe and is considered one of Scotland's most famous figures, will be celebrated with a Â£2 coin. The 75th anniversary of the death of science fiction author HG Wells, who penned works such as The Time Machine and The War Of The Worlds, will also be marked on a Â£2 coin, with a depiction of images from his novels. The 50th anniversary of decimalisation, when Britain's modern coins came into force, will be featured on a 50p coin. The 75th anniversary of the death of the inventor John Logie Baird, famous for his early prototypes of the television, will be commemorated on another new 50p coin. As the Queen's head already appears on one side of all coins in circulation, these five coins will each offer a different depiction from the various stages of her reign. Clare Maclennan, of the consumer division at the Royal Mint, said this year's commemorative coins marked ""some of the biggest anniversaries in 2021"", with each coin ""a miniature work of art"" designed as ""a treasured keepsake or gift"". The commemorative set will be available to purchase from the Royal Mint website.
