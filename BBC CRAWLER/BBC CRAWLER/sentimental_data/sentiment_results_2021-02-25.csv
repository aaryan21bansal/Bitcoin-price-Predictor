"Labour's support for keeping the UK's nuclear weapons is ""non-negotiable,"" the shadow defence secretary has said. But in a speech, John Healey also promised to ""lead efforts to secure multilateral disarmament"" if the party wins power. Labour dropped its policy of unilaterally getting rid of the UK's nuclear weapons after then-leader Neil Kinnock lost the 1987 general election. Many on the party's left remain vehemently opposed to that decision. Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - a long-time opponent of the UK's Trident submarine-based missile system and a vice president of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) - said in 2015 that he would never use it if he became prime minister. Yet maintaining nuclear weapons remained a pledge in the party's 2019 election manifesto. Labour's troubles with the bomb PM launches review to 'overhaul' foreign policy MPs vote to renew Trident weapons system Trident and the replacement debate In a speech to the Royal United Services Institute think tank, Mr Healey emphasised that the party leadership under Sir Keir Starmer is far clearer in its backing of this than Mr Corbyn was. ""Labour's support for the UK's nuclear deterrent is non-negotiable. The matter is settled,"" he said. He added that Labour wanted to see the UK ""doing more to lead efforts to secure strategic arms limitation and multilateral disarmament"". Mr Healey also said the party's commitment to the NATO military alliance - which Mr Corbyn said in 2012 should be disbanded, but later argued should focus on reducing ""tensions around the world"" - is  ""unshakeable"". This isn't a change in policy, but it's a distinct change in tone. Labour wants to make sure it gets a serious hearing on defence. It knows that it needs its own position to be clear to be able to most effectively challenge the government's decisions (which is particularly important with the Integrated Review due soon). That means definitively answering some of the questions which have been raised over recent years, especially around NATO and nuclear weapons. Keeping Britain's nuclear weapons system has always been a divisive issue within Labour, but it is party policy. That didn't change under Jeremy Corbyn, but his lifelong personal opposition to nuclear weapons - and his statement in 2015 that he would never use them - allowed Labour's commitment to be questioned. Stating that it is ""non-negotiable"" ends that speculation, although it is unlikely to go down well with everyone in the party. The government launched itsIntegrated Review,externallast year, looking at the UK's long-term foreign policy and defence priorities. Mr Healey said the review should ""refocus our defence efforts on where the threats are, not where the business opportunities might be"". He also called for the review - which ministers have promised this month - to be published now, to end ""confusion and speculation"" about its contents. He added that unless the review confirmed a reduction in potential threats to the UK, it would be ""very hard to accept the case for reducing the strength of our full-time forces"". And he also urged the government to ""set a higher bar"" when deciding to buy military equipment from abroad. Margaret Thatcher's government purchased the Trident system Responding to Mr Healey's speech, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament accused Labour's leadership of being ""stuck in a 20th Century rut"". Its general secretary Kate Hudson said the UK today was facing ""new and different threats,"" including climate change, pandemics, artificial intelligence and cyber warfare. ""This is where investment urgently needs to go, not on massively expensive nuclear weapons,"" she added. ""Labour has to stop pandering to an old agenda and give the people the sensible, forward-looking thinking that today's reality demands."" The government has promised an increase in spending on defence of 2.6% above the rate of inflation between 2019/20 and 2020/21. It expects the overall figure to rise to Â£41.5bn during this time. Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government first acquired Trident - using submarines to carry up to eight missiles each - in the early 1980s, replacing the previous Polaris system. Opponents say the maintenance and update costs - running into billions of pounds - are excessive and that the deterrent effect of such weapons is questionable, and that is not truly independent as it relies on US technology. But supporters argue that there is no alternative, and that Russia and China already have nuclear missiles, with several others attempting to develop them. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has described Trident as ""vital"" to protecting the UK.

"Online booking platform Airbnb has said it is preparing for a ""significant"" travel rebound as the world emerges from coronavirus lockdowns. However the company said it was still ""too early"" to predict how the business would fare this year. The company's revenue dropped 30% last year to $3.4bn (Â£2.4bn), as Covid-19 restrictions kept many from travelling. That was better than many other travel companies, as people took to their cars for longer stays in private homes. The firm said it has already seen a smaller decline in travel this year than in the last three months of 2020, when revenue was down 22% year-on-year at $859m. That was better than many analysts had expected,given the resurgence of Covid cases and fresh lockdown restrictions in many areas. ""Travel is coming back and we are laser-focused on preparing for the travel rebound,"" its chief executive Brian Chesky said. Investors mob Airbnb listing giving it $100bn value Airbnb cuts 25% of staff amid travel downturn Mr Chesky said he expected new travel preferences to emerge from the pandemic that will benefit his company. He said the firm is optimistic that staying in private homes will appeal to people travelling to see family and friends. Remote working patterns will also allow people to take more frequent weekend trips - or even spend several months away from home, he suggested. ""We'veÂ seen a number of new use cases,"" he said. ""We don't think we're ever going to go back to travel in 2019. It's going to change and it's going to be different."" However, Airbnb also warned that it still had ""limited visibility for growth trends in 2021 given the difficulty in determining the pace of vaccine rollouts and the related impact on willingness to travel"". ""We are not providing an outlook for the rest of 2021 at this time,"" it said in its first financial update for investors since its public listing in December. Airbnb, which is active in more than 220 countries, said people around the world are travelling more domestically during the pandemic - but not enough to make up for the loss of business from international tourism. Airbnb was founded by Nathan Blecharczyk, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia when they were in their 20s Its business in Europe, which is fuelled by cross-border travel, was the hardest hit region in 2020, especially the UK, Germany and Italy. North America was the most stable. Overall the firm lost $4.6bn last year, including $3.9bn in the last three months of the year, when it was hit with high costs connected with its stock market debut. A recent survey conducted for the company in the US found that more than half of about 1,000 respondents had already booked or were planning to travel this year. On a call with analysts, the firm faced some questions about its relationships with hosts, which has been strained this year partly due to financial losses suffered after cancellations. But Angelo Zino, an equity analyst at CFRA, said he expected revenue to come ""roaring back"" as vaccines become widely distributed in the US and Europe by the summer, ""reflecting the enormous amount of pent-up demand in the ecosystem"". ""We believe Airbnb's business model and growth opportunities are highly attractive and struggle to find a better way to play the travel space,"" he said.

"Michael Gove should apologise to children who lost support from collapsed charity Kids Company, its founder Camila Batmanghelidjh has said.

In the run-up to its collapse, the charity was spending around Â£20m a year, up to a quarter of which came from the government. A plan to restructure the organisation's finances had been agreed with David Cameron's government, but it was wound up after the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into sexual assault allegations, following the broadcast of a report on BBC Two's Newsnight.

A year earlier, Kids Company had also been investigated bythe National Audit Office,externalandthe House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts,external.

She also explained why she felt the charity was wrongly tarnished, suggesting it had been subject to a ""smear campaign"". ""I think there were two targets,"" she said. ""One is, I believe, David Cameron, because he was seen to have chosen us as Big Society [Mr Cameron's initiative to fund voluntary projects] and I think the Brexit team wanted to discredit him.

"Sarah McDonald says the assault has been a 'wake-up call' about runners' safety An athlete who competes for Great Britain says she has been left in a ""state of shock"" after being assaulted at a canalside while training for the Olympics. Middle-distance runner Sarah McDonald had her backside grabbed by a man on a moped while warming up in Birmingham. The 27-year-old said she had received an ""overwhelming response"" to sharing the experience on social media. She added she would be reporting the matter to police. Ms McDonald, who has represented her country at World and European Championships level, was out with a training partner when the assault occurred on Wednesday. She said in preparation for the 1,500m at theTokyo Olympics, she had been using a quiet stretch of canal to train ""most days"" during lockdowns. ""I think it's quite common to have things shouted at you and catcalls, but I didn't think twice about those,"" she told the BBC. But things took a turn shortly after her training partner shouted to ""watch out for a bike"". Ms McDonald said: ""I stepped to the left. I wasn't even looking, but the [moped] slowed down and the man on the back grabbed my bum before zooming off into the distance."" She added: ""If I'd gone to the right-hand-side, I hate to think - they might have pushed me into the canal."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the plan for teachers to grade results in England is the ""right way forward"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended plans for teachers to grade GCSE and A-level pupils in England this summer as a ""good compromise"". It follows confirmation thatschools rather than an algorithm will determine grades this summer. The PM said the process will be ""fair"" and ""durable"", adding that he had confidence in the education secretary. But education select committee chairman Robert Halfon asked how ministers would prevent a ""Wild West of grading"". The story of the big U-turn of the summer 'Has all my work gone down the drain?' Gavin Williamson: How has he survived? With GCSEs and A-levels cancelled because of the pandemic, schools will determine grades using a combination of mock exams, coursework and essays, exam regulator Ofqual said on Thursday. There will be optional assessments set by exam boards for all subjects, but they will not be taken in exam conditions nor decide final grades. Results will be published earlier in August to allow time to appeal. A-level results day will be 10 August, with GCSE results given out on 12 August. But concerns have been raised that the measures will result in grade inflation. On a visit to Accrington Academy in Lancashire earlier, Mr Johnson said exams would have continued normally in an ""ideal world"". ""But I think this is as good a compromise as we can come to. ""I think it will be fair, I think it will be durable and it's the right way forward."" Asked if he had confidence in Education Secretary Gavin Williamson amid speculation he will be moved out of the position in an upcoming reshuffle, Mr Johnson said: ""Of course."" Last summer, thousands of A-level students had their results downgraded from school estimates by a controversial algorithm, beforeOfqual announced a U-turn which allowed them to use teachers' predictions instead. Mr Halfon said school-assessed grades were the ""least worst option that the government has come up with"" but it risked ""baking a rock cake of grade inflation into the system"". ""So will (Gavin Williamson) confirm what is the government's plan to ensure we will not have a wild west of grading, that these grades will be meaningful to employers so as not to damage children's life chances and when?"" Mr Williamson said grade inflation was an ""important issue"" but it was being addressed through internal and external checks, and exam boards would be able to ""root out malpractice"".

"Talks over the future of Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port car plant have been ""productive but not conclusive"", the car plant's owner said. Stellantis has been in talks with the government for weeks about the site, which employs more than 1,000 people. It is thought Stellantis is seeking financial incentives to make a fully electric car at the factory. There are fears Stellantis, formed from the merger of France's PSA Group and Fiat-Chrysler, may close the factory. Stellantis bosses have also voiced concern about the UK's decision to bring forward a ban on new petrol and diesel cars. Michael Lohscheller, who heads the parent group's Vauxhall unit, said it expects an ""eventual binding commitment by the UK government in the near future and will act accordingly. ""In the meanwhile, no investment decision will be made,"" he said. Speculation over the future of the plant, which makes the Astra car, has been mounting since the merger of PSA and Fiat-Chrysler created a new automotive superpower. Future of Ellesmere Port hangs in the balance Crunch talks to save Ellesmere Port plant continue Stellantis has been reviewing its options for plants worldwide. It has yet to decide if a new generation of a hatchback model will be produced there. Vauxhall confirmed on Thursday that talks on ""different scenarios for Ellesmere Port"" were ongoing with UK authorities ""at both national and local levels"". Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has been involved in discussions with Stellantis, which have been ongoing for several weeks. The BBC understands thatthree options on the table for the plant include: Continued production of internal combustion engine-powered cars - with the possible addition of the new hatchback model - for the short-term until the ban on sales of new petrol and diesel vehicles in 2030. Making plans to wind down production at Ellesmere Port completely. Securing the plant's long-term future by committing to making a new generation of electric cars in the North West. Stellantis boss Carlos Tavares recently referred to the ""brutal"" decisionfor the UK government to bring forward the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030 and said it might make more sense to move future electric production closer to its biggest market in the European Union (EU). Shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said: ""The Ellesmere Port plant is a major employer and winding it down would have devastating consequences, with 1,000 highly skilled jobs lost from the local community. ""To support our automotive manufacturing industry and boost its competitiveness, Labour has called for ambitious investment in electric vehicle technology, including the electric battery supply chain, through a Â£30bn green economic recovery. This investment would mean manufacturers have the long-term confidence they need to build new electric models in the UK."" A government spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring the UK continues to be one of the best locations in the world for automotive manufacturing, and we're doing all we can to protect and create jobs, while securing a competitive future for theâ¯sector.""

"Princess Shamsa fled her father's estate in the summer of 2000 but was forcibly returned to Dubai months later Princess Latifa, the captive daughter of Dubai's ruler, has appealed to UK police to re-investigate the kidnap of her older sister from a Cambridge street more than 20 years ago. In a letter shared with the BBC, Latifa tells Cambridgeshire police this could help free Princess Shamsa, who was captured on the orders of their father. Shamsa, who was just 18 then and is now 39, has not been seen in public since. The government of Dubai has not responded to BBC requests for comment. A High Court judge ruled in 2019, that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum had abducted both daughters and held them against their will. Last week BBC Panorama broadcastshocking videos Latifa had secretly recorded on a phone she had been given, in which she described how she was being held ""hostage"" by her father following a failed escape attempt in 2018. The UN has since asked the United Arab Emirates for proof that Latifa is alive. But almost two decades earlier, an attempt by her older sister to flee the family also ended in capture and imprisonment. In August 2000, around two months after escaping from her father's Longcross Estate in Surrey, Shamsa was forcibly taken from Cambridge, flown by helicopter to France and then by private jet back to Dubai. Latifa's handwritten letter, which was passed to the Cambridgeshire force by her friends on Wednesday, urges action for her sister by British authorities. It was written in 2019 while she was being held in solitary confinement in a ""jail villa"". ""All I ask of you"", writes Latifa, ""is to please give attention on her case because it could get her her freedom... your help and attention on her case could free her."" She adds: ""She has strong links to Englandâ¦ she really loves England, all of her fondest memories are of her time there."" This video can not be played Videos show Dubai's Princess Latifa in ""villa jail"" Latifa dated the letter February 2018, before her escape attempt, to avoid revealing that she had a way of communicating with the outside world from captivity. It paints a chilling picture of her sister's fate after she was returned to Dubai. ""She was kept incommunicado with no release date, trial or charge. She was tortured by getting her feet caned..."" Cambridgeshire police first launched a kidnap investigation in 2001 after Shamsa made contact via an immigration lawyer. But the investigation eventually hit a dead end when officers were blocked from going to Dubai. It later emerged that aides acting for the sheikh had made representations to the Foreign Office around the time of the investigation. Police reviewed the investigation in 2018, and BBC News can now reveal that one investigator acknowledged there were ""significant sensitivities"" with the case. A further review was launched after the High Court judgment was published in 2020. In a statement to BBC News, Cambridgeshire Police said it had received Latifa's letter, which ""will be looked at as part of the ongoing review"". The statement added: ""This is a very complex and serious matter and as such there are details of the case that it would be inappropriate to discuss publicly."" The Foreign Office, which has previously faced questions over its response in the wake of representations from a powerful state ally, told the BBC this was a private matter between two individuals and it had no role in the investigation by Cambridgeshire Constabulary or its outcome. They also declined to comment on contact from the sheikh's office regarding the case. After the footage of Princess Latifa emerged, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the footage was ""deeply troubling"" and that the UK would ""watch very closely developments on that front"". Timeline: Failed escapes of sheikh's daughters Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum: Who is Dubai's ruler? Latifa: The princess who vanished In 2018, the Dubai Royal Court told the BBC that Shamsa was ""adored and cherished"". The sheikh's only statement on the case has been to the High Court, and speaks of ""relief"" at having found his ""vulnerable"" daughter Shamsa after she went missing. Shamsa's story prefigured what happened to Latifa 18 years later and played a key role in her decision to seek a new life abroad. It led directly to her failed escape on a boat in the Indian Ocean. In a video posted to YouTube before her attempt to escape in 2018 Latifa describes what happened to her sister and its severe repercussions. BBC News has also spoken to someone who had regular contact with Shamsa in Dubai: ""You didn't need to be a doctor to know that [she] was tranquilised all the time."" Princess Shamsa had grown up partly in the UK and had been given a Western education. There are few pictures of Princess Shamsa, who was partly brought up in the UK ""Shamsa wasn't what you would call a 'Princess'"", according to her cousin Marcus Essabri, who lived with the family in Dubai for two years and was close to her. ""She was cheeky. Full of life and adventure."" ""She wanted to make a difference for women, in the Arab world especially. She wanted to push the boundariesâ¦ this is when the problems started,"" Mr Essabri said. Shamsa wrote to Mr Essabri from London in September 1999, nine months before her escape. Her father, then Crown Prince of Dubai, was not letting her pursue her studies and go to university. ""I'm not allowed to continue. You know that he didn't even ask me what I was interested in. He just said no."" She confided in her cousin that she was thinking of running away. Longcross Estate, Surrey ""The one thing that scares me is imagining myself old and regretting not trying when I was 18. Try what? I don't know. Just taking that chance"". Then in summer 2000, she took it. She drove a black Range Rover to the edge of the sheikh's sprawling Â£75m estate at Longcross in Surrey and slipped away. The sheikh deployed a team of agents to secretly track her down. On 19 August 2000, a man took Shamsa to Cambridge, where they checked into the University Arms Hotel. Unbeknownst to her, up to four of her father's operatives had arrived, and she was captured on the street. This video can not be played Dubaiâs Princess Latifa reveals details of  her own kidnapping in a video Shamsa was driven to the sheikh's estate near Newmarket. By 0500 the next day, she was on a helicopter from Newmarket to northern France, where she was transferred to a private jet. Hours later, she was back in Dubai: her dreams of freedom and of an education over. It took around seven months for the kidnap allegation to reach Det Ch Insp David Beck at central Cambridge's Parkside Police Station. ""It's not every day that an allegation involving a head of state lands on a police officer's desk,"" he told the BBC in 2018 for the documentary Escape from Dubai. Shamsa had managed to get a letter to the immigration lawyer she'd met while she was in London earlier: ""I don't have the time to write in detail. I am being watched all the time so I'll get straight to the point. I was caught by my father, he managed to track me down. I am locked up until todayâ¦ now, I am not only asking you to report this immediately, I am asking your help and to involve the authorities (involve everyone)."" ""The evidence at that point suggested that there may be some substance to what was being alleged. If the allegation was true, then an offence appears to have been committed against a UK law,"" Det Ch Insp  Beck told the BBC in 2018. More details of the investigation were only revealed last year, when Cambridgeshire Police complied with a disclosure order from the High Court. It emerged that he had managed to speak to Shamsa by phone, and then corroborated key details of her story. But he needed to go to Dubai to interview her and investigate further. He applied through the Crown Prosecution Service, but his request was rejected. ""I was never given a reason why."" The case was shelved, until a review in 2018 in the wake of yet another message from Shamsa. That was eventually closed because of ""insufficient evidence to take any further action"". The sheikh did submit a statement to the High Court describing Shamsa as ""more vulnerable than other young women of her age"" because her status made her a kidnap risk. Latifa's letter will represent the third time a plea has been made for police to investigate the abduction. Dubai's Princess Latifa before her escape attempt in 2018 The sheikh's connections in the UK are deep. He is a friend of the Queen and one of the biggest private landowners in the country. Successive UK administrations have viewed the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is part, as a key strategic and business ally in the region. In 2000 or 2001 the sheikh's London office contacted the Foreign Office about Shamsa's case. The FCO would later confirm in a Parliamentary answer that they had responded that it was a matter for the police. But inside the Foreign Office, BBC News understands that there was silence about the alleged abduction. Tony Blair, then prime minister, told us through a spokesperson, that he has ""absolutely no recollection of this coming to him in government"". In response to a BBC Freedom of Information request for any conversations held by the FCO relating to the case, we were told that ""disclosure of information detailing our relationship with the UAE Government could potentially damage the bilateral relationship between the UK and UAE."" Latifa has said that Shamsa spent the eight years after her capture in prison. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the father of both princesses, has many close ties with the UK When she was released in 2008, Latifa was able to see her. ""She had to be led around by her hand. She couldn't open her eyesâ¦ she was given a bunch of pills to control her. Those pills made her like a zombie."" The person who had contact with Shamsa after her release said: ""She was justâ¦. kept quiet. Everything she did was controlled. There was no spark in Shamsa any more. There was no fight in her. There was nothing. She was just a shell."" ""I think she just resigned herself to the fact that this was her life. It's desperately sad."" In 2019 Latifa met Shamsa again, by which time Latifa was imprisoned herself after also trying to escape. She described the meeting to her cousin via her secret phone. ""Latifa warned me 'you are not going to recognise her now'. She has been drugged up so much. She is alive. But Shamsa is not Shamsa"", said Mr Essabri. The person who has known Shamsa adds: ""You couldn't actually make this up. Because who would believe you. It seems so unreal. But unfortunately, it's real. And I understand that people can't get their head round it, they just see some rich girl. It's not like that at all. It's horrific.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the plan for teachers to grade results in England is the ""right way forward"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended plans for teachers to grade GCSE and A-level pupils in England this summer as a ""good compromise"". It follows confirmation thatschools rather than an algorithm will determine grades this summer. The PM said the process will be ""fair"" and ""durable"", adding that he had confidence in the education secretary. But education select committee chairman Robert Halfon asked how ministers would prevent a ""Wild West of grading"". The story of the big U-turn of the summer 'Has all my work gone down the drain?' Gavin Williamson: How has he survived? With GCSEs and A-levels cancelled because of the pandemic, schools will determine grades using a combination of mock exams, coursework and essays, exam regulator Ofqual said on Thursday. There will be optional assessments set by exam boards for all subjects, but they will not be taken in exam conditions nor decide final grades. Results will be published earlier in August to allow time to appeal. A-level results day will be 10 August, with GCSE results given out on 12 August. But concerns have been raised that the measures will result in grade inflation. On a visit to Accrington Academy in Lancashire earlier, Mr Johnson said exams would have continued normally in an ""ideal world"". ""But I think this is as good a compromise as we can come to. ""I think it will be fair, I think it will be durable and it's the right way forward."" Asked if he had confidence in Education Secretary Gavin Williamson amid speculation he will be moved out of the position in an upcoming reshuffle, Mr Johnson said: ""Of course."" Last summer, thousands of A-level students had their results downgraded from school estimates by a controversial algorithm, beforeOfqual announced a U-turn which allowed them to use teachers' predictions instead. Mr Halfon said school-assessed grades were the ""least worst option that the government has come up with"" but it risked ""baking a rock cake of grade inflation into the system"". ""So will (Gavin Williamson) confirm what is the government's plan to ensure we will not have a wild west of grading, that these grades will be meaningful to employers so as not to damage children's life chances and when?"" Mr Williamson said grade inflation was an ""important issue"" but it was being addressed through internal and external checks, and exam boards would be able to ""root out malpractice"".

"The number of rough sleepers in England fell by a third over a year, official figures suggest. Government statistics show 2,688 people on the streets on one night in autumn 2020, down from 4,266 in 2019. The fall follows the ""Everyone In"" scheme, which has housed about 37,000 people since the pandemic hit last March. In the House of Commons, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was ""heartened"" by ""this fantastic result"". Mr Jenrick congratulated council officers and outreach workers on their ""incredible achievements"", but said these were only a beginning: ""Our ambition is that no one should need to sleep rough."" However, Labour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, told MPs there was ""a real risk that the gains made last year will be lost"". This video can not be played Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick: ""The pandemic has been an incredible opportunity to reduce rough sleeping"" The number of people housed by councils under Everyone In far outstripped the numbers in the 2019 official estimate. The 2020 figures,external, from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, show: 2,688 people estimated to be sleeping rough on a single night in autumn 2020 This was down by 1,578 (37%) from last year, and down 43% from the 2017 peak - but up by 52% since 2010 Nearly half (44%) were in London and the South East The official estimate is based on a snapshot where councils in England either count rough sleepers on one night each year between 1 October and 30 November - or give an estimate based on information from ""local agencies"", often charities. But research carried out by the BBC a year ago, also using figures from local authorities, suggested 25,000 people slept rough in England at some point in 2018, five times the figure in the autumn snapshot for the same year. Government's rough sleeping strategy 'out of step' Five times more sleep rough than official figures All rough sleepers in England 'to be housed' There's no doubt the government's approach to rough sleeping during the pandemic has proved what can be done. But while there's widespread acknowledgement that the efforts were successful in the short term, questions remain about the government's strategy. Charities report that while the snapshot figures show a decrease in the last few years, people are still sleeping rough in significant numbers. And there's concern that without a sea change in support, rising unemployment and the financial pressures of the pandemic could lead to the problem getting much worse. If Boris Johnson is to keep his promise to end rough sleeping by the end of this parliament, the figures will have to fall much further and faster than they have so far. In the London Borough of Southwark, Helen Dennis, cabinet member for social support and homelessness, says the Everyone In scheme was ""really effective in getting people off the streets, particularly during the first lockdown"". But she added: ""The challenge is we are seeing new people sleeping rough all the time."" Ms Dennis says the number of homelessness applications in the borough is currently 48% higher than at this time last year, and this is translating into a rise in the numbers of rough sleepers. ""We've seen people losing their jobs in catering, cleaning, so lots of people who maybe were on low-paid jobs to start with have lost that lifeline and find themselves homeless for the first time."" Arran Nahal, 25, originally from Stratford-upon-Avon, had just returned to the UK after a two-year stint working in hospitality in Australia and was due to start a live-in job at a hotel in the Cotswolds as the UK first locked down last March. The Cotswolds job was cancelled, leaving him jobless and without accommodation, his savings ran low and he ""hit rock bottom"" when he had to spend the night in a central London bus stop. ""Not being quite familiar with homelessness in the past and rough sleeping... I was a bit lost, a bit scared. ""You have some deep dark thoughts during those hours."" He says he asked himself repeatedly: ""How has it come to this?"" The next day he ""stumbled across"" Southwark's Manna day centre, which found him emergency accommodation and then a hostel room in east London where he still lives. He had never heard of Universal Credit but now relies on it. Soon he hopes to move on, although the lockdown means jobs in hospitality are impossible to find. ""If it hadn't been for the help I received almost immediately, I don't know where I'd be right now,"" he says. ""It's opened my eyes, given me a new perspective on the struggles people go through."" Laurence Cummins, now 20, found himself rough sleeping in London in 2019 after his father died and he could no longer stay in the family home. ""It was really cold, really dark and uncomfortable,"" he remembers. ""It's not a lifestyle you want really... but I didn't have a choice. ""At first I was very frightened. I just didn't really know what services were out there and that there were people who could provide accommodation for you."" By last winter, Laurence was sleeping in cold weather shelters. His earlier hopes of university and a good career were gone. It was only when the he got an Everyone In hotel place at the start of the pandemic that he started receiving support to turn his life around. He is now in stable accommodation, studying for a diploma in fashion and hoping to progress to a degree course. For Laurence, the pandemic provided a lifeline and ""the chance to think"". He was in the hotel for more than a month. It allowed him to sleep, watch TV and - with the help of youth charity New Horizons - plan a future. ""I just forgot about being homeless,"" he says.

"Michael Gove should apologise to children who lost support from collapsed charity Kids Company, its founder Camila Batmanghelidjh has said. Speaking on BBC Woman's Hour, she also said she believed Kids Company was targeted by a ""smear campaign"". A government source later told the BBC the charity ""was badly run"" and ""beset by a litany of failures"". Ms Batmanghelidjh's comments follow herHigh Court winagainst being disqualified from other organisations. The ruling cleared former chief executive Ms Batmanghelidjh and seven others of personal wrongdoing. Kids Company leaders win disqualification fight Kids Company, which supported vulnerable young people in London and Bristol, closed its doors in 2015. In the run-up to its collapse, the charity was spending around Â£20m a year, up to a quarter of which came from the government. A plan to restructure the organisation's finances had been agreed with David Cameron's government, but it was wound up after the Metropolitan Police launched an investigation into sexual assault allegations, following the broadcast of a report on BBC Two's Newsnight. The police investigationconcluded in 2016 after finding no evidence of criminality. A year earlier, Kids Company had also been investigated bythe National Audit Office,externalandthe House of Commons Committee of Public Accounts,external. Asked on the programme whether she felt she was owed an apology from anyone in government, Ms Batmanghelidjh said Mr Gove, now the Cabinet Office minister, had been ""disingenuous"". She said he had initially supported the charity's work and handed her a CBE when he was in the Department for Education, but that by 2015 ""he was saying he never wanted Kids Co funded, you know, and I find it very difficult when people change colours"". The state should be stepping up to protect children in care ""when their own parents aren't there to protect them"", Ms Batmanghelidjh said. She added: ""I can live without Michael Gove's apology but the staff and the children are owed an apology from Michael Gove, [former Conservative MP] Oliver Letwin, all these people who promised that they were going to help us resolve the fact that children were pouring in through our doors."" She also explained why she felt the charity was wrongly tarnished, suggesting it had been subject to a ""smear campaign"". ""I think there were two targets,"" she said. ""One is, I believe, David Cameron, because he was seen to have chosen us as Big Society [Mr Cameron's initiative to fund voluntary projects] and I think the Brexit team wanted to discredit him. ""And I think another bit was campaigning for child protection issues and I think the country has no capacity to address its child protection problems. ""And I think we got sandwiched between these two concerns and that was why there was such a ferocious attack on us."" A Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""The problems surrounding Kids Company that led to its closure have been well documented."" He added that the government was ""committed to levelling up outcomes for every young person, no matter their background or circumstance"" and pointed to investment of more than Â£2.4bn a year through the Pupil Premium to support the most disadvantaged pupils, raising the quality of children's social care and targeting support through our catch-up package to those who need the most help in getting back on track as a result of the Covid pandemic. And a government source said after the Woman's Hour interview: ""As two independent official investigations found, Kids Company was badly run, couldn't survive without government handouts and was beset by a litany of failures. That is why the charity collapsed."" The Official Receiver (OR) brought High Court proceedings against Ms Batmanghelidjh and the former trustees, arguing they were ""unfit"" to hold directorships because of their handling of the charity. But, in a ruling on February 12, Mrs Justice Falk rejected the case and said the charity may have survived financially to continue its work had it not closed. A statement issued after the ruling on behalf of the former trustees said: ""Kids Company was forced to close in August 2015 following what the judge records as 'unfounded allegations' of child abuse, which made fundraising from private and government sources impossible. ""We are pleased that finally the facts have been gathered and assessed in a court of law, and that Mrs Justice Falk has exonerated both the former trustees and Kids Company chief executive Camila Batmanghelidjh."" Founded in 1996 in south London, Kids Company provided practical, emotional and educational support to up to 36,000 deprived and vulnerable inner-city children and young people. It employed more than 600 people, with high-profile supporters including the then prime minister David Cameron. You can listen to the full Woman's Hour interviewhere.

"Primark stores have been hit hard by lockdown Fast fashion chain Primark hopes to offload millions of pounds worth of last year's clothing stock when its shops reopen in England on 12 April. The High Street giant does not offer online sales and says it expects to have lost Â£1.1bn in sales due to the latest lockdown closures. It plans to sell more than Â£400m of last year's stock to help plug the gap. The chain said its stores would also offer new ranges for all the new seasons, including this spring. Primark said its 153 stores would reopen in England on 12 April, and in Scotland on 26 April. Unlike rivals, the retailer had no online operation to shift stock when stores were closed during lockdowns. But Primark is not set up to sell online, and has said the costs involved in distribution and  sales online would mean price rises for customers. Primark's Â£1.1bn sales drop contrasts with online only fashion retailers such as Asos and Boohoo, whose sales rose by around 40% in the last four months of 2020. Primark owner Associated British Foods said sales for the 24 weeks to 27 February 2021 were Â£2.2bn, compared to Â£3.7bn in the same period last year, as lockdowns and closures in the UK and Europe stopped people going to many High Street shops. Its stores have been closed in many countries across Europe, including Germany and the Netherlands. It has dates for reopening shops in those countries, but still does not know when it will reopen in Wales, the Republic of Ireland and Portugal. However, it is optimistic that customers will return to all of its stores as soon as they reopen: ""We know that people will welcome us back when we reopen,"" finance chief John Bason said. ""There is pent-up demand."" Retail sales slump in January amid lockdown 'I haven't bought clothes in a shop for years' It will be selling a mix of new and old lines for the remainder of the year as it plays catch-up. When stores reopen Primark expects to sell Â£150m of spring and summer lines that were stored in warehouses from last year. It then aims to sell Â£260m of autumn and winter stock such as jeans and jumpers next season. This is unusual in the fashion world, where unsold stock is usually sold off in end-of-season sales, and has in the past even been burnt or sent to landfill, to make space for new ranges. Primark says it does not burn or bin any unsold stock but instead normally donates it to charity. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the closures of the Primark estate were ""costing a pretty penny"". ""However, the retail chain is a force to be reckoned with,"" she said. ""When previous lockdowns ended we saw demand rebounded strongly."" While sales were down 15% in the last round of reopening, which ""sounds bad"", ""in reality that's an impressive recovery when you consider people had little reason to visit the High Street, and Primark's lack of online business"". ""Even more importantly, so strong is the demand for Primark's clothes, excess inventory has been less of a problem during the pandemic, because more of it flies off the shelf than expected once the doors open,"" she said. In the past Primark has said it won't sell online because the cost of manning the operation and processing high volumes of returns would mean it could no longer offer low prices. Being in fast fashion means it has low margins, so ""they have to be very competitive on price,"" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData told the BBC in January. Online players like Asos and Boohoo were ""geared up for it in terms of logistics"". ""But Primark would be starting from scratch, and would have to integrate any new online operation with its existing store structure which would be costly."" However Retail Economics' Richard Lim said Primark was at risk of ""potentially alienating its customers"" who increasingly expect to be able to shop online. Customers would be finding new ways of shopping with rivals, he said. Primark's performance meant owner-Associated British Foods' first half sales and earnings would be lower than the previous year, the company said. But Associated British Foods has a grocery division, with brands that include Kingsmill bread, Twinings tea and Ovaltine, as well as major sugar, agriculture and ingredients businesses. These fared well as people stocked up during lockdown. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""Primark store closures are inevitably punching a hole in profits, but the diversified nature of the business is serving AB Foods well. ""Changing habits arising from the pandemic have boosted other parts of the business.""

"Talks over the future of Vauxhall's Ellesmere Port car plant have been ""productive but not conclusive"", the car plant's owner said. Stellantis has been in talks with the government for weeks about the site, which employs more than 1,000 people. It is thought Stellantis is seeking financial incentives to make a fully electric car at the factory. There are fears Stellantis, formed from the merger of France's PSA Group and Fiat-Chrysler, may close the factory. Stellantis bosses have also voiced concern about the UK's decision to bring forward a ban on new petrol and diesel cars. Michael Lohscheller, who heads the parent group's Vauxhall unit, said it expects an ""eventual binding commitment by the UK government in the near future and will act accordingly. ""In the meanwhile, no investment decision will be made,"" he said.

Future of Ellesmere Port hangs in the balance Crunch talks to save Ellesmere Port plant continue Stellantis has been reviewing its options for plants worldwide. It has yet to decide if a new generation of a hatchback model will be produced there. Vauxhall confirmed on Thursday that talks on ""different scenarios for Ellesmere Port"" were ongoing with UK authorities ""at both national and local levels"". Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has been involved in discussions with Stellantis, which have been ongoing for several weeks.

Making plans to wind down production at Ellesmere Port completely. Securing the plant's long-term future by committing to making a new generation of electric cars in the North West. Stellantis boss Carlos Tavares recently referred to the ""brutal"" decisionfor the UK government to bring forward the ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars to 2030 and said it might make more sense to move future electric production closer to its biggest market in the European Union (EU).

"Princess Shamsa fled her father's estate in the summer of 2000 but was forcibly returned to Dubai months later Princess Latifa, the captive daughter of Dubai's ruler, has appealed to UK police to re-investigate the kidnap of her older sister from a Cambridge street more than 20 years ago. In a letter shared with the BBC, Latifa tells Cambridgeshire police this could help free Princess Shamsa, who was captured on the orders of their father. Shamsa, who was just 18 then and is now 39, has not been seen in public since. The government of Dubai has not responded to BBC requests for comment. A High Court judge ruled in 2019, that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum had abducted both daughters and held them against their will. Last week BBC Panorama broadcastshocking videos Latifa had secretly recorded on a phone she had been given, in which she described how she was being held ""hostage"" by her father following a failed escape attempt in 2018. The UN has since asked the United Arab Emirates for proof that Latifa is alive. But almost two decades earlier, an attempt by her older sister to flee the family also ended in capture and imprisonment. In August 2000, around two months after escaping from her father's Longcross Estate in Surrey, Shamsa was forcibly taken from Cambridge, flown by helicopter to France and then by private jet back to Dubai. Latifa's handwritten letter, which was passed to the Cambridgeshire force by her friends on Wednesday, urges action for her sister by British authorities. It was written in 2019 while she was being held in solitary confinement in a ""jail villa"". ""All I ask of you"", writes Latifa, ""is to please give attention on her case because it could get her her freedom... your help and attention on her case could free her."" She adds: ""She has strong links to Englandâ¦ she really loves England, all of her fondest memories are of her time there."" This video can not be played Videos show Dubai's Princess Latifa in ""villa jail"" Latifa dated the letter February 2018, before her escape attempt, to avoid revealing that she had a way of communicating with the outside world from captivity. It paints a chilling picture of her sister's fate after she was returned to Dubai. ""She was kept incommunicado with no release date, trial or charge. She was tortured by getting her feet caned..."" Cambridgeshire police first launched a kidnap investigation in 2001 after Shamsa made contact via an immigration lawyer. But the investigation eventually hit a dead end when officers were blocked from going to Dubai. It later emerged that aides acting for the sheikh had made representations to the Foreign Office around the time of the investigation. Police reviewed the investigation in 2018, and BBC News can now reveal that one investigator acknowledged there were ""significant sensitivities"" with the case. A further review was launched after the High Court judgment was published in 2020. In a statement to BBC News, Cambridgeshire Police said it had received Latifa's letter, which ""will be looked at as part of the ongoing review"". The statement added: ""This is a very complex and serious matter and as such there are details of the case that it would be inappropriate to discuss publicly."" The Foreign Office, which has previously faced questions over its response in the wake of representations from a powerful state ally, told the BBC this was a private matter between two individuals and it had no role in the investigation by Cambridgeshire Constabulary or its outcome. They also declined to comment on contact from the sheikh's office regarding the case. After the footage of Princess Latifa emerged, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the footage was ""deeply troubling"" and that the UK would ""watch very closely developments on that front"". Timeline: Failed escapes of sheikh's daughters Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum: Who is Dubai's ruler? Latifa: The princess who vanished In 2018, the Dubai Royal Court told the BBC that Shamsa was ""adored and cherished"". The sheikh's only statement on the case has been to the High Court, and speaks of ""relief"" at having found his ""vulnerable"" daughter Shamsa after she went missing. Shamsa's story prefigured what happened to Latifa 18 years later and played a key role in her decision to seek a new life abroad. It led directly to her failed escape on a boat in the Indian Ocean. In a video posted to YouTube before her attempt to escape in 2018 Latifa describes what happened to her sister and its severe repercussions. BBC News has also spoken to someone who had regular contact with Shamsa in Dubai: ""You didn't need to be a doctor to know that [she] was tranquilised all the time."" Princess Shamsa had grown up partly in the UK and had been given a Western education. There are few pictures of Princess Shamsa, who was partly brought up in the UK ""Shamsa wasn't what you would call a 'Princess'"", according to her cousin Marcus Essabri, who lived with the family in Dubai for two years and was close to her. ""She was cheeky. Full of life and adventure."" ""She wanted to make a difference for women, in the Arab world especially. She wanted to push the boundariesâ¦ this is when the problems started,"" Mr Essabri said. Shamsa wrote to Mr Essabri from London in September 1999, nine months before her escape. Her father, then Crown Prince of Dubai, was not letting her pursue her studies and go to university. ""I'm not allowed to continue. You know that he didn't even ask me what I was interested in. He just said no."" She confided in her cousin that she was thinking of running away. Longcross Estate, Surrey ""The one thing that scares me is imagining myself old and regretting not trying when I was 18. Try what? I don't know. Just taking that chance"". Then in summer 2000, she took it. She drove a black Range Rover to the edge of the sheikh's sprawling Â£75m estate at Longcross in Surrey and slipped away. The sheikh deployed a team of agents to secretly track her down. On 19 August 2000, a man took Shamsa to Cambridge, where they checked into the University Arms Hotel. Unbeknownst to her, up to four of her father's operatives had arrived, and she was captured on the street. This video can not be played Dubaiâs Princess Latifa reveals details of  her own kidnapping in a video Shamsa was driven to the sheikh's estate near Newmarket. By 0500 the next day, she was on a helicopter from Newmarket to northern France, where she was transferred to a private jet. Hours later, she was back in Dubai: her dreams of freedom and of an education over. It took around seven months for the kidnap allegation to reach Det Ch Insp David Beck at central Cambridge's Parkside Police Station. ""It's not every day that an allegation involving a head of state lands on a police officer's desk,"" he told the BBC in 2018 for the documentary Escape from Dubai. Shamsa had managed to get a letter to the immigration lawyer she'd met while she was in London earlier: ""I don't have the time to write in detail. I am being watched all the time so I'll get straight to the point. I was caught by my father, he managed to track me down. I am locked up until todayâ¦ now, I am not only asking you to report this immediately, I am asking your help and to involve the authorities (involve everyone)."" ""The evidence at that point suggested that there may be some substance to what was being alleged. If the allegation was true, then an offence appears to have been committed against a UK law,"" Det Ch Insp  Beck told the BBC in 2018. More details of the investigation were only revealed last year, when Cambridgeshire Police complied with a disclosure order from the High Court. It emerged that he had managed to speak to Shamsa by phone, and then corroborated key details of her story. But he needed to go to Dubai to interview her and investigate further. He applied through the Crown Prosecution Service, but his request was rejected. ""I was never given a reason why."" The case was shelved, until a review in 2018 in the wake of yet another message from Shamsa. That was eventually closed because of ""insufficient evidence to take any further action"". The sheikh did submit a statement to the High Court describing Shamsa as ""more vulnerable than other young women of her age"" because her status made her a kidnap risk. Latifa's letter will represent the third time a plea has been made for police to investigate the abduction. Dubai's Princess Latifa before her escape attempt in 2018 The sheikh's connections in the UK are deep. He is a friend of the Queen and one of the biggest private landowners in the country. Successive UK administrations have viewed the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is part, as a key strategic and business ally in the region. In 2000 or 2001 the sheikh's London office contacted the Foreign Office about Shamsa's case. The FCO would later confirm in a Parliamentary answer that they had responded that it was a matter for the police.

"Princess Shamsa fled her father's estate in the summer of 2000 but was forcibly returned to Dubai months later Princess Latifa, the captive daughter of Dubai's ruler, has appealed to UK police to re-investigate the kidnap of her older sister from a Cambridge street more than 20 years ago. In a letter shared with the BBC, Latifa tells Cambridgeshire police this could help free Princess Shamsa, who was captured on the orders of their father. Shamsa, who was just 18 then and is now 39, has not been seen in public since. The government of Dubai has not responded to BBC requests for comment. A High Court judge ruled in 2019, that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum had abducted both daughters and held them against their will. Last week BBC Panorama broadcastshocking videos Latifa had secretly recorded on a phone she had been given, in which she described how she was being held ""hostage"" by her father following a failed escape attempt in 2018. The UN has since asked the United Arab Emirates for proof that Latifa is alive. But almost two decades earlier, an attempt by her older sister to flee the family also ended in capture and imprisonment. In August 2000, around two months after escaping from her father's Longcross Estate in Surrey, Shamsa was forcibly taken from Cambridge, flown by helicopter to France and then by private jet back to Dubai. Latifa's handwritten letter, which was passed to the Cambridgeshire force by her friends on Wednesday, urges action for her sister by British authorities. It was written in 2019 while she was being held in solitary confinement in a ""jail villa"". ""All I ask of you"", writes Latifa, ""is to please give attention on her case because it could get her her freedom... your help and attention on her case could free her."" She adds: ""She has strong links to Englandâ¦ she really loves England, all of her fondest memories are of her time there."" This video can not be played Videos show Dubai's Princess Latifa in ""villa jail"" Latifa dated the letter February 2018, before her escape attempt, to avoid revealing that she had a way of communicating with the outside world from captivity. It paints a chilling picture of her sister's fate after she was returned to Dubai. ""She was kept incommunicado with no release date, trial or charge. She was tortured by getting her feet caned..."" Cambridgeshire police first launched a kidnap investigation in 2001 after Shamsa made contact via an immigration lawyer. But the investigation eventually hit a dead end when officers were blocked from going to Dubai. It later emerged that aides acting for the sheikh had made representations to the Foreign Office around the time of the investigation. Police reviewed the investigation in 2018, and BBC News can now reveal that one investigator acknowledged there were ""significant sensitivities"" with the case. A further review was launched after the High Court judgment was published in 2020. In a statement to BBC News, Cambridgeshire Police said it had received Latifa's letter, which ""will be looked at as part of the ongoing review"". The statement added: ""This is a very complex and serious matter and as such there are details of the case that it would be inappropriate to discuss publicly."" The Foreign Office, which has previously faced questions over its response in the wake of representations from a powerful state ally, told the BBC this was a private matter between two individuals and it had no role in the investigation by Cambridgeshire Constabulary or its outcome. They also declined to comment on contact from the sheikh's office regarding the case. After the footage of Princess Latifa emerged, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the footage was ""deeply troubling"" and that the UK would ""watch very closely developments on that front"". Timeline: Failed escapes of sheikh's daughters Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum: Who is Dubai's ruler? Latifa: The princess who vanished In 2018, the Dubai Royal Court told the BBC that Shamsa was ""adored and cherished"". The sheikh's only statement on the case has been to the High Court, and speaks of ""relief"" at having found his ""vulnerable"" daughter Shamsa after she went missing. Shamsa's story prefigured what happened to Latifa 18 years later and played a key role in her decision to seek a new life abroad. It led directly to her failed escape on a boat in the Indian Ocean. In a video posted to YouTube before her attempt to escape in 2018 Latifa describes what happened to her sister and its severe repercussions. BBC News has also spoken to someone who had regular contact with Shamsa in Dubai: ""You didn't need to be a doctor to know that [she] was tranquilised all the time."" Princess Shamsa had grown up partly in the UK and had been given a Western education. There are few pictures of Princess Shamsa, who was partly brought up in the UK ""Shamsa wasn't what you would call a 'Princess'"", according to her cousin Marcus Essabri, who lived with the family in Dubai for two years and was close to her. ""She was cheeky. Full of life and adventure."" ""She wanted to make a difference for women, in the Arab world especially. She wanted to push the boundariesâ¦ this is when the problems started,"" Mr Essabri said. Shamsa wrote to Mr Essabri from London in September 1999, nine months before her escape. Her father, then Crown Prince of Dubai, was not letting her pursue her studies and go to university. ""I'm not allowed to continue. You know that he didn't even ask me what I was interested in. He just said no."" She confided in her cousin that she was thinking of running away. Longcross Estate, Surrey ""The one thing that scares me is imagining myself old and regretting not trying when I was 18. Try what? I don't know. Just taking that chance"". Then in summer 2000, she took it. She drove a black Range Rover to the edge of the sheikh's sprawling Â£75m estate at Longcross in Surrey and slipped away. The sheikh deployed a team of agents to secretly track her down. On 19 August 2000, a man took Shamsa to Cambridge, where they checked into the University Arms Hotel. Unbeknownst to her, up to four of her father's operatives had arrived, and she was captured on the street. This video can not be played Dubaiâs Princess Latifa reveals details of  her own kidnapping in a video Shamsa was driven to the sheikh's estate near Newmarket. By 0500 the next day, she was on a helicopter from Newmarket to northern France, where she was transferred to a private jet. Hours later, she was back in Dubai: her dreams of freedom and of an education over. It took around seven months for the kidnap allegation to reach Det Ch Insp David Beck at central Cambridge's Parkside Police Station. ""It's not every day that an allegation involving a head of state lands on a police officer's desk,"" he told the BBC in 2018 for the documentary Escape from Dubai. Shamsa had managed to get a letter to the immigration lawyer she'd met while she was in London earlier: ""I don't have the time to write in detail. I am being watched all the time so I'll get straight to the point. I was caught by my father, he managed to track me down. I am locked up until todayâ¦ now, I am not only asking you to report this immediately, I am asking your help and to involve the authorities (involve everyone)."" ""The evidence at that point suggested that there may be some substance to what was being alleged. If the allegation was true, then an offence appears to have been committed against a UK law,"" Det Ch Insp  Beck told the BBC in 2018. More details of the investigation were only revealed last year, when Cambridgeshire Police complied with a disclosure order from the High Court. It emerged that he had managed to speak to Shamsa by phone, and then corroborated key details of her story. But he needed to go to Dubai to interview her and investigate further. He applied through the Crown Prosecution Service, but his request was rejected. ""I was never given a reason why."" The case was shelved, until a review in 2018 in the wake of yet another message from Shamsa. That was eventually closed because of ""insufficient evidence to take any further action"". The sheikh did submit a statement to the High Court describing Shamsa as ""more vulnerable than other young women of her age"" because her status made her a kidnap risk. Latifa's letter will represent the third time a plea has been made for police to investigate the abduction. Dubai's Princess Latifa before her escape attempt in 2018 The sheikh's connections in the UK are deep. He is a friend of the Queen and one of the biggest private landowners in the country. Successive UK administrations have viewed the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is part, as a key strategic and business ally in the region. In 2000 or 2001 the sheikh's London office contacted the Foreign Office about Shamsa's case. The FCO would later confirm in a Parliamentary answer that they had responded that it was a matter for the police. But inside the Foreign Office, BBC News understands that there was silence about the alleged abduction.

"The number of rough sleepers in England fell by a third over a year, official figures suggest. Government statistics show 2,688 people on the streets on one night in autumn 2020, down from 4,266 in 2019. The fall follows the ""Everyone In"" scheme, which has housed about 37,000 people since the pandemic hit last March. In the House of Commons, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick said he was ""heartened"" by ""this fantastic result"". Mr Jenrick congratulated council officers and outreach workers on their ""incredible achievements"", but said these were only a beginning: ""Our ambition is that no one should need to sleep rough."" However, Labour's shadow housing secretary, Thangam Debbonaire, told MPs there was ""a real risk that the gains made last year will be lost"". This video can not be played Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick: ""The pandemic has been an incredible opportunity to reduce rough sleeping"" The number of people housed by councils under Everyone In far outstripped the numbers in the 2019 official estimate. The 2020 figures,external, from the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government, show: 2,688 people estimated to be sleeping rough on a single night in autumn 2020 This was down by 1,578 (37%) from last year, and down 43% from the 2017 peak - but up by 52% since 2010 Nearly half (44%) were in London and the South East The official estimate is based on a snapshot where councils in England either count rough sleepers on one night each year between 1 October and 30 November - or give an estimate based on information from ""local agencies"", often charities. But research carried out by the BBC a year ago, also using figures from local authorities, suggested 25,000 people slept rough in England at some point in 2018, five times the figure in the autumn snapshot for the same year. Government's rough sleeping strategy 'out of step' Five times more sleep rough than official figures All rough sleepers in England 'to be housed' There's no doubt the government's approach to rough sleeping during the pandemic has proved what can be done. But while there's widespread acknowledgement that the efforts were successful in the short term, questions remain about the government's strategy. Charities report that while the snapshot figures show a decrease in the last few years, people are still sleeping rough in significant numbers. And there's concern that without a sea change in support, rising unemployment and the financial pressures of the pandemic could lead to the problem getting much worse. If Boris Johnson is to keep his promise to end rough sleeping by the end of this parliament, the figures will have to fall much further and faster than they have so far. In the London Borough of Southwark, Helen Dennis, cabinet member for social support and homelessness, says the Everyone In scheme was ""really effective in getting people off the streets, particularly during the first lockdown"". But she added: ""The challenge is we are seeing new people sleeping rough all the time."" Ms Dennis says the number of homelessness applications in the borough is currently 48% higher than at this time last year, and this is translating into a rise in the numbers of rough sleepers. ""We've seen people losing their jobs in catering, cleaning, so lots of people who maybe were on low-paid jobs to start with have lost that lifeline and find themselves homeless for the first time."" Arran Nahal, 25, originally from Stratford-upon-Avon, had just returned to the UK after a two-year stint working in hospitality in Australia and was due to start a live-in job at a hotel in the Cotswolds as the UK first locked down last March. The Cotswolds job was cancelled, leaving him jobless and without accommodation, his savings ran low and he ""hit rock bottom"" when he had to spend the night in a central London bus stop. ""Not being quite familiar with homelessness in the past and rough sleeping... I was a bit lost, a bit scared. ""You have some deep dark thoughts during those hours."" He says he asked himself repeatedly: ""How has it come to this?"" The next day he ""stumbled across"" Southwark's Manna day centre, which found him emergency accommodation and then a hostel room in east London where he still lives. He had never heard of Universal Credit but now relies on it. Soon he hopes to move on, although the lockdown means jobs in hospitality are impossible to find. ""If it hadn't been for the help I received almost immediately, I don't know where I'd be right now,"" he says. ""It's opened my eyes, given me a new perspective on the struggles people go through."" Laurence Cummins, now 20, found himself rough sleeping in London in 2019 after his father died and he could no longer stay in the family home. ""It was really cold, really dark and uncomfortable,"" he remembers. ""It's not a lifestyle you want really... but I didn't have a choice. ""At first I was very frightened. I just didn't really know what services were out there and that there were people who could provide accommodation for you."" By last winter, Laurence was sleeping in cold weather shelters. His earlier hopes of university and a good career were gone. It was only when the he got an Everyone In hotel place at the start of the pandemic that he started receiving support to turn his life around. He is now in stable accommodation, studying for a diploma in fashion and hoping to progress to a degree course. For Laurence, the pandemic provided a lifeline and ""the chance to think"". He was in the hotel for more than a month. It allowed him to sleep, watch TV and - with the help of youth charity New Horizons - plan a future. ""I just forgot about being homeless,"" he says.

"Primark stores have been hit hard by lockdown Fast fashion chain Primark hopes to offload millions of pounds worth of last year's clothing stock when its shops reopen in England on 12 April. The High Street giant does not offer online sales and says it expects to have lost Â£1.1bn in sales due to the latest lockdown closures. It plans to sell more than Â£400m of last year's stock to help plug the gap. The chain said its stores would also offer new ranges for all the new seasons, including this spring. Primark said its 153 stores would reopen in England on 12 April, and in Scotland on 26 April. Unlike rivals, the retailer had no online operation to shift stock when stores were closed during lockdowns. But Primark is not set up to sell online, and has said the costs involved in distribution and  sales online would mean price rises for customers. Primark's Â£1.1bn sales drop contrasts with online only fashion retailers such as Asos and Boohoo, whose sales rose by around 40% in the last four months of 2020. Primark owner Associated British Foods said sales for the 24 weeks to 27 February 2021 were Â£2.2bn, compared to Â£3.7bn in the same period last year, as lockdowns and closures in the UK and Europe stopped people going to many High Street shops. Its stores have been closed in many countries across Europe, including Germany and the Netherlands. It has dates for reopening shops in those countries, but still does not know when it will reopen in Wales, the Republic of Ireland and Portugal. However, it is optimistic that customers will return to all of its stores as soon as they reopen: ""We know that people will welcome us back when we reopen,"" finance chief John Bason said. ""There is pent-up demand."" Retail sales slump in January amid lockdown 'I haven't bought clothes in a shop for years' It will be selling a mix of new and old lines for the remainder of the year as it plays catch-up. When stores reopen Primark expects to sell Â£150m of spring and summer lines that were stored in warehouses from last year. It then aims to sell Â£260m of autumn and winter stock such as jeans and jumpers next season. This is unusual in the fashion world, where unsold stock is usually sold off in end-of-season sales, and has in the past even been burnt or sent to landfill, to make space for new ranges. Primark says it does not burn or bin any unsold stock but instead normally donates it to charity. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the closures of the Primark estate were ""costing a pretty penny"". ""However, the retail chain is a force to be reckoned with,"" she said. ""When previous lockdowns ended we saw demand rebounded strongly."" While sales were down 15% in the last round of reopening, which ""sounds bad"", ""in reality that's an impressive recovery when you consider people had little reason to visit the High Street, and Primark's lack of online business"". ""Even more importantly, so strong is the demand for Primark's clothes, excess inventory has been less of a problem during the pandemic, because more of it flies off the shelf than expected once the doors open,"" she said. In the past Primark has said it won't sell online because the cost of manning the operation and processing high volumes of returns would mean it could no longer offer low prices. Being in fast fashion means it has low margins, so ""they have to be very competitive on price,"" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData told the BBC in January. Online players like Asos and Boohoo were ""geared up for it in terms of logistics"". ""But Primark would be starting from scratch, and would have to integrate any new online operation with its existing store structure which would be costly."" However Retail Economics' Richard Lim said Primark was at risk of ""potentially alienating its customers"" who increasingly expect to be able to shop online. Customers would be finding new ways of shopping with rivals, he said. Primark's performance meant owner-Associated British Foods' first half sales and earnings would be lower than the previous year, the company said. But Associated British Foods has a grocery division, with brands that include Kingsmill bread, Twinings tea and Ovaltine, as well as major sugar, agriculture and ingredients businesses. These fared well as people stocked up during lockdown. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""Primark store closures are inevitably punching a hole in profits, but the diversified nature of the business is serving AB Foods well. ""Changing habits arising from the pandemic have boosted other parts of the business.""

"Asda says it has begun consulting with workers over a major restructuring of the business which could put about 5,000 jobs at risk, including 3,000 non-store jobs. Proposed cuts would include in areas such as cash management, where there is less work as more people shop online. The company said it planned to create 4,500 jobs as it expands its online offering. The cuts could also affect two online-only stores where orders are picked. Asda said its sites in Dartford and Heston that are used to pick online orders could close as the company switches to using  regular stores to gather goods for online deliveries. This would mean the loss of 800 jobs. It also plans to change about 1,100 store management roles, although it insists that this will mean an increase in jobs overall. Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said: ""The pandemic has accelerated change across the retail sector especially the shift towards grocery home shopping and our priority is to serve customers in the way they want to shop with us. ""The last 12 months have shown us that businesses have to be prepared to adapt quickly to change and I am incredibly proud of the way we demonstrated our agility and resilience through the pandemic."" People close to the business insist that the move is led by a change in demand from shoppers rather than a cost-cutting drive, and point to the 4,500 new jobs being created as order pickers and delivery drivers. The company can handle 90% more online orders compared to a year ago. Asda says it hopes many of those at risk can be moved to the new jobs and that the actual number of workers leaving the business will be lower. One store manager, who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity, told the BBC the proposed job cuts would ""pile more pressure and stress on an already stretched workforce"" and described scenes of upset in their store. Asda was recently purchased by billionaire brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa and private equity firm TDR Capital, in a deal valuing it at Â£6.8bn, funded largely with debt. The deal came after a failed attempt at merging with rival Sainsbury's. ""Asda workers have had a torrid two years,"" Roger Jenkins, national officer for the GMB union said. ""The failed Sainsbury's takeover, twelve months working on the pandemic frontline and now the uncertainty of a new take over, sidling the company with huge debts and potential sell offs. ""This is the last thing they need."" The union said the company is profitable and does not need to enforce redundancies.

And the Metropolitan Police says it as ""a hugely important police power for protecting the public"". Overall rates of stop-and-search have fallen in the past decade, despite recent increases. But there had been no corresponding drop for people belonging to ethnic minorities, Justice found. What is stop and search and what are your rights? Only six Met PCs disciplined over stop and search Black men 'stopped and searched over fist bump' Most stop-and-searches require ""reasonable grounds"" for suspicion. But 3%, known as Section 60s - in a set area, normally a neighbourhood, for a defined period of time, often following a violent incident or where police believe crimes may happen - do not. There were almost 18,000, mostly in London, in the year to March 2020, an increase on the previous year. And a quarter of those searched were black people, according to Home Office figures. ""This disproportionate trend continued even at the height of the first wave of Covid-19 infections,"" Justice says. And only 4% of Section 60 stop-and-searches lead to arrest. ""How stop-and-search is conducted provides the single most important opportunity to change the relationship between BAME [black, Asian and minority ethnic] children and the police,"" the report says. And it demands the abolition of the Met's ""fundamentally discriminatory""gangs violence matrix,external. Introduced in the aftermath of the 2011 riots, the GVM is basically a spreadsheet containing details of people officers have identified as gang members. Following highly critical reports by Amnesty UK and the Information Commissioner's Office, more than 1,000 people were taken off the matrix. But nearly 2,500 remain on it. And about 90% of them are Londoners belonging to ethnic minorities. The ""GVM exacerbates perceptions of children, especially BAME children, as sophisticated criminals rather than vulnerable individuals"", Justice says. ""We are not convinced that the alleged policing benefits outweigh the manifest disproportionate and negative effect it has on BAME communities,"" the report says. A team of senior lawyers and experts at Justice put together the report because of rising concern about the proportion of children belonging to ethnic minorities in youth custody. This has hit a record high, according to Ministry of Justice figures. And Justice say this ""represents the most acute manifestation of racial disparity"" in the youth justice system. A government official said: ""No-one should be stopped and searched because of their race. ""We are determined to tackle the deep-rooted causes of over-representation in the criminal-justice system.""

"Princess Shamsa fled her father's estate in the summer of 2000 but was forcibly returned to Dubai months later Princess Latifa, the captive daughter of Dubai's ruler, has appealed to UK police to re-investigate the kidnap of her older sister from a Cambridge street more than 20 years ago. In a letter shared with the BBC, Latifa tells Cambridgeshire police this could help free Princess Shamsa, who was captured on the orders of their father. Shamsa, who was just 18 then and is now 39, has not been seen in public since. The government of Dubai has not responded to BBC requests for comment. A High Court judge ruled in 2019, that Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum had abducted both daughters and held them against their will. Last week BBC Panorama broadcastshocking videos Latifa had secretly recorded on a phone she had been given, in which she described how she was being held ""hostage"" by her father following a failed escape attempt in 2018. The UN has since asked the United Arab Emirates for proof that Latifa is alive. But almost two decades earlier, an attempt by her older sister to flee the family also ended in capture and imprisonment. In August 2000, around two months after escaping from her father's Longcross Estate in Surrey, Shamsa was forcibly taken from Cambridge, flown by helicopter to France and then by private jet back to Dubai. Latifa's handwritten letter, which was passed to the Cambridgeshire force by her friends on Wednesday, urges action for her sister by British authorities. It was written in 2019 while she was being held in solitary confinement in a ""jail villa"". ""All I ask of you"", writes Latifa, ""is to please give attention on her case because it could get her her freedom... your help and attention on her case could free her."" She adds: ""She has strong links to Englandâ¦ she really loves England, all of her fondest memories are of her time there."" This video can not be played Videos show Dubai's Princess Latifa in ""villa jail"" Latifa dated the letter February 2018, before her escape attempt, to avoid revealing that she had a way of communicating with the outside world from captivity. It paints a chilling picture of her sister's fate after she was returned to Dubai. ""She was kept incommunicado with no release date, trial or charge. She was tortured by getting her feet caned..."" Cambridgeshire police first launched a kidnap investigation in 2001 after Shamsa made contact via an immigration lawyer. But the investigation eventually hit a dead end when officers were blocked from going to Dubai. It later emerged that aides acting for the sheikh had made representations to the Foreign Office around the time of the investigation. Police reviewed the investigation in 2018, and BBC News can now reveal that one investigator acknowledged there were ""significant sensitivities"" with the case. A further review was launched after the High Court judgment was published in 2020. In a statement to BBC News, Cambridgeshire Police said it had received Latifa's letter, which ""will be looked at as part of the ongoing review"". The statement added: ""This is a very complex and serious matter and as such there are details of the case that it would be inappropriate to discuss publicly."" The Foreign Office, which has previously faced questions over its response in the wake of representations from a powerful state ally, told the BBC this was a private matter between two individuals and it had no role in the investigation by Cambridgeshire Constabulary or its outcome. They also declined to comment on contact from the sheikh's office regarding the case. After the footage of Princess Latifa emerged, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the footage was ""deeply troubling"" and that the UK would ""watch very closely developments on that front"". Timeline: Failed escapes of sheikh's daughters Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum: Who is Dubai's ruler? Latifa: The princess who vanished In 2018, the Dubai Royal Court told the BBC that Shamsa was ""adored and cherished"". The sheikh's only statement on the case has been to the High Court, and speaks of ""relief"" at having found his ""vulnerable"" daughter Shamsa after she went missing. Shamsa's story prefigured what happened to Latifa 18 years later and played a key role in her decision to seek a new life abroad. It led directly to her failed escape on a boat in the Indian Ocean. In a video posted to YouTube before her attempt to escape in 2018 Latifa describes what happened to her sister and its severe repercussions. BBC News has also spoken to someone who had regular contact with Shamsa in Dubai: ""You didn't need to be a doctor to know that [she] was tranquilised all the time."" Princess Shamsa had grown up partly in the UK and had been given a Western education. There are few pictures of Princess Shamsa, who was partly brought up in the UK ""Shamsa wasn't what you would call a 'Princess'"", according to her cousin Marcus Essabri, who lived with the family in Dubai for two years and was close to her. ""She was cheeky. Full of life and adventure."" ""She wanted to make a difference for women, in the Arab world especially. She wanted to push the boundariesâ¦ this is when the problems started,"" Mr Essabri said. Shamsa wrote to Mr Essabri from London in September 1999, nine months before her escape. Her father, then Crown Prince of Dubai, was not letting her pursue her studies and go to university. ""I'm not allowed to continue. You know that he didn't even ask me what I was interested in. He just said no."" She confided in her cousin that she was thinking of running away. Longcross Estate, Surrey ""The one thing that scares me is imagining myself old and regretting not trying when I was 18. Try what? I don't know. Just taking that chance"". Then in summer 2000, she took it. She drove a black Range Rover to the edge of the sheikh's sprawling Â£75m estate at Longcross in Surrey and slipped away. The sheikh deployed a team of agents to secretly track her down. On 19 August 2000, a man took Shamsa to Cambridge, where they checked into the University Arms Hotel. Unbeknownst to her, up to four of her father's operatives had arrived, and she was captured on the street. This video can not be played Dubaiâs Princess Latifa reveals details of  her own kidnapping in a video Shamsa was driven to the sheikh's estate near Newmarket. By 0500 the next day, she was on a helicopter from Newmarket to northern France, where she was transferred to a private jet. Hours later, she was back in Dubai: her dreams of freedom and of an education over. It took around seven months for the kidnap allegation to reach Det Ch Insp David Beck at central Cambridge's Parkside Police Station. ""It's not every day that an allegation involving a head of state lands on a police officer's desk,"" he told the BBC in 2018 for the documentary Escape from Dubai. Shamsa had managed to get a letter to the immigration lawyer she'd met while she was in London earlier: ""I don't have the time to write in detail. I am being watched all the time so I'll get straight to the point. I was caught by my father, he managed to track me down. I am locked up until todayâ¦ now, I am not only asking you to report this immediately, I am asking your help and to involve the authorities (involve everyone)."" ""The evidence at that point suggested that there may be some substance to what was being alleged. If the allegation was true, then an offence appears to have been committed against a UK law,"" Det Ch Insp  Beck told the BBC in 2018. More details of the investigation were only revealed last year, when Cambridgeshire Police complied with a disclosure order from the High Court. It emerged that he had managed to speak to Shamsa by phone, and then corroborated key details of her story. But he needed to go to Dubai to interview her and investigate further. He applied through the Crown Prosecution Service, but his request was rejected. ""I was never given a reason why."" The case was shelved, until a review in 2018 in the wake of yet another message from Shamsa. That was eventually closed because of ""insufficient evidence to take any further action"". The sheikh did submit a statement to the High Court describing Shamsa as ""more vulnerable than other young women of her age"" because her status made her a kidnap risk. Latifa's letter will represent the third time a plea has been made for police to investigate the abduction. Dubai's Princess Latifa before her escape attempt in 2018 The sheikh's connections in the UK are deep. He is a friend of the Queen and one of the biggest private landowners in the country. Successive UK administrations have viewed the United Arab Emirates, of which Dubai is part, as a key strategic and business ally in the region. In 2000 or 2001 the sheikh's London office contacted the Foreign Office about Shamsa's case. The FCO would later confirm in a Parliamentary answer that they had responded that it was a matter for the police. But inside the Foreign Office, BBC News understands that there was silence about the alleged abduction. Tony Blair, then prime minister, told us through a spokesperson, that he has ""absolutely no recollection of this coming to him in government"". In response to a BBC Freedom of Information request for any conversations held by the FCO relating to the case, we were told that ""disclosure of information detailing our relationship with the UAE Government could potentially damage the bilateral relationship between the UK and UAE."" Latifa has said that Shamsa spent the eight years after her capture in prison. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the father of both princesses, has many close ties with the UK When she was released in 2008, Latifa was able to see her. ""She had to be led around by her hand. She couldn't open her eyesâ¦ she was given a bunch of pills to control her. Those pills made her like a zombie."" The person who had contact with Shamsa after her release said: ""She was justâ¦. kept quiet. Everything she did was controlled. There was no spark in Shamsa any more. There was no fight in her. There was nothing. She was just a shell."" ""I think she just resigned herself to the fact that this was her life. It's desperately sad."" In 2019 Latifa met Shamsa again, by which time Latifa was imprisoned herself after also trying to escape. She described the meeting to her cousin via her secret phone. ""Latifa warned me 'you are not going to recognise her now'. She has been drugged up so much. She is alive. But Shamsa is not Shamsa"", said Mr Essabri. The person who has known Shamsa adds: ""You couldn't actually make this up. Because who would believe you. It seems so unreal. But unfortunately, it's real. And I understand that people can't get their head round it, they just see some rich girl. It's not like that at all. It's horrific.""

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says the plan for teachers to grade results in England is the ""right way forward"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended plans for teachers to grade GCSE and A-level pupils in England this summer as a ""good compromise"". It follows confirmation thatschools rather than an algorithm will determine grades this summer. The PM said the process will be ""fair"" and ""durable"", adding that he had confidence in the education secretary. But education select committee chairman Robert Halfon asked how ministers would prevent a ""Wild West of grading"". The story of the big U-turn of the summer 'Has all my work gone down the drain?' Gavin Williamson: How has he survived? With GCSEs and A-levels cancelled because of the pandemic, schools will determine grades using a combination of mock exams, coursework and essays, exam regulator Ofqual said on Thursday. There will be optional assessments set by exam boards for all subjects, but they will not be taken in exam conditions nor decide final grades. Results will be published earlier in August to allow time to appeal. A-level results day will be 10 August, with GCSE results given out on 12 August. But concerns have been raised that the measures will result in grade inflation. On a visit to Accrington Academy in Lancashire earlier, Mr Johnson said exams would have continued normally in an ""ideal world"". ""But I think this is as good a compromise as we can come to. ""I think it will be fair, I think it will be durable and it's the right way forward."" Asked if he had confidence in Education Secretary Gavin Williamson amid speculation he will be moved out of the position in an upcoming reshuffle, Mr Johnson said: ""Of course."" Last summer, thousands of A-level students had their results downgraded from school estimates by a controversial algorithm, beforeOfqual announced a U-turn which allowed them to use teachers' predictions instead. Mr Halfon said school-assessed grades were the ""least worst option that the government has come up with"" but it risked ""baking a rock cake of grade inflation into the system"". ""So will (Gavin Williamson) confirm what is the government's plan to ensure we will not have a wild west of grading, that these grades will be meaningful to employers so as not to damage children's life chances and when?"" Mr Williamson said grade inflation was an ""important issue"" but it was being addressed through internal and external checks, and exam boards would be able to ""root out malpractice"". Addressing the Commons about the plans, he said: ""Ultimately, this summer's assessments will ensure fair routes to the next stages of education or the start of their career. That is our overall aim."" During last year's exam protests there were banners saying ""trust in teachers"". This is certainly the case this year, with teachers being given a remarkable amount of flexibility over how they will decide this summer's A-level and GCSE results. Before the pandemic disrupted exams, there was control freakery over how grades were shared out. Now it's going to be left to teachers' professional judgement, with no limits on grades or anchoring to previous years' results. It's the free jazz of exam systems. Depending on your perspective, that's either a liberating outbreak of trust in teachers, or else it's going to mean headlines about ""Exam Chaos 2"" and massive grade inflation. Even the test papers being sent out by exam boards are optional and they won't be taken in exam halls or against the clock. The only people with exam nerves are going to be the publishers of revision guides. This is going to be another unpredictable year for exams. It could be a chance for teachers to show how an assessment system can work without huge layers of bureaucracy. And Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will be desperately hoping it's less disastrous than last year. Or it could become blighted with worries about whether some schools are awarding grades that are much more generous than others, sparking waves of angry appeals. But the exam season for 2021 is getting under way. So turn over your papers and begin. Or don't if you don't want to. There will be no fixed share of grades and schools will not be expected to keep in line with last year's results or any earlier year. The Education Policy Institute think tank has warned the plans for this year risk ""extremely high grade inflation"". But Ofqual's interim chief regulator of exams, Simon Lebus, said he did not expect ""a huge amount"" of grade inflation. ""Giving proper weight to teacher judgements is the best way of approaching a very difficult situation,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme, adding that there was ""no reason to assume [teachers'] results won't be accurate"". Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandhave already announced that exams will be replaced by teacher-assessed grades. Caitlin Orsborn, an A-level student from Rotherham said she and her friends are ""relieved"" teachers will decide their grades. Caitlin Orsborn, an A-level student from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, said she and her friends were ""relieved"" teachers would decide their grades. The 18-year-old says: ""We're all relieved this morning because we have been working towards nothing for two months."" She believes teacher-awarded results are the ""best way"" for students to be graded this year, explaining that ""being in and out of school so sporadically has really affected so many students' level of work and mental health"". ""So to make exams compulsory, in my eyes, was never a good idea,"" she adds. Read more about what students make of the plan The Education Policy Institute warned of a ""high risk of inconsistencies"" between schools - and if there are large numbers of successful appeals or widespread grade inflation it could be difficult for universities and employers to distinguish between applicants. But the ASCL head teachers' union supported giving schools ""flexibility over the assessments they use"". While the National Education Union said it was probably the ""least worst option available"". Parenting charity Parentkind said ""teacher assessment is, under the circumstances, the fairest way to test pupils"". Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said delays to deciding a replacement for exams had ""created needless stress for pupils, parents and teachers"". Are you a teacher or a student?

"David Solomon Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon has rejected remote working as a ânew normalâ and labelled it an âaberrationâ instead. Mr Solomon said the investment bank had operated throughout 2020 with âless than 10% of our peopleâ in the office. His eagerness for workers to return to the office is at odds with many other firms, who have suggested that working from home could become permanent. Mr Solomon suggested that it does not suit the work culture at Goldman Sachs. Microsoft makes remote work option permanent Home working increases cyber-security fears 'Working alongside strangers online helps me focus' âI do think for a business like ours, which is an innovative, collaborative apprenticeship culture, this is not ideal for us. And itâs not a new normal. Itâs an aberration that weâre going to correct as soon as possible,â he told a conference on Wednesday. ""I'm really not looking forward to going back into the office,"" Tom, a 35-year-old who works in urban planning, told the BBC. He has enjoyed being more involved with his young children during the pandemic. But his employer is quite ""stubborn"" about wanting him back in five days a week. ""I have found the lack of understanding and support from the older generation of directors, as well as their eagerness to just go back to offices and not learn lessons really difficult."" He says his employer seems to assume there will be someone at home to cover childcare and other day-to-day demands, whereas the tech industry, where his wife works, allows more flexibility. Tom is now looking for a new job that will offer him more choice. ""The best-case scenario for me would be two days in the office - to get that connection with colleagues - and two to three days at home."" In particular Mr Solomon was worried about an incoming âclassâ of about 3,000 new recruits, who wouldnât get the âdirect mentorshipâ they need. âI am very focused on the fact that I donât want another class of young people arriving at Goldman Sachs in the summer remotely,â he said. Although he thought the Covid-19 pandemic had helped push the adoption of digital technologies and created ways for the investment bank to run more efficiently, Mr Solomon thought it would not lead to huge changes over the longer term. This video can not be played How to combat back pain while working from home âI donât think as we get out of the pandemic the overall operating mode of the way a business like ours operates will be vastly different,â he said. Within the finance sector, it appears Mr Solomon is not alone. In September, JP Morganâs chief executive Jamie Dimon said that working from home has had a negative effect on productivity. Barclays boss Jes Staley also expressed hope recently that the vaccine would allow employees to return to the office. However, more recently Lloyds Banking Group said it planned to cut the amount of office space it uses by 20% within three years, and HSBC has announced a 40% cut in its office footprint. Tech companies, also appear to be more enthusiastic about work from home arrangements. Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter have all said staff would have the option to work from home permanently. Facebook has suggested that up to half of its staff could work remotely within five to ten years. But the social media giant has also hinted that remote workers might receive lower pay, as their expenses would be less away from San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

"There will be optional question papers for each subject set by exam boards GCSEs and A-levels cancelled in England by the pandemic will be replaced by grades decided by teachers, the exams watchdog Ofqual has confirmed. Schools can determine grades this summer by using a combination of mock exams, coursework and essays. There will be optional assessments set by exam boards for all subjects, but they will not be taken in exam conditions nor decide final grades. Results will be published earlier in August to allow time to appeal. Schools minister Nick Gibb said the government had devised ""the best system possible to ensure there is consistency and fairness in how teachers submit grades for their students"". Asked whether he accepted grades would be inflated this year, he told BBC Breakfast the government had put in place ""different checking mechanisms"" to ensure there was ""consistency"". He added ministers had devised the ""best system possible"" to ensure ""fairly awarded grades at a time when we don't think it's fair for [students] to sit the exams in the normal way."" This video can not be played Schools minister Nick Gibb: 'There will be consistency and fairness' Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnsontweeted,externalon Thursday that ""no child should be left behind as a result of learning lost during the pandemic"", which was why government had devised a ""fair and flexible system"" that would ensure all young people ""can progress to the next stage of their education or career"". The new arrangements, which will be set out by Education Secretary Gavin Williamson in the House of Commons later, come after a consultation into how best to assess pupils after months of school and college closures. The story of the big U-turn of the summer 'Has all my work gone down the drain?' Gavin Williamson: How has he survived? Last summer, thousands of A-level students had their results downgraded from school estimates by a controversial algorithm, beforeOfqual announced a U-turn which allowed them to use teachers' predictions instead. There will be no fixed share of grades and schools will not be expected to keep in line with last year's results or any earlier year. But the Education Policy Institute think tank has warned the plans for this year risk ""extremely high grade inflation"". Scotland,WalesandNorthern Irelandhave already announced that exams will be replaced by teacher-assessed grades. After last year's chaos, the exams watchdog Ofqual and the Department for Education say there will be no algorithm calculating results. Instead, the grading system will be built around teachers' judgements - with schools allowed to decide on the evidence to be used, such as mock exams, coursework and essays. There will be no algorithm used this year for results, after protests and U-turns last year If students are unhappy at the outcome of what their school and teachers have decided, they can appeal, with no financial charge expected. For those still wanting to take written papers, there will be an option of exams in the autumn. A-level results day will be 10 August, with GCSEs results given out on 12 August. They are earlier this year to create a ""buffer"" for appeals, ahead of decisions over university places in the autumn. Students awaiting the result of an appeal before being granted a university place will be prioritised under this year's system, Mr Gibb said on Thursday. Before the end of the school year, teachers can tell pupils how they got on in the test papers set by exam boards - but not their final grades. There will be test papers set by exam boards for each subject, which are intended to inform the judgement of teachers, but will not decide the final grades. These have been labelled ""mini-exams"", but Ofqual says the tests, which will be optional for schools to use, should not be seen as exams.

"Primark stores have been hit hard by lockdown Fast fashion chain Primark hopes to offload millions of pounds worth of last year's clothing stock when its shops reopen in England on 12 April. The High Street giant does not offer online sales and says it expects to have lost Â£1.1bn in sales due to the latest lockdown closures. It plans to sell more than Â£400m of last year's stock to help plug the gap. The chain said its stores would also offer new ranges for all the new seasons, including this spring. Primark said its 153 stores would reopen in England on 12 April, and in Scotland on 26 April. Unlike rivals, the retailer had no online operation to shift stock when stores were closed during lockdowns. But Primark is not set up to sell online, and has said the costs involved in distribution and  sales online would mean price rises for customers. Primark's Â£1.1bn sales drop contrasts with online only fashion retailers such as Asos and Boohoo, whose sales rose by around 40% in the last four months of 2020. Primark owner Associated British Foods said sales for the 24 weeks to 27 February 2021 were Â£2.2bn, compared to Â£3.7bn in the same period last year, as lockdowns and closures in the UK and Europe stopped people going to many High Street shops. Its stores have been closed in many countries across Europe, including Germany and the Netherlands. It has dates for reopening shops in those countries, but still does not know when it will reopen in Wales, the Republic of Ireland and Portugal. However, it is optimistic that customers will return to all of its stores as soon as they reopen: ""We know that people will welcome us back when we reopen,"" finance chief John Bason said. ""There is pent-up demand."" Retail sales slump in January amid lockdown 'I haven't bought clothes in a shop for years' It will be selling a mix of new and old lines for the remainder of the year as it plays catch-up. When stores reopen Primark expects to sell Â£150m of spring and summer lines that were stored in warehouses from last year. It then aims to sell Â£260m of autumn and winter stock such as jeans and jumpers next season. This is unusual in the fashion world, where unsold stock is usually sold off in end-of-season sales, and has in the past even been burnt or sent to landfill, to make space for new ranges. Primark says it does not burn or bin any unsold stock but instead normally donates it to charity. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the closures of the Primark estate were ""costing a pretty penny"". ""However, the retail chain is a force to be reckoned with,"" she said. ""When previous lockdowns ended we saw demand rebounded strongly."" While sales were down 15% in the last round of reopening, which ""sounds bad"", ""in reality that's an impressive recovery when you consider people had little reason to visit the High Street, and Primark's lack of online business"". ""Even more importantly, so strong is the demand for Primark's clothes, excess inventory has been less of a problem during the pandemic, because more of it flies off the shelf than expected once the doors open,"" she said. In the past Primark has said it won't sell online because the cost of manning the operation and processing high volumes of returns would mean it could no longer offer low prices. Being in fast fashion means it has low margins, so ""they have to be very competitive on price,"" Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director at GlobalData told the BBC in January. Online players like Asos and Boohoo were ""geared up for it in terms of logistics"". ""But Primark would be starting from scratch, and would have to integrate any new online operation with its existing store structure which would be costly."" However Retail Economics' Richard Lim said Primark was at risk of ""potentially alienating its customers"" who increasingly expect to be able to shop online. Customers would be finding new ways of shopping with rivals, he said. Primark's performance meant owner-Associated British Foods' first half sales and earnings would be lower than the previous year, the company said. But Associated British Foods has a grocery division, with brands that include Kingsmill bread, Twinings tea and Ovaltine, as well as major sugar, agriculture and ingredients businesses. These fared well as people stocked up during lockdown. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: ""Primark store closures are inevitably punching a hole in profits, but the diversified nature of the business is serving AB Foods well. ""Changing habits arising from the pandemic have boosted other parts of the business.""

"This video can not be played The former chancellor Philip Hammond says ministers will not be able to stick to pre-pandemic spending plans. Former Chancellor Lord Hammond has said the government must risk unpopularity and tell ""some difficult home truths"" about the state of the economy. He told the BBC that dealing with the pandemic had been the financial equivalent of ""fighting a war"". But giving money away was easier than collecting it for ""a populist government"", he added. A No 10 spokeswoman said she ""doesn't recognise"" his characterisation of a government reluctant to be unpopular. She added that the pandemic had shown Boris Johnson was ""a prime minister that is prepared to take difficult decisions and is weighing up very hard choices at the moment"". The Budget on Wednesday comes amid rising unemployment and follows the biggest UK annual economic shrinkage on record. Lockdown should ease to help economy - Hammond UK faces 1980s-levels of jobless - ex-chancellors How much will coronavirus cost the UK? In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Hammond - who resigned as chancellor when Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019 - said the economy had taken a ""huge hit"" from Covid-19, but should ""bounce back"". There had been ""long-term scarring"", with sectors like aviation and hospitality suffering ""permanent damage"", and transport and retail ""changed forever"", he added. Official figures show the UKeconomy contracted by 9.9%in 2020 - more than twice as much as in any previous year on record. On Tuesday, it was revealed unemployment hadrisen to 5.1%in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015. And the national debt - worsened by furlough, other pandemic help schemes and falling tax takes - stands atmore than Â£2 trillion. Lord Hammond said it was unlikely in the ""foreseeable future"" that ministers would be able to ""do anything that will actually see the debt starting to fall"". ""But what matters is not the absolute size of the debt, but the size of the debt relative to our economy,"" he said. ""If we can grow the British economy over the coming years, then just as we did after the Second World War, we can make the debt fade in significance, because, although it stays the same in absolute terms, it becomes a much smaller percentage of our national economy."" Philip Hammond has never been Boris Johnson's number one fan, to put it mildly. They clashed on Brexit, with the former chancellor being booted out of Parliamentary Conservative Party during the wild political autumn of 2019. But even though he is back in the party fold, and with the ermine of a Tory member of the House of Lords no less, the former occupant of No 11 isn't mincing his words. While he sticks to the broad consensus backing the government's massive emergency economic support during the pandemic, Lord Hammond looks very pointedly to the challenges that will come next, questioning whether Downing Street will have the right priorities. His not very subtle implication: Downing Street would rather be popular than do the right thing. Read more from Laura here. Lord Hammond said the challenge facing the government was ""how to move out of this crisis period"". He praised Mr Sunak for getting the economic response right so far and said he was ""very confident"" his instincts were ""the right ones"". But he said his fear was ""that as a populist government, giving money away is always easier than collecting it in"", and warned that ministers had ""made very extravagant commitments to the British electorate in good faith before the coronavirus crisis"". ""Not all of those commitments can now sensibly be delivered on and that's going to be a big challenge for a government that regards its short-term popularity as very, very important,"" Lord Hammond added. He said he was ""not sure"" the current ""top leadership"" had the ""appetite for being unpopular, in order to do the right thing"". The prime minister has said the chancellor will set out the government's plans to ""build back better"" in next Wednesday's Budget. Mr Sunak has promised to lay out the ""support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery"", adding: ""I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy."" A Treasury spokesman added: ""The chancellor has always put protecting jobs and livelihoods at the heart of everything he has done and that will not change. ""This Budget will give people the reassurance they need in the immediate term, and he will be honest with the British people about how we are going to recover beyond this crisis."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""not the time"" for tax increases for individuals or businesses, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic. James Green, who runs the Whitstable Oyster Company in Kent, says the impact of the pandemic has been ""tough"". ""Obviously there's Covid-19 at the beginning of the year, which affected us, the restaurant side of the business and the oyster sales. We were open over the summer. We were busy, like most coastal places, and then we shut again in November."" But Mr Green adds: ""For the oyster side of the business the impact of Brexit is probably had more of an effect than Covid-19, I would say."" As a result of Britain leaving the single market, he says he has tons of oysters sitting on his farm that he cannot sell either to France or domestically. Mr Green says the chancellor should give the shellfish industry ""some help to get us through now - otherwise there won't be one"".

"About 29 million people in the UK may be entitled to compensation of up to Â£30 each if a legal claim from watchdog Which? is successful. It is suing chipmaker Qualcomm, claiming it breached UK competition law by taking advantage of its dominance in the patent licensing and chip markets. Which? alleges that it charged inflated fees to manufacturers, which were then passed on to consumers in the form of higher smartphone prices. Qualcomm said the case had ""no basis"". ""As the plaintiffs are well aware, their claims were effectively put to rest last summer by a unanimous panel of judges at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States,"" a spokesman told the BBC. Which? is seeking damages for all affected Apple and Samsung smartphones purchased since 1 October 2015. It estimates individuals could be entitled to up to Â£30 compensation each, depending on the type of smartphone they bought. Anabel Hoult, chief executive of Which? said: ""We believe Qualcomm's practices are anti-competitive and have so far taken around Â£480m from consumers' pockets - this needs to stop. ""We are sending a clear warning that if companies like Qualcomm indulge in manipulative practices which harm consumers, Which? is prepared to take action."" It has filed its legal claim with the Competition Appeal Tribunal, which will decide if it can go ahead. Qualcomm has been a dominant player in the mobile chip industry Qualcomm, one of the world's biggest producers of mobile phone chips, has faced a series of allegations about anti-competitive behaviour. In 2018, the European Commission fined the firm â¬997m (Â£858m) for violating competition laws in a series of deals it made with Apple. And in 2019, it issued another â¬242m fine for abusing its dominant position in the 3G chipset market, following a four-year investigation. Qualcomm is appealing against both findings. The Federal Trade Commission in the United States also sued the firm for unfair practices in the way it licensed its technology back in 2017, but had its case dismissed last year.

These have been labelled ""mini-exams"", but Ofqual says the tests, which will be optional for schools to use, should not be seen as exams. Assessments will be in classrooms rather than exam halls Question papers, which could be from previous exams, will be sent to schools before the Easter holidays and can be taken before 18 June, when schools have to submit grades to exam boards. The intention is that regardless of how much time pupils might have missed out of school, they will have questions on a topic they will have studied. These tests will be taken in class rather than exam halls, there is no fixed time limit for their duration and they will be marked by teachers. There will be no fixed share of grades - and schools will not be expected to keep in line with last year's results or any earlier year. Instead teachers will be expected to award grades based on their professional judgement, drawing on whatever evidence is available. This is the second year of exam results being disrupted by the pandemic Schools will be given detailed information about grading and will be expected to ensure consistency between teachers. Exam boards will check random samples and if there are specific concerns about unusual results, they can investigate and change grades. Teachers' grades will be used to replace written vocational exams, in the same way as GCSEs and A-levels. But where there are practical, hands-on skills to be tested, such as for a professional qualification, some of these exams will continue in a Covid-safe way. The results of some vocational qualifications will be released in the week of 9 August. Caitlyn in Wigan, aged 15, is taking nine GCSEs and has been studying at home where it's hard to concentrate and the wi-fi keeps crashing. She is glad she won't have to sit exams. Caitlyn is relieved not to be taking exams this summer after missing so much school ""You feel relief because there's not so much pressure,"" she says, especially when they had missed so much time in school. ""It's not the same as face-to face interactions with teachers,"" she says. The mock exams she sat in November she found particularly hard. ""You had that fear of going into a hall with 200 people around you. ""It was really stressful as obviously, we'd been online learning so then you had to quickly cram everything in which made quite a few people drained."" Kori is worried that how this year's results will be treated when students have not taken exams Kori from Blackburn, aged 16, is taking five GCSES. He says learning from home was ""in a way better for me, so I could concentrate and there was no-one to distract me"". Although he did miss the support of teachers when he got stuck. Kori feels the assessments, the so-called ""mini exams"", that will be offered ""are going to be better for me"". Although he worries all the pupils this year might be judged unfairly because they didn't sit the full exams. The Education Policy Institute warned of a ""high risk of inconsistencies"" between schools - and if there are large numbers of successful appeals or widespread grade inflation it could be difficult for universities and employers to distinguish between applicants. But the ASCL head teachers' union supported giving schools ""flexibility over the assessments they use"". While the National Education Union said it was probably the ""least worst option available"". Parenting charity Parentkind said ""teacher assessment is, under the circumstances, the fairest way to test pupils"". Labour's Shadow Education Secretary Kate Green said delays to deciding a replacement for exams had ""created needless stress for pupils, parents and teachers"". Are you a teacher or a student?

"The 50p coins were designed by paleo-artist Robert Nicholls The life of 19th Century fossil hunter Mary Anning is being celebrated with a new commemorative 50p coin collection. Anning discovered Jurassic skeletons in her hometown of Lyme Regis, Dorset, which helped change long-held thinking about prehistoric life.

The collection will depict a temnodontosaurus - a large-jawed marine reptile, a plesiosaurus - a large marine sauropterygian reptile, and a dimorphodon - a small flying reptile. Mary Anning lived in the small Dorset town of Lyme Regis until her death in 1847, aged 47 Anning, who was born in 1799, was the child of a poor family and had nine siblings when she started helping her father collect fossils which he sold to tourists.

"This video can not be played The former chancellor Philip Hammond says ministers will not be able to stick to pre-pandemic spending plans. Former Chancellor Lord Hammond has said the government must risk unpopularity and tell ""some difficult home truths"" about the state of the economy. He told the BBC that dealing with the pandemic had been the financial equivalent of ""fighting a war"". But giving money away was easier than collecting it for ""a populist government"", he added. A No 10 spokeswoman said she ""doesn't recognise"" his characterisation of a government reluctant to be unpopular. She added that the pandemic had shown Boris Johnson was ""a prime minister that is prepared to take difficult decisions and is weighing up very hard choices at the moment"". The Budget on Wednesday comes amid rising unemployment and follows the biggest UK annual economic shrinkage on record. Lockdown should ease to help economy - Hammond UK faces 1980s-levels of jobless - ex-chancellors How much will coronavirus cost the UK? In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Hammond - who resigned as chancellor when Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019 - said the economy had taken a ""huge hit"" from Covid-19, but should ""bounce back"". There had been ""long-term scarring"", with sectors like aviation and hospitality suffering ""permanent damage"", and transport and retail ""changed forever"", he added. Official figures show the UKeconomy contracted by 9.9%in 2020 - more than twice as much as in any previous year on record. On Tuesday, it was revealed unemployment hadrisen to 5.1%in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015. And the national debt - worsened by furlough, other pandemic help schemes and falling tax takes - stands atmore than Â£2 trillion. Lord Hammond said it was unlikely in the ""foreseeable future"" that ministers would be able to ""do anything that will actually see the debt starting to fall"". ""But what matters is not the absolute size of the debt, but the size of the debt relative to our economy,"" he said. ""If we can grow the British economy over the coming years, then just as we did after the Second World War, we can make the debt fade in significance, because, although it stays the same in absolute terms, it becomes a much smaller percentage of our national economy."" Philip Hammond has never been Boris Johnson's number one fan, to put it mildly. They clashed on Brexit, with the former chancellor being booted out of Parliamentary Conservative Party during the wild political autumn of 2019. But even though he is back in the party fold, and with the ermine of a Tory member of the House of Lords no less, the former occupant of No 11 isn't mincing his words. While he sticks to the broad consensus backing the government's massive emergency economic support during the pandemic, Lord Hammond looks very pointedly to the challenges that will come next, questioning whether Downing Street will have the right priorities. His not very subtle implication: Downing Street would rather be popular than do the right thing. Read more from Laura here. Lord Hammond said the challenge facing the government was ""how to move out of this crisis period"". He praised Mr Sunak for getting the economic response right so far and said he was ""very confident"" his instincts were ""the right ones"". But he said his fear was ""that as a populist government, giving money away is always easier than collecting it in"", and warned that ministers had ""made very extravagant commitments to the British electorate in good faith before the coronavirus crisis"". ""Not all of those commitments can now sensibly be delivered on and that's going to be a big challenge for a government that regards its short-term popularity as very, very important,"" Lord Hammond added. He said he was ""not sure"" the current ""top leadership"" had the ""appetite for being unpopular, in order to do the right thing"". The prime minister has said the chancellor will set out the government's plans to ""build back better"" in next Wednesday's Budget. Mr Sunak has promised to lay out the ""support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery"", adding: ""I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy."" A Treasury spokesman added: ""The chancellor has always put protecting jobs and livelihoods at the heart of everything he has done and that will not change. ""This Budget will give people the reassurance they need in the immediate term, and he will be honest with the British people about how we are going to recover beyond this crisis."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""not the time"" for tax increases for individuals or businesses, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic. James Green, who runs the Whitstable Oyster Company in Kent, says the impact of the pandemic has been ""tough"". ""Obviously there's Covid-19 at the beginning of the year, which affected us, the restaurant side of the business and the oyster sales. We were open over the summer. We were busy, like most coastal places, and then we shut again in November."" But Mr Green adds: ""For the oyster side of the business the impact of Brexit is probably had more of an effect than Covid-19, I would say."" As a result of Britain leaving the single market, he says he has tons of oysters sitting on his farm that he cannot sell either to France or domestically. Mr Green says the chancellor should give the shellfish industry ""some help to get us through now - otherwise there won't be one"".

"Alum Rock has seen some of the lowest levels of vaccine uptake in Birmingham Alum Rock is an inner city suburb of Birmingham. It is deprived and ethnically diverse, with a large Pakistani community. The area has seen high rates of infection and yet it has among the lowest number of people coming forward for vaccination. Just six in 10 of those aged over 80 have had the jab. A few miles to the north is Sutton Four Oaks, an affluent area with detached houses and tree-lined streets. Infection rates have been three times lower in recent weeks, but close to 95% of over-80s have been vaccinated. Local MP Liam Byrne spoke about the problem in the House of Commons this week. It is, he told MPs, ""a story of two nations - rich and poor"". This is not unique to Birmingham. It is a pattern that is being repeated across the country. The people who are most at risk from the virus are the ones, it seems, who are least likely to come forward for vaccination. Detailed data on uptake down to a community level is not being published by the government to the frustration of many - the figures for Birmingham were published by the council. But what information is available suggests the poorest and most ethnically diverse communities (there is a huge overlap between the two) are seeing the lowest levels of uptake. Sir Sam Everington, who is a GP in the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, one of the poorest areas in the city, says he has seen this pattern emerging, which he describes as ""enormously worrying"". He believes the vaccination programme needs to be taken out into local communities more, instead of relying on mass vaccination centres and large community hubs. He would like to see local GPs, nurses and the community working hand-in-hand, taking the vaccine out into community settings. It is, to be fair, something that has already been recognised by the government. It has provided Â£23 million of funding under the Covid Champions Fund, to help councils address some of the problems. Councils like Birmingham are using it to work with community leaders, training them to speak informatively and confidently about the benefit of vaccination. Some areas are setting up pop-up clinics in neighbourhoods where uptake is low. They have been run in mosques, churches and community halls. But there is a barrage of misinformation out there, with videos and information circulating on the internet and social media claiming the vaccines cause fertility problems, contain animal products and even alter a person's DNA. The Center for Countering Digital Hateestimates,externalthat the biggest English-language anti-vaxxers social media accounts enjoy a global following of 59 million, with the top 147 accounts increasing their reach by nearly a fifth in the last year. These myths need busting. But Dr Farzana Hussain, of the NHS Confederation, which represents GPs in charge of the vaccination programme, says it is also important to recognise people have legitimate ""questions and fears"" too that they want addressing. ""It is not always resistance. It's been rolled out very quickly - [they ask] how can it be safe?"" But this is not just about vaccination. It has been well-documented that those in more deprived and ethnically diverse communities have been at greater risk from the virus. Work by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) shows that those living in the most deprived neighbourhoods have been more than twice as likely to die from Covid as those in the least deprived - the reasons for this are complex, ranging from greater exposure to higher levels of poor health. And that is likely to continue. Infection rates are still circulating at higher levels in the poorest neighbourhoods. React, one of the government's surveillance programmes, showed that when the second wave peaked in January, infection rates were 50% higher in the most deprived areas than in the least deprived. Ethnic minority groups were twice as likely to be infected than their white peers. Dr Sakthi Karunanithi, director of public health in Lancashire, believes this combination of lower vaccine uptake and higher infection levels could further ""entrench inequalities"" for years to come, with the virus clustering in the most deprived neighbourhoods. He wants the government to ""progressively advantage"" such communities when it comes to the response to Covid. He says this could include everything from prioritisation in vaccination rollout, to better financial support to self-isolate, pointing out they work in higher risk professions where they have more frequent contacts, and are less able to work from home. Without this, Dr Karunanithi is concerned that deprived areas face the prospect of cases rising when lockdown lifts or having tougher restrictions for longer, further disadvantaging communities. Analysis by the Health Foundation,externalhas shown that even before the pandemic, people in the poorest tenth of the country were three times more likely to die prematurely than some in the richest tenth. The pattern emerging with Covid, the think-tank warned, was likely to increase that gap even further. This is a ""real risk"", says Prof Jackie Cassell, a public health expert at the University of Brighton. ""The government is talking about the civic duty of people to do their bit, but that is harder for some than others."" She says there are so many complex factors at play. ""If you haven't got a car or you are in ill health, it may not be easy to get to a vaccination centre. We can't assume it is because people do not want to be vaccinated - it may be about access. ""And if you live in crowded housing, are on a zero-hours contract or have to provide care to an elderly relative, isolating when you have symptoms is not easy. If we don't find a way to address these challenges, it will be devastating for the most deprived. They will be left behind.""

"This video can not be played The former chancellor Philip Hammond says ministers will not be able to stick to pre-pandemic spending plans. Former Chancellor Lord Hammond has said the government must risk unpopularity and tell ""some difficult home truths"" about the state of the economy. He told the BBC that dealing with the pandemic had been the financial equivalent of ""fighting a war"". But giving money away was easier than collecting it for ""a populist government"", he added. A No 10 spokeswoman said she ""doesn't recognise"" his characterisation of a government reluctant to be unpopular. She added that the pandemic had shown Boris Johnson was ""a prime minister that is prepared to take difficult decisions and is weighing up very hard choices at the moment"". The Budget on Wednesday comes amid rising unemployment and follows the biggest UK annual economic shrinkage on record. Lockdown should ease to help economy - Hammond UK faces 1980s-levels of jobless - ex-chancellors How much will coronavirus cost the UK? In an interview with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Lord Hammond - who resigned as chancellor when Boris Johnson became prime minister in 2019 - said the economy had taken a ""huge hit"" from Covid-19, but should ""bounce back"". There had been ""long-term scarring"", with sectors like aviation and hospitality suffering ""permanent damage"", and transport and retail ""changed forever"", he added. Official figures show the UKeconomy contracted by 9.9%in 2020 - more than twice as much as in any previous year on record. On Tuesday, it was revealed unemployment hadrisen to 5.1%in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015. And the national debt - worsened by furlough, other pandemic help schemes and falling tax takes - stands atmore than Â£2 trillion. Lord Hammond said it was unlikely in the ""foreseeable future"" that ministers would be able to ""do anything that will actually see the debt starting to fall"". ""But what matters is not the absolute size of the debt, but the size of the debt relative to our economy,"" he said. ""If we can grow the British economy over the coming years, then just as we did after the Second World War, we can make the debt fade in significance, because, although it stays the same in absolute terms, it becomes a much smaller percentage of our national economy."" Philip Hammond has never been Boris Johnson's number one fan, to put it mildly. They clashed on Brexit, with the former chancellor being booted out of Parliamentary Conservative Party during the wild political autumn of 2019. But even though he is back in the party fold, and with the ermine of a Tory member of the House of Lords no less, the former occupant of No 11 isn't mincing his words. While he sticks to the broad consensus backing the government's massive emergency economic support during the pandemic, Lord Hammond looks very pointedly to the challenges that will come next, questioning whether Downing Street will have the right priorities. His not very subtle implication: Downing Street would rather be popular than do the right thing. Read more from Laura here. Lord Hammond said the challenge facing the government was ""how to move out of this crisis period"". He praised Mr Sunak for getting the economic response right so far and said he was ""very confident"" his instincts were ""the right ones"". But he said his fear was ""that as a populist government, giving money away is always easier than collecting it in"", and warned that ministers had ""made very extravagant commitments to the British electorate in good faith before the coronavirus crisis"". ""Not all of those commitments can now sensibly be delivered on and that's going to be a big challenge for a government that regards its short-term popularity as very, very important,"" Lord Hammond added. He said he was ""not sure"" the current ""top leadership"" had the ""appetite for being unpopular, in order to do the right thing"". The prime minister has said the chancellor will set out the government's plans to ""build back better"" in next Wednesday's Budget. Mr Sunak has promised to lay out the ""support we'll provide through the remainder of the pandemic and our recovery"", adding: ""I know how incredibly tough the past year has been for everyone, and every job lost is a personal tragedy."" A Treasury spokesman added: ""The chancellor has always put protecting jobs and livelihoods at the heart of everything he has done and that will not change. ""This Budget will give people the reassurance they need in the immediate term, and he will be honest with the British people about how we are going to recover beyond this crisis."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""not the time"" for tax increases for individuals or businesses, given the ongoing impact of the pandemic. James Green, who runs the Whitstable Oyster Company in Kent, says the impact of the pandemic has been ""tough"". ""Obviously there's Covid-19 at the beginning of the year, which affected us, the restaurant side of the business and the oyster sales. We were open over the summer. We were busy, like most coastal places, and then we shut again in November."" But Mr Green adds: ""For the oyster side of the business the impact of Brexit is probably had more of an effect than Covid-19, I would say."" As a result of Britain leaving the single market, he says he has tons of oysters sitting on his farm that he cannot sell either to France or domestically. Mr Green says the chancellor should give the shellfish industry ""some help to get us through now - otherwise there won't be one"".

"Facebook has overturned a decision to block news on its platform in Australia Australia has passed a world-first law aimed at making Google and Facebook pay for news content on their platforms. The legislation had been fiercely opposed by the US tech giants, with Facebook blocking all news content to Australians over the row. Facebook agreed to reverse its decision after robust negotiations with the government, which led to changes to the law to address some of their concerns. The law is seen as a test case for similar regulation around the world. The amended legislation - the News Media Bargaining Code - was passed by Australia's House of Representatives on Thursday, after earlier going through the Senate. What happened after Facebook blocked news in Australia? Facebook v Australia: Two sides to the story Facebook and Google had earlier argued the law ""fundamentally"" misunderstands how the internet works. The news code encourages tech giants and news organisations to negotiate payment deals between themselves, and commits Facebook and Google to invest tens of millions of dollars in local digital content. If negotiations fail, an independent arbitrator can set the price they pay domestic media - something analysts say benefits the news groups. The government argues this prescribes a ""fairer"" negotiation process between the parties, as it gives news organisations more leverage. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) - a market regulator - says publishers have had little negotiating power until now because they are so reliant on tech monopolies like Google and Facebook. It follows an investigation by the commission into the tech firms' online advertising dominance, which showed that in 2018 for every A$100 (Â£56; â¬65) spent by Australian advertisers, A$49 went to Google and A$24 to Facebook. This video can not be played Australians react to Facebook's news ban (18 February) The code also forces tech platforms to give notice to news publishers of changes to their algorithms, which decides which stories are being displayed. The amended law also now requires the government to consider a platform's existing contributions to journalism - such as commercial deals with publishers - before applying the code to them. This means Facebook and Google could escape the arbitration process entirely. The government also has to give a platform a month's notice if it is considering applying the code. The tech firms argue they already help news publishers by driving traffic back to news sites from their platforms. Facebook and Google simply help people find news content in the first place, the platforms say. How Facebook became the 'absent editor' in newsrooms Both tech companies lobbied the Australian government to amend the law, while also pursuing contracts with local news companies. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his government was not intimidated by the tech firms' threats Google had threatened to withdraw its primary search engine from Australia, but the company recently agreed deals with local media companies including Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media worth an estimated A$60m ($47m; Â£34m) in total. It has also signed a deal for an undisclosed sum with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. In a statement on Tuesday, Facebook promised to reverse its ban on news content, however Australian news pages remain unavailable. Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ban would be lifted on Friday. Facebook has since signed at least one deal - with Seven West Media - and is in talks other Australian news groups. Both firms have also committed to spending $1bn each in the news industry globally over the next three years. When Facebook decided to restore news content in Australia, the big question became who blinked first: Australia or the tech giant? But this was really a major face-saving exercise. The government - which was blindsided by the social media company - can say triumphantly that it convinced Facebook to reverse its decision. Facebook - which has done its reputation much damage globally by the move - can also claim it brought the highest levels of government to the negotiating table, and gained crucial amendments to a law it deeply disliked. Compromise seems to be a key word here. But this whole stand-off isn't just about power - it's essentially about precedent. The world is watching this closely. And if Australia's move works, you can be sure that other countries will want to start their own negotiations. Facebook's black-out of Australian news content in past week has triggered harsh criticism, both in Australia and globally. The company has admitted it overstepped in also removing over 100 non-news pages, including key health and emergency agencies. But its powerful action has been interpreted as a warning shot to lawmakers elsewhere - such as in Canada, the UK and the EU - who have expressed interest in Australia's law. As more news readership has shifted online, tech giants have faced calls internationally to pay more for news stories hosted on their platforms. They have also faced increased scrutiny over their power, including calls for them to do more to combat misinformation and abuse.

"David Solomon Goldman Sachs boss David Solomon has rejected remote working as a ânew normalâ and labelled it an âaberrationâ instead. Mr Solomon said the investment bank had operated throughout 2020 with âless than 10% of our peopleâ in the office. His eagerness for workers to return to the office is at odds with many other firms, who have suggested that working from home could become permanent. Mr Solomon suggested that it does not suit the work culture at Goldman Sachs. Microsoft makes remote work option permanent Home working increases cyber-security fears 'Working alongside strangers online helps me focus' âI do think for a business like ours, which is an innovative, collaborative apprenticeship culture, this is not ideal for us. And itâs not a new normal. Itâs an aberration that weâre going to correct as soon as possible,â he told a conference on Wednesday. ""I'm really not looking forward to going back into the office,"" Tom, a 35-year-old who works in urban planning, told the BBC. He has enjoyed being more involved with his young children during the pandemic. But his employer is quite ""stubborn"" about wanting him back in five days a week. ""I have found the lack of understanding and support from the older generation of directors, as well as their eagerness to just go back to offices and not learn lessons really difficult."" He says his employer seems to assume there will be someone at home to cover childcare and other day-to-day demands, whereas the tech industry, where his wife works, allows more flexibility. Tom is now looking for a new job that will offer him more choice. ""The best-case scenario for me would be two days in the office - to get that connection with colleagues - and two to three days at home."" In particular Mr Solomon was worried about an incoming âclassâ of about 3,000 new recruits, who wouldnât get the âdirect mentorshipâ they need. âI am very focused on the fact that I donât want another class of young people arriving at Goldman Sachs in the summer remotely,â he said. Although he thought the Covid-19 pandemic had helped push the adoption of digital technologies and created ways for the investment bank to run more efficiently, Mr Solomon thought it would not lead to huge changes over the longer term. This video can not be played How to combat back pain while working from home âI donât think as we get out of the pandemic the overall operating mode of the way a business like ours operates will be vastly different,â he said. Within the finance sector, it appears Mr Solomon is not alone. In September, JP Morganâs chief executive Jamie Dimon said that working from home has had a negative effect on productivity. Barclays boss Jes Staley also expressed hope recently that the vaccine would allow employees to return to the office. However, more recently Lloyds Banking Group said it planned to cut the amount of office space it uses by 20% within three years, and HSBC has announced a 40% cut in its office footprint. Tech companies, also appear to be more enthusiastic about work from home arrangements. Microsoft, Facebook and Twitter have all said staff would have the option to work from home permanently. Facebook has suggested that up to half of its staff could work remotely within five to ten years. But the social media giant has also hinted that remote workers might receive lower pay, as their expenses would be less away from San Francisco and Silicon Valley.

"The UK will never meet its carbon targets unless homes are better insulated, ministers have been warned. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) - an independent body which advises the UK government and devolved administrations - says the strugglingGreen Homes Grant,externalmust be rescued. The scheme offers households up to Â£10,000 to insulate their property. But many have not been able to apply because contractors were overwhelmed - and some contractors have not been paid for work done. The Times has reported that the scheme might be axed in next week's Budget. MPs criticise government home insulation programme How will we heat homes in zero carbon Britain? But CCC chief executive Chris Stark said he believed no decision to scrap it had yet been taken. However, it is clear the chancellor wants to claw back cash from an original Â£1.5bn budget, of which just Â£109m has been spent on the scheme, which currently has one more month to go. The government says Rishi Sunak will divert the under-spend into Treasury coffers, rather than keeping it for insulation. The CCC is urging him to ring-fence the money and invest it temporarily on other insulation projects, deemed to be doing well. Mr Stark said: ""There's no escaping the fact that the UK won't hit its legally binding climate change targets unless buildings are much better insulated and low-carbon heat systems are installed."" He added that ""an attractive and efficient programme for insulating homes and promoting low-carbon heating"" was needed. The CCC says the government needs to spend at least Â£2bn a year through to 2030 for badly insulated homes, with extra cash for developing low-carbon heating. The total allocated budget for home decarbonisation is around Â£3bn a year currently, but the CCC estimates a further Â£3bn a year is required. So what is gone wrong with the grant scheme? The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy blames the coronavirus pandemic, which it says has made many reluctant to welcome tradespeople into their homes. Critics say that is wrong - and that many insulation contractors have gone out of business following stop-start government incentive schemes. Questions are also being asked about ICF, the US-based consultancy that won the contract to administer the scheme. I understand the government is bound by a contract to continue with the company. But a group of trades unions has written to the chancellor complaining of what it calls damage from outsourcing. Its letter says: ""The obvious answer to administrative problems is to strengthen the Green Homes Grants scheme by bringing it under public sector management and using the experience and knowledge of local authorities. ""Instead, the rug is apparently to be pulled from under the scheme. This backtracking would call into question whether this government has any real commitment to a green recovery."" Government sources say the Treasury imposed strict conditions on administrators because it was stung by malpractice in theNorthern Ireland ""cash-for-ash"" scandal. A government spokeswoman said around 76,000 grant applications had been made, and more than 26,000 vouchers had been issued. Critics say this does not include the thousands of people who could not find a contractor. The government spokeswoman said there were 938 registered installer companies registered. But, out of 7,400 members of the Master Builders' Federation, only three had been accredited.

"Ikea will soon be selling pre-used versions of some of its best sellers If you started lockdown last year putting together a work-from-home desk, don't throw away the Allen key yet. Ikea UK is planning to launch its promised ""Buy Back"" venture shortly after retail reopens, giving you the chance to return used items if you're heading back to the office. The start of the scheme was postponed in November due to the pandemic. Financial results for last year also show UK sales and profits fell sharply after Ikea stores closed in March. Some lost custom was made up for with an expanded online service as people scrambled to refurbish their homes and gardens during lockdown. But overall revenues fell 10% in the year running from September 2019 to August 2020 and the business made a loss of Â£32.7m. Customers showed particular interest in sound absorbers and speakers, garden furniture, artificial plants and chairs and desks designed for gaming, Ikea said. Enthusiasm for Netflix series Tiger King prompted purchases of animal-themed wall art and sheepskin rugs, the firm added. Ikea to start selling spare parts for products 'I made Â£1,265 selling my clothes second-hand' Ikea to buy back used furniture in recycling push Overall online sales were 31% higher than the previous year. But the firm had to pause plans to start buying and selling second-hand items, postponing the scheme's November launch. ""Last year, Ikea was piloting Buy Back in our Edinburgh and Glasgow stores to explore how we support our customers to lead more sustainable lives, step by step,"" said Hege Saebjornsen, country sustainability manager for Ikea UK and Ireland. ""Irrespective of the trial being shorter than planned due to store closures, we believe strongly in the idea and moreover, believe that providing customers with more convenient ways to give their products a second life is the right thing to do."" He said Buy Back would launch as soon as possible after restrictions on non-essential shops were lifted, which the government has said will be some time after 12 April in England. In Scotland Ikea stores could open after 26 April. In Wales some non-essential retail may start to reopen from 15 March. Northern Ireland has not yet published a roadmap for reopening. The Buy Back scheme offers customers cashback vouchers for a range of second-hand Ikea items including bookcases, tables, chairs and chests of drawers. Upholstered items will not be included. The start of Ikea's ""Buy Back"" scheme in the UK was postponed in November due to the pandemic The venture represented a ""brave"" move, said Lucie Middlemiss, associate professor in sustainability at the University of Leeds. ""I can't imagine it generating a lot of profit,"" she said. While the number of Ikea items available for resale on platforms like eBay suggested there was a market for things like Billy bookcases and desks, it wasn't clear whether customers would be willing to take the trouble of transporting the items to stores. The items must be presented assembled, Ikea said. For larger items that could involve disassembling and flat-packing them to fit into the back of a car, before some quick work with an Allen key in the Ikea car park. Ikea deserved credit for innovating in this area said Ms Middlemiss, but offering things like replacement sofa covers, which Ikea already does, probably did more to avoid ""fast furniture"", which like ""fast fashion"" encourages customers to update their styles on a regular basis, rather than keeping items for longer. Ikea has already launched Buy Back schemes in 27 countries. In Australia, where it has operated for more than a year, more than 10,000 items have been returned. Ikea has introduced further measures to improve its green credentials from using more sustainable wood and switching to renewable energy to adding plant-based balls alongside meatballs on its canteen menus.

"The UK will never meet its carbon targets unless homes are better insulated, ministers have been warned. The Climate Change Committee (CCC) - an independent body which advises the UK government and devolved administrations - says the strugglingGreen Homes Grant,externalmust be rescued. The scheme offers households up to Â£10,000 to insulate their property. But many have not been able to apply because contractors were overwhelmed - and some contractors have not been paid for work done. The Times has reported that the scheme might be axed in next week's Budget. MPs criticise government home insulation programme How will we heat homes in zero carbon Britain? But CCC chief executive Chris Stark said he believed no decision to scrap it had yet been taken. However, it is clear the chancellor wants to claw back cash from an original Â£1.5bn budget, of which just Â£109m has been spent on the scheme, which currently has one more month to go. The government says Rishi Sunak will divert the under-spend into Treasury coffers, rather than keeping it for insulation. The CCC is urging him to ring-fence the money and invest it temporarily on other insulation projects, deemed to be doing well. Mr Stark said: ""There's no escaping the fact that the UK won't hit its legally binding climate change targets unless buildings are much better insulated and low-carbon heat systems are installed."" He added that ""an attractive and efficient programme for insulating homes and promoting low-carbon heating"" was needed. The CCC says the government needs to spend at least Â£2bn a year through to 2030 for badly insulated homes, with extra cash for developing low-carbon heating. The total allocated budget for home decarbonisation is around Â£3bn a year currently, but the CCC estimates a further Â£3bn a year is required. So what is gone wrong with the grant scheme? The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy blames the coronavirus pandemic, which it says has made many reluctant to welcome tradespeople into their homes. Critics say that is wrong - and that many insulation contractors have gone out of business following stop-start government incentive schemes. Questions are also being asked about ICF, the US-based consultancy that won the contract to administer the scheme. I understand the government is bound by a contract to continue with the company.

"About 29 million people in the UK may be entitled to compensation of up to Â£30 each if a legal claim from watchdog Which? is successful. It is suing chipmaker Qualcomm, claiming it breached UK competition law by taking advantage of its dominance in the patent licensing and chip markets. Which? alleges that it charged inflated fees to manufacturers, which were then passed on to consumers in the form of higher smartphone prices. Qualcomm said the case had ""no basis"". ""As the plaintiffs are well aware, their claims were effectively put to rest last summer by a unanimous panel of judges at the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States,"" a spokesman told the BBC. Which? is seeking damages for all affected Apple and Samsung smartphones purchased since 1 October 2015. It estimates individuals could be entitled to up to Â£30 compensation each, depending on the type of smartphone they bought. Anabel Hoult, chief executive of Which? said: ""We believe Qualcomm's practices are anti-competitive and have so far taken around Â£480m from consumers' pockets - this needs to stop. ""We are sending a clear warning that if companies like Qualcomm indulge in manipulative practices which harm consumers, Which? is prepared to take action."" It has filed its legal claim with the Competition Appeal Tribunal, which will decide if it can go ahead. Qualcomm has been a dominant player in the mobile chip industry Qualcomm, one of the world's biggest producers of mobile phone chips, has faced a series of allegations about anti-competitive behaviour. In 2018, the European Commission fined the firm â¬997m (Â£858m) for violating competition laws in a series of deals it made with Apple. And in 2019, it issued another â¬242m fine for abusing its dominant position in the 3G chipset market, following a four-year investigation. Qualcomm is appealing against both findings. The Federal Trade Commission in the United States also sued the firm for unfair practices in the way it licensed its technology back in 2017, but had its case dismissed last year.

"Facebook has overturned a decision to block news on its platform in Australia Australia has passed a world-first law aimed at making Google and Facebook pay for news content on their platforms. The legislation had been fiercely opposed by the US tech giants, with Facebook blocking all news content to Australians over the row. Facebook agreed to reverse its decision after robust negotiations with the government, which led to changes to the law to address some of their concerns. The law is seen as a test case for similar regulation around the world. The amended legislation - the News Media Bargaining Code - was passed by Australia's House of Representatives on Thursday, after earlier going through the Senate. What happened after Facebook blocked news in Australia? Facebook v Australia: Two sides to the story Facebook and Google had earlier argued the law ""fundamentally"" misunderstands how the internet works. The news code encourages tech giants and news organisations to negotiate payment deals between themselves, and commits Facebook and Google to invest tens of millions of dollars in local digital content. If negotiations fail, an independent arbitrator can set the price they pay domestic media - something analysts say benefits the news groups. The government argues this prescribes a ""fairer"" negotiation process between the parties, as it gives news organisations more leverage. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) - a market regulator - says publishers have had little negotiating power until now because they are so reliant on tech monopolies like Google and Facebook. It follows an investigation by the commission into the tech firms' online advertising dominance, which showed that in 2018 for every A$100 (Â£56; â¬65) spent by Australian advertisers, A$49 went to Google and A$24 to Facebook. This video can not be played Australians react to Facebook's news ban (18 February) The code also forces tech platforms to give notice to news publishers of changes to their algorithms, which decides which stories are being displayed. The amended law also now requires the government to consider a platform's existing contributions to journalism - such as commercial deals with publishers - before applying the code to them. This means Facebook and Google could escape the arbitration process entirely. The government also has to give a platform a month's notice if it is considering applying the code. The tech firms argue they already help news publishers by driving traffic back to news sites from their platforms. Facebook and Google simply help people find news content in the first place, the platforms say. How Facebook became the 'absent editor' in newsrooms Both tech companies lobbied the Australian government to amend the law, while also pursuing contracts with local news companies. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said his government was not intimidated by the tech firms' threats Google had threatened to withdraw its primary search engine from Australia, but the company recently agreed deals with local media companies including Nine Entertainment and Seven West Media worth an estimated A$60m ($47m; Â£34m) in total. It has also signed a deal for an undisclosed sum with Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. In a statement on Tuesday, Facebook promised to reverse its ban on news content, however Australian news pages remain unavailable. Australian Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ban would be lifted on Friday. Facebook has since signed at least one deal - with Seven West Media - and is in talks other Australian news groups. Both firms have also committed to spending $1bn each in the news industry globally over the next three years. When Facebook decided to restore news content in Australia, the big question became who blinked first: Australia or the tech giant? But this was really a major face-saving exercise. The government - which was blindsided by the social media company - can say triumphantly that it convinced Facebook to reverse its decision. Facebook - which has done its reputation much damage globally by the move - can also claim it brought the highest levels of government to the negotiating table, and gained crucial amendments to a law it deeply disliked. Compromise seems to be a key word here. But this whole stand-off isn't just about power - it's essentially about precedent. The world is watching this closely. And if Australia's move works, you can be sure that other countries will want to start their own negotiations. Facebook's black-out of Australian news content in past week has triggered harsh criticism, both in Australia and globally. The company has admitted it overstepped in also removing over 100 non-news pages, including key health and emergency agencies. But its powerful action has been interpreted as a warning shot to lawmakers elsewhere - such as in Canada, the UK and the EU - who have expressed interest in Australia's law. As more news readership has shifted online, tech giants have faced calls internationally to pay more for news stories hosted on their platforms. They have also faced increased scrutiny over their power, including calls for them to do more to combat misinformation and abuse.

"Pressure to hit school performance measures may lead some head teachers to take decisions that are not in a child's interests, a union has warned. Tim Pratt of the ASCL union believes there are some examples of pupils being removed from registers so their grades do not count towards school data. It followsconcerns about so-called ""off-rolling"" in England. The Welsh Government said any evidence would ""not be tolerated"" and this had been made ""absolutely clear"" to heads. A parliamentary committee and the English schools' inspectorate hasraised concerns about some schoolsmoving pupils from their register to other settings such as pupil referral units or home education. Those pupils' exam results would not count against the school's performance measures. The way schools are measured is different in Wales and Estyn, the inspectorate in Wales, said it discussed information about changes to pupil rolls with school heads during inspections and local council officials each term. ""In a few secondary schools where there have been significant changes to the Year 10 and/or Year 11 cohort this has been explored by inspectors and information is already used to inform our evaluations of the school,"" said a spokeswoman. ""We are currently undertaking further, more detailed analysis, at school, local authority and national level during this term."" Excluded pupils 'abandoned by schools' Autism concern over home schooling rise in Wales Are more children getting expelled? What is it like to be excluded from school? Mr Pratt, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru (ASCL) said: ""It does happen. I don't think from the evidence we have, we would regard it as a major issue but nor would we deny that in certain cases it does take place. ""Our view is that whatever happens should be in the best interests of a child. ""The pressures on a school, the pressures on school leaders might sometimes lead them to take decision that in other circumstance they wouldn't. ""That doesn't make the decision right and I think we have to keep coming back to this that from a moral point of view we have to say that whatever the circumstance, the interests of the child must come first."" But he believes changes to accountability measures being introduced by ministers should help. In the past, the percentage of pupils achieving five A* to C passes including English or Welsh and maths has been an influential measure of school performance, but that is being ditched as part of reforms. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We have been working with head teachers on a range of new interim performance measures that place a greater focus on raising our aspirations for all learners. ""These new measures will remove the narrow focus on the achievement of just C grades that has occurred as a result of the current measures and will value the progress of all pupils across the cohort. This will ensure that every child matters."" Erika Lye said it was unfair the pressures schools are under Erika Lye, who's the chair of a home education charity, is concerned about the number of young people leaving the school system late in their schooling, particularly children with additional learning needs. She believes that is partly driven by pressures on budgets and performance measures. ""Home education is a valid choice, it's a successful choice but it should be a choice. It shouldn't be something that parents are forced into. ""If they want their children in school, the state should be providing what those children need. ""It's really unfair the pressures that the schools are under, and teachers themselves are under - they need more resources - they need more support. ""Government is the one that's setting these targets and I suppose society has this expectation of performance outcomes where really you want a happy school for your child, you want an inclusive environment for your child. ""Performance outcomes really shouldn't be what you plan your child's education for. For your job, for anybody's job you're going to work to your performance targets.""
