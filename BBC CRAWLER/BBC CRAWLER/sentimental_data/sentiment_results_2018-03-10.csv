"Singer Katy Perry got caught up in a lawsuit involving two nuns and the Los Angeles Archdiocese A nun embroiled in a property dispute with singer Katy Perry collapsed and died during a court hearing on Friday, US media report. Sister Catherine Rose Holzman was 89. She was one of two nuns locked in a legal battle with Perry and the Los Angeles Archdiocese over a former convent in the city. Perry agreed to buy the property for $14.5m (Â£10.4m) in 2015, but the deal turned sour when the former residents objected. Sister Catherine Rose and Sister Rita Callanan said they were uncomfortable handing the convent and its eight surrounding acres over to the star, whose sometimes provocative hits include I Kissed A Girl and Ur So Gay. Perry reportedly visited the nuns to win them over, and is said to have shown them her tattoo of Jesus and sung a hymn for them. But the pair remained unconvinced. ""I found her videos,"" Sister Rita Callanan told the Los Angeles Times.,external""I wasn't happy with any of it."" The nuns instead sold the residence to local restaurant owner Dana Hollister, without the approval of their Archdiocese. Perry and the Catholic Church were awarded almost $10m in damages in 2017, when their lawyers successfully argued that the sisters had no right to sell the property. The nuns had failed to get the consent of Archbishop Jose Gomez and the Vatican, which must approve the sale of any property worth over $7.5m, the advocates said. Perry convent sale 'violates our vows', say nuns A jury then concluded that the restaurateur had deliberately interfered with Perry's planned purchase. The post-judgement proceedings have been put on hold following the nun's death. In a statement on Friday, Archbishop Gomez said: ""Sister Catherine Rose served the Church with dedication and love for many years, and today we remember her life with gratitude.""

"Anti-hate group Tell Mama shared a picture of a letter it said had been received by people across the UK Letters encouraging recipients to take part in ""Punish a Muslim Day"" have reportedly been sent to addresses across the country. Images of the A4 notes, which contain a list of violent acts alongside a number of points for performing them, have been widely shared online. They have prompted a chorus of condemnation, with campaigners and MPs describing them as ""disturbing"". Counter-terrorism police are treating the letters as a possible hate crime. Tell Mama UK, which monitors anti-Muslim activity, said it had received reports of people in Bradford, Leicester, London, Cardiff and Sheffield getting the letters. Allow Twitter content?

Director Iman Atta said: ""This has caused quite a lot of fear within the community. ""They are asking if they are safe, if their children are safe to play outdoors. ""We have told them to keep calm and to phone the police if they receive one of these letters."" She said a number of the letters had been posted from Sheffield and bore a similarity to letters sent to mosques in the UK and US in May 2017, which were also posted from Sheffield. ""They are inciting violence against the Muslim community,"" she said. Labour MP Naz Shah said several of her constituents in Bradford had received the ""hate mail"" through their doors. Ms Shah said the letters were an attempt to instil fear but one that would ultimately fail. ""We stand shoulder by shoulder, and stand side by side, because nothing will divide us,"" she said. ""This is hatred and it just doesn't work. You know, it's what we do.""

"This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies President Trump has tweeted that a deal with North Korea is ""very much in the making"", a day after revealing he had agreed to meet its leader Kim Jong-un. Earlier, the White House said the meeting would not take place unless Pyongyang took ""concrete actions"". US media report that Mr Trump made the decision to meet without consulting key figures in his administration, who are now scrambling to catch up. No sitting US president has ever met a North Korean leader. The tricky task of preparing for the Trump-Kim summit The political gamble of the 21st Century Mr Trump stunned observers when he agreed to the summit following an invitation delivered by South Korean envoys. Confusion mounted when Mr Trump's own press secretary, Sarah Sanders, told reporters that North Korea has ""promised to denuclearise"". She added: ""We're not going to have this meeting take place until we see concrete actions."" The top US diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was on his first official trip to Africa when the announcement was made. He told reporters on Friday the decision to meet Mr Kim was one ""the president took himself"". ""I spoke to him very early this morning about that decision and we had a very good conversation,"" Mr Tillerson added. On Saturday, Mr Tillerson cancelled all his official events in Kenyawith aides saying the secretary was ""not feeling well after a long couple days working on major issues back home such as North Korea"". South Korean envoys - who recently met with Mr Kim in Pyongyang - have said North Korea is ""committed to denuclearisation"" as an end goal, but they have not said this would start before a meeting with the US. Instead, North Korea is understood to have agreed to halt its testing programme as negotiations continue. Mr Trump tweeted that North Korea had promised not to conduct missile tests during the talks and he believed them. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There has been no mention of any meeting in North Korean media. But on Friday the Washington Post reported a statement from the North Korean ambassador to the UN in New York, who credited the developments to the ""great courageous decision of our Supreme Leader"". He added that ""peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the East Asia region"" could be secured. An initial statement from the South Korean delegation said the meeting would take place by May - but no place or date has officially been set. The Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as possible venues. Kim Jong-un unexpectedly used his New Year's message to reciprocate an offer of talks made by the South last year. This led to North Korea sending a delegation to the Winter Olympics in the South.

"Authorities in Japan have warned people of the risk of large flying rocks within 4km (2.5 miles) of an erupting volcano on Kyushu island. Mount Shinmoedake has been spewing ash for days but eruptions turned explosive very early on Saturday. Volcanic activity there could continue for several months, experts say. In the 1967 James Bond film You Only Live Twice, Mount Shinmoedake was used to depict the exterior of a criminal organisation's secret lair. On Saturday the country's meteorological agency issued new warnings, saying flying rocks could now be expected to reach a 4km radius around the volcano. People living in the area are wearing helmets to protect against the ash and potential falling rocks Aerial photos have shown the intensity of the peak's eruption The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) said large explosions happened at 01:54 local time (16:54 GMT on Friday) and at 04:27 local time. Smoke rose 4,500m (15,000ft) in the air. Vibrations have caused nearby buildings to shake, and lava is running down one side of the volcano. An eruption in 2011 causedhundreds of people to leave their homes. Japan has 110 active volcanoes.

"This video can not be played Amrik Singh told staff his turban was a religious requirement A student said he felt ""victimised"" when asked to leave a bar because he was wearing a turban. Student Amrik Singh was told that Rush in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, had a ""no headwear"" policy. Mr Singh recorded himself saying his turban is a religious requirement and is then asked: ""I didn't think you were allowed to drink anyway."" The management has apologised and said the staff involved faced suspension pending an investigation. Amrik Singh said while he was considering legal options, he hoped the case would educate people Mr Singh, 22, a law student at Nottingham Trent University, said he went to Rush with friends on Friday night. He was initially allowed in but was approached after half an hour and told he had to remove his turban. He said: ""I explained that a turban isn't just headgear, but part of my religion and that I was allowed to wear a turban in public. The bouncer ignored this and said I needed to take it off. ""I refused and was subsequently dragged away from my friends."" The bar management said they were shocked by the actions of their door staff Mr Singh said he asked to speak to whoever was in charge as he felt ""victimised"" and recorded the conversation. In this, Mr Singh repeatedly explains the significance of his turban but is told any headgear is against club policy, ""like trainers"". Mr Singh said he was eventually allowed back in but told in future he would be barred. He said: ""This experience ruined my night. It broke my heart. ""I'm very fortunate that I'm well spoken and I am able to stand up for myself. What if it was someone who wasn't confident was told to leave? I am disgusted."" Mr Singh said he had not reported the incident to police as he did not believe a law had been broken but was ""considering legal options"". However, he said he wanted the main impact of the case to be one of education ""about what is it like to be treated this way"".

"This video can not be played Home Secretary Amber Rudd says the police investigation is serious and substantial More than 240 witnesses have been identified as police investigate the Russian ex-spy poisoning ""at speed"", the home secretary has said. Amber Rudd praised the professionalism of the police who are now looking at more than 200 pieces of evidence. The investigation into the attempted murder of Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia is now in its sixth day. Meanwhile, Det Sergeant Nick Bailey, who fell ill attending the pair, has denied he is a ""hero"". Mr Bailey remains seriously ill but is awake and engaging with his family. Ms Rudd said both Col Skripal, 66, and his daughter, 33, who are being treated at Salisbury District Hospital, remain in a ""critical but stable condition"" after being exposed to a nerve agent. The pair were found unconscious on a bench in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on Sunday 4 March. Sergei Skripal - story of the man at centre of spy story Poisoning poses major challenge for MI6 Russian spy: What we know so far What are nerve agents? More than 250 counter terrorism police are now involved in what the home secretary has described as a ""major investigation"". Speaking after a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, Ms Rudd said the government was using enormous resources to try and identify those responsible for the attempted murder. ""I want to stress that they are proceeding with speed and professionalism,"" she said. More than 250 counter terrorism police are involved in the investigation She added: ""This investigation is focused on making sure that we keep people safe and also that we collect all the evidence so that when it comes to attribution [of the attack] we will be absolutely clear where it should be. ""The police have said that if anybody thinks they have any additional information they would welcome them coming forward. ""There is also substantial amounts of CCTV they have to go through. This is a painstaking, detailed investigation and the police need to be given the space and time to get on with it."" Mr Skripal was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a ""spy swap"". Russia has denied any involvement. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said the country will respond ""robustly"" if Moscow is found to have been behind the incident. The challenge for MI6 BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera Observers say that with Russia, it increasingly looks as if the intelligence agencies are happy with ""implausible deniability"" - even if it seems obvious they are behind an act, they simply say ""prove it"" and try to muddy the waters with misinformation as much as possible. If the theory of Russian revenge and message sending is correct, it raises difficult questions for British intelligence. MI6 relies on recruiting agents like Skripal in countries like Russia to provide secrets. It has always prided itself on keeping the identity of those agents secret in order to protect them. But if the perception emerges that it cannot protect those agents - even if they are in the UK - then it will make it much harder to do its job and recruit agents to gather intelligence. Poisoning poses major challenge for MI6 As part of the investigation, about 180 military personnel have been deployed to help remove vehicles and objects which may have been contaminated. They include members of the Army and RAF, Royal Marines and others who are specially trained in chemical warfare and decontamination. The troops are now spending a second day in Salisbury and have turned their attention to an ambulance station near the hospital. Military personnel in decontamination suits and masks covered a potentially contaminated ambulance with a tarpaulin as they prepared to move it from the scene. On Saturday, police were active at the cemetery where Ms Skripal's brother, Alexander Skripal, and mother, Liudmila Skripal are buried. Salisbury's London Road cemetery was cordoned off on Friday, but police confirmed officers were not exhuming a body. BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, in Salisbury This video can not be played Dominic Casciani visits the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday with his daughter It's been a busy Saturday for shoppers. What many people have been worried about is whether the city will suffer in the long-term because of its new, and unfortunate, link to an extraordinary attempted murder. City officials have already been talking to the businesses most affected by the security operation - including those still behind a police cordon at The Maltings precinct. They're hoping to give them some marketing support and other advice so they can get back on their feet once they reopen. As for the investigation, there has been virtually no discernible activity. Police were again seen this morning at the graveyard on the London Road - but nobody appears to have seen the military units which were meant to be arriving to help the police. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a park bench Alexander Skripal died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure, and his mother died of cancer in 2012. Earlier on Saturday, Irina Petrova, a childhood friend of Yulia who attended primary school with her in Russia, told the BBCshe remembered the Skripals as the ""perfect family"". Ms Petrova said Ms Skripal ""never shared her problems"" - even when her father was arrested for spying in 2004, with the incident broadcast on Russian state TV. She said ""everyone was shocked"" at the news, adding that Ms Skripal, who was visiting her father from Moscow, was a ""normal kind of person"" who enjoyed spending time in the UK and even considered applying for citizenship.

"This video can not be played The latest on the clean-up and the investigation in Salisbury Traces of the nerve agent used against former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, have been found at the restaurant where they ate on Sunday afternoon, the BBC understands. The substance was found in one part of Zizzi in Salisbury during a continuing forensic examination. The pair were found two hours after finishing their meal collapsed on a park bench. Both are critically ill. No-one who was in the restaurant at the same time is thought to be in danger. There is also no suggestion that anyone dining at the time had anything to do with the nerve agent. The restaurant is currently surrounded by a large screen while an investigation continues inside. Zizzi is one of five sites in the small Wiltshire city of Salisbury at the heart of the operation. Sergei Skripal - story of the man at centre of spy story Russian spy: What we know so far What are nerve agents? Also being investigated are the bench where the couple were found, Mr Skripal's home, the Mill pub - visited by the Skripals - and the cemetery where Mr Skripal's wife and son are buried. Soldiers are assisting police for a third day. On Saturday they took away an ambulance from a South Western Ambulance Service station. More than 250 counter terrorism police are now involved in the investigation, which has yielded 200 pieces of evidence so far and more than 240 witnesses. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are still critically ill in hospital Earlier, Home Secretary Amber Rudd praised the professionalism of the police, who she said were proceeding ""at speed"". She said the government was using ""enormous resources"" to try to identify those responsible for the attempted murder. ""This investigation is focused on making sure that we keep people safe and also that we collect all the evidence so that when it comes to attribution [of the attack] we will be absolutely clear where it should be."" This video can not be played Home Secretary Amber Rudd says the police investigation is serious and substantial ""The police have said that if anybody thinks they have any additional information they would welcome them coming forward."" She said the police were looking at ""substantial amounts"" of CCTV footage. Det Sgt Nick Bailey remains in hospital Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill attending the pair, remains seriously ill in hospital but has been talking to his family. In a statement, he said he did not ""consider himself a hero"" and was ""merely doing his job"". Joe Riddle, editor of the Salisbury Journal, said some residents were ""understandably"" scared but the majority were ""more interested in finding out what happened"" and ""frustrated"" at being ""kept in the dark"". He also told BBC Breakfast there was ""a lot of support"" for Det Sgt Bailey in the city. Marina Litvinenko, widow of murdered former KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, said it would appear lessons had not been learned from her husband's case. She said Russia had a ""bad reputation now"" but the case must be properly investigated and proven before blame is apportioned. This video can not be played Marina Litvinenko: 'Lessons haven't been learned' After a public inquiry found her husband's 2006 assassination was likely to have been ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin's orders, Mrs Litvinenko received a letter from Theresa May which said the government would ""take every step to protect the UK and its people from such a crime ever being repeated"". Mrs Litvinenko told Andew Marr: ""Unfortunately it happened again, it means something was not done and a lesson was not learned."" She also said no-one in Russia had been punished for her husband's death. An inquiry found Alexander Litvinenko's death was likely to have been ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin The Bishop of Salisbury, the Right Reverend Nicholas Holtam, said the attack on Mr Skripal and his daughter was a ""violation"" of the city. He told BBC Radio Solent prayers would be said in the cathedral for them, adding: ""It is more than an attack on individuals."" As part of the investigation, about 180 military personnel have been deployed to Salisbury to remove vehicles and objects which may have been contaminated. They include members of the Army and RAF, Royal Marines and others who are specially trained in chemical warfare and decontamination. On Saturday, police were active at the cemetery where Ms Skripal's brother, Alexander Skripal, and mother, Liudmila Skripal are buried. The challenge for MI6 BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera Observers say that with Russia, it increasingly looks as if the intelligence agencies are happy with ""implausible deniability"" - even if it seems obvious they are behind an act, they simply say ""prove it"" and try to muddy the waters with misinformation as much as possible. If the theory of Russian revenge and message sending is correct, it raises difficult questions for British intelligence. MI6 relies on recruiting agents like Skripal in countries like Russia to provide secrets. It has always prided itself on keeping the identity of those agents secret in order to protect them. But if the perception emerges that it cannot protect those agents - even if they are in the UK - then it will make it much harder to do its job and recruit agents to gather intelligence. Poisoning poses major challenge for MI6 Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a ""spy swap"". Russia has denied any involvement. UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said the country will respond ""robustly"" if Moscow is found to have been behind the incident. Salisbury's London Road cemetery has also been cordoned off but police said on Friday they were not exhuming a body. Do you have any information to share on this story?

"Sergei Skripal holding Yulia at the time of her birth with family members Sergei Skripal, the ex-Russian spy who is fighting for his life after being poisoned in Salisbury, was born in the Soviet Kaliningrad region on 23 June 1951. It was close enough to the West to pick up the sound of BBC World Service radio broadcasts and friends talk about him recalling the faint sounds. He was physically strong and chose to join the elite Soviet airborne troop known as the Desantniki. In 1979, Soviet troops went into Afghanistan and Skripal was one of the first to go in. After this, he graduated from the Diplomatic Military Academy in Moscow. Spies like us: How defectors come in from the cold Kim Philby, British double agent, reveals all in secret video Military deployed after poisoning There he seems to have been talent spotted by the GRU - Russia's military intelligence - and would embark on the second phase of his life as an intelligence officer. His initial role in the GRU was in its First Directorate, which focused on spying in Europe. This gave him the chance to serve overseas for military intelligence under cover as a diplomat. Friends say he later spoke of this period with excitement, recalling jumping out of a plane in Afghanistan. Sergei Skripal pictured as a lieutenant in the Russian Airborne Troops He had two postings in Europe - one in the 1980s and one in the 1990s. It was during this time that it was alleged that he was approached by British intelligence - beginning the next phase of his career. It would later be claimed by the authorities that he provided the identities of Russian undercover operatives to the British in return for money. In 1999 or 2000 (there is some debate on the date) he quit the GRU. He was fed up with the corruption, the BBC understands from friends. He was then believed to have gone to work for Boris Gromov. Gromov had been the last commander of Soviet forces in Afghanistan who was the last soldier to leave the country, crossing the so-called Friendship Bridge on 15 February 1989. Skripal pictured in central Asia in 1977 This led to a relatively settled period of Skripal's family life. He had married Liudmila when they were still young. She had been his teenage sweetheart in Kaliningrad. Their son Alexander - who was known as Sasha - would be born in 1974 and a daughter, Yulia, in 1984. Sasha got married and settled into a job, while Yulia was described as the brightest spark in the family and she learnt English. But in December 2004, the settled family life was shattered when he was arrested for spying. Sergei Skripal and Liudmila on their wedding day in June 1972 It is claimed that his shoulder was deliberately wrenched from his socket by officers from the Russian security service (FSB) during the arrest. TV cameras were there to capture the whole event. He was convicted swiftly in a trial largely closed to the media and sentenced to 13 years in a labour camp - much spent in Mordovia (the same place a member of the Pussy Riot group was imprisoned in 2011). Reports from those who have been imprisoned there describe tough conditions, but Skripal, friends say, did not succumb. One advantage was Skripal had been a championship boxer in the Soviet army (explaining his slightly squashed nose). This proved useful when on remand in Moscow, because it allowed him to deal with a couple of criminals whom he suspected had been paid to make his life difficult. In the labour camp, even though he was now over 50 years old, he could take the blows from guards and few of the other inmates wanted to take him on. The period did have its difficulties though. His son Sasha lost his job and, it is thought, his marriage, because of his father being a convicted spy (something Sergei himself may have felt guilty about). Suddenly, in July 2010, he was released as part of a major spy swap. When he had been in prison he had dreamt of ice cream and this was the first thing he wanted to eat. He was reunited with Liudmila. They decided to set up home in Salisbury because they liked the area, the BBC understands from friends. He first of all lived in a flat where he was welcomed by neighbours and then moved to the house in a cul-de-sac - the same house that is now a major crime scene for police. The life of spies after they have defected or are swapped is rarely easy. Much has been made of one of Britain's most infamous spies, Kim Philby - an MI6 officer who provided its secrets to the Soviet Union's KGB - and his time in Moscow, where he continued to listen to the cricket. But friends say Skripal was a resilient character who had worked to make the most of the situation. There have been reports that he may have given the odd lecture about Russia, but there is no outward sign he was involved in any ongoing operational activities. NRA sues as Florida signs gun-control law Trump accepts 'milestone' meeting with Kim Island bones 'likely' to be Earhart's Any knowledge would have been dated given he had left the GRU in 2000. Friends instead describe him enjoying the local museums, especially those with a military flavour like the Tank Museum in Bovington, as well as military and nature documentaries (they say he particularly liked David Attenborough). He was said to have missed Russia. Skripal with his father Friends describe him as a patriot who loved his country, but disliked the regime that ran it. They say he slowly got used to his new surroundings. Liudmila grew roses in the garden while Sergei liked to barbecue inedible sausages. But this new life for the couple was short-lived. In 2011, Liudmila was diagnosed with cancer. She died on 23 October 2012. He would frequently place flowers at her grave. In July 2017, son Sasha died in St Petersburg while on holiday with a girlfriend. Family told the BBC he was rushed to the hospital and died of sudden liver failure - they believe it might have been suspicious. Skripal himself was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and took insulin daily. In the summer of 2015, Yulia went back to Moscow, possibly to be with a boyfriend, but kept in touch with her father over Skype. Sergei's elder brother also died in 2016 after losing weight. With his family gone, a friend said Sergei made the best of the situation. He would eat Russian dumplings called Pelmeni while playing World War II tank games on his computer. Friends say he would have been pleased to see his daughter as she arrived for her recent visit. It was a visit which would end with both of them lying in a critical condition in hospital beds following their poisoning with a nerve agent. Skripal once told a close friend that in the darkest days of the labour camp he kept his mind healthy by building a home in his imagination. His friends hope that same trick may be working for him now as he fights for his life.

"The gunman took three women hostage but allowed others to escape The man who killed three women after a stand-off at a veterans' home in Napa Valley, California was a former patient, authorities say. The three victims were all employees at the centre in Yountville. The residential centre provides mental health services for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The suspected gunman, who died at the scene, has been named as Albert Wong, 36. No motive for the attack has been identified, police say. Wong, reportedly a former US Army rifleman, had left a programme to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The gunman entered the building while employees were having cake as a leaving celebration for some colleagues. After a siege lasting all day police discovered the four bodies in a room at The Pathway Home on Friday evening. The three employees who died have been named,externalby the Napa County Sheriff-Coroner's Office as Jennifer Golick, 42, the clinical director, Christine Loeber, 48, the executive director, and 29-year-old Jennifer Gonzalez, a clinical psychologist.

"A woman was robbed while she was parked on the hard shoulder of a motorway in the south of Scotland. The 32-year-old was targeted after her car suffered a flat tyre on the A74(M) near Johnstonebridge on Friday. A group of three people stopped their vehicle, before one grabbed her by her neck, demanded money and made off with cash and a mobile phone. Police said the woman suffered a ""traumatic experience"" at the hands of ""despicable individuals."" The incident happened between 18:30 and 19:00 on Friday, when the woman noticed her white Volkswagen had a flat tyre. She pulled on to the hard shoulder between junctions 16 and 17 on the A74(M), about three miles south of Johnstonebridge. After phoning for help at an SOS phone box, police said she returned to her car. But when a small silver car approached, and its three occupants offered to help, she got out of her vehicle. However, she was then pushed back into the car by one of the men. He grabbed her by her neck and demanded money. He then stole a three-figure sum of cash and her mobile phone, before returning to his car and driving south. The woman reported the robbery using the SOS phone box. Det Sgt Andy McDowall appealed for help in tracing those responsible. ""This was a very traumatic experience for a young woman to endure and it is vital that we trace the despicable individuals responsible,"" he said. ""I appeal to any drivers who were travelling on the A74(M) around junctions 16 and 17 and may have witnessed this incident, or anyone who saw the small silver car in the vicinity around 19:00 last night, to contact police immediately."" The suspect who grabbed and pushed the woman back into her car is described as white, tall, with a muscular build and he had short brown hair.

"Rory Harrison denies withholding information in the case and perverting the course of justice A friend of two Ulster rugby players accused of rape has told a court that Paddy Jackson would be the ""last person in the world"" to rape someone. The friend, Rory Harrison, 25, of Manse Road, Belfast is charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information. He denies the charges. Mr Harrison shared a taxi home with the alleged victim on the night in question. She was upset at the time but he insisted he did not know why. ""I thought she'd maybe been rejected by Patrick,"" he said. Paddy Jackson and fellow rugby player Stuart Olding are accused of raping the same woman in Mr Jackson's house, in the early hours of 28 June 2016. Rory Harrison was in the house that night. He said he noticed the woman, who was 19 at the time, staring at Mr Jackson, and saw her follow him upstairs. Paddy Jackson arriving at court on Saturday Later, he went upstairs to say ""goodbye"" to Mr Jackson and walked past the woman at the top of the stairs. He said he did not notice anything untoward. ""Nothing drew my attention to her,"" he said. A short time later, he saw her downstairs and ""she seemed a little bit upset"". He added: ""I told her I would bring her home and she agreed."" They went outside to try to flag down a taxi. He said that by this stage she was more upset and was ""crying"". The next day she sent him a message saying: ""I know you must be mates with those guys but I don't like them. And what happened was not consensual which is why I was so upset."" Mr Harrison said he did not take the message seriously. Although he was shocked initially, he did not believe it. He told the court: ""The more I thought about it, I have known Patrick since I was eight or nine, he is the last person in the world to rape someone. ""I didn't believe it. ""I thought she had maybe done something and then regretted it."" He said he did not tell Mr Jackson about the message from the alleged victim. His defence barrister asked him to explain why. ""Because I didn't believe it. I didn't want to worry him,"" he said. Asked why he did not tell Stuart Olding about the message, he said he did not know Mr Olding had been involved with the woman so he did not think it was relevant. Stuart Olding arriving at court on Saturday Saturday's hearing was the first time in the six-week trial that Mr Harrison has given evidence from the witness box. The court took the unusual step of arranging a weekend hearing in a bid to make up time in the case. His defence barrister began by asking him some questions about his background. He said his father is a solicitor and his mother is a nurse. He went to school at Methodist College in Belfast, and then to University College Dublin (UCD). He represented Ulster and Ireland schools at rugby and described Paddy Jackson as a ""good friend"". On the night of the alleged rapes, he went out in Belfast with Mr Jackson, Stuart Olding and Blane McIlroy. They went to Cutter's Wharf bar, and then to the VIP section of Ollie's nightclub in the centre of the city. He said members of the Northern Ireland football team were there and he got a photo taken with striker Will Grigg, which he posted on Facebook the next day. He said his alcohol consumption that night included six cans of beer, four pints of Guinness, some gin and tonics, four or five vodka and lemonades and ""a few"" shots. From the nightclub, he went back to Mr Jackson's house with his friends and four young women, arriving around 02.30 GMT. The day he first spoke to the police about the incident, 30 June 2016, was his 24th birthday. It was two days after the night out. He was asleep when the police called at his family home around 15:00 GMT. He was asked to give an account of what happened on the night in question. Initially he was treated as a witness rather than a suspect, but that subsequently changed. During Saturday's hearing, his barrister asked him a number of questions about the journey home with the alleged victim. He asked: ""It has been speculated by the Crown that you knew or believed that she had been the victim of rape at that time?"" Mr Harrison replied: ""No, I did not."" He also denied attempting to cover up what had happened or trying to ""manage"" the woman. The trial had previously heard how the four defendants met for lunch at Soul Food cafe on Belfast's Ormeau Road the day after the alleged attack. It has been suggested that there was a conspiracy to concoct a false version of events about the previous night. ""No there wasn't,"" Mr Harrison told the court. He was also asked to explain why he told Blane McIlroy to ""leave"" his phone if going to the police. ""I was aware that police seize phones. It is pretty inconvenient when you lose numbers and photographs,"" he said. Blane McIlroy arriving at court on Saturday His defence lawyer asked: ""Were you trying to impede an investigation or conceal anything?"" ""No, I was not,"" Mr Harrison replied. He added that he answered every police question to the best of his ability and did not attempt to cover anything up. His barrister said: ""Have you done anything to pervert the course of justice?"" Mr Harrison answered: ""No, I have not."" The barrister added: ""Have you concealed any criminal activity?"" ""No I have not,"" he answered. Mr Harrison spent almost two hours being questioned in the witness box. The case has been adjourned until Monday afternoon. Dismissing the jury of eight men and three women for the weekend, Judge Patricia Smyth repeated warnings to them not to discuss the case with friends and family. She told the jury: ""Keep your minds open. This case is not yet complete."" Paddy Jackson, Stuart Olding, Blane McIlroy and Rory Harrison deny all charges against them In total, four men have been charged in connection with the case. Mr Jackson, 26, from Belfast's Oakleigh Park, is charged with one count of rape and one count of sexual assault. He denies the charges. Mr Olding, 24, from Ardenlee Street, Belfast, is also charged with rape. He too denies the charge. Blane McIlroy, 26, of Royal Lodge Road, Belfast, is charged with one count of exposure. He denies the charge. Mr Harrison, 25, of Manse Road, Belfast is charged with perverting the course of justice and withholding information. He denies the charges.

"This video can not be played Six Nations 2018: Ireland 28-8 Scotland highlights Ireland have been crowned Six Nations champions with a match to spare after England's hopes of retaining the title ended withtheir 22-16 loss to France. Ireland's earlier four-try,28-8 win over Scotlandhad left England needing a bonus-point victory in Paris to keep their title hopes alive. It is Ireland's third title in five years under Joe Schmidt but Johnny Sexton said celebrations were ""muted"". They will win the Grand Slam if they beat England next Saturday. Ireland must 'save the best for last' ""It's a strange feeling to win the championship with a game to go,"" said Irish fly-half Sexton. ""We know how difficult it will be [to win the Grand Slam]. The shoe is on the other foot from last year [when Ireland ended England's Grand Slam hopes with victory in Dublin on the final weekend] and I am sure they will be licking their lips."" Ireland have an unassailable nine-point lead with one round still to play If Ireland win in London they will secure the third Grand Slam in their history, following previous triumphs in 1948 and 2009. ""It's going to be a big game for us now,"" said Ireland captain Rory Best. ""Whenever you put yourself in the position to win everything in the Six Nations it becomes massive, but the key for us is approach it as we do every game. ""We are going to have to save the best till last. That's what it's going to take to win everything next week."" Outright Championship wins since 1883 (shared wins) England- 28 (10) Wales- 26 (12) France- 17 (8) Scotland- 15 (9) Ireland- 13 (9) Italy- 0 (0) Ireland began the day five points clear of England at the top of the Six Nations table. Schmidt's side knew a bonus-point victory in Dublin would require England to do the same in Paris to keep the title race alive - and the Irish secured the five points with ease. Winger Jacob Stockdale, the 21-year-old playing only his eighth game for Ireland, bagged two tries to take his overall international tally to 10, while further scores from Conor Murray and Sean Cronin handed ruthless Ireland a thumping win. So it was over to England, in the later game in Paris, to take the title race to the final weekend. This video can not be played Six Nations: France 22-16 England highlights England travelled to the Stade de France hoping to avoid two successive defeats for the first time under head coach Eddie Jones. They had been comprehensively outplayed by a fired-up Scottish outfit at Murrayfield in the third round, and kicked off in Paris knowing only a bonus-point victory would be enough to deny Ireland the title. Before the match, Jones told BBC Sport his side had not discussed bonus points and permutations, and just needed to play well. With the scores level at 9-9, the match was blown wide open when Anthony Watson's high tackle on Benjamin Fall saw the England full-back yellow carded and a penalty try awarded. Jonny May's late try gave them hope of an unlikely win, but France held out against a white-shirted onslaught at the death for only their second win in a year. Ireland very nearly fell at the first hurdle in this year's tournament, but were saved by Johnny Sexton's last-gasp drop-goal in Paris. The Irish fly-half landed a dramatic long-range effort in the 83rd minuteto snatch victory over Franceon the opening weekend in February. Former British and Irish Lions centreJeremy Guscott saidit would go down as ""one of the great sporting moments in Six Nations' history"" if Ireland went on to win the Six Nations. ""It was a very special moment for the team,"" Sexton said of his drop-goal. ""We will look back on that five minutes [Ireland's 41-phase move to set up Sexton] when we lift the trophy next week, hopefully with a Grand Slam, and say it was a huge moment in our success.""

"Sergei Skripal was jailed in Russia after being convicted of spying for Britain The attempted killing of Sergei Skripal poses major challenges for British intelligence. This was a man who had beenconvicted for spying for Britain,pardoned, released and thentargeted to be killed on British soil.The search for a motive remains a key question. Skripal is thought to have been recruited by British intelligence in the 1990s while serving under diplomatic cover abroad with the GRU - the Russian military intelligence. He is likely to have provided valuable intelligence at the time - especially the identities of other undercover operatives. But he left the GRU around 2000 and was arrested in 2004. He was then imprisoned. After his release in 2010 in the spy swap, he will have been debriefed by British intelligence but there are few signs so far that he was involved in serious ongoing operational work. What we know so far Story of the man at centre of spy story Who is the former Russian colonel? Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were exposed to a nerve agent It has been reported that he may have given the occasional lecture about the GRU but he would have had little fresh operational knowledge about people or events in Moscow since he had retired close to 20 years ago and had spent the last 14 years either in prison or in Britain. There has even been speculation that he was somehow involved in thefamous ""dossier"" about Donald Trumpdrawn up by former MI6 officer Chris Steele. But sources close to Orbis - Steele's company - have told the BBC that it had no links with Skripal at any point. So what does that leave as a possible motive? Revenge perhaps. Revenge for someone that former colleagues in Russian intelligence will certainly have seen as a traitor for selling secrets to MI6. And also perhaps a message to others thinking of doing the same. A message that Russia will one day come for you, wherever you are. That has been a recurrent theme from Vladimir Putin, a former intelligence officer himself. It has been pointed out that this case is different because Skripal had been formally pardoned and released as part of a spy swap. Killing someone after a swap would be against the traditional (unwritten) rules of espionage. Sergei Skripal had been in the Soviet Airborne Troops before working for Russian military intelligence Mr Skripal, pictured with his father, was convicted in Russia of spying for Britain This may be true. But it also neglects the fact that, under Vladimir Putin, Russia has shown a willingness to push the boundaries of what was previously considered acceptable. The same is true in cyberspace. Here, Russia is alleged to have been involved in acts like switching off a French TV channel and turning off the power in Ukraine, far beyond the realm of traditional cyber espionage and stealing secrets. And, even after allegations it hacked US political parties and operatives and released their emails, the same group - linked it is thought to the GRU for which Skripal worked - is said to have continued operating, hacking other countries such as France and, more recently, Germany. What now for the UK/Russia relationship? What are nerve agents and what do they do? It is almost as if those behind such actions simply do not care about being found and called out about it. In the past, intelligence agencies talked of wanting ""plausible deniability"" for their covert operations - being able to say it was not them. But observers say that with Russia, it increasingly looks as if the intelligence agencies are happy with ""implausible deniability"" - even if it seems obvious they are behind an act, they simply say ""prove it"" and try to muddy the waters with misinformation as much as possible. If the theory of Russian revenge and message sending is correct, it raises difficult questions for British intelligence. MI6 relies on recruiting agents like Skripal in countries like Russia to provide secrets. It has always prided itself on keeping the identity of those agents secret in order to protect them. But if the perception emerges that it cannot protect those agents - even if they are in the UK - then it will make it much harder to do its job and recruit agents to gather intelligence. Sergei Skripal moved to Salisbury after being involved in a spy swap A risk assessment is normally made for agents who are resettled in the UK or elsewhere and it is possible the risk assessment for Skripal in 2010 was sensible, based on Russian behaviour at the time and the fact he was swapped. But there will be questions over whether the risk assessments were reconsidered given changing Russian behaviour. There will also be challenges for MI5, the security service, more generally. It puts the bulk of its resources - understandably - into counter-terrorism but there have long been questions about whether this has left enough focus on another part of its job - tracking the activities of foreign intelligence services in the UK. Counter-espionage was once the core of its work but it may need a significant boost if the service is going to have to contend with the possibility of other states using nerve agents to try to kill people on British soil.

"Recruitment targets for teaching have been missed for five years in a row The education secretary has promised to cut teachers' workload in an attempt to resolve a recruitment crisis in England's schools. Damian Hinds told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that there will be no more new changes to primary tests, GCSEs or A-levels. But he faced challenges from delegates over school funding shortages. And Mr Hinds told head teachers: ""It has been tough, funding is tight, I don't deny that at all."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the education secretary's promise to cut the ""bureaucratic burden"" on teachers. But there were calls from the conference floor for Mr Hinds to ""answer the question"" over problems with school funding. The education secretary had conceded: ""I understand why that's people's number one issue. I understand why, for everyone in this room, the funding of our schools and colleges is such an important topic."" Damian Hinds told head teachers he will work with them on cutting bureaucracy In his first speech to heads and teachers since becoming education secretary, Mr Hinds said that tackling the teacher shortage was a ""top priority"". Mr Hinds said long hours and red tape were among the ""biggest threats"" to recruiting and retaining staff. For five successive years,recruitment targets for teaching have been missedand schools have complained of the expense and disruption of relying on temporary staff or having to use teachers who are not specialists in the subjects they are teaching. Schools are spending Â£835m per year on supply agencies, according to the most recent government figures. The education secretary told the head teachers' conference on Saturday: ""With rising pupil numbers, I recognise that recruitment and retention is difficult for schools. ""And, clearly, one of the biggest threats to retention, and also to recruitment, is workload. ""Too many of our teachers and our school leaders are working too long hours - and on non-teaching tasks that are not helping children to learn."" Mr Hinds promised head teachers no more changes to the curriculum or to testing and exams in primary or secondary school until the end of this Parliament. But existing reforms that are already in the pipeline, such as the roll-out of changes to GCSEs, will go ahead. Mr Hinds spoke alongside the Ofsted chief, Amanda Spielman, and they highlighted the need to avoid any unnecessary bureaucracy around inspections. Ms Spielman said that Ofsted wants to help to reduce workload. Improvements in school will not be sustained ""if the people, who make them run so well, are burning out and leaving the profession"", Ms Spielman told the head teachers' conference. She warned against ""entirely unnecessary"" extra work such as rehearsals for inspections, so-called ""mocksteds"". Mr Barton, ASCL's general secretary, supported the push to cut workload. The heads' union has warned repeatedly of the recruitment problems facing schools, particularly in maths and science. The heads' leader warned that the ways into teaching have become confusingly complicated and need to be simplified. But Mr Barton said head teachers should work differently to reduce workload in their own schools, such as cutting needless meetings or administration. ""In the longer term, we're the generation who needs to redefine what it is to be a teacher in the 21st Century, to make sure we don't become the Luddite profession, doing things in the way we've always done them."" Labour's shadow schools minister, Mike Kane, said: ""This government can't offer a solution to the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention because they created it. ""If the government were serious about ending the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention they would match Labour's fully-funded commitment to scrap the public sector pay cap and give our teachers the pay rise they deserve.""

"Miles Hurley, pictured with his aunt, Elizabeth Hurley, is believed to be one of two young men stabbed on Thursday Actress and model Elizabeth Hurley's 21-year-old nephew is in hospital after being stabbed repeatedly in the back.

The Irish victory means they will be champions if the English do not also score four tries and win away in France in Saturday's later match. Two tries by Jacob Stockdale and further scores by Conor Murray and Sean Cronin secured a deserved Irish win. Blair Kinghorn scored on his first Test start for Scotland, but the visitors were left to rue missed chances. Follow France vs England live In a game of unrelenting pace, both teams created opportunities - but it was Ireland who proved more ruthless when it counted. Ireland have an unassailable nine-point lead with one round still to play Get the latest news by addingrugby union alertsin BBC Sport's app Insight and chat - subscribe to the Rugby Union Weekly podcast Perhaps it was the occasion, or maybe the conditions - but both teams were left to count the cost of a frenetic opening quarter. Ireland were guilty of a number of sloppy errors as obvious passes were missed, balls were fumbled and even Johnny Sexton's trademark wraparound misfired more than once - including in the build-up to  Greig Laidlaw's opening penalty. Blair Kinghorn scored Scotland's try despite the efforts of Garry Ringrose The Scotland scrum-half split the posts and - against the run of play - the visitors led after 12 minutes, despite Ireland dominating territory and turning down a kickable shot at goal in favour of going to the corner. However the biggest mistake of the opening half was by Scotland's inside centre Peter Horne, who had players out wide but paid the price for his ambitious skip pass out wide that was read by Stockdale, who scampered over for the opening try. The game was being played at an incredible pace as both teams battled to keep the ball alive as much as possible. Ireland were under pressure when Keith Earls sent a pass floating into touch and then Sean Maitland burnt past his opposite number Stockdale in a flowing move that featured Ryan Wilson and Finn Russell. Sexton and Russell were driving the tempo and both fly-halves took quick line-outs in an attempt to gain an edge, with Russell and Stuart Hogg combining to allow Huw Jones to attack down the left wing. The centre gathered his own chip over Earls and broke Rob Kearney's tackle, but then butchered a two-on-one against Sexton when his pass to Hogg drifted forward. Ireland's 28-8 win left them on the brink of clinching the Six Nations Championship Ireland were not as wasteful with their attacks as Sexton and Murray combined to carve their way through the centre of the Scottish defence. Then Garry Ringrose produced a sublime tip-on pass to send Kearney careering down the left wing, only for Murray to be held up over the line. From the five-metre scrum, and with the clock in red, Ringrose again showed his playmaking ability with quick hands releasing Stockdale to send Ireland into an 11-point lead at the break. This video can not be played Townsend 'frustrated' with Scotland's missed opportunities Scotland have now played 47 away matches since the inception of the Six Nations in 2000 and have won just six - four of them in Rome. Gregor Townsend's side need to develop a meaner streak away from Murrayfield if they are to make the step up to the next level. They were caught cold at the start of the second half after conceding a needless penalty that allowed Ireland go to the corner, and Murray darted off the tail of the resulting maul to power over for his 12th Irish try. The visitors then produced another purple patch, but Maitland and Horne both sent passes into touch before a well-worked training ground move featuring Finn Russell, Stuart Hogg and Sean Maitland allowed Kinghorn to score on his full Test debut. Ireland are seeking what would be only their third grand slam Ireland knew the championship was within their grasp and they went after the bonus score with real intent. Ringrose was held up under the posts and Fraser Brown won a relieving penalty for his side, but the green wave kept coming. Sexton turned down another opportunity to kick for the posts and Sean Cronin, just moments after his arrival off the bench, muscled his way over for a try that reverberated across Dublin. Schmidt and his players must brace themselves for a week of Grand Slam fervour as the visit to Twickenham looms large on the horizon. Schmidt's current crop are attempting to become just the third Irish side to win a Grand Slam and join the legendary teams of 1948 and 2009. Scotland will travel to Rome for 'Super Saturday', when they will be heavily favoured to finish their championship on a winning note. It will be fascinating to see if Townsend chooses to recall the likes of Richie Gray or Alex Dunbar, or if he will give the team that won the Calcutta Cup another opportunity. The veteran full-back's place was thought to be under threat going into this year's Six Nations, but 140 metres made from 10 carries illustrates how important he remains to Ireland.

"Sergei Skripal holding Yulia at the time of her birth with family members Sergei Skripal, the ex-Russian spy who is fighting for his life after being poisoned in Salisbury, was born in the Soviet Kaliningrad region on 23 June 1951. It was close enough to the West to pick up the sound of BBC World Service radio broadcasts and friends talk about him recalling the faint sounds. He was physically strong and chose to join the elite Soviet airborne troop known as the Desantniki. In 1979, Soviet troops went into Afghanistan and Skripal was one of the first to go in. After this, he graduated from the Diplomatic Military Academy in Moscow. Spies like us: How defectors come in from the cold Kim Philby, British double agent, reveals all in secret video Military deployed after poisoning There he seems to have been talent spotted by the GRU - Russia's military intelligence - and would embark on the second phase of his life as an intelligence officer. His initial role in the GRU was in its First Directorate, which focused on spying in Europe. This gave him the chance to serve overseas for military intelligence under cover as a diplomat. Friends say he later spoke of this period with excitement, recalling jumping out of a plane in Afghanistan. Sergei Skripal pictured as a lieutenant in the Russian Airborne Troops He had two postings in Europe - one in the 1980s and one in the 1990s. It was during this time that it was alleged that he was approached by British intelligence - beginning the next phase of his career. It would later be claimed by the authorities that he provided the identities of Russian undercover operatives to the British in return for money. In 1999 or 2000 (there is some debate on the date) he quit the GRU. He was fed up with the corruption, the BBC understands from friends. He was then believed to have gone to work for Boris Gromov. Gromov had been the last commander of Soviet forces in Afghanistan who was the last soldier to leave the country, crossing the so-called Friendship Bridge on 15 February 1989. Skripal pictured in central Asia in 1977 This led to a relatively settled period of Skripal's family life. He had married Liudmila when they were still young. She had been his teenage sweetheart in Kaliningrad. Their son Alexander - who was known as Sasha - would be born in 1974 and a daughter, Yulia, in 1984. Sasha got married and settled into a job, while Yulia was described as the brightest spark in the family and she learnt English. But in December 2004, the settled family life was shattered when he was arrested for spying. Sergei Skripal and Liudmila on their wedding day in June 1972 It is claimed that his shoulder was deliberately wrenched from his socket by officers from the Russian security service (FSB) during the arrest. TV cameras were there to capture the whole event. He was convicted swiftly in a trial largely closed to the media and sentenced to 13 years in a labour camp - much spent in Mordovia (the same place a member of the Pussy Riot group was imprisoned in 2011). Reports from those who have been imprisoned there describe tough conditions, but Skripal, friends say, did not succumb. One advantage was Skripal had been a championship boxer in the Soviet army (explaining his slightly squashed nose). This proved useful when on remand in Moscow, because it allowed him to deal with a couple of criminals whom he suspected had been paid to make his life difficult. In the labour camp, even though he was now over 50 years old, he could take the blows from guards and few of the other inmates wanted to take him on. The period did have its difficulties though. His son Sasha lost his job and, it is thought, his marriage, because of his father being a convicted spy (something Sergei himself may have felt guilty about). Suddenly, in July 2010, he was released as part of a major spy swap. When he had been in prison he had dreamt of ice cream and this was the first thing he wanted to eat. He was reunited with Liudmila. They decided to set up home in Salisbury because they liked the area, the BBC understands from friends. He first of all lived in a flat where he was welcomed by neighbours and then moved to the house in a cul-de-sac - the same house that is now a major crime scene for police. The life of spies after they have defected or are swapped is rarely easy. Much has been made of one of Britain's most infamous spies, Kim Philby - an MI6 officer who provided its secrets to the Soviet Union's KGB - and his time in Moscow, where he continued to listen to the cricket. But friends say Skripal was a resilient character who had worked to make the most of the situation. There have been reports that he may have given the odd lecture about Russia, but there is no outward sign he was involved in any ongoing operational activities. NRA sues as Florida signs gun-control law Trump accepts 'milestone' meeting with Kim Island bones 'likely' to be Earhart's Any knowledge would have been dated given he had left the GRU in 2000.

He was said to have missed Russia. Skripal with his father Friends describe him as a patriot who loved his country, but disliked the regime that ran it. They say he slowly got used to his new surroundings. Liudmila grew roses in the garden while Sergei liked to barbecue inedible sausages. But this new life for the couple was short-lived. In 2011, Liudmila was diagnosed with cancer. She died on 23 October 2012. He would frequently place flowers at her grave. In July 2017, son Sasha died in St Petersburg while on holiday with a girlfriend. Family told the BBC he was rushed to the hospital and died of sudden liver failure - they believe it might have been suspicious. Skripal himself was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and took insulin daily. In the summer of 2015, Yulia went back to Moscow, possibly to be with a boyfriend, but kept in touch with her father over Skype. Sergei's elder brother also died in 2016 after losing weight. With his family gone, a friend said Sergei made the best of the situation. He would eat Russian dumplings called Pelmeni while playing World War II tank games on his computer. Friends say he would have been pleased to see his daughter as she arrived for her recent visit. It was a visit which would end with both of them lying in a critical condition in hospital beds following their poisoning with a nerve agent. Skripal once told a close friend that in the darkest days of the labour camp he kept his mind healthy by building a home in his imagination.

"Sergei Skripal was jailed in Russia after being convicted of spying for Britain The attempted killing of Sergei Skripal poses major challenges for British intelligence. This was a man who had beenconvicted for spying for Britain,pardoned, released and thentargeted to be killed on British soil.The search for a motive remains a key question. Skripal is thought to have been recruited by British intelligence in the 1990s while serving under diplomatic cover abroad with the GRU - the Russian military intelligence. He is likely to have provided valuable intelligence at the time - especially the identities of other undercover operatives. But he left the GRU around 2000 and was arrested in 2004. He was then imprisoned. After his release in 2010 in the spy swap, he will have been debriefed by British intelligence but there are few signs so far that he was involved in serious ongoing operational work. What we know so far Story of the man at centre of spy story Who is the former Russian colonel? Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were exposed to a nerve agent It has been reported that he may have given the occasional lecture about the GRU but he would have had little fresh operational knowledge about people or events in Moscow since he had retired close to 20 years ago and had spent the last 14 years either in prison or in Britain. There has even been speculation that he was somehow involved in thefamous ""dossier"" about Donald Trumpdrawn up by former MI6 officer Chris Steele. But sources close to Orbis - Steele's company - have told the BBC that it had no links with Skripal at any point. So what does that leave as a possible motive? Revenge perhaps. Revenge for someone that former colleagues in Russian intelligence will certainly have seen as a traitor for selling secrets to MI6. And also perhaps a message to others thinking of doing the same. A message that Russia will one day come for you, wherever you are. That has been a recurrent theme from Vladimir Putin, a former intelligence officer himself. It has been pointed out that this case is different because Skripal had been formally pardoned and released as part of a spy swap. Killing someone after a swap would be against the traditional (unwritten) rules of espionage. Sergei Skripal had been in the Soviet Airborne Troops before working for Russian military intelligence Mr Skripal, pictured with his father, was convicted in Russia of spying for Britain This may be true. But it also neglects the fact that, under Vladimir Putin, Russia has shown a willingness to push the boundaries of what was previously considered acceptable. The same is true in cyberspace. Here, Russia is alleged to have been involved in acts like switching off a French TV channel and turning off the power in Ukraine, far beyond the realm of traditional cyber espionage and stealing secrets. And, even after allegations it hacked US political parties and operatives and released their emails, the same group - linked it is thought to the GRU for which Skripal worked - is said to have continued operating, hacking other countries such as France and, more recently, Germany. What now for the UK/Russia relationship? What are nerve agents and what do they do? It is almost as if those behind such actions simply do not care about being found and called out about it. In the past, intelligence agencies talked of wanting ""plausible deniability"" for their covert operations - being able to say it was not them. But observers say that with Russia, it increasingly looks as if the intelligence agencies are happy with ""implausible deniability"" - even if it seems obvious they are behind an act, they simply say ""prove it"" and try to muddy the waters with misinformation as much as possible. If the theory of Russian revenge and message sending is correct, it raises difficult questions for British intelligence. MI6 relies on recruiting agents like Skripal in countries like Russia to provide secrets. It has always prided itself on keeping the identity of those agents secret in order to protect them. But if the perception emerges that it cannot protect those agents - even if they are in the UK - then it will make it much harder to do its job and recruit agents to gather intelligence. Sergei Skripal moved to Salisbury after being involved in a spy swap A risk assessment is normally made for agents who are resettled in the UK or elsewhere and it is possible the risk assessment for Skripal in 2010 was sensible, based on Russian behaviour at the time and the fact he was swapped. But there will be questions over whether the risk assessments were reconsidered given changing Russian behaviour. There will also be challenges for MI5, the security service, more generally. It puts the bulk of its resources - understandably - into counter-terrorism but there have long been questions about whether this has left enough focus on another part of its job - tracking the activities of foreign intelligence services in the UK. Counter-espionage was once the core of its work but it may need a significant boost if the service is going to have to contend with the possibility of other states using nerve agents to try to kill people on British soil.

"The National Rifle Association (NRA)  is suing Florida after it passed a gun control law in the wake of a school shooting that left 17 people dead. Governor Rick Scott, a staunch ally of the gun lobby, enacted the bill, which the NRA says violates the constitution. The law raises the legal age for buying rifles in Florida, but also allows the training and arming of school staff. It does not ban semi-automatic rifles like the one used in the 14 February massacre in Parkland. But it does introduce a three-day waiting period on all gun sales and a ban on bump stocks, a device that enables semi-automatic rifles to fire hundreds of rounds a minute. One mother, two school shootings Trump clashes with Republicans on guns Guns banned on dating app Bumble The NRA filed its lawsuit on Friday just an hour after the bill was signed by the governor. One of its arguments is that the legislation violates the rights of young women as they are unlikely to commit violent crime. Itraises the minimum age for buying rifles from 18 to 21in the state - although 18, 19 and 20-year-old police officers and members of the security forces will still be able to buy rifles and shotguns Itbans bump stocks- devices that raise the firing speed of semi-automatic rifles It introduces athree-day waiting period on all gun purchases(previously this only applied when people bought handguns) It makes iteasier for police to confiscate weapons and ammunitionfrom people who are deemed to pose a threat of violent behaviour (a measure that has been proposed by five other states in the last month, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence) It allows school staff to carry guns, with the agreement of their school district authorities and sheriff's department. This is already allowed in the states of Wyoming, South Dakota, Tennessee, Georgia, Kansas and Texas President Donald Trump has voiced support for arming teachers and so has the NRA. This video can not be played America's gun laws explained Florida Governor Rick Scott, a Republican, signed the bill into law on Friday, after lawmakers at the Florida state level voted in its favour. As he signed it, he said he was an NRA member, and that some members would agree with the new law while others would not. ""It's an example to the entire country that government can and has, moved fast,"" he said. Florida's Attorney General Pam Bondi said the changes were ""the right thing to do"". ""This bill is not perfect, and sadly it will not bring back the 17 lives lost in the horrific school shooting, but the safety of our children is not a political issue,"" she said. The NRA is asking a judge to block the age restriction and prevent the state of Florida from enforcing the new law. People aged 18 are considered adults ""for almost all purposes and certainly for the purposes of the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights"", the lawsuit says. The complaint says the law violates the second amendment of the US constitution, which protects the right to bear arms. It also argues the bill breaches the 14th amendment's equal protection clause by banning law-abiding citizens between 18-21 from buying guns. Why is the NRA so controversial? US investment giant pressures gun firms NRA spokesman Chris Cox said the bill ""punishes law-abiding gun owners for the criminal acts of a deranged individual"". ""Preventing a responsible 20-year-old from purchasing the best tool for self-defence will not stop a deranged criminal intent on committing a crime,"" the lobby group said. The legal action says the Florida legislation particularly affects young women. ""Females between the ages of 18 and 21 pose a relatively slight risk of perpetrating a school shooting... or, for that matter, a violent crime of any kind,"" says the lawsuit. It also points out that men of 21-24, just outside the new age limit, account for more violent crime arrests than men aged 18-21. A former student with a history of mental health issues is accused of killing 14 students and three staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on 14 February in the second-deadliest US school shooting ever. This video can not be played Students have been lobbying for greater gun control The bill's passage by a Republican-controlled legislature in a state where the NRA wields considerable influence is seen as a testament to an impassioned pro-gun control campaign launched by young survivors of the shooting and parents of the victims. American teens demand 'Never Again' The bill was signed into law in the presence of some Parkland survivors and their families, while some of the student campaigners from the school welcomed it as a good first step.

"Sergei Skripal holding Yulia at the time of her birth with family members Sergei Skripal, the ex-Russian spy who is fighting for his life after being poisoned in Salisbury, was born in the Soviet Kaliningrad region on 23 June 1951. It was close enough to the West to pick up the sound of BBC World Service radio broadcasts and friends talk about him recalling the faint sounds. He was physically strong and chose to join the elite Soviet airborne troop known as the Desantniki. In 1979, Soviet troops went into Afghanistan and Skripal was one of the first to go in. After this, he graduated from the Diplomatic Military Academy in Moscow.

"Douma continues to be under government bombardment The Syrian army has made a significant advance in its effort to take rebel-held Eastern Ghouta, reports say. Troops have cut off the region's biggest town, Douma, and isolated another, according to UK-based conflict monitors the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). The advance would effectively split the region into three parts. The Syrian government began a major offensive last month to re-take Eastern Ghouta, near the capital Damascus. Since then they have reportedly taken control of half of the region, in an advance that has left around 1,000 civilians dead over the past three weeks, according to SOHR. The UN has called the bombardment ""unacceptable"", saying it amounts to ""the collective punishment of civilians"". The military has been accused of targeting civilians, but it says it is trying to liberate the region - one of the last rebel strongholds - from those it terms terrorists. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? Read more: Who's fighting whom in Syria's Ghouta?,external A clear strategy of the Syrian government's offensive in Eastern Ghouta has been to divide the enclave into isolated sections and so cut off rebel support and supply networks, the BBC's Arab Affairs editor Sebastian Usher says - and now the government appears to have all but achieved that goal. The Syrian government has reportedly captured the central town of Misraba, and advanced onwards into surrounding farmland. Misraba is located along a major road that links Douma, in the north, with another big town, Harasta, in the west. If confirmed, the advance leaves the enclave divided into three - Douma and its surrounding towns in the north, western Harasta, and the rest of the territory in the south. Syrian state television also said the army had splinted Eastern Ghouta, but a spokesman for one of the main rebel groups told Reuters neither Harasta nor Douma were cut off. Meanwhile an opposition website said that a group of fighters from the jihadists Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) arrived in central Hama province from Eastern Ghouta,a day after an evacuation deal was reached. On Friday a UN convoy was able to successfully deliver aid to Eastern Ghouta, after previous deliveries were halted by shelling. Some 400,000 people are still thought to live in the area, seven years into Syria's civil war. It has been besieged by government forces since 2013. The rebels in Eastern Ghouta are not one cohesive group. They encompass multiple factions, including jihadists, and in-fighting between them has led to past losses of ground to the Syrian government. The two largest groups are Jaish al-Islam and its rival Faylaq al-Rahman. The latter has in the past fought alongside HTS. This video can not be played A short guide to the Syrian civil war Eastern Ghouta is so close to Damascus that it is possible for rebels to fire mortars into the heart of the capital, which has led to scores of civilian deaths. The Syrian government is desperate to regain the territory, and has said its attempts to recapture it can be attributed directly due to the HTS presence there. HTS was excluded from a ceasefire agreed at the UN that has yet to come into effect. The group is an alliance of factions led by the Nusra Front, which sprang from al-Qaeda. Syrian state media showed what it described as rebel fighters being evacuated from Eastern Ghouta In January, Turkey began an offensive to oust the Kurdish YPG militia from the Afrin region in northern Syria, near the Turkish border. Turkish troops, and some allied Syrian rebel militias, are now on the outskirts of Afrin town, the SOHR says. Both the SOHR and an embedded news agency reporter said that Turkish forces had captured a military base from Kurdish groups and were seen taking heavy machine guns out, while exchanging fire with Kurdish fighters. Turkey regards the YPG as a terrorist group and says it is linked to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party, which has fought an insurgency for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades.

"Recruitment targets for teaching have been missed for five years in a row The education secretary has promised to cut teachers' workload in an attempt to resolve a recruitment crisis in England's schools. Damian Hinds told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that there will be no more new changes to primary tests, GCSEs or A-levels. But he faced challenges from delegates over school funding shortages. And Mr Hinds told head teachers: ""It has been tough, funding is tight, I don't deny that at all."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the education secretary's promise to cut the ""bureaucratic burden"" on teachers. But there were calls from the conference floor for Mr Hinds to ""answer the question"" over problems with school funding. The education secretary had conceded: ""I understand why that's people's number one issue. I understand why, for everyone in this room, the funding of our schools and colleges is such an important topic."" Damian Hinds told head teachers he will work with them on cutting bureaucracy In his first speech to heads and teachers since becoming education secretary, Mr Hinds said that tackling the teacher shortage was a ""top priority"". Mr Hinds said long hours and red tape were among the ""biggest threats"" to recruiting and retaining staff. For five successive years,recruitment targets for teaching have been missedand schools have complained of the expense and disruption of relying on temporary staff or having to use teachers who are not specialists in the subjects they are teaching. Schools are spending Â£835m per year on supply agencies, according to the most recent government figures. The education secretary told the head teachers' conference on Saturday: ""With rising pupil numbers, I recognise that recruitment and retention is difficult for schools. ""And, clearly, one of the biggest threats to retention, and also to recruitment, is workload. ""Too many of our teachers and our school leaders are working too long hours - and on non-teaching tasks that are not helping children to learn."" Mr Hinds promised head teachers no more changes to the curriculum or to testing and exams in primary or secondary school until the end of this Parliament. But existing reforms that are already in the pipeline, such as the roll-out of changes to GCSEs, will go ahead. Mr Hinds spoke alongside the Ofsted chief, Amanda Spielman, and they highlighted the need to avoid any unnecessary bureaucracy around inspections. Ms Spielman said that Ofsted wants to help to reduce workload. Improvements in school will not be sustained ""if the people, who make them run so well, are burning out and leaving the profession"", Ms Spielman told the head teachers' conference. She warned against ""entirely unnecessary"" extra work such as rehearsals for inspections, so-called ""mocksteds"". Mr Barton, ASCL's general secretary, supported the push to cut workload. The heads' union has warned repeatedly of the recruitment problems facing schools, particularly in maths and science. The heads' leader warned that the ways into teaching have become confusingly complicated and need to be simplified. But Mr Barton said head teachers should work differently to reduce workload in their own schools, such as cutting needless meetings or administration. ""In the longer term, we're the generation who needs to redefine what it is to be a teacher in the 21st Century, to make sure we don't become the Luddite profession, doing things in the way we've always done them."" Labour's shadow schools minister, Mike Kane, said: ""This government can't offer a solution to the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention because they created it. ""If the government were serious about ending the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention they would match Labour's fully-funded commitment to scrap the public sector pay cap and give our teachers the pay rise they deserve.""

"This video can not be played Six Nations 2018: Ireland 28-8 Scotland highlights 2018 Six Nations Ireland (14) 28 Tries:Stockdale 2, Murray, CroninCons:Sexton 4 Scotland (3) 8 Try:KinghornPen:Laidlaw Six Nations leaders Ireland secured a bonus-point win over Scotland to put the pressure on title rivals England. The Irish victory means they will be champions if the English do not also score four tries and win away in France in Saturday's later match. Two tries by Jacob Stockdale and further scores by Conor Murray and Sean Cronin secured a deserved Irish win. Blair Kinghorn scored on his first Test start for Scotland, but the visitors were left to rue missed chances. Follow France vs England live In a game of unrelenting pace, both teams created opportunities - but it was Ireland who proved more ruthless when it counted. Ireland have an unassailable nine-point lead with one round still to play Get the latest news by addingrugby union alertsin BBC Sport's app Insight and chat - subscribe to the Rugby Union Weekly podcast Perhaps it was the occasion, or maybe the conditions - but both teams were left to count the cost of a frenetic opening quarter. Ireland were guilty of a number of sloppy errors as obvious passes were missed, balls were fumbled and even Johnny Sexton's trademark wraparound misfired more than once - including in the build-up to  Greig Laidlaw's opening penalty. Blair Kinghorn scored Scotland's try despite the efforts of Garry Ringrose The Scotland scrum-half split the posts and - against the run of play - the visitors led after 12 minutes, despite Ireland dominating territory and turning down a kickable shot at goal in favour of going to the corner. However the biggest mistake of the opening half was by Scotland's inside centre Peter Horne, who had players out wide but paid the price for his ambitious skip pass out wide that was read by Stockdale, who scampered over for the opening try. The game was being played at an incredible pace as both teams battled to keep the ball alive as much as possible. Ireland were under pressure when Keith Earls sent a pass floating into touch and then Sean Maitland burnt past his opposite number Stockdale in a flowing move that featured Ryan Wilson and Finn Russell. Sexton and Russell were driving the tempo and both fly-halves took quick line-outs in an attempt to gain an edge, with Russell and Stuart Hogg combining to allow Huw Jones to attack down the left wing. The centre gathered his own chip over Earls and broke Rob Kearney's tackle, but then butchered a two-on-one against Sexton when his pass to Hogg drifted forward. Ireland's 28-8 win left them on the brink of clinching the Six Nations Championship Ireland were not as wasteful with their attacks as Sexton and Murray combined to carve their way through the centre of the Scottish defence. Then Garry Ringrose produced a sublime tip-on pass to send Kearney careering down the left wing, only for Murray to be held up over the line. From the five-metre scrum, and with the clock in red, Ringrose again showed his playmaking ability with quick hands releasing Stockdale to send Ireland into an 11-point lead at the break. This video can not be played Townsend 'frustrated' with Scotland's missed opportunities Scotland have now played 47 away matches since the inception of the Six Nations in 2000 and have won just six - four of them in Rome. Gregor Townsend's side need to develop a meaner streak away from Murrayfield if they are to make the step up to the next level. They were caught cold at the start of the second half after conceding a needless penalty that allowed Ireland go to the corner, and Murray darted off the tail of the resulting maul to power over for his 12th Irish try. The visitors then produced another purple patch, but Maitland and Horne both sent passes into touch before a well-worked training ground move featuring Finn Russell, Stuart Hogg and Sean Maitland allowed Kinghorn to score on his full Test debut. Ireland are seeking what would be only their third grand slam Ireland knew the championship was within their grasp and they went after the bonus score with real intent. Ringrose was held up under the posts and Fraser Brown won a relieving penalty for his side, but the green wave kept coming. Sexton turned down another opportunity to kick for the posts and Sean Cronin, just moments after his arrival off the bench, muscled his way over for a try that reverberated across Dublin. Schmidt and his players must brace themselves for a week of Grand Slam fervour as the visit to Twickenham looms large on the horizon. Schmidt's current crop are attempting to become just the third Irish side to win a Grand Slam and join the legendary teams of 1948 and 2009. Scotland will travel to Rome for 'Super Saturday', when they will be heavily favoured to finish their championship on a winning note. It will be fascinating to see if Townsend chooses to recall the likes of Richie Gray or Alex Dunbar, or if he will give the team that won the Calcutta Cup another opportunity. The veteran full-back's place was thought to be under threat going into this year's Six Nations, but 140 metres made from 10 carries illustrates how important he remains to Ireland.

"Fans invade pitch & chant at owners as West Ham beaten by Burnley Kenedy (2) and Ritchie as Newcastle beat Southampton Bottom club West Brom hammered by Leicester after taking lead Bong own goal and Tosun give Everton win over 10-man Brighton Jordan Ayew sees red but Swansea draw at Huddersfield Stephan Shemilt and Luke Reddy I think that's about it. You can catch the closing stages ofChelsea-Palace hereand we'll back tomorrow for Sunday's two Premier League games. Happy Saturday. Huddersfield 0-0 Swansea Huddersfield Town Huddersfield boss David Wagner:""Weâre frustrated about the result, but the boys did everything right apart from score. We hit the bar and post three times and missed other chances. Sometimes you need luck and that wasnât on our side today. ""We played the overload quite well. I will only praise my players for how they played it. We had everything apart from the goal. We have to accept this point and the performance. ""It could be an important point at the end, even though I thought we deserved all three."" Huddersfield 0-0 Swansea Swansea City Swansea boss Carlos Carvalhal, speaking to Match of the Day:""It was a happy point because we were down to 10 players very early. It didn't look like a red card at the first moment but when I look again what my player did was exactly the same as the Huddersfield player did. It was strange. ""My team was really brave. They defended very well. It is not the sort of game I want, in the end it was a little bit lucky but the luck I think was completely deserved for how my players played with their fight. ""We showed another face of our character. We didn't have the conditions in this game to get more than one point."" Huddersfield 0-0 Swansea Perhaps, though, the most crucial and hard-fought point of the day was earned by Swansea, who clung on at Huddersfield despite having to play most of the game with 10 men. West Brom 1-4 Leicester Leicester City Leicester manager Claude Puel to MOTD:""It was a crucial win. The first half was end to end with open play and chances for both sides. Half-time it could have been 3-3. Second half we needed more management. It was better, clever, with more quality and we scored some fantastic goals. On Riyad Mahrez:""He scored last time and played a very good game this afternoon. It's important he continues but today he showed his quality. He's come back with a positive attitude and gave his best to the team. It was important for the team, for the confidence, to put the ball on the floor and keep calm. On Kelechi Iheanacho:""I'm happy for him because he shows a good mentality in training. He's had a good reward in the Cup but it was important to find that quality in the Premier League. All this gives us good quality and momentum for the next games in the Premier League."" West Brom 1-4 Leicester West Bromwich Albion West Brom manager Alan Pardew speaking to MOTD:""After taking the lead and starting well, we looked in a much better place. They scored a great goal and unfortunately they scored another great goal. We had moments to extend our lead and our confidence was shot from that. I felt the Schmeichel save and not getting a second goal is where it hinged for us. ""It's difficult to play so well for a big portion of the game and still lose 4-1, but we still have to believe and fight. The last 20 minutes was painful for us, it's difficult for the players, but I'm not going to make excuses. We've got to fight to the end and they got that message after the game. ""Like the Huddersfield game, it was the sort we couldn't afford to lose, and we have. We have to show pride and professionalism, and show the fans that we care. We couldn't have worked harder this week but unfortunately it didn't happen."" West Brom 1-4 Leicester Meanwhile, West Brom were pushed a little closer to the trapdoor... Everton 2-0 Brighton Brighton & Hove Albion Brighton manager Chris Hughton speaking to MOTD:""We fell well below the
standards weâve set and the level we needed, at a place like Everton to get a result. ""Weâve been on a very good run
and came in to the game with a lot of confidence. We restricted them to minimal chances
going into half time. Once the first goal goes in
it lifts the crowd here and it becomes very difficult. ""In that last period they
were able to raise their game, they have a lot of offensive options in their
squad. ""You want a reaction from
the team. Generally weâve been in most games but this is not a good one for us
today particularly with the run weâve been on.""  Everton 2-0 Brighton Everton Everton manager Sam Allardyce speaking to BBC MOTD:""Usually when you lose two games and in the way that we've lost them, you have to find a response from the players. At Goodison, I don't think there's been a problem. Our big problem has been away from home. If you reverse it [home and away form] and look with the home points we've gained weâre riding high in the top six."" ""The players had to handle the
pressure today, our form away, thatâs been a long standing problem and it was a big win under those
circumstances. The players accepted the pressure and delivered a performance. ""You have to give credit to
Wayne Rooney today, playing in a position he doesnât play in  normally. We had a very attacking three in midfield and we asked Wayne to be
responsible enough to be the playmaker and sit deep."" Everton 2-0 Brighton If Newcastle are nearing safety, then Everton can say that they will be in the Premier League next season. They comfortably swept aside in-form Brighton, who still perhaps need one more win. Newcastle 3-0 Southampton Southampton Southampton midfielder Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg:""I think no matter where you play, it is not good if you concede that early. At Newcastle it is very difficult. ""It's frustrating, a 3-0 loss. They weren't dangerous but neither were we. No excuses, just very disappointing ""In football you talk about confidence and momentum, but you can say that with us. Maybe that's a part of it, but it is very difficult to stand here five minutes after the match and not put any emotion into it. To not feel angry and blame yourself. ""There is no chance of us going out like this next week. This has to stop. How? Just the attitude and showing we can play football. ""Right now it is about showing who you are. We can't do this to the club, to the fans who have trouble and to ourselves. No excuses, we the players have to change what's going on."" Text 81111 From beating Inter Milan, a Wembley final and 8th place to this is 16 months . Unreal and frankly poor management. Adam, Southampton You've got to feel for the Saints, a good club that over the last few years has been drained of some real talent, both players and managers. Stuart, Colchester Newcastle 3-0 Southamption Southampton Southampton manager Mauricio Pellegrino speaking to MOTD:""The first goal in the first minute had a massive impact on the players. From then we couldn't react. The spirit of the team was poor. You can play poorly, but to play without spirit, this is the big pity today. ""When you play bad, you have to show you are on the pitch; running, fighting, playing as best you can. We still have eight games,  we are still alive. We have to say sorry to the fans because we could give them we we should have today. ""I am the Southampton manager right now. I believe I can keep the team up. If not I have to move along. There has to be winners and losers, but this is one week. It is part of life and part of football."" #bbcfootball Russell:Benitez is an actual magician isnât he? Keeping Newcastle in the Premier League on nothing more than Scotch mist, hopes and dreams, and duck tape. Theyâd be dangerous if he ever got access to some actual money. Pete: Even if Newcastle go down. You can't argue how well benitez has kept this side competitive. No money no problems. Newcastle 3-0 Southampton Newcastle United More from Rafael Benitez:""We know they have most of possession in their games, and after the goal they had to take the risk and attack. So we can be organised. When you play against a team who have possession and pass a lot you have to defend well and counter attack. ""Five points is good but still plenty to do. I have confidence in the team. sometimes it is bad luck, lack of experience, but confident we can do it."" Newcastle 3-0 Southampton Newcastle United Newcastle manager Rafael Benitez speaking to MOTD:""We knew it was a massive for us, against a team close to us in the table, we needed to do well. The players approached it well, the intensity they showed, they way they moved the ball, it was very pleasing. ""You need a bit of luck score early, we scored a second and needed the third just to kill the game. You could see the hard work they put in for the clean sheet. When you see the payers working so hard, as a manager you have to be pleased."" Well over an hour since the full-times and we're still talking about what went on at London Stadium. Burnley's 3-0 win at West Ham probably wasn't the most important result at the foot of the Premier League, though. Newcastle's home win against Southampton by the same scoreline has pushed them towards safety and left Saints right in the mire. Tex 81111 I'm sorry but for people to call our fans a disgrace don't understand the context of what's happening at West Ham. This has been building up for a long time, the lies that board have given us, the lack of investment and planning into the team, the traditions of what was once a family east end club have been taken away from us and today people have reached there limit. James West Ham 0-3 Burnley West Ham United West Ham captain Mark Noble:""People have to realise we are footballers, we are targets but we have got to protect ourselves. There were a number of fans on the pitch. In all honesty a lot of them were running towards the chairman but if someone approaches me personally I'm going to protect myself. It's a big stadium with a lot of area to cover, its tough for security. ""There was a break, we conceded two goals really quickly and it killed the game. The atmosphere was tough which was great for Burnley. We couldn't cope with it after they scored. ""In football winning games is all that matters, but a team like West Ham and every team apart from Man City are going to lose games. It's hard for us, the fans are unhappy with the board, obviously. As soon as we go a goal down we get targeted. A lot of players haven't played in that atmosphere before."" West Ham 0-3 Burnley West Ham United More from West Ham captain Mark Noble:""It's been like it for a while. The only way to stop is it to win games and we are not going to win every game. ""The way it's been going since the start of the season, a result, a win is the only thing that will stop the fans voicing their opinion, They are not happy, that's obvious. The players take the brunt of things, which is fine. We understand they are frustrated. But we are going to lose games and we are going to need them behind us. ""There's a lot out there who aren't happy at the moment, It's a tough atmosphere to play in."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"One of the best things about Tate Modern's Picasso exhibition is it contains some terrible art. I mean real howlers. Paintings in which we see the modern master fluffing his lines and losing his form. It's such a relief. Not because we learn he is fallible like the rest of us - we're not idiots, we know artists aren't gods - but it shows the exhibition's curators had the confidence and integrity to tell the whole story of Pablo Picasso in 1932 - his so-called annus mirabilis - and not palm us off with a superficial Now That's What I Call Picasso '32: Greatest Hits compilation. I'm not saying the show is packed with turkeys, far from it. But there are enough duds for you to be able to appreciate those moments when the prolific Spaniard went into masterpiece mode, as he did with Nude in a Black Armchair. Nu au fauteuil noir (Nude in a Black Armchair) This is a painting of such exquisite beauty, balance and sensuality you have no option but to stop and stare. And the more you look, the more you see. At first glance, there is a voluptuous reclining female nude on a black chair, lit by a fiery sun, visible though a window that is partially obscured by the green leaves of an indoor plant. You note the obvious influences in both composition and style. There's a hint of Titian's Venus, of Manet's Olympia, and Matisse's Odalisque with Magnolias. And then there is the evidence of Picasso's own artistic journey: a slab of blue from his early days, the disjointed body parts echoing his Cubist period, the sinuous lines of his post-war modernist-primitivism, and the otherworldly dreaminess of his more recent interest in surrealism. But (at the risk of sounding like a total phoney), it is its soul that mesmerises. It is so poetic, and erotic, and sonorous. This is a painting of love spelt out in the graceful fluidity of the artist's line and harmonic balance of his colours. Nu sur la plage (Woman on the Beach) The subject of his adoration is a 22-year-old Parisian called Marie-Therese Walter, who had been his lover for the past five years. They met by chance in 1927 at the Galeries Lafayette department store, where he told her she had ""an interesting face"" and that he'd like to do a portrait of her. He introduced himself as Picasso. She had no idea who he was, but the chat-up line worked all the same. Within weeks they were lovers, although the then 45-year-old artist was already married to Olga, a Russian ballerina who had danced with Sergei Diagilev's famous Ballets Russes. Their marriage wasn't going terribly well. Portrait of Olga in an Armchair, 1918 Olga was increasingly anxious about the relationship, which was not unreasonable as her husband was a serial philanderer. She yearned to settle down to a bourgeois life of respectability with smart friends, smart clothes, and smart homes. Picasso did not. Well, not quite as much, anyway. He wanted to rekindle the bohemian excitement of his youth, to recharge his creative batteries, and to go again. This is the middle-aged man we meet in the exhibition. An artist at the crossroads of his career with a major retrospective of his work planned for the summer (restaged in part in this Tate show), which he hopes will, once and for all, establish him as the greatest living artist in the world. For this to happen, the mid-life crisis he is experiencing urgently needs to be resolved. Marie-Therese is his way out. She will be his inspiration, his muse, and his weapon against Henri Matisse, his great rival for the world art crown. But before we can get to her, he needs to deal with Olga, to whom we are introduced at the beginning of the exhibition, in an angry, jagged painting called Woman with Dagger. La Femme au stylet (Woman with Dagger) It is Picasso's re-imaging of Jacques-Louis David's iconic painting,The Death of Marat,external(1793). The themes of betrayal, revenge, and a murdered competitor unite the two images, but while David's has an air of resignation, Picasso's is full of rage. If this is indeed a painting of Olga attacking a rival - or even if it's not - it vividly demonstrates what a poisoned chalice it was to be Picasso's lover. At first there is the charm and generosity when you are immortalised on canvas or in stone by the gifted artist. But when your time was up, his unkindness and thoughtlessness could be so devastating and destructive as to drive you to the point of insanity. So, while you walk around this exhibition and see painting after painting that explores his passion for Marie-Therese, together with their little in-jokes and furtive allusions, there is something ominous about these images of the young, athletic woman being depicted and manipulated. Take a look at The Dream for example; a technically excellent painting that makes you feel uneasy. We see Marie-Therese asleep in a red armchair, her head resting on one shoulder, with her left breast exposed in the classical manner. Le Reve (The Dream) Her hands rest suggestively on her lap, while half her face has been turned into a phallus. The explicit suggestion being she has sex on her mind. But does she? Isn't she asleep? The artist couldn't possibly know what she was dreaming, could he? Isn't this more likely the imposition of Picasso's unconscious (or conscious) thoughts projected onto his young lover? The exhibition asks you that question time and time again. What's going on here? Which is probably exactly what Picasso was asking himself, as he pushed the boundaries and possibilities of his art further and further. The result of this intense period of painting and sculpting (the bulbous, phallic busts he made of Marie-Therese's head have a disturbing Elephant Man-like quality), is a year's worth of work that is very impressive on many fronts. What painter today is challenging the medium in the same way Picasso did nearly 80 years ago? Maybe he took it as far as it would go?

"Final score: France women 18-17 England women Tremouliere 2, Drouin tries, Tremouliere pen Fra Dow, Cokayne tries, Daley-Mclean 2 cons, 1 pen Eng England's men beaten 22-16 in France to hand Ireland Six Nations title Earlier Jacob Stockdale scored twice as Ireland beat Scotland 28-8 Get involved #bbcsixnations or text 81111 Matthew Henry And that is that! Thank you very much for joining us on a brilliant day of rugby. There'll be some celebrating in France and Ireland tonight. Not a good day for either England side. The report on this women's game will be on the site shortly. See you soon. England can't do it! Danielle Waterman is barged into touch and that is it. France have won it with a last minute try. They are now huge favourites for this Women's Six Nations. England are beaten for the first time this year. England win it back at the restart! They have a chance! This is the last play. They must score. Jessy Tremouliere Heartbreak for England? It's Jessy Tremouliere



yet again. England pile into the breakdown and that leaves France with numbers outside. The full-back is too strong. She charges through a tackle. Her team-mates pile on top of her. France think they've won this at the death but Tremouliere misses the conversion. England will have one chance we're into the red... France go through the phases but there are numbers out wide.... That's way too risky, England. They try to play from their own line and France win the penalty at the breakdown. Three blue shirts pile over the ball. Penalty kicked to touch. Three minutes left. A French line-out to come inside the England 22. Both sides' Six Nations title hopes are on the line here. #bbcsixnations or text on 81111 The England girls can do this! They know how to dig deep and drive the ball - they can pull the win out of the bag. Believe! Anon Great cover from Ellie Kildunne. She runs back again to provide a last-ditch tackle and push the ball out into touch while in French hands. England safely get the ball back in play from the line-out but they're going to have to get this away from their own line sharpish. And clear of sorts. The ball is back 40 yards from the try line. But here come France again... Crikey. How have England survived here? They fumble at the restart and France have territory and possession. France go for a big crossfield kick but Ellie Kildunne scrambles back to save. England are awarded a penalty for a knock on and they're going to have to defend a huge scrum five metres from their own try line. Katy Daley-McLean Three more points added. Could be crucial. This is tense. Line-out messed up again but England recover the ball. They've got a penalty advantage and as a result Daley-McLean goes for a drop goal. She misses. She'll have a simple chance for three points in a sec but surely the better option was to run that for longer and go for the try? Groans from the home fans. England get another penalty. Is this tiredness creeping in? There have been plenty of penalties in the last few minutes. Again Daley-McLean makes good ground with the kick. Another line-out in the 22. Now a penalty goes England's way. The ref tells the French skipper to have a word with her team with this coming after a string of penalties on both sides. Again Daley-McLean kicks to the left-hand touchline but England make a mistake at the set-piece. All very scrappy all of a sudden. England make a change with Poppy Cleall and Abbie Dow making way for Izzy Noel-Smith



and Charlotte Pearce. Wow. What an atmposphere we have now. The fans are all on their feet as a record crowd of 17,440 is announced. Now they're belting out La Marseillaise again and waving their French flags. More cheers as France take a penalty quickly. 15 minutes left. This is going to the wire. England just a point in front. #bbcsixnations or text on 81111 The women's game between France and England is a really high standard and a very entertaining watch! Andy, Doncaster Aaaaand it's another mistake at the line-out from England. They want to start a driving maul but the French are not engaging and as a result England are being penalised. A change of tactic is needed. Another good opportunity looks to have been wasted. France have ball in hand again. England make a hash of the line-out but get a chance soon after. This one is clean and quickly spun out into the hands of Katy Daley-McLean. Offside France! A sloppy error. England kick to touch again. They're going to have another chance from the line-out deep in the French 22. What's going on with the England defence? There's desperation all round as France break into English territory again. And breathe. Camille Boudaud



has the ball knocked out of her hands in a tackle. England boot the penalty kick clear. About a 30-second breather and we go again. Jessy Tremouliere And Tremouliere makes no mistake from right in front of the sticks. We've got a thriller on our hands. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Recruitment targets for teaching have been missed for five years in a row The education secretary has promised to cut teachers' workload in an attempt to resolve a recruitment crisis in England's schools. Damian Hinds told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that there will be no more new changes to primary tests, GCSEs or A-levels. But he faced challenges from delegates over school funding shortages. And Mr Hinds told head teachers: ""It has been tough, funding is tight, I don't deny that at all."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the education secretary's promise to cut the ""bureaucratic burden"" on teachers. But there were calls from the conference floor for Mr Hinds to ""answer the question"" over problems with school funding. The education secretary had conceded: ""I understand why that's people's number one issue. I understand why, for everyone in this room, the funding of our schools and colleges is such an important topic."" Damian Hinds told head teachers he will work with them on cutting bureaucracy In his first speech to heads and teachers since becoming education secretary, Mr Hinds said that tackling the teacher shortage was a ""top priority"". Mr Hinds said long hours and red tape were among the ""biggest threats"" to recruiting and retaining staff. For five successive years,recruitment targets for teaching have been missedand schools have complained of the expense and disruption of relying on temporary staff or having to use teachers who are not specialists in the subjects they are teaching. Schools are spending Â£835m per year on supply agencies, according to the most recent government figures. The education secretary told the head teachers' conference on Saturday: ""With rising pupil numbers, I recognise that recruitment and retention is difficult for schools. ""And, clearly, one of the biggest threats to retention, and also to recruitment, is workload. ""Too many of our teachers and our school leaders are working too long hours - and on non-teaching tasks that are not helping children to learn."" Mr Hinds promised head teachers no more changes to the curriculum or to testing and exams in primary or secondary school until the end of this Parliament. But existing reforms that are already in the pipeline, such as the roll-out of changes to GCSEs, will go ahead. Mr Hinds spoke alongside the Ofsted chief, Amanda Spielman, and they highlighted the need to avoid any unnecessary bureaucracy around inspections. Ms Spielman said that Ofsted wants to help to reduce workload. Improvements in school will not be sustained ""if the people, who make them run so well, are burning out and leaving the profession"", Ms Spielman told the head teachers' conference. She warned against ""entirely unnecessary"" extra work such as rehearsals for inspections, so-called ""mocksteds"". Mr Barton, ASCL's general secretary, supported the push to cut workload. The heads' union has warned repeatedly of the recruitment problems facing schools, particularly in maths and science. The heads' leader warned that the ways into teaching have become confusingly complicated and need to be simplified. But Mr Barton said head teachers should work differently to reduce workload in their own schools, such as cutting needless meetings or administration. ""In the longer term, we're the generation who needs to redefine what it is to be a teacher in the 21st Century, to make sure we don't become the Luddite profession, doing things in the way we've always done them."" Labour's shadow schools minister, Mike Kane, said: ""This government can't offer a solution to the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention because they created it. ""If the government were serious about ending the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention they would match Labour's fully-funded commitment to scrap the public sector pay cap and give our teachers the pay rise they deserve.""

"The HMRC said the pensioners received a ""coding notice in error"" About 17,000 ex-mineworkers were wrongly told they owed thousands of pounds in tax due to an error. One of them was 79-year-old Michael Hinchley, from Nottinghamshire, who said he was shocked after being told in a letter he owed Â£26,000. Capita, the administrator for the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme, said the tax code letters were sent by mistake. The National Union of Mineworkers said it showed a lack of ""human contact and concern"" for UK miners. Michael Hinchley, 79, from Mansfield Woodhouse, a former electrician at Mansfield and Sherwood collieries, received the letter, stating he owed Â£26,235.36, on Monday. He said: ""I thought 'how can I owe that when I've been paying tax on my pension?' ""If someone who is elderly and doesn't have family to help them out gets a letter like that it could be really worrying for them."" The tax code letter sent to Mr Hinchley said he owed Â£26,235.36 Chris Kitchen, general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), said the union was ""inundated"" with calls after 17,000 former miners were issued with the letters, with some told they owed Â£50,000 in tax. He said the union was concerned no-one at the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) picked up on the error before the letters were generated. ""The letter would have been concerning for pensioners who already have small pensions and haven't got a large amount of money,"" he said. ""I don't want them to get distressed over it... it's an error in the new system. ""But it's highlighted our concerns of whether Capita are up to the job - there's a lack of human contact and concern with HMRC, too."" About 17,000 miners across the UK were issued with the letters The Mineworkers' Pension Scheme said in an automated response to callers that the correspondence received from HMRC was issued in error and it was working hard to rectify it. HMRC said it was ""sorry"" that Mr Hinchley received a ""coding notice in error"". A spokesman said: ""Where we are provided with incorrect information, we work hard to put matters right. ""We will ensure that no customer will lose out as a result of this."" A Capita spokesperson said: ""Following a change to HM Revenue & Customs' online PAYE portal, an incorrect update was made in processing information for members of the Mineworkers Pension scheme. ""This issue has been resolved and all members affected will shortly receive letters to advise that they do not need to take any action.

"Miles Hurley, pictured with his aunt, Elizabeth Hurley, is believed to be one of two young men stabbed on Thursday Actress and model Elizabeth Hurley's 21-year-old nephew is in hospital after being stabbed repeatedly in the back. Hurley confirmed the ""brutal"" attack on her Twitter account, saying it is an ""appalling"" time for the family. The Met Police could not confirm the victim's identity but it has been widely reported to be Miles Hurley, who is also a model. Police believe a group of men got out of a vehicle in south-west London and assaulted two men before fleeing. Officers were called on Thursday to Ascalon Street, near Battersea Park, at 20:52 GMT following reports of a stabbing. London Ambulance Service took the two men to a south London hospital, where they were treated for stab wounds. Quiz: What's Meghan Markle done this week?

Dubbed Doodoowatch, the scheme allows locals in Wimblington, Cambridgeshire, to mark dumping spots on an interactive map.

She added: ""We're not going to have this meeting take place until we see concrete actions."" The top US diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, was on his first official trip to Africa when the announcement was made. He told reporters on Friday the decision to meet Mr Kim was one ""the president took himself"". ""I spoke to him very early this morning about that decision and we had a very good conversation,"" Mr Tillerson added.

South Korean envoys - who recently met with Mr Kim in Pyongyang - have said North Korea is ""committed to denuclearisation"" as an end goal, but they have not said this would start before a meeting with the US.

"Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard showed Amber Rudd the bench where Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed Home Secretary Amber Rudd is to chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, as the investigation into the attempted murder of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter continues. Sergei and Yulia Skripal are both in a serious condition in hospital after being exposed to a nerve agent. Ms Rudd, who visited the crime scene in Salisbury, called the attack ""outrageous"". About 180 military personnel have been deployed to the city. Salisbury's MP John Glen sought to reassure his constituents that a ""whole range of tools are at our disposal"" once it is established who was behind the attack. Sergei Skripal - story of the man at centre of spy story Russian spy: What we know so far What are nerve agents? State TV anchor warns 'traitors' Saturday's Cobra meeting is the second in a week and comes four days after counter-terrorism detectives took over the investigation. Ms Rudd visited Salisbury District Hospital where Mr Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter are being treated. The home secretary did not, however, give any further details of the nerve agent used or how it was administered. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off On Friday, the investigation turned to Salisbury cemetery where the graves of the 66-year-old's wife and son, who died in 2012 and 2017 respectively, were cordoned off. Members of the military were also seen covering a police car that has been at Salisbury Hospital since Sunday, before men dressed in white hazardous materials suits examined it. It was later towed away from the hospital, covered by tarpaulin, on the back of an Army truck. The police car was towed away from the hospital on an Army truck The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance ""to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene"", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. Defence minister Tobias Ellwood said the military's presence reflected the ""seriousness"" of the situation adding that such responses would be discussed with Nato partners at the forthcoming July summit. He added: ""Some big questions arise as to how do you stand up to a clandestine and sinister attack deliberately done to play havoc in our society?"" Those deployed include experts in chemical warfare and decontamination. There is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. Military personnel were pictured making preparations at Winterbourne Gunner, Wiltshire, before deployment to Salisbury Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday -  remains in hospital and is conscious but ""very anxious"" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. Former Russian military security colonel Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre.

"Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father The daughter of an ex-Russian agent poisoned alongside her father in the UK ""hasn't done anything to deserve"" being targeted, a friend says. Police are investigating the attempted murder of Yulia and Sergei Skripal after both were found unconscious in Salisbury, Wiltshire on Sunday. Her childhood friend Irina Petrova told the BBC she remembered the Skripals as the ""perfect family"". But she thought people might be afraid to speak publicly about the pair. ""I'm starting to get scared,"" she said. ""No one wants to speak - even her relatives"". Ms Skripal, 33, and her 66-year-old father are being treated in Salisbury District Hospital after being exposed to a nerve agent, nearly a week after being found slumped on a shopping centre bench in the city. Troops, meanwhile, are spending a second day in Salisbury and have turned their attention to an ambulance station near the hospital. Military personnel in decontamination suits and masks covered a potentially contaminated ambulance with a tarpaulin as they prepared to move it from the scene. Military personnel have turned their attention to an ambulance station in Salisbury Decontamination specialists are working at multiple sites around Salisbury Home Secretary Amber Rudd is chairing a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, as the investigation into the attempted murder of the pair continues. Ms Petrova, who has known Ms Skripal since attending primary school with her in Russia, said relatives ""don't want to talk"", adding: ""There aren't many of them left."" Ms Skripal's mother, uncle and elder brother have all died in recent years. Sergei Skripal - story of the man at centre of spy story Poisoning poses major challenge for MI6 Russian spy: What we know so far What are nerve agents? State TV anchor warns 'traitors' This video can not be played Business owner Molly Cook says customers are cancelling appointments at her salon Ms Skripal, who was visiting her father from Moscow, has worked for multinationals, including Nike and PepsiCo, according to friends. She moved to the UK with her father in 2010 when he was released as part of a spy swap, but returned to Moscow five years later. She enjoyed her time in the UK, Ms Petrova said, adding that she passed her driving test and intended to apply for citizenship but later changed her mind. Sergei Skripal and his family, holding baby Yulia in the early 1980s ""She told me she liked everything there,"" she said. ""They had an amazing place, and amazing house."" She said Ms Skripal, who went to university in Moscow, returned to the city to live with her long-term boyfriend. Ms Skripal had an ""excellent"" relationship with her father, she said, and had been the ""perfect kid"" who received excellent grades at school. Ms Petrova said Ms Skripal ""never shared her problems"" - even when her father was arrested for spying in 2004, with the incident broadcast on Russian state TV. She said ""everyone was shocked"" at the news, adding that Ms Skripal was a ""normal kind of person"". Ms Petrova said no one knew who her father was before the arrest, but noted that Mr Skripal was often abroad and that his work had brought the family to Malta for a time. She said Ms Skripal rarely spoke about her problems, but was ""always smiling, just like her mother"". The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have been taped off BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera Observers say that with Russia, it increasingly looks as if the intelligence agencies are happy with ""implausible deniability"" - even if it seems obvious they are behind an act, they simply say ""prove it"" and try to muddy the waters with misinformation as much as possible. If the theory of Russian revenge and message sending is correct, it raises difficult questions for British intelligence. MI6 relies on recruiting agents like Skripal in countries like Russia to provide secrets. It has always prided itself on keeping the identity of those agents secret in order to protect them. But if the perception emerges that it cannot protect those agents - even if they are in the UK - then it will make it much harder to do its job and recruit agents to gather intelligence. Poisoning poses major challenge for MI6 Security minister Ben Wallace has described the attack on Ms Skripal and her father as a ""very serious incident with horrendous outcomes"", saying the government was prepared to ""respond with the full force of the UK's resources"". ""Someone has come onto our soilâ¦ has recklessly, brazenly, committed what looks like a very nasty crime, with a nerve agent  prohibited, by most international lawsâ¦ and has potentially put lots of people at risk,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. When asked if Mr Skripal worked for British intelligence services, he said it was a long-standing government policy to keep such details secret, ""not least [for] the security of individuals"". BBC home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, in Salisbury This video can not be played Dominic Casciani visits the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday with his daughter It's been a busy Saturday for shoppers. What many people have been worried about is whether the city will suffer in the long-term because of its new, and unfortunate, link to an extraordinary attempted murder. City officials have already been talking to the businesses most affected by the security operation - including those still behind a police cordon at The Maltings precinct. They're hoping to give them some marketing support and other advice so they can get back on their feet once they reopen. As for the investigation, there has been virtually no discernible activity. Police were again seen this morning at the graveyard on the London Road - but nobody appears to have seen the military units which were meant to be arriving to help the police. Police say no bodies are being exhumed despite ongoing work at a cemetery Earlier on Saturday, police activity resumed at the cemetery where Ms Skripal's brother, Alexander Skripal, and mother, Liudmila Skripal are buried. Salisbury's London Road cemetery was cordoned off on Friday, but police confirmed officers were not exhuming a body.

"One of the best things about Tate Modern's Picasso exhibition is it contains some terrible art. I mean real howlers. Paintings in which we see the modern master fluffing his lines and losing his form. It's such a relief. Not because we learn he is fallible like the rest of us - we're not idiots, we know artists aren't gods - but it shows the exhibition's curators had the confidence and integrity to tell the whole story of Pablo Picasso in 1932 - his so-called annus mirabilis - and not palm us off with a superficial Now That's What I Call Picasso '32: Greatest Hits compilation. I'm not saying the show is packed with turkeys, far from it. But there are enough duds for you to be able to appreciate those moments when the prolific Spaniard went into masterpiece mode, as he did with Nude in a Black Armchair. Nu au fauteuil noir (Nude in a Black Armchair) This is a painting of such exquisite beauty, balance and sensuality you have no option but to stop and stare. And the more you look, the more you see. At first glance, there is a voluptuous reclining female nude on a black chair, lit by a fiery sun, visible though a window that is partially obscured by the green leaves of an indoor plant. You note the obvious influences in both composition and style. There's a hint of Titian's Venus, of Manet's Olympia, and Matisse's Odalisque with Magnolias. And then there is the evidence of Picasso's own artistic journey: a slab of blue from his early days, the disjointed body parts echoing his Cubist period, the sinuous lines of his post-war modernist-primitivism, and the otherworldly dreaminess of his more recent interest in surrealism. But (at the risk of sounding like a total phoney), it is its soul that mesmerises. It is so poetic, and erotic, and sonorous. This is a painting of love spelt out in the graceful fluidity of the artist's line and harmonic balance of his colours. Nu sur la plage (Woman on the Beach) The subject of his adoration is a 22-year-old Parisian called Marie-Therese Walter, who had been his lover for the past five years. They met by chance in 1927 at the Galeries Lafayette department store, where he told her she had ""an interesting face"" and that he'd like to do a portrait of her. He introduced himself as Picasso. She had no idea who he was, but the chat-up line worked all the same. Within weeks they were lovers, although the then 45-year-old artist was already married to Olga, a Russian ballerina who had danced with Sergei Diagilev's famous Ballets Russes. Their marriage wasn't going terribly well. Portrait of Olga in an Armchair, 1918 Olga was increasingly anxious about the relationship, which was not unreasonable as her husband was a serial philanderer. She yearned to settle down to a bourgeois life of respectability with smart friends, smart clothes, and smart homes. Picasso did not. Well, not quite as much, anyway. He wanted to rekindle the bohemian excitement of his youth, to recharge his creative batteries, and to go again. This is the middle-aged man we meet in the exhibition. An artist at the crossroads of his career with a major retrospective of his work planned for the summer (restaged in part in this Tate show), which he hopes will, once and for all, establish him as the greatest living artist in the world. For this to happen, the mid-life crisis he is experiencing urgently needs to be resolved. Marie-Therese is his way out. She will be his inspiration, his muse, and his weapon against Henri Matisse, his great rival for the world art crown. But before we can get to her, he needs to deal with Olga, to whom we are introduced at the beginning of the exhibition, in an angry, jagged painting called Woman with Dagger. La Femme au stylet (Woman with Dagger) It is Picasso's re-imaging of Jacques-Louis David's iconic painting,The Death of Marat,external(1793). The themes of betrayal, revenge, and a murdered competitor unite the two images, but while David's has an air of resignation, Picasso's is full of rage. If this is indeed a painting of Olga attacking a rival - or even if it's not - it vividly demonstrates what a poisoned chalice it was to be Picasso's lover. At first there is the charm and generosity when you are immortalised on canvas or in stone by the gifted artist. But when your time was up, his unkindness and thoughtlessness could be so devastating and destructive as to drive you to the point of insanity. So, while you walk around this exhibition and see painting after painting that explores his passion for Marie-Therese, together with their little in-jokes and furtive allusions, there is something ominous about these images of the young, athletic woman being depicted and manipulated. Take a look at The Dream for example; a technically excellent painting that makes you feel uneasy. We see Marie-Therese asleep in a red armchair, her head resting on one shoulder, with her left breast exposed in the classical manner. Le Reve (The Dream) Her hands rest suggestively on her lap, while half her face has been turned into a phallus. The explicit suggestion being she has sex on her mind. But does she? Isn't she asleep? The artist couldn't possibly know what she was dreaming, could he? Isn't this more likely the imposition of Picasso's unconscious (or conscious) thoughts projected onto his young lover? The exhibition asks you that question time and time again. What's going on here? Which is probably exactly what Picasso was asking himself, as he pushed the boundaries and possibilities of his art further and further. The result of this intense period of painting and sculpting (the bulbous, phallic busts he made of Marie-Therese's head have a disturbing Elephant Man-like quality), is a year's worth of work that is very impressive on many fronts. What painter today is challenging the medium in the same way Picasso did nearly 80 years ago? Maybe he took it as far as it would go? He certainly took a lot of risks, not all of which paid off, and that is the joy of this show - you actually get to see him struggling to find a new form of visual expression. Picasso might have been a flawed man, but see this show and be in no doubt, he was a truly great artist.

"""This is a tragic piece of news - one we were really hoping we wouldn't have to [give]"" Three people and their attacker have been killed during a hostage situation at a California veterans' home. The facility in Yountville was the scene of an hours-long police standoff on Friday after a man entered the building with a rifle. A police spokesman said officers discovered three dead women alongside the gunman shortly before 18:00 local time (02:00 GMT). The three women are understood to have been employees at the centre. The identity of the gunman has not been released, and it is not yet known if he had any relationship to any of the victims. The veteran's home is situated in California's Napa Valley wine region ""This is a tragic piece of news - one we were really hoping we wouldn't have to come before the public to give,"" said California Highway Patrol Assistant Chief Chris Childs. He said the local deputy who was first on the scene ""put himself in harm's way... and exchanged initial gunfire with the suspect."" ""We credit him with saving the lives of others in the area by eliminating the ability of the suspect to go out and find further victims."" The veterans' home is one of the largest in the United States, housing about 1,000 veterans who served in the US military in a number of conflicts as far back as World War Two. It is situated in the Napa Valley wine region, north of San Francisco.

"Recruitment targets for teaching have been missed for five years in a row The education secretary has promised to cut teachers' workload in an attempt to resolve a recruitment crisis in England's schools. Damian Hinds told a head teachers' conference in Birmingham that there will be no more new changes to primary tests, GCSEs or A-levels. But he faced challenges from delegates over school funding shortages. And Mr Hinds told head teachers: ""It has been tough, funding is tight, I don't deny that at all."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the education secretary's promise to cut the ""bureaucratic burden"" on teachers. But there were calls from the conference floor for Mr Hinds to ""answer the question"" over problems with school funding. The education secretary had conceded: ""I understand why that's people's number one issue. I understand why, for everyone in this room, the funding of our schools and colleges is such an important topic."" Damian Hinds told head teachers he will work with them on cutting bureaucracy In his first speech to heads and teachers since becoming education secretary, Mr Hinds said that tackling the teacher shortage was a ""top priority"". Mr Hinds said long hours and red tape were among the ""biggest threats"" to recruiting and retaining staff. For five successive years,recruitment targets for teaching have been missedand schools have complained of the expense and disruption of relying on temporary staff or having to use teachers who are not specialists in the subjects they are teaching. Schools are spending Â£835m per year on supply agencies, according to the most recent government figures. The education secretary told the head teachers' conference on Saturday: ""With rising pupil numbers, I recognise that recruitment and retention is difficult for schools. ""And, clearly, one of the biggest threats to retention, and also to recruitment, is workload. ""Too many of our teachers and our school leaders are working too long hours - and on non-teaching tasks that are not helping children to learn."" Mr Hinds promised head teachers no more changes to the curriculum or to testing and exams in primary or secondary school until the end of this Parliament. But existing reforms that are already in the pipeline, such as the roll-out of changes to GCSEs, will go ahead. Mr Hinds spoke alongside the Ofsted chief, Amanda Spielman, and they highlighted the need to avoid any unnecessary bureaucracy around inspections. Ms Spielman said that Ofsted wants to help to reduce workload. Improvements in school will not be sustained ""if the people, who make them run so well, are burning out and leaving the profession"", Ms Spielman told the head teachers' conference. She warned against ""entirely unnecessary"" extra work such as rehearsals for inspections, so-called ""mocksteds"". Mr Barton, ASCL's general secretary, supported the push to cut workload. The heads' union has warned repeatedly of the recruitment problems facing schools, particularly in maths and science. The heads' leader warned that the ways into teaching have become confusingly complicated and need to be simplified. But Mr Barton said head teachers should work differently to reduce workload in their own schools, such as cutting needless meetings or administration. ""In the longer term, we're the generation who needs to redefine what it is to be a teacher in the 21st Century, to make sure we don't become the Luddite profession, doing things in the way we've always done them."" Labour's shadow schools minister, Mike Kane, said: ""This government can't offer a solution to the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention because they created it. ""If the government were serious about ending the crisis in teacher recruitment and retention they would match Labour's fully-funded commitment to scrap the public sector pay cap and give our teachers the pay rise they deserve.""

The Swedish embassy in Pyongyang represents US, Canadian and Australian diplomatic interests there. Analysis by the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul South Korean President Moon Jae-in has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. His approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off, it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel Peace Prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship. Read Laura's piece in full The South Korean envoys met Mr Kim in Pyongyang this week. It was the culmination of a rapprochement that began at the New Year and saw the Koreas marching together at the Winter Olympics. The envoys then travelled to Washington to brief Mr Trump. North Korean cheerleaders with a unified Korean flag at the Winter Olympics Speaking outside the White House after the meeting, South Korean National Security Adviser Chung Eui-yong said Mr Kim was prepared to sit down with the US president and was now ""committed to denuclearisation"". In a statement sent to the Washington Post, North Korea's UN ambassador said the ""courageous decision"" of Mr Kim would help secure ""peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the East Asia region"".,external How to talk to the world's most secretive country What could happen now? There is no indication yet of where the Trump-Kim talks might take place, but the Korean border's demilitarised zone (DMZ) and Beijing are seen as likely options. Clearly for the US, South Korea and allied nations, denuclearisation is the key issue. North Korea has been isolated for decades because of its pursuit of nuclear weapons, in defiance of international laws. The North has carried out six nuclear testsand has missiles that could reach the US. However, the BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul says it is important to note that North Korea has not yet promised to abandon its nuclear weapons completely.

An easing, if not removal, of sanctions certainly. Perhaps a peace treaty to finally end the Korean War and a promise that if North Korea denuclearised then the US would finally withdraw its troops from South Korea. Did sanctions push North Korea into talks? Asian markets rally on US-NK talks hopes What missiles does North Korea have? The US has tens of thousands of military personnel there and the massive annual joint war games infuriate the North because it believes they are preparation for invasion. The UN was among the most positive, with Secretary-General Antonio Guterres commending the ""leadership and vision"" of all concerned. Chinese President Xi Jinping telephoned Donald Trump on Friday to welcome the development and urge all sides to avoid doing anything that could impede the improving situation. Russia, Germany, the EU and the IAEA all voiced hope that talks would reduce the risk of conflict erupting.

"Wiltshire Police Chief Constable Kier Pritchard showed Amber Rudd the bench where Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed Home Secretary Amber Rudd is to chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, as the investigation into the attempted murder of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter continues. Sergei and Yulia Skripal are both in a serious condition in hospital after being exposed to a nerve agent. Ms Rudd, who visited the crime scene in Salisbury, called the attack ""outrageous"". About 180 military personnel have been deployed to the city. Salisbury's MP John Glen sought to reassure his constituents that a ""whole range of tools are at our disposal"" once it is established who was behind the attack. Sergei Skripal - story of the man at centre of spy story Russian spy: What we know so far What are nerve agents? State TV anchor warns 'traitors' Saturday's Cobra meeting is the second in a week and comes four days after counter-terrorism detectives took over the investigation. Ms Rudd visited Salisbury District Hospital where Mr Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter are being treated. The home secretary did not, however, give any further details of the nerve agent used or how it was administered. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off On Friday, the investigation turned to Salisbury cemetery where the graves of the 66-year-old's wife and son, who died in 2012 and 2017 respectively, were cordoned off. Members of the military were also seen covering a police car that has been at Salisbury Hospital since Sunday, before men dressed in white hazardous materials suits examined it. It was later towed away from the hospital, covered by tarpaulin, on the back of an Army truck. The police car was towed away from the hospital on an Army truck The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance ""to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene"", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. Defence minister Tobias Ellwood said the military's presence reflected the ""seriousness"" of the situation adding that such responses would be discussed with Nato partners at the forthcoming July summit. He added: ""Some big questions arise as to how do you stand up to a clandestine and sinister attack deliberately done to play havoc in our society?"" Those deployed include experts in chemical warfare and decontamination. There is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. Military personnel were pictured making preparations at Winterbourne Gunner, Wiltshire, before deployment to Salisbury Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday -  remains in hospital and is conscious but ""very anxious"" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. Former Russian military security colonel Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted by the Russian government of passing secrets to MI6, but given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a ""spy swap"". Valery Morozov, a Russian exile, told BBC News that Mr Skripal was working in cyber security. This video can not be played Amber Rudd praises Salisbury police response Russian foreign ministerSergei Lavrov has denied his country's involvement in the attempted murder of the ex-spy.

"South Korean President Moon Jae-in - dupe or genius? South Korean leader Moon Jae-in is either a diplomatic genius or a communist set on destroying his country and US President Donald Trump is either a master of brinkmanship or a pawn in a more devious game - depending on who you speak to. But it is the other actor in this saga, Kim Jong-un, the only one who has yet to make a direct statement, who may just be the most significant player in this most extraordinary of political gambles. From the moment he extended an apparent olive branch to the South in his new year message to the cordial delegations to Pyeongchang for the Winter Olympics, it became clear that Kim Jong-un had mastered the most sophisticated crafts of propaganda. Some will viewhis personal invitation to Mr Trump to hold talks with him- as well as the commitment to freeze further nuclear tests - as the real diplomatic masterstroke after a year that was unprecedented for the level of naked hostility the US and the North bared toward one another. But the risk here belongs to both Moon Jae-in and Donald Trump. In a situation where neither can claim sole mastery of the narrative, without a clear exit strategy, and when there are so many definitions for both success and failure, a lot is at stake. Mr Moon is viewed by his supportersas the negotiator-in-chief who has now skilfully managed to get Mr Kim to at least talk about getting rid of nuclear weapons. He is the one who spotted the opportunity duringthe North Korean leader's speech in January- which offered a glimmer of hope that the reclusive state was willing to engage with the South - and grabbed it with both hands. This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un The dizzying level of diplomacy and a frenzy of visits between North and South has now delivered - it seems. ""People are calling this the North Korean charm offensive, I actually think this is a South Korean charm offensive. This is something President Moon Jae-in clearly wanted,"" John Delury from Yonsei University said to me even before the talks were announced. Mr Moon knew his envoys would have to extract the word ""denuclearisation"" from Mr Kim when they visited Pyongyang. He also knew having two of his top level government ministers looking cosy with the North Korean leader would not go down well in Washington or Tokyo. But it was worth the risk. The US would not have considered talking to the communist state without that meeting. His chosen delegates got what they needed. The South Korean leader is also attempting the role of honest broker, handling Mr Trump and Mr Kim at the same time. He is choosing his words carefully and keeping his cards close to his chest while flattering those who respond to the spotlight. Is North Korea just playing the US? US ties any N Korea talks to nuclear arms In his New Year's address he said Mr Trump deserved ""huge credit"" for talks between the two Koreas, knowing it would please him. He is also using language that will reassure a concerned Republican administration.The language of the South Korean statement announcing the talkswas also fulsome in its admiration for Trump's handling of the situation leading up to this moment. Sanctions will stay in place, Mr Moon had said earlier, and Mr Trump has now confirmed that. But everybody knows it wasn't always like that. Just six months ago Mr Trump waspromising to rain down ""fire and fury like the world has never seen""on North Korea if it dare threaten the US. Prof Haksoon Paik, lead researcher at the Sejong Institute, said that threat level felt ""totally unprecedented"". ""President Moon was very much concerned about nuclear threat of war. Kim Jong-un was in the same situation. We were hearing from the likes of the US Senator Lindsay Graham that lives will be lost over here. Donald Trump's unorthodox and unstable leadership had both Korean leaders worried about the potential of military options."" The US has always maintained that the permanent denuclearisation of North Korea is the endgame. Even with all the surprises up to this point, few believe Mr Kim would agree to that so if they don't achieve that what options does Trump have? South Korean officials held a landmark meeting with Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang this week So is Moon Jae-in - and indeed Donald Trump - being manipulated by a North Korea which has fooled the world before? ""By dangling before the US once again 'denuclearization of the Korean peninsula' and 'moratorium on nuclear and missile tests', Kim seeks to weaken sanctions, pre-empt US military pre-emption, and condition the world into accepting North Korea as a legitimate nuclear state,"" says Prof Lee Sung-yoon from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University. For Mr Trump this could be about one of the boldest and most historic moves a US leader has made in foreign relations. If this gamble works out, Mr Trump could credit himself as the president who sorted out North Korea. His administration has had very few victories, despite promising his voters there would ""so much winning."" He believes his ""maximum pressure"" strategy and his work to get China on side and help squeeze Pyongyang economically is working. Protesters in Seoul called for peace talks between the US and North Korea in November Reporters say he casually mentioned in the White House briefing room that he hoped they would give him credit for Kim Jong-un's offer. His voters certainly will. But meeting Mr Kim risks treating the communist leader as an equal. It could be a PR disaster. The date set is also only a few months away - a short time frame to achieve diplomatic goals with a leaderhe mocked as ""little rocket man"" just a few months ago. Prof Robert E Kelly at Busan University in South Korea tweeted: ""Trump doesn't study or even read. He tends to fly wildly off script. And May means there's almost no time for all the staff prep necessary."" Pyongyang has been playing this game for decades. Mr Trump is new to it. He may see a big win on the horizon, but his Art of the Deal book will not be the guide he needs to deal with Kim Jong-un. For Mr Moon this is about history and it is also personal. He played a part in previous attempts to negotiate with North Korea as chief of staff to President Roh Moo-hyun when he met Mr Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, in 2007. That was the last time the leaders of the two Koreas held a summit. A satellite launch by Pyongyang ended the talks. By then around $4.5bn of aid had been sent North during the policy of engagement. Critics believe that money helped to accelerate the weapons programme. North Korea crisis in 300 words Have the Winter Olympics repaired North-South Korea relations? The politics behind the 'peace Olympics' Having failed once before, Mr Moon is trying to complete the work he started, says Duyeon Kim, a senior fellow at the Korean Peninsula Forum. ""He's basically following the same playbook as his two liberal predecessors. It's exactly the kind of thing he would want to pick up and continue."" The border between the North and South is demarcated at the truce village of Panmunjom As a son of refugees from the North, Mr Moon is also aware of the effects of conflict on the peninsula. His parents fled North Korea aboard a UN supply ship in 1950 at the start of the Korean War alongside thousands of other refugees. He told reporters during his election campaign: ""My father fled from the North, hating communism. I myself hate the communist North Korean system. That doesn't mean I should let the people in the North suffer under an oppressive regime."" North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Meet North Korea's first family President Moon has acknowledged there are obstacles ahead. He is managing expectations and so much can go wrong. Duyeon Kim believes there is a high probability that at the end of this negotiating process, all parties will fail, and North Korea will decide it wants to keep its nuclear weapons. And yet... ""You just don't know. I don't think it's ever a lost cause, in spite of all the doubts and scepticism all parties should go in with clear eyes, but negotiate hard."" North Korea says its long-range missiles protect all of Korea from ""US aggressors"" President Moon's approval ratings took a hit during the Winter Olympics after he integrated the women's hockey team with players from the North and met a general from Pyongyang who had been accused of masterminding deadly attacks on South Koreans, though they have since rebounded. He may suffer politically if this fails but maybe for him, this is not about scoring political points. This is what he told Time magazine last year when he was presidential candidate: ""My mother is the only one [of her family] who fled to the South. [She] is 90 years old. Her younger sister is still in the North alive. My mother's last wish is to see her again."" These talks are a huge gamble with a communist state which is hard to read. But if, just if, he helps pull it off it may reduce the threat of nuclear war and he could win himself a Nobel peace prize. If all fails, it is back to brinkmanship.

"Kim Jong-un and Dennis Rodman watching a basketball game in Pyongyang in January 2014 The North Korean leader has received a copy of Donald Trump's book - so what can he learn from it? In June 2017, Dennis Rodman packed his bags, hopped on a plane and flew to North Korea to see Kim Jong-un. As you do. The former basketball player has known Mr Kim since 2013 and calls him a ""friend for life"". So, like any good friend, he took gifts. The goody-bag included soap, a mermaid puzzle and a Where's Waldo book. He also gave him a book written in 1987. The book, called Art of the Deal, was written by none other than Donald Trump - another of Rodman's friends. It is part-memoir, part self-help for dealmakers. As Mr Kim prepares for his proposed meeting with the US president - what might he learn from Mr Trump's book? A peek in Rodman's odd Korean gift bag This video can not be played The unlikely triangle: Trump, Rodman and Kim Jong-un Theodore Dobias was a drill sergeant in the US Marines who became a teacher at a private boarding school in New York. In the 1960s, one of his students was a teenage Donald J Trump. ""Dobias was the kind of guy who could slam into a goalpost wearing a football helmet and break the post, rather than his head,"" writes Mr Trump in Art of the Deal. ""If you stepped out of line, Dobias smacked you, and he smacked you hard."" Some of Mr Trump's classmates took on Mr Dobias physically. ""They ended up getting stomped,"" writes Mr Trump. Some of them sucked up. ""They became nebbishes [someone pitifully ineffectual or timid],"" he says. The future president tried a third route. He respected Mr Dobias, but let him know he wasn't intimidated. ""Like so many strong guys, Dobias had a tendency to go for the jugular if he smelled weakness,"" writes Mr Trump. ""On the other hand, if he sensed strength, but you didn't try to undermine him, he treated you like a man."" This video can not be played Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un: From enemies to frenemies During college, Mr Trump invested in a housing development in Cincinnati, Ohio. One of his project managers was a 65-year-old called Irving. Irving was short, fat, bald, with thick glasses and ""hands like Jell-o"". On the plus side - says Mr Trump - he was a ""great bullshitter"". One day, Irving went to collect overdue rent from a tenant. After swearing at the family's 10-year-old daughter, he asked her mother out for dinner. An hour later, the girl's father - ""huge guy, a monster, maybe 240 pounds"" - burst into Irving's office. ""I expected Irving to run for his life,"" writes Trump. ""Instead he started verbally attacking the man, flailing and screaming and chopping his hands in the air."" While waving his arms, Irving told the man he couldn't fight him. His hands were lethal weapons. They were registered with the police department, he said. The man - the 240lb monster - left the office. ""Irving probably saved his own life, just by showing no fear, and that left a very vivid impression on me,"" writes Mr Trump. ""You can't be scared. You do your thing, you hold your ground, you stand up tall, and whatever happens, happens."" After losing the 1980 US presidential election, Jimmy Carter went to see Donald Trump in his office. Mr Carter was fundraising for his presidential library, so Mr Trump asked how much he wanted. The answer? $5m (around $15m in today's money). ""I was dumbfounded,"" writes Mr Trump. ""I didn't even answer him."" But the meeting wasn't wasted. Trump-Kim talks 'vindicate US strategy' The political gamble of the 21st Century ""Until then, I'd never understood how Jimmy Carter became president,"" writes Mr Trump. ""The answer is that, as poorly qualified as he was for the job, Jimmy Carter had the nerve, the guts, the balls, to ask for something extraordinary."" Leverage, writes Mr Trump, is having something the other guy wants, needs, or can't do without. ""The best thing you can do is deal from strength,"" he says. ""And leverage is the biggest strength you can have."" Sometimes, though, leverage must be created. North Korea-Trump talks in 400 words Donald Trump: his life in pictures In 1974, Mr Trump agreed to buy the Commodore Hotel, but needed the authorities in New York to agree. So, he persuaded the Commodore's owners to tell the media they were planning to close. ""After they made the announcement, I wasn't shy about pointing out to everyone in the city what a disaster a boarded-up hotel would be for the Grand Central area,"" writes Mr Trump. ""You have to convince the other guy it's in his interest to make the deal."" Despite buying a number of casinos, Mr Trump says he has ""never gambled in his life"". ""To me, a gambler is someone who plays slot machines,"" he writes. ""I prefer to own slot machines. It's a very good business, being the house."" Mr Trump does not believe in the power of positive thinking. Instead, he says, he believes in the ""power of negative thinking"". ""I always go into the deal anticipating the worst,"" he writes. ""If you plan for the worst - if you can live with the worst - the good will always take care of itself."" The difference now, of course, is that real estate is a different game to nuclear weapons. Planning for the worst - for both Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un - is a petrifying prospect.

"Sergei Skripal holding Yulia at the time of her birth with family members Sergei Skripal, the ex-Russian spy who is fighting for his life after being poisoned in Salisbury, was born in the Soviet Kaliningrad region on 23 June 1951. It was close enough to the West to pick up the sound of BBC World Service radio broadcasts and friends talk about him recalling the faint sounds. He was physically strong and chose to join the elite Soviet airborne troop known as the Desantniki. In 1979, Soviet troops went into Afghanistan and Skripal was one of the first to go in. After this, he graduated from the Diplomatic Military Academy in Moscow. Spies like us: How defectors come in from the cold Kim Philby, British double agent, reveals all in secret video Military deployed after poisoning There he seems to have been talent spotted by the GRU - Russia's military intelligence - and would embark on the second phase of his life as an intelligence officer. His initial role in the GRU was in its First Directorate, which focused on spying in Europe. This gave him the chance to serve overseas for military intelligence under cover as a diplomat. Friends say he later spoke of this period with excitement, recalling jumping out of a plane in Afghanistan. Sergei Skripal pictured as a lieutenant in the Russian Airborne Troops He had two postings in Europe - one in the 1980s and one in the 1990s. It was during this time that it was alleged that he was approached by British intelligence - beginning the next phase of his career. It would later be claimed by the authorities that he provided the identities of Russian undercover operatives to the British in return for money. In 1999 or 2000 (there is some debate on the date) he quit the GRU. He was fed up with the corruption, the BBC understands from friends. He was then believed to have gone to work for Boris Gromov. Gromov had been the last commander of Soviet forces in Afghanistan who was the last soldier to leave the country, crossing the so-called Friendship Bridge on 15 February 1989. Skripal pictured in central Asia in 1977 This led to a relatively settled period of Skripal's family life. He had married Liudmila when they were still young. She had been his teenage sweetheart in Kaliningrad. Their son Alexander - who was known as Sasha - would be born in 1974 and a daughter, Yulia, in 1984. Sasha got married and settled into a job, while Yulia was described as the brightest spark in the family and she learnt English. But in December 2004, the settled family life was shattered when he was arrested for spying. Sergei Skripal and Liudmila on their wedding day in June 1972 It is claimed that his shoulder was deliberately wrenched from his socket by officers from the Russian security service (FSB) during the arrest. TV cameras were there to capture the whole event. He was convicted swiftly in a trial largely closed to the media and sentenced to 13 years in a labour camp - much spent in Mordovia (the same place a member of the Pussy Riot group was imprisoned in 2011). Reports from those who have been imprisoned there describe tough conditions, but Skripal, friends say, did not succumb. One advantage was Skripal had been a championship boxer in the Soviet army (explaining his slightly squashed nose). This proved useful when on remand in Moscow, because it allowed him to deal with a couple of criminals whom he suspected had been paid to make his life difficult. In the labour camp, even though he was now over 50 years old, he could take the blows from guards and few of the other inmates wanted to take him on. The period did have its difficulties though. His son Sasha lost his job and, it is thought, his marriage, because of his father being a convicted spy (something Sergei himself may have felt guilty about). Suddenly, in July 2010, he was released as part of a major spy swap. When he had been in prison he had dreamt of ice cream and this was the first thing he wanted to eat. He was reunited with Liudmila. They decided to set up home in Salisbury because they liked the area, the BBC understands from friends. He first of all lived in a flat where he was welcomed by neighbours and then moved to the house in a cul-de-sac - the same house that is now a major crime scene for police. The life of spies after they have defected or are swapped is rarely easy. Much has been made of one of Britain's most infamous spies, Kim Philby - an MI6 officer who provided its secrets to the Soviet Union's KGB - and his time in Moscow, where he continued to listen to the cricket. But friends say Skripal was a resilient character who had worked to make the most of the situation. There have been reports that he may have given the odd lecture about Russia, but there is no outward sign he was involved in any ongoing operational activities. NRA sues as Florida signs gun-control law Trump accepts 'milestone' meeting with Kim Island bones 'likely' to be Earhart's Any knowledge would have been dated given he had left the GRU in 2000. Friends instead describe him enjoying the local museums, especially those with a military flavour like the Tank Museum in Bovington, as well as military and nature documentaries (they say he particularly liked David Attenborough). He was said to have missed Russia. Skripal with his father Friends describe him as a patriot who loved his country, but disliked the regime that ran it. They say he slowly got used to his new surroundings. Liudmila grew roses in the garden while Sergei liked to barbecue inedible sausages. But this new life for the couple was short-lived. In 2011, Liudmila was diagnosed with cancer. She died on 23 October 2012. He would frequently place flowers at her grave. In July 2017, son Sasha died in St Petersburg while on holiday with a girlfriend. Family told the BBC he was rushed to the hospital and died of sudden liver failure - they believe it might have been suspicious. Skripal himself was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and took insulin daily. In the summer of 2015, Yulia went back to Moscow, possibly to be with a boyfriend, but kept in touch with her father over Skype. Sergei's elder brother also died in 2016 after losing weight. With his family gone, a friend said Sergei made the best of the situation. He would eat Russian dumplings called Pelmeni while playing World War II tank games on his computer. Friends say he would have been pleased to see his daughter as she arrived for her recent visit. It was a visit which would end with both of them lying in a critical condition in hospital beds following their poisoning with a nerve agent. Skripal once told a close friend that in the darkest days of the labour camp he kept his mind healthy by building a home in his imagination. His friends hope that same trick may be working for him now as he fights for his life.

"John Culley, who was employed by Southend Borough Council, was not the girl's teacher, the panel heard An ""intellectually arrogant"" teacher who contacted a 13-year-old girl on social media and gave her gifts has been told he can continue teaching. John Culley was a music teacher for Southend Borough Council in Essex and worked with the town's youth orchestra. He invited the girl to his 60th birthday party in 2016, two years after he was told to stop contact. A professional misconduct hearing,externalsaid his interest was not sexual and a teaching ban was ""not proportionate"". The National College for Teaching and Leadership panel heard Mr Culley first contacted the girl using Facebook private messages in 2014, when she was 13, and gave her gifts including CDs. Her parents contacted his line manager, who in November 2014 told him to stop messaging the teenager. The panel was told Mr Culley continued to privately message the girl, who was not one of his pupils, for four days afterwards. In one message he wrote: ""Sadly when an older single man messages a girl some people could get the wrong idea and in the worst case I could lose my job."" When his line manager left her job in 2016, the peripatetic music teacher resumed Facebook contact. The panel said an ""extremely troubling"" aspect of the messages was the request for secrecy and deletion, the increasing frequency over months and a series of messages late at night and early in the morning. It was told the teenager felt ""under pressure"" to reply to up to six messages a day and was ""quite guilty when she was too busy to message him"". In mitigation, their contact was not that of a teacher and pupil, the panel heard. The panel said it was completely satisfied the ""friendship"" and private messaging was not sexually motivated and this has not been alleged. Mr Culley also demonstrated remorse and admitted the messages could be seen as ""pestering"". The panel said he was ""intellectually arrogant, dismissive of rules, yet naive; a man totally absorbed by music"" and at the time was ""emotionally and socially vulnerable"". It found he had brought the profession into disrepute but should not be banned from teaching. He has since developed links with adult musical organisations and returned to a linguistic teaching career.

" By Beth Rose, BBC Ouch:PyeongChang Conditions are good. Nineteen-year-old Millie Knight is preparing for a race that will see her hit speeds of 115km/h (71mph). Registered blind, she will rely on her guide, Brett Wild, to talk her down the mountain. They are a team. Fist bump. Ritual. A whispered chant from Irish band, The Script: “You could be the greatest, you can be the best, you can be the King Kong banging on your chest.” Into the gates. “Three, two, one.” Wild pushes off. “Go.” Knight follows. The mountain falls away. The cut of skis on snow and the intense exchange of instructions is all that can be heard as Wild shouts out the course. Spectators stand silent, forbidden to make noise. Knight only has 5% vision. It is peripheral and blurry but she catches glints of Wild’s orange jacket, which keeps her on track. Twists and turns. Rhythmic. And then the final stretch, downhill, skis straight, body tucked. All out until they're over the line. The mountain's silence is broken by cheering. Knight and Wild have become champions in the World Para Alpine Skiing Championships. It's a first for Britain at such an event. But Knight fails to stop. She crashes at 115km/h. “I heard her on the comms screaming,” says Wild. “I looked back and could tell instantly how bad it was. She was getting rag-dolled and there was blood all over the snow. She slid on the ice and it ripped her face.” Knight had skidded under an inflatable barrier, which re-inflated on top of her. “She was saying she couldn't breathe,” says Wild. Sports psychologist Kelley Fay watched the crash unfold. “Brett was frantic. Millie wouldn't have known what was happening,” she says. Knight was taken to hospital. Besides cuts and bruises, she was apparently unharmed and discharged in time for the medal ceremony. Knight's injuries The next day the pair returned to compete in the Super G - a form of slalom. But as psychologist Fay took up her position at the bottom of the course, she felt uneasy. “I knew Millie’s head wasn't in the right place,” she says. “So I radioed up and we pulled her out of the race. She was really cross, but in the end she could see we'd made the right decision for her.” It was the first sign that all was not well with the teenager. “We'd been skiing together for over a year and she'd never crashed,” says Wild. “Millie was known for staying on her feet.” That was January 2017. A month later, in South Korea at a test event for the Paralympics, the blind skier found herself in hospital again. “It was at the finish line again,” Knight says. “I flipped and landed on my head a couple of times and we were blue-lighted off to hospital.” A diagnosis of concussion would take her off the ski slopes. Recuperation included light gym sessions, but too much exertion could wipe her out for days. That's when fear crept in.” Knight's brain scan Unable to confront the mountains, the fear started to eat away at her. She threw herself into her school work - A-levels were looming - and her love of photography. Knight photographs people and movement - skiing rarely features - and often sells her work. “I take photos to see the world because the way I see it is very different,” she says. “It's almost like a new language to me. When I look through the camera I realise that's what everyone else sees.” Knight started to prepare for her first solo photography exhibition. But as hard as she focused, her mind kept replaying the crash. “I thought, ‘Have I lost this? Have I lost my bottle? Am I not going to be as good as I was?’” Knight had always been known for her fearlessness. She has skied since she was six - the same age that she was left with 5% vision. As a baby, an infection scarred the retina of her right eye. Five years later the sight was gone in her left eye, too. “I don't remember having sight,” she says. “It's not an event in my life and my mum never made a big deal about it.” “She was a massive skier, so she just put me into ski school and didn't tell them I couldn't see.” Knight stayed close to the instructor and became a natural follower on the snow. Millie Knight The family took annual ski holidays. It was something to create memories with and a chance to feel speed - after all, Knight would never ride a bike or drive a car. “I can see about two to three metres in front of me but it's unclear and foggy,” she says. “Within that, I don't really have depth perception, so I don't know how far away things are.” Millie Knight and her mother Suzanne In 2012, when she was 12, Knight attended the opening ceremony of the London Paralympics. “That was the moment I was like, ‘Wow I want to be one of those athletes.’” Back at home in Canterbury, she contacted Disability Snowsport UK and began to focus on ski training. Her mother Suzanne acted as her guide. At 13, Knight made it on to the UK development team and just two years later qualified for the Sochi Paralympics. She became ParalympicsGB's youngest Winter Games athlete and was nominated as flag-bearer to lead the team into the Fisht Olympic Stadium. Knight carries the flag “I was thinking, ‘Why am I here, it's crazy’. I was so starstruck,” she says. She was too young to compete in all the ski events but came fifth in the slalom and the giant slalom. After the Games, Knight’s guide retired from the sport to go to university. Good guides are hard to come by, partly because of the expense. Unless they are at the top of their game, guides pay their own way. Others retire due to injury. Over the following season, Knight went through eight guides. None was quite right. Then in 2016, Knight’s development coach Euan Bennett, heard about a young Royal Navy skier who had represented Scotland at a junior level and thought he’d be worth a trial. Brett Wild had joined the Royal Navy when he was 19. He grew up in Scotland where his dad managed Glasgow Ski Centre and his mum was an instructor. They put Wild on the snow aged three and he competed for Scotland as a teenager. He travelled the world to training camps and competitions and almost went full time in his final year of school. Brett Wild Bennett told Wild that as a guide, he would need to ski a couple of metres ahead of Knight, but they wouldn't be tethered. They would communicate via Bluetooth headsets. He would need to be proficient in five disciplines - Downhill, Super-G, Giant Slalom, Slalom and Super Combined, which is made up of one downhill run and a slalom event. Wild was up for it and flew to Austria for a trial. Knight was less sure. She had been used to older guides who took control and made decisions. Wild was just 23 and had no idea what he was doing. But he took to it quickly and easily. Knight and Wild As they descend a slope, Wild is expected to describe the terrain from the start gate to the finish line. A “steep here”, a “flatter” there, as well as the snow conditions - “bumpy”, “icy”, “soft”. He will also instruct Knight to turn at every gate for the rhythmical changes. If she can’t catch sight of his orange jacket in front of her, she will let him know by saying “off”. “I was told her life is in my hands and that she’s my responsibility until she has her skis off,” says Wild. After a week’s training, Knight threw Wild into the deep end by asking him to guide for her at an international competition in Aspen, Colorado, US. The Navy agreed Wild could go but only if he returned immediately for a nine-month tour of duty. Waiting for him in Aspen was Knight’s sports psychologist Kelley Fay. She wanted to ensure that her young charge would be in good hands. “I could see his potential but he was just a boy. So I pulled him aside and had a stern conversation with him about what he needed to do,” she says. “He said I frightened the life out of him, but I wanted him to hit the ground running.” The pep talk worked. By the end of the competition, the pair had picked up seven medals including three golds. “It was hard to get my head around,” Wild says. “The week before I was pleased to win a bronze medal at the Inter-Service Championships. Then I had three gold World Cup medals to bring home.” PyeongChang beckoned and the Navy agreed to release Wild for two years, on a reduced salary, to take Knight to the Winter Games. But the crash a year later in South Korea changed everything for Knight. With just over 12 months to go, the blind skier was gripped with the fear of racing down a mountainside. Her Paralympic hopes hung in the balance. “Before my crash, I was confident because I had nothing to fear. But afterwards I was thinking, ‘Why am I doing this if it is going to cause me injuries?’” “My performance is 80% psychological and 20% talent because when you’re standing there and you have that second of doubt - that's when things start to go wrong.” Psychologist Fay says Knight was the most confident ski racer she had worked with. “She wasn’t cocky but had a lot of self belief in what she could achieve. She had no anxiety before the crashes. “After the first one we got her on her skis very quickly but the second one meant she was removed from that ski world. That made this particularly difficult to overcome,” she says. Kelly Fay with Knight and Wild Fay spent up to 90 minutes a day with Knight. Sometimes they would talk during a 10-minute ski-lift ride to redirect Knight's thoughts before the next run, or discuss her body language to make her look and feel more confident. “You could see she was willing to do whatever it took, but whenever she put her speed skis on it just freaked her out,” Fay says. “Even when we were doing a gentle slope, she’d be saying ‘I can't do this’. She was that frightened. “That was when we knew it was very serious.” As time ticked away, they needed a breakthrough. Kelly speaks to Knight and Wild Fay accompanied Knight to Chile to the ParaGB training camp, in the hope she could establish where Knight's fear came from and why both crashes happened in the finish area. They started with the basics - how to stop. “The guys are 100% committed all the way down for speed. But the last few gates are normally straight, so a lot of them switch off because it's just ‘go go go’,” says Fay. “We worked a lot to make sure she was staying fully engaged until they were stopped, but even that didn’t take the fear away.” Then Fay had another idea - they would return to the site of the crash and face Knight's fears head-on. The trio went back to the exact spot where the crash happened, where Knight's confidence had been shattered. “It was about reprogramming my brain into thinking differently about it,” Knight says. “Changing my emotions towards it.” Fay says: “It was getting her to accept that this is speed racing, so there's an element of risk involved. But if we did A, B and C that would minimise it.” Knight and Wild Wild, naturally, blamed himself for the crash and Knight’s subsequent loss of confidence. As her guide he was meant to be her eyes. “I think of Millie as a little sister and I feel very protective of her,” he says. “I felt useless that I couldn’t help. All I could do was stay positive when she was losing belief in herself. There were times when she was upset and I didn't know what to do. “I tried to stay positive, but it was out of my control. The problems were in Millie’s head.” Knight's crash and loss of confidence had set them and their training back and they needed to make up ground on the snow. Knight weight training The got stuck into training. They needed to work on their trust and relationship both on and off the slopes. Daily training would begin at 05:00. They practised relentlessly, eradicating any potential for error “When I'm skiing all I can hear is Brett and his skis,” says Knight. “I'm only aware of following Brett's commands, I totally zone in and that's all I’m focused on.” Learning how to fall, gracefully. However, I'm not best known for being graceful, especially when it comes to falling...😬 A post shared byMillie Knight(@knight_millie) onAug 5, 2017 at 10:04am PDT In January 2018 news came through that the pair had made the GB team for PyeongChang. But the physical and mental hurdle of returning to the slopes in competition remained. Had Knight's fears finally be conquered? The pair were to find out at a pre-Games competition in Canada. They were faultless. Three bronze medals out of four. But the top accolade went to Knight and Wild’s team-mates - Menna Fitzpatrick and guide Jennifer Kehoe - who won two golds and a silver. Their fight back to the top was not yet over. Menna Fitzpatrick and guide Jennifer Kehoe “Canada was good,” says Wild. “I don't think it's exactly where we wanted to be, but we're now back in the mix. We were about a second off the fastest girl so we are close enough. It’s just whether we can bring it all together on race day.” But Knight saw it as proof her fears had dissipated. “I think now I'm much stronger mentally. When I think about my crash I smile, I don't think of it and get worried any more.” Knight and Wild A gold medal hangs in the balance. But so does the partnership the pair has effortlessly formed. The two years that Wild was granted by the Navy is almost up. He’s still part of the armed forces ski team but isn’t sure whether he will be allowed to continue working with Knight on another Paralympic cycle. A gold medal might just swing it - and keep the pair together. “I wouldn't want to follow anyone else down a mountain,” Knight says. “It would be devastating if we couldn’t ski together again.” Built with Shorthand",Negative,0.041064344
"The military personnel are experts in chemical warfare and decontamination About 180 military personnel have been deployed to Salisbury to help in the investigation into the attempted murder of an ex-Russian spy and his daughter. The personnel - from the Army, Royal Marines and RAF - are experts in chemical warfare and decontamination. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition after being exposed to a nerve agent. Home Secretary Amber Rudd will chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee, Cobra, on Saturday. She has described Sunday's attack as ""outrageous"". Those deployed include instructors from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre and the 29 Explosive Ordnance Group, who are experts in bomb disposal. Eighteen vehicles have also been sent. Russian spy: What we know so far What are nerve agents? State TV anchor warns 'traitors' Members of the military were seen covering over a police car that has been at Salisbury Hospital since Sunday, before men dressed in white hazardous materials suits examined it. It was later towed away from the hospital, covered by a tarpaulin, on the back of an Army truck. Officers are also expected to secure Mr Skripal's car. The police car was towed away from the hospital on an Army truck Specialist officers have also put up a tent over the grave of Mr Skripal's son, who died last year, at Salisbury cemetery. The Metropolitan Police said the counter-terrorism unit has requested the military's assistance ""to remove a number of vehicles and objects from the scene"", including ambulances that may have been contaminated while assisting the victims. The public should not be alarmed and there is no evidence to suggest a wide public health risk at this time, the police added. The military personnel in Salisbury are mostly from the Army, but also from the Royal Marines and RAF Military personnel were pictured making preparations at Winterbourne Gunner, Wiltshire, before deployment to Salisbury Valery Morozov, a Russian exile, told BBC News that Mr Skripal was working in cyber security. The former Russian military security colonel and his daughter remain in a critical condition at Salisbury District Hospital. The graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off Det Sgt Nick Bailey - who attended the scene on Sunday -  is conscious but ""very anxious"" about being exposed to a nerve agent. Director of nursing Lorna Wilkinson said Mr Bailey was in a serious but stable condition. Specialist investigators wearing protective suits have been seen examining the bench that Mr Skripal and his daughter collapsed on. Mr Skripal's house and his car have also been cordoned off. Former Russian military security colonel Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday It is known that Mr Skripal and his daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found near the Maltings shopping centre. By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Some of the 180 military personnel who have been sent to help the investigation are specialists in chemical biological radiological and nuclear (CBRN) warfare. They include Falcon Squadron from the Royal Tank Regiment, which uses specialist Fuchs vehicles - effectively mobile laboratories - to carry out tests and decontamination. ""Sensitive Site Exploitation"" will look for any further traces of the nerve agent. Royal Marines from 40 Commando have also just completed the UK's biggest chemical warfare exercise -  called Toxic Dagger - involving 300 personnel and including scientists from Porton Down. The existence of these units - some of which had suffered under defence cuts - highlights a growing concern in the military about the use of chemical weapons by individuals, terrorist groups and ""rogue states"". But the public is being told not to be alarmed. Many of the military personnel will be working behind the scenes and helping the police with relatively straightforward tasks, such as securing sites and removing objects, including ambulances, for decontamination. Ms Rudd visited some of the sites cordoned off by counter-terrorism police in Salisbury on Friday.
