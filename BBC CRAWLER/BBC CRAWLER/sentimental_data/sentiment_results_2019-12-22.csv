"The small community of Balmoral is 120km (75 miles) from Sydney The leader of New South Wales, Gladys Berejiklian, says ""catastrophic"" fire conditions have almost completely razed one Australian community. She said there was ""not much left"" of the town of Balmoral, south-west of Sydney, where about 400 people live. Firefighters are struggling to contain bushfires burning across several states amid dry and hot conditions. One Balmoral resident, Steve Harrison, shared his dramatic story of surviving the destructive blaze. ""I ran to my [vehicle] but my garden was already on fire here, and the driveway was on fire and the road was on fire, so I realised I couldn't evacuate,"" the 67-year-old artist told ABC. ""So the day before I had actually built myself a small kiln down the back. A coffin-sized kiln, just big enough for me to crawl inside. I hid in there for half an hour while the fire storm went over."" How climate change has contributed to bushfires Australia's long and dangerous summer ahead How do you fight extreme wildfires? Since September, Australia's bushfire emergency has killed at least nine people, destroyed hundreds of homes and scorched millions of hectares of land. On Sunday Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison apologised for causing ""great anxiety"" by going on holiday during the mounting crisis. A number of small towns have reportedly sustained significant damage this weekend. Balmoral was hit, for the second time in days, as wind conditions changed around the Green Wattle Creek fire on Saturday. This video can not be played The BBC's Shaimaa Khalil says ""the destruction is absolute"" in Balmoral Residents are currently not allowed to return to the town, amid safety concerns, and an unknown number of homes have been destroyed. ""We want people to have access to their land, to their property, as soon as they can. But it has to be safe,"" Ms Berejiklian said. ""Even if people have lost their properties, they still want to go back to see what's left and if there is anything they can salvage."" No fatalities were reported in the town, but several firefighters were reportedly injured when fighting the blaze. Elsewhere, at least 86 homes have now been destroyed in the Adelaide Hills area of South Australia - where a 69-year-old man was found dead at his property on Saturday. As of Sunday night there were still 98 fires burning in New South Wales, including 50 yet to be contained. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Harry Dunn's father has met the home secretary, as her department considers requesting the extradition of a US woman charged over his death. Priti Patel visited the Dunn family lawyer's home in Northamptonshire. The meeting comes after suspect Anne Sacoolaswas charged by the Crown Prosecution Service. The family said they were ""incredibly reassured"" to meet Ms Patel, who was accompanied by their local MP Andrea Leadsom. Priti Patel and Andrea Leadsom met the Dunn family at the home of the family's lawyer in the village of Charlton The home secretary said she had met the family to explain the extradition process to them and spoken to Mr Dunn's father, Tim Dunn. She said: ""It was a nice opportunity to hear from them, obviously about what they have been experiencing, what they have been going through, and to reassure them at what has been a very difficult and traumatic time for them."" Family spokesman Radd Seiger said they were now ""incredibly reassured this whole saga will be dealt with under the rule of law"". ""You hear from some of the most senior politicians in this country... they are going to go to bed tonight feeling reassured."" Harry's father Tim Dunn thanked the home secretary for the meeting Mr Dunn said it had been a ""positive meeting"" and a ""great way to end the year"", but Christmas would be difficult without his son. He said: ""He loved Christmas... people have one Christmas jumper, Harry would have four... every day he would be wearing one."" Friends of Harry Dunn put up a Christmas tree and decorations around his banner outside RAF Croughton on Sunday Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, did not attend the meeting. Mr Dunn, 19, died in August after his motorbike was in collision with a car driven by Mrs Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, where her husband worked as an intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas left for the US under diplomatic immunity, but on Friday was charged with causing death by dangerous driving, following a campaign by Mr Dunn's family. The home secretary hugged Mr Dunn during the meeting Mrs Leadsom said there was a ""clear process"" of extradition. She added: ""There's a clear extradition treaty and it is absolutely vital that we get justice for Harry."" This video can not be played ""A huge step"": Harry's mother reacts to the charge Mr Dunn's mother had said the family was ""relieved"" the 42-year-old suspect had finally been charged. But US officials said it was not ""a helpful development"" and Mrs Sacoolas' lawyer said she would not return to the UK ""to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident"". After it confirmed Mrs Sacoolas had been charged, the CPS said extradition proceedings had started, noting that the ""Home Office is responsible for considering our request and deciding whether to formally issue this through US diplomatic channels"". ""Our specialist extradition team will be working closely with the UK Central Authority at the Home Office to do this,"" it added. The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. A statement from Amy Jeffress, Mrs Sacoolas's lawyer, said she had ""co-operated fully with the investigation and accepted responsibility"". It added: ""This was an accident, and a criminal prosecution with a potential penalty of 14 years' imprisonment is simply not a proportionate response. ""We have been in contact with the UK authorities about ways in which Anne could assist with preventing accidents like this from happening in the future, as well as her desire to honour Harry's memory. ""We will continue that dialogue in an effort to move forward from this terrible tragedy.""

"Ungaro (pictured in 1999) was known for his bold colours and prints French fashion designer Emanuel Ungaro has died in Paris aged 86. Ungaro was the son of Italian immigrants who trained under Spanish designer Cristobal Balenciaga. He founded his fashion house in the 1960s and described himself as a ""sensual obsessive"" - with a reputation for bold colours and prints. He retired and sold the brand in 2005. He went on to criticise the fashion house when US actress Lindsay Lohan was briefly hired as an artistic director. Ungaro was born in Aix-en-Province in the south of France in 1933. He first learned tailoring by working under his father and moved to Paris in his early 20s to launch a career in fashion. His time training with Balenciaga taught him ""rigor and perfectionism"", according to his former brand's website. ""Season after season, Emanuel Ungaro dared to be different, combining unexpected yet sensual clashes of bright colours and prints with beautiful draping,"" the House of Emanuel Ungaro website says. His ready-to-wear looks were popular among consumers in the 1980s Ungaro's work included haute couture designs as well as clothes for the ready-to-wear market. ""One should not wear a dress, one should live in it,"" he once said, according to the AFP news agency. The label was at the height of its popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. Ungaro sold the label to Silicon Valley businessman Asim Abdullah in 2005. After his departure, the brand gained a reputation for a high turnover of creative staff - most notably Ms Lohan. Emanuel Ungaro seen at his Autumn-Winter show in 2002-2003 The collections the actress worked on were widely panned by fashion critics, and Ungaro himself, as a ""disaster"". The designer was quoted at the time as saying he was ""furious"" with the move and said his former fashion house was ""in the process of losing its soul"". Today it continues to produce women's fashion, as well as other products including perfumes and luxury furniture. Ungaro was married and had a daughter, but in recent years stayed out of the spotlight. He had spent the last two years of his life in a ""weakened"" state of health, a family member told AFP.

"January 2010. Barack Obama was one year into his US presidency, Instagram hadn't been invented and the word Brexit had never been uttered. A decade on, we look back at the most read stories on the BBC News website year by year. Miner Juan Illanes celebrates after coming out of the Phoenix capsule Being trapped underground in darkness, with hardly any food or water, is ""the stuff of nightmares"", says BBC Latin America online editor Vanessa Buschschluter, who reported from the San Jose mine in northern Chile after 33 miners became trapped deep underground. It was the nightmarish quality of the miners' situation, she says, that moved not only Chileans, but people around the world. For 17 days the collapse of a Chilean copper and gold mine was not widely covered outside the country. That was until the miners tied a note to a probe sent deep beneath the ground saying they were alive. And with that, ""people were hooked"", says Ms Buschschluter. Rescuers drilled down as the miners' desperate families watched on, keeping vigil from what became known as Camp Hope. ""When one of the drills finally reached the miners,the camp's bell rang out and relatives hugged and jumped for joy, some fell on their knees praying,"" Ms Buschschluter adds. The 33 miners were brought to the surface one by one in a specially-designed capsule via a tunnel just wider than the men's shoulders. Winching them to safety took 22 hours. People sang the national anthem and waved Chilean flags, as champagne corks popped. It was the stuff of movies - and sure enough their ordeal made it on to the big screen in a Hollywood film starring Antonio Banderas. A story with a happy ending? Not quite. Many of the miners, who were trapped underground for a record 69 days, struggled to cope with their newfound fame, and some faced health and financial difficulties in the years after. A 150-year-old furniture store in Croydon is sent up in flames It was the worst case of civil unrest in the UK for a generation. The police shooting of 29-year-old Mark Duggan in Tottenham, north London, prompted a protest that turned violent. Over four hot August nights, looters ran free and armed rioters set fire to two police cars, then a bus, and shops. Theunrest spreadjust like the flames - first across London, to Hackney, then Lewisham, Peckham, Woolwich, Ealing and Clapham - before erupting in other major cities including Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham, Wolverhampton and Liverpool. The Met Police officers later said they had beenoutnumberedand were afraid to take on rioters, some of whom were carrying machetes. Five people died and more than 3,000 were arrested. In the year that followed, 1,400 of them were jailed and handed much tougher sentences than magistrates would usually give for such offences. Research by sociologist Juta Kawalerowicz found deprivation and tensions between communities and police were main factors behind the riots. The issue of police stop and search powers being used to target black people came up in the University of Oxford research. But Ms Kawalerowicz said they were not ""race riots"", and rioters did not come from one ethnic group. Michelle and Barack Obama hug in one of the most re-tweeted posts in social media history The race was expected to be tight. But on election night, America's first black president stormed to another victory, securing a second term. Barack Obama's re-election was particularly important, says our senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher, because it proved US voters ""were comfortable enough with a black man as president to want to keep him in the White House"". Mr Obama, a Democrat, had run a largely solid, professional campaign, painting his Republican opponent - Mitt Romney - as an elite, corporate executive who was out of touch with mainstream American voters, says our reporter. In his first term, Mr Obama, who took office amid one of the worst recessions in decades, had overhauled the US healthcare system and overcome strong Republican opposition to pass a programme designed to boost the economy. And in his first speech after re-election, Mr Obama told America: ""The best is yet to come."" He would go on to strike a climate change agreement in Paris, negotiate a deal to curb Iran's nuclear potential and restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. ButMr Obama's second termwas also punctuated by frustration, notably problems with his healthcare system and his failure to push through gun control legislation. ""Of course, four years later, Democrat Hillary Clinton was unable to rebuild Obama's winning coalition of young, minority and working class Americans,"" says Mr Zurcher. This video can not be played The moment of the first explosion A jubilant scene at the finish line of the 2013 Boston marathon turned into a horrific one when two pressure cooker bombs packed with nails, ball bearings and other shrapnel exploded. Three spectators - including an eight-year-old boy - were killed, while 260 others suffered injuries, with many losing legs. The US has had its share of terror attacks, but this one ""transcended tragedy to become an ongoing national drama"", says Mr Zurcher. The search for the perpetrators shut down Boston for days. ""It was a manhunt that played itself out on both traditional news outlets and social media, as Americans across the country watched every twist and turn with fear and fascination - the false alarms, dead-end leads and dramatic confrontations,"" he says. Three days after the bombing, the FBI released CCTV images of the suspects, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Then a police officer responding to reports of a disturbance near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus was found with fatal gunshot wounds. The brothers hijacked a car at gunpoint, and were chased by police, throwing explosives at them, before their car crashed. The elder brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a gunfight that followed, but Dzhokhar fled on foot. The wounded 19-year-old was found hours later hiding in a boat in a local resident's backyard. At a trial, his defence team argued his older brother was the driving force, but prosecutors said Dzhokhar was an equal partner. He was found guilty of 30 charges and sentenced to death. Earlier this month, lawyers for Dzhokhar - who is currently in a high security prison - appealed against his death sentence, alleging jurors at his trial were biased. Peaches Geldof had started using heroin again before her death, an inquest heard Peaches Geldof's death from a heroin overdose at just 25 shocked us all, says BBC senior entertainment reporter Mark Savage. ""Initial reports from the ambulance service called the tragedy 'unexplained and sudden' - immediately and eerily reminding us of the shocking death of Peaches' mother, Paula Yates,"" he adds. Geldof was just 11 when her mother died from a heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41. The model and TV presenter - the second daughter of musician Bob Geldof - was a favourite of paparazzi photographers from a young age, often pictured leaving London parties in the early hours. But later in life, she moved to the countryside with her second husband musician Tom Cohen and her two young sons, posting frequently about her family on social media. She told Mother and Baby magazine a month before her death that ""becoming a mother was like becoming me, finally"". After Geldof died, messages of condolence poured into the BBC from readers.. Aninquestheard she had been addicted to heroin and had been taking the substitute drug methadone for two-and-a-half years. Her husband told the inquest Geldof had started using heroin again before her death. Detectives investigated who had given Geldof the heroin, but closed the case a year later with no answers. Gunmen stormed the Bataclan concert hall, firing at the crowds inside Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson still remembers the sound of bullets ricocheting off the old facades of buildings in the city's 11th arrondissement on the night attackers killed130 peopleand injured hundreds more. Almost simultaneously, gunmen and suicide bombers attacked the Bataclan concert hall, the Stade de France stadium, as well as Parisian restaurants and bars. It came in the middle of a string of attacks in France - 10 months after attacks onthe offices of Charlie Hebdo magazineand nine months beforethe Nice lorry attack. The suspected ringleader of the Paris killings was Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian national who was killed in a police raid in northern Paris five days later. After months on the run, the sole surviving attacker, Salah Abdeslam, was shot and injured in a dramatic arrest in Brussels. He was later sentenced to 20 years in prison. ""For almost two years, it felt as if France was being bludgeoned again and again,"" says Ms Williamson. But she says there was ""something different"" about the Paris attacks that means four years later ""the impact lives on just below the surface"". ""In the midst of attacks on satirical journalists, police officers, the Jewish community, priests, and symbols of the state, this time the hatred expanded to cover everyone - people at a concert, in restaurants, at a football game,"" she says. ""The target was simply France's joy in its own way of life."" Nigel Farage reacts to the 2016 referendum result at a party in central London on 24 June 2016 BBC News' live coverage of the UK's 2016 EU referendumwas, and still is, the site's most read page ever - by some distance. It was to be the biggest decision ""in our lifetimes"", according to then prime minister, David Cameron, who urged the country to vote to stay in the EU. The campaign that followed saw a ""blizzard of claims, some of them of dubious provenance"", says the BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris. Across the side of a Vote Leave bus was the message: ""We send the EU Â£350m a week, let's fund the NHS instead."" Mr Cameron and the Remainers were ultimately defeated by 52% to 48% - despite London, Scotland and Northern Ireland backing Remain. Boris Johnson, the public face of Vote Leave, said voters had ""searched in their hearts"" and the UK now had a ""glorious opportunity"" to pass its own laws, set its own taxes and control its own borders. UKIP leader Nigel Farage hailed it the UK's ""independence day"". A day later, Mr Cameron quit. Our correspondent says the referendum ""created the current divide in British politics - a divide the latest election hasn't really resolved"". ""We now know Brexit will happen,"" says Mr Morris. ""But many of the bitter arguments surrounding it aren't going to go away."" This video can not be played Reaction from Bristol: 'You're joking. Why does she need to do it?' ""Not another one,"" was the cry from Brenda from Bristol, after Theresa May announced her intention to call a snap election. Coming after the EU referendum and the 2015 general election, people were tired of politics. ""In just three words, Brenda summed up the thoughts of so many millions of voters,"" says BBC presenter Jon Kay, who interviewed her. ""With her lovely Bristolian accent and her old shopping trolley, we knew immediately that we had struck TV gold."" Mrs May said the election was needed for ""certainty, stability and strong leadership"" after the EU referendum - although, as we now know, she ended up losing her majority and having to rely on the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government. The BBC's live coverage of the results was the most read page of the year. In its first months, the government got its legislation through Parliament quite comfortably, but as Mrs May found to her cost, political deadlock was about to set in. As for Brenda, Mr Kay still checks in with her from time to time. ""She's doing fine but doesn't want any more fuss. She laughs about how mad the world is,"" he says. Brenda doesn't own a laptop or a mobile phone. So when Mr Kay told her that her catchphrase had gone viral again after the 2019 election was called, she laughed and replied: ""That doesn't sound very pleasant."" For a brief spell in November 2018, it looked as though the UK was headed for an orderly Brexit. But it didn't last long. After years of negotiations, Theresa Mayfinally struck a deal with EU leaders, setting out the terms on which the UK would leave the EU. Mrs May said her cabinet had backed the deal, calling it ""the best that could have been negotiated"". But she soon faced a revolt. Dominic Raab, then Brexit minister, led a wave of resignations, saying he could not ""in good conscience"" support the deal. In the following months, Mrs May faced votes of no confidence in her leadership, but she clung on. However, after MPs rejected a version of her Brexit agreement for a third time,she stepped down, telling the country she deeply regretted being unable to deliver Brexit. Boris Johnson outside his polling station with his dog, Dilyn ""Everything changed"" on the stroke of 22:00 GMT on 12 December, says BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake. As the BBC's Huw Edwards declared the exit poll at the end of a cold and wet December polling day, the Conservatives were about to secure a Commons majority of 80, the party's largest since 1987. ""A campaign focussed relentlessly on the seemingly simple promise to 'get Brexit done' had won over voters in places long-seen as out of reach for the Conservatives,"" says Mr Blake. The Labour Party had its worst election result since 1935, while the SNP made big gains across Scotland.  In Northern Ireland, more nationalists than unionists won seats, putting the union further ""under strain"", says Mr Blake. ""But in Downing Street Mr Johnson's grip on power was stronger, his support-base wider and he now had a freer hand to do, within reason, what he wanted,"" he continued. ""The election result has set the course firmly for the UK's departure from the European Union, left Labour in ruins and all but silenced the arguments for another referendum."" Knife-edge votes and backroom deals between parties have defined the politics of the past decade. But after the Tory's resounding victory, the tone of the next 10 years could be entirely different.

"Ungaro (pictured in 1999) was known for his bold colours and prints French fashion designer Emanuel Ungaro has died in Paris aged 86. Ungaro was the son of Italian immigrants who trained under Spanish designer Cristobal Balenciaga. He founded his fashion house in the 1960s and described himself as a ""sensual obsessive"" - with a reputation for bold colours and prints. He retired and sold the brand in 2005. He went on to criticise the fashion house when US actress Lindsay Lohan was briefly hired as an artistic director. Ungaro was born in Aix-en-Province in the south of France in 1933. He first learned tailoring by working under his father and moved to Paris in his early 20s to launch a career in fashion. His time training with Balenciaga taught him ""rigor and perfectionism"", according to his former brand's website. ""Season after season, Emanuel Ungaro dared to be different, combining unexpected yet sensual clashes of bright colours and prints with beautiful draping,"" the House of Emanuel Ungaro website says. His ready-to-wear looks were popular among consumers in the 1980s Ungaro's work included haute couture designs as well as clothes for the ready-to-wear market. ""One should not wear a dress, one should live in it,"" he once said, according to the AFP news agency. The label was at the height of its popularity in the 1980s and 1990s. Ungaro sold the label to Silicon Valley businessman Asim Abdullah in 2005. After his departure, the brand gained a reputation for a high turnover of creative staff - most notably Ms Lohan. Emanuel Ungaro seen at his Autumn-Winter show in 2002-2003 The collections the actress worked on were widely panned by fashion critics, and Ungaro himself, as a ""disaster"". The designer was quoted at the time as saying he was ""furious"" with the move and said his former fashion house was ""in the process of losing its soul"". Today it continues to produce women's fashion, as well as other products including perfumes and luxury furniture. Ungaro was married and had a daughter, but in recent years stayed out of the spotlight. He had spent the last two years of his life in a ""weakened"" state of health, a family member told AFP.

"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Harry Dunn's father has met the home secretary, as her department considers requesting the extradition of a US woman charged over his death. Priti Patel visited the Dunn family lawyer's home in Northamptonshire. The meeting comes after suspect Anne Sacoolaswas charged by the Crown Prosecution Service. The family said they were ""incredibly reassured"" to meet Ms Patel, who was accompanied by their local MP Andrea Leadsom. Priti Patel and Andrea Leadsom met the Dunn family at the home of the family's lawyer in the village of Charlton The home secretary said she had met the family to explain the extradition process to them and spoken to Mr Dunn's father, Tim Dunn. She said: ""It was a nice opportunity to hear from them, obviously about what they have been experiencing, what they have been going through, and to reassure them at what has been a very difficult and traumatic time for them."" Family spokesman Radd Seiger said they were now ""incredibly reassured this whole saga will be dealt with under the rule of law"". ""You hear from some of the most senior politicians in this country... they are going to go to bed tonight feeling reassured."" Harry's father Tim Dunn thanked the home secretary for the meeting Mr Dunn said it had been a ""positive meeting"" and a ""great way to end the year"", but Christmas would be difficult without his son. He said: ""He loved Christmas... people have one Christmas jumper, Harry would have four... every day he would be wearing one."" Friends of Harry Dunn put up a Christmas tree and decorations around his banner outside RAF Croughton on Sunday Mr Dunn's mother, Charlotte Charles, did not attend the meeting. Mr Dunn, 19, died in August after his motorbike was in collision with a car driven by Mrs Sacoolas outside RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, where her husband worked as an intelligence officer. Mrs Sacoolas left for the US under diplomatic immunity, but on Friday was charged with causing death by dangerous driving, following a campaign by Mr Dunn's family. The home secretary hugged Mr Dunn during the meeting Mrs Leadsom said there was a ""clear process"" of extradition. She added: ""There's a clear extradition treaty and it is absolutely vital that we get justice for Harry."" This video can not be played ""A huge step"": Harry's mother reacts to the charge Mr Dunn's mother had said the family was ""relieved"" the 42-year-old suspect had finally been charged. But US officials said it was not ""a helpful development"" and Mrs Sacoolas' lawyer said she would not return to the UK ""to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident"". After it confirmed Mrs Sacoolas had been charged, the CPS said extradition proceedings had started, noting that the ""Home Office is responsible for considering our request and deciding whether to formally issue this through US diplomatic channels"". ""Our specialist extradition team will be working closely with the UK Central Authority at the Home Office to do this,"" it added. The extradition request is sent via the British Embassy to the US State Department. A lawyer will then decide whether it falls under the dual-criminality treaty, where the alleged offence is a crime in both countries and carries a prison sentence of at least a year. The maximum sentence for causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years' imprisonment, although this is usually reserved for the most serious cases. The US may reject the request for extradition, arguing that Mrs Sacoolas is still entitled to diplomatic immunity. A statement from Amy Jeffress, Mrs Sacoolas's lawyer, said she had ""co-operated fully with the investigation and accepted responsibility"". It added: ""This was an accident, and a criminal prosecution with a potential penalty of 14 years' imprisonment is simply not a proportionate response. ""We have been in contact with the UK authorities about ways in which Anne could assist with preventing accidents like this from happening in the future, as well as her desire to honour Harry's memory. ""We will continue that dialogue in an effort to move forward from this terrible tragedy.""

"Youth workers in Cardiff said that the clubs helped give teenagers a ""safe place"" to stop being drawn into gangs and carrying knives Teenagers could be left vulnerable to drugs and crime if more youth clubs close in Wales, sector workers fear. BBC figures show 163 youth clubs have been closed by councils in the last five years. One voluntary sector club in Caerphilly said it was ""begging for cash"" to keep teenagers off the streets. The body which represents councils said youth work was ""vital"" and authorities had been forced to make tough decisions due to financial challenges. Children's commissioner Sally Holland said teenagers were ""frustrated"" at cuts in communities where drug dealing and knife crime were on the rise. Youth clubs 'key to tackling gang rise' Reality check: Have youth service cuts led to more crime? Councils, charities and voluntary sector organisations run youth services in Wales, which includes work to tackle homelessness and running youth clubs. But in recent years local authorities have made cuts and reorganised services, with 163 council-run clubs closing since 2014. The figures, revealed under the Freedom of Information Act, also show the number of council-employed youth workers fell dramatically in the period, with the largest cuts felt in Bridgend, Rhondda and Gwynedd. A number of voluntary sector groups said they were constantly asking for cash, with some on the brink of closure due to funding issues. In the last nine years the number of front-line youth workers employed by councils more than halved, from 2,434 in 2010-11 to 1,097 in 2018-19. The youth club closures come as councils in Wales have faced making millions in cuts in a bid to balance their budgets. The north felt the worst of the cuts. In 2018, Gwynedd council shut all 39 of its youth clubs and replaced it with onecounty-wide roving service in a bid to save Â£270,000. Conwy closed 15, Wrexham 14 and Flintshire 11, while Anglesey has closed 10, some of which the authority says were shut due to lack of use. Rhondda was the only area to increase the number of youth clubs, after a reorganisation saw all 20 existing clubs shut with 21 opened in different locations. All but one council slashed the number of youth workers it employed - with areas including Bridgend cutting its front-line workforce to less than half that in 2014. This video can not be played Young people at the Sydic youth club talked about the group being one big family. When Senghenydd youth club (SYDIC), in Caerphilly, opened in 1997 the area had issues with anti-social behaviour and vandalism. Dave Brenton, who runs the not-for-profit club, said giving young people a non-judgemental safe place to socialise had helped. The club puts on activities and helps some of the children with issues including mental health problems and drug addiction. Rising knife crime linked to council cuts, study suggests While the club gets funding from charities, Mr Brenton said they were ""always begging for cash"" and the situation was now dire. ""We are not seen as a thing that is vital, but to these guys we are, we are a place where they can be themselves and voice their opinions,"" he said. Esme-Jade Davies now volunteers at the club and worries if it was not here young people would be out on the streets ""There aren't many things for kids to do here,"" says Esme-Jade Davies, 17, who started volunteering at the club after being a member for years. ""This club means a lot to me because it's like a family. It keeps us out of trouble, and keeps us off the streets."" The children in Dyffryn Ardudwy enjoyed a Christmas party after the parents rallied together to restart the youth club In Dyffryn Ardudwy, in Gwynedd, parents fundraised to reopen and run their youth club in a small village after the council closed all the groups. The club is now going strong and has joined forces with the local youth football team, also set up by the community, which is struggling to get funding. Maisy, 12, said the club was great, adding: ""We are not getting into trouble, which is what people do if there is nothing to do."" In June the Welsh Government more thandoubled cash available for youth work servicesfor 2019-20, to more than Â£10m. The cash, given to councils via the youth support grant, has to be used in partnership with the voluntary sector. But a large chunk of it is for projects to prevent homelessness and mental health issues. Caroline Ryan, of YMCA Cardiff, said more cash was needed to give young people a safe place to avoid exploitation and crime. Set up in 2012 the drop-in runs activities and helps young people avoid getting involved in ""County Lines"" gangs. ""With local authority clubs closing there is more risk of them getting involved in gangs and knife crime, but if they are engaging in youth clubs they are not going to be going out to take part in criminal activities,"" she said. Next April councils are set to get a 4.3% increase in funding as part of the Welsh Government budget - the first significant increase in 12 years. Sally Holland says that youth services are a ""first line of defence"" against serious issues like knife crime and drugs Dr Holland said youth services are vital as a first line of defence against serious problems like knife crime and drugs and needed investment. ""It's really important that we recognise that spending on youth work can save money in the long term by helping to keep young people happy, healthy and safe,"" she said. But the Welsh Local Government Association said the financial outlook for councils remained challenging and tough decisions would still need to be made. ""It would be a matter for individual local authorities to decide how services are provided and funded, using local discretion in line with local circumstances and budgets,"" he said.

"January 2010. Barack Obama was one year into his US presidency, Instagram hadn't been invented and the word Brexit had never been uttered. A decade on, we look back at the most read stories on the BBC News website year by year. Miner Juan Illanes celebrates after coming out of the Phoenix capsule Being trapped underground in darkness, with hardly any food or water, is ""the stuff of nightmares"", says BBC Latin America online editor Vanessa Buschschluter, who reported from the San Jose mine in northern Chile after 33 miners became trapped deep underground. It was the nightmarish quality of the miners' situation, she says, that moved not only Chileans, but people around the world. For 17 days the collapse of a Chilean copper and gold mine was not widely covered outside the country. That was until the miners tied a note to a probe sent deep beneath the ground saying they were alive. And with that, ""people were hooked"", says Ms Buschschluter. Rescuers drilled down as the miners' desperate families watched on, keeping vigil from what became known as Camp Hope. ""When one of the drills finally reached the miners,the camp's bell rang out and relatives hugged and jumped for joy, some fell on their knees praying,"" Ms Buschschluter adds. The 33 miners were brought to the surface one by one in a specially-designed capsule via a tunnel just wider than the men's shoulders. Winching them to safety took 22 hours. People sang the national anthem and waved Chilean flags, as champagne corks popped. It was the stuff of movies - and sure enough their ordeal made it on to the big screen in a Hollywood film starring Antonio Banderas. A story with a happy ending? Not quite. Many of the miners, who were trapped underground for a record 69 days, struggled to cope with their newfound fame, and some faced health and financial difficulties in the years after. A 150-year-old furniture store in Croydon is sent up in flames It was the worst case of civil unrest in the UK for a generation. The police shooting of 29-year-old Mark Duggan in Tottenham, north London, prompted a protest that turned violent. Over four hot August nights, looters ran free and armed rioters set fire to two police cars, then a bus, and shops. Theunrest spreadjust like the flames - first across London, to Hackney, then Lewisham, Peckham, Woolwich, Ealing and Clapham - before erupting in other major cities including Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham, Wolverhampton and Liverpool. The Met Police officers later said they had beenoutnumberedand were afraid to take on rioters, some of whom were carrying machetes. Five people died and more than 3,000 were arrested. In the year that followed, 1,400 of them were jailed and handed much tougher sentences than magistrates would usually give for such offences. Research by sociologist Juta Kawalerowicz found deprivation and tensions between communities and police were main factors behind the riots. The issue of police stop and search powers being used to target black people came up in the University of Oxford research. But Ms Kawalerowicz said they were not ""race riots"", and rioters did not come from one ethnic group. Michelle and Barack Obama hug in one of the most re-tweeted posts in social media history The race was expected to be tight. But on election night, America's first black president stormed to another victory, securing a second term. Barack Obama's re-election was particularly important, says our senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher, because it proved US voters ""were comfortable enough with a black man as president to want to keep him in the White House"". Mr Obama, a Democrat, had run a largely solid, professional campaign, painting his Republican opponent - Mitt Romney - as an elite, corporate executive who was out of touch with mainstream American voters, says our reporter. In his first term, Mr Obama, who took office amid one of the worst recessions in decades, had overhauled the US healthcare system and overcome strong Republican opposition to pass a programme designed to boost the economy. And in his first speech after re-election, Mr Obama told America: ""The best is yet to come."" He would go on to strike a climate change agreement in Paris, negotiate a deal to curb Iran's nuclear potential and restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. ButMr Obama's second termwas also punctuated by frustration, notably problems with his healthcare system and his failure to push through gun control legislation. ""Of course, four years later, Democrat Hillary Clinton was unable to rebuild Obama's winning coalition of young, minority and working class Americans,"" says Mr Zurcher. This video can not be played The moment of the first explosion A jubilant scene at the finish line of the 2013 Boston marathon turned into a horrific one when two pressure cooker bombs packed with nails, ball bearings and other shrapnel exploded. Three spectators - including an eight-year-old boy - were killed, while 260 others suffered injuries, with many losing legs. The US has had its share of terror attacks, but this one ""transcended tragedy to become an ongoing national drama"", says Mr Zurcher. The search for the perpetrators shut down Boston for days. ""It was a manhunt that played itself out on both traditional news outlets and social media, as Americans across the country watched every twist and turn with fear and fascination - the false alarms, dead-end leads and dramatic confrontations,"" he says. Three days after the bombing, the FBI released CCTV images of the suspects, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Then a police officer responding to reports of a disturbance near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus was found with fatal gunshot wounds. The brothers hijacked a car at gunpoint, and were chased by police, throwing explosives at them, before their car crashed. The elder brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a gunfight that followed, but Dzhokhar fled on foot. The wounded 19-year-old was found hours later hiding in a boat in a local resident's backyard. At a trial, his defence team argued his older brother was the driving force, but prosecutors said Dzhokhar was an equal partner. He was found guilty of 30 charges and sentenced to death. Earlier this month, lawyers for Dzhokhar - who is currently in a high security prison - appealed against his death sentence, alleging jurors at his trial were biased. Peaches Geldof had started using heroin again before her death, an inquest heard Peaches Geldof's death from a heroin overdose at just 25 shocked us all, says BBC senior entertainment reporter Mark Savage. ""Initial reports from the ambulance service called the tragedy 'unexplained and sudden' - immediately and eerily reminding us of the shocking death of Peaches' mother, Paula Yates,"" he adds. Geldof was just 11 when her mother died from a heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41. The model and TV presenter - the second daughter of musician Bob Geldof - was a favourite of paparazzi photographers from a young age, often pictured leaving London parties in the early hours. But later in life, she moved to the countryside with her second husband musician Tom Cohen and her two young sons, posting frequently about her family on social media. She told Mother and Baby magazine a month before her death that ""becoming a mother was like becoming me, finally"". After Geldof died, messages of condolence poured into the BBC from readers.. Aninquestheard she had been addicted to heroin and had been taking the substitute drug methadone for two-and-a-half years. Her husband told the inquest Geldof had started using heroin again before her death. Detectives investigated who had given Geldof the heroin, but closed the case a year later with no answers. Gunmen stormed the Bataclan concert hall, firing at the crowds inside Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson still remembers the sound of bullets ricocheting off the old facades of buildings in the city's 11th arrondissement on the night attackers killed130 peopleand injured hundreds more. Almost simultaneously, gunmen and suicide bombers attacked the Bataclan concert hall, the Stade de France stadium, as well as Parisian restaurants and bars. It came in the middle of a string of attacks in France - 10 months after attacks onthe offices of Charlie Hebdo magazineand nine months beforethe Nice lorry attack. The suspected ringleader of the Paris killings was Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian national who was killed in a police raid in northern Paris five days later. After months on the run, the sole surviving attacker, Salah Abdeslam, was shot and injured in a dramatic arrest in Brussels. He was later sentenced to 20 years in prison. ""For almost two years, it felt as if France was being bludgeoned again and again,"" says Ms Williamson. But she says there was ""something different"" about the Paris attacks that means four years later ""the impact lives on just below the surface"". ""In the midst of attacks on satirical journalists, police officers, the Jewish community, priests, and symbols of the state, this time the hatred expanded to cover everyone - people at a concert, in restaurants, at a football game,"" she says. ""The target was simply France's joy in its own way of life."" Nigel Farage reacts to the 2016 referendum result at a party in central London on 24 June 2016 BBC News' live coverage of the UK's 2016 EU referendumwas, and still is, the site's most read page ever - by some distance. It was to be the biggest decision ""in our lifetimes"", according to then prime minister, David Cameron, who urged the country to vote to stay in the EU. The campaign that followed saw a ""blizzard of claims, some of them of dubious provenance"", says the BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris. Across the side of a Vote Leave bus was the message: ""We send the EU Â£350m a week, let's fund the NHS instead."" Mr Cameron and the Remainers were ultimately defeated by 52% to 48% - despite London, Scotland and Northern Ireland backing Remain. Boris Johnson, the public face of Vote Leave, said voters had ""searched in their hearts"" and the UK now had a ""glorious opportunity"" to pass its own laws, set its own taxes and control its own borders. UKIP leader Nigel Farage hailed it the UK's ""independence day"". A day later, Mr Cameron quit. Our correspondent says the referendum ""created the current divide in British politics - a divide the latest election hasn't really resolved"". ""We now know Brexit will happen,"" says Mr Morris. ""But many of the bitter arguments surrounding it aren't going to go away."" This video can not be played Reaction from Bristol: 'You're joking. Why does she need to do it?' ""Not another one,"" was the cry from Brenda from Bristol, after Theresa May announced her intention to call a snap election. Coming after the EU referendum and the 2015 general election, people were tired of politics. ""In just three words, Brenda summed up the thoughts of so many millions of voters,"" says BBC presenter Jon Kay, who interviewed her. ""With her lovely Bristolian accent and her old shopping trolley, we knew immediately that we had struck TV gold."" Mrs May said the election was needed for ""certainty, stability and strong leadership"" after the EU referendum - although, as we now know, she ended up losing her majority and having to rely on the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government. The BBC's live coverage of the results was the most read page of the year. In its first months, the government got its legislation through Parliament quite comfortably, but as Mrs May found to her cost, political deadlock was about to set in. As for Brenda, Mr Kay still checks in with her from time to time. ""She's doing fine but doesn't want any more fuss. She laughs about how mad the world is,"" he says. Brenda doesn't own a laptop or a mobile phone. So when Mr Kay told her that her catchphrase had gone viral again after the 2019 election was called, she laughed and replied: ""That doesn't sound very pleasant."" For a brief spell in November 2018, it looked as though the UK was headed for an orderly Brexit. But it didn't last long. After years of negotiations, Theresa Mayfinally struck a deal with EU leaders, setting out the terms on which the UK would leave the EU. Mrs May said her cabinet had backed the deal, calling it ""the best that could have been negotiated"". But she soon faced a revolt. Dominic Raab, then Brexit minister, led a wave of resignations, saying he could not ""in good conscience"" support the deal. In the following months, Mrs May faced votes of no confidence in her leadership, but she clung on. However, after MPs rejected a version of her Brexit agreement for a third time,she stepped down, telling the country she deeply regretted being unable to deliver Brexit. Boris Johnson outside his polling station with his dog, Dilyn ""Everything changed"" on the stroke of 22:00 GMT on 12 December, says BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake. As the BBC's Huw Edwards declared the exit poll at the end of a cold and wet December polling day, the Conservatives were about to secure a Commons majority of 80, the party's largest since 1987. ""A campaign focussed relentlessly on the seemingly simple promise to 'get Brexit done' had won over voters in places long-seen as out of reach for the Conservatives,"" says Mr Blake. The Labour Party had its worst election result since 1935, while the SNP made big gains across Scotland.  In Northern Ireland, more nationalists than unionists won seats, putting the union further ""under strain"", says Mr Blake. ""But in Downing Street Mr Johnson's grip on power was stronger, his support-base wider and he now had a freer hand to do, within reason, what he wanted,"" he continued. ""The election result has set the course firmly for the UK's departure from the European Union, left Labour in ruins and all but silenced the arguments for another referendum."" Knife-edge votes and backroom deals between parties have defined the politics of the past decade. But after the Tory's resounding victory, the tone of the next 10 years could be entirely different.

"MPs have called on Whirlpool to offer refunds or ""swift compensation"" as it recalls 519,000 washing machines. A cross-party group on consumer protection said customers had been ""severely let down"" owing to the delay until machines are fixed or replaced. The former head of the Commons Business Committee has also demanded the company give refunds to those who want them. But the company said its priority was to ensure potentially dangerous appliances were removed from homes. About 20% of the Hotpoint and Indesit washing machines sold since 2014 are affected by a safety fault. Up to 519,000 washing machines sold in the UK need to be recalled, a process that will start in early January. Seventy-nine fires are thought to have been caused by an overheating door locking system, a fault which develops over time, according to Whirlpool, which owns the brands. Whirlpool washing machine danger revealed as recall launched 'I've called Whirlpool 40 times and got nowhere' Yvonne Fovargue MP, who chaired the Consumer Protection All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) in the last Parliament and Carolyn Harris MP, who chaired the Electrical Safety APPG in the last Parliament, said that Whirlpool appeared to have learned little from its handling ofa safety problem regarding tumble dryers, ""Whirlpool's advice to affected customers simply not to use the machines until repaired or replaced is wholly inadequate, particularly in the busy holiday period when families are at home,"" said Ms Fovargue. ""It appears that once again customer trust is being abused and eroded. Whirlpool should swiftly compensate customers who have been severely let down."" Whirlpool has set upa model checker online,external. Owners of Hotpoint and Indesit washing machines bought since October 2014 will need to enter the model and serial number of their appliance - found inside the door or on the back - to see if it is one of those affected. There is also a free helpline, open every day, available on 0800 316 1442. Meanwhile, Rachel Reeves, who chaired the Business Committee in the last Parliament, which investigated the Whirlpool saga, called for those affected by the washing machine recall to be offered a refund, rather than just a repair or replacement. ""I understand Whirlpool is refusing to offer refunds to consumers hit by this latest safety problem in what seems to be a never-ending saga,"" she said. ""That refusal will further damage consumer confidence and shows a lack of respect for the people on whom Whirlpool's profits depend."" The company said that a refund would not ensure the fire-prone machines were withdrawn from people's homes, which was its priority. It has put in a range of plans, including hiring engineers and building up call centre staffing. The company said it was in contact with various second-hand sales platforms to alert them to recall and ensure the affected products were not sold, as it had for the tumble dryer recall. It said very few of these appliances would still be in stock with regular retailers and should not be sold.

"Youth workers in Cardiff said that the clubs helped give teenagers a ""safe place"" to stop being drawn into gangs and carrying knives Teenagers could be left vulnerable to drugs and crime if more youth clubs close in Wales, sector workers fear. BBC figures show 163 youth clubs have been closed by councils in the last five years. One voluntary sector club in Caerphilly said it was ""begging for cash"" to keep teenagers off the streets. The body which represents councils said youth work was ""vital"" and authorities had been forced to make tough decisions due to financial challenges. Children's commissioner Sally Holland said teenagers were ""frustrated"" at cuts in communities where drug dealing and knife crime were on the rise. Youth clubs 'key to tackling gang rise' Reality check: Have youth service cuts led to more crime? Councils, charities and voluntary sector organisations run youth services in Wales, which includes work to tackle homelessness and running youth clubs. But in recent years local authorities have made cuts and reorganised services, with 163 council-run clubs closing since 2014. The figures, revealed under the Freedom of Information Act, also show the number of council-employed youth workers fell dramatically in the period, with the largest cuts felt in Bridgend, Rhondda and Gwynedd. A number of voluntary sector groups said they were constantly asking for cash, with some on the brink of closure due to funding issues. In the last nine years the number of front-line youth workers employed by councils more than halved, from 2,434 in 2010-11 to 1,097 in 2018-19. The youth club closures come as councils in Wales have faced making millions in cuts in a bid to balance their budgets. The north felt the worst of the cuts. In 2018, Gwynedd council shut all 39 of its youth clubs and replaced it with onecounty-wide roving service in a bid to save Â£270,000. Conwy closed 15, Wrexham 14 and Flintshire 11, while Anglesey has closed 10, some of which the authority says were shut due to lack of use. Rhondda was the only area to increase the number of youth clubs, after a reorganisation saw all 20 existing clubs shut with 21 opened in different locations. All but one council slashed the number of youth workers it employed - with areas including Bridgend cutting its front-line workforce to less than half that in 2014. This video can not be played Young people at the Sydic youth club talked about the group being one big family. When Senghenydd youth club (SYDIC), in Caerphilly, opened in 1997 the area had issues with anti-social behaviour and vandalism. Dave Brenton, who runs the not-for-profit club, said giving young people a non-judgemental safe place to socialise had helped. The club puts on activities and helps some of the children with issues including mental health problems and drug addiction. Rising knife crime linked to council cuts, study suggests While the club gets funding from charities, Mr Brenton said they were ""always begging for cash"" and the situation was now dire. ""We are not seen as a thing that is vital, but to these guys we are, we are a place where they can be themselves and voice their opinions,"" he said. Esme-Jade Davies now volunteers at the club and worries if it was not here young people would be out on the streets ""There aren't many things for kids to do here,"" says Esme-Jade Davies, 17, who started volunteering at the club after being a member for years. ""This club means a lot to me because it's like a family. It keeps us out of trouble, and keeps us off the streets."" The children in Dyffryn Ardudwy enjoyed a Christmas party after the parents rallied together to restart the youth club In Dyffryn Ardudwy, in Gwynedd, parents fundraised to reopen and run their youth club in a small village after the council closed all the groups. The club is now going strong and has joined forces with the local youth football team, also set up by the community, which is struggling to get funding. Maisy, 12, said the club was great, adding: ""We are not getting into trouble, which is what people do if there is nothing to do."" In June the Welsh Government more thandoubled cash available for youth work servicesfor 2019-20, to more than Â£10m. The cash, given to councils via the youth support grant, has to be used in partnership with the voluntary sector. But a large chunk of it is for projects to prevent homelessness and mental health issues. Caroline Ryan, of YMCA Cardiff, said more cash was needed to give young people a safe place to avoid exploitation and crime. Set up in 2012 the drop-in runs activities and helps young people avoid getting involved in ""County Lines"" gangs. ""With local authority clubs closing there is more risk of them getting involved in gangs and knife crime, but if they are engaging in youth clubs they are not going to be going out to take part in criminal activities,"" she said. Next April councils are set to get a 4.3% increase in funding as part of the Welsh Government budget - the first significant increase in 12 years. Sally Holland says that youth services are a ""first line of defence"" against serious issues like knife crime and drugs Dr Holland said youth services are vital as a first line of defence against serious problems like knife crime and drugs and needed investment. ""It's really important that we recognise that spending on youth work can save money in the long term by helping to keep young people happy, healthy and safe,"" she said. But the Welsh Local Government Association said the financial outlook for councils remained challenging and tough decisions would still need to be made. ""It would be a matter for individual local authorities to decide how services are provided and funded, using local discretion in line with local circumstances and budgets,"" he said.

"The Queen, Prince Charles, Prince William and Prince George made the Christmas puddings Buckingham Palace has released two pictures of the Queen and other senior royals making Christmas puddings for charity. Here are five things we noticed about the festive photos. Four generations of royals - the Queen and the next three heirs to the throne, princes Charles, William and George - were photographed in the palace's music room. In the background is an impressive Christmas tree Look closely and you will see it's adorned with a number of regal-themed baubles, including mini crowns, corgis, a golden throne and a piper wearing a kilt. A royal tree: A Buckingham Palace Christmas tree is decorated with crowns Sadly, we can't see what's on top of the tree. This is not the only tree the royals have at Christmas. Traditionally, the family spend Christmas at the Queen's private estate Sandringham and they meet there on Christmas Eve to finish decorating their 20ft tree. What's a royal Christmas like? It's fair to say the four generations of royals are not wearing the usual baking attire. All four are smartly dressed, with Prince William and his father, Charles, both wearing suits and ties. The Queen, meanwhile, is wearing a formal dress, as well as a string of pearls and a brooch. The puddings are for the Royal British Legion's new Together at Christmas scheme It's worth bearing in mind that the dress code for a royal Christmas is quite formal anyway. Royal historian Kate Williamspreviously told the BBC:""There are quite a lot of different dresses required - change for church, change for dinner."" The Queen is rarely seen without a handbag on her arm and, if this photo is anything to go by, the same might even be true in her own palace. She appears to be carryinga favourite of hers,a Launer London Traviata which is handmade at a factory in Walsall and costs around Â£1,800. Launer London was granted the Royal Warrant in 1968 and has been supplying Her Majesty with bags ever since. What's inside her bag remains for only the Queen to know. If the mixing bowl in the photo looks familiar, then maybe it is. Many consider the Mason Cash bowl to be a classic in the UK, used in kitchens for decades by their parents and grandparents - and even features in the Great British Bake Off. The bowls are similar to those used on the Great British Bake Off We don't know exactly when the pictures were taken, except that it was sometime earlier this month. It must have been before Friday, when the Queen left for Sandringham, which was also when Prince Philipwas admitted to hospital. Traditionally, the Christmas puddingis made on Stir-up Sunday,external- usually the last Sunday before Advent, in order to boost the flavour. This year that was 24 November. It would then be wrapped up in a cloth - or nowadays in cling film or foil - and stored in a cool, dry place until Christmas Day. Some people add coins or other items to the mixture for luck -a tradition startedby Queen Victoria, apparently as a gesture of thanks to her cook - while in other families people take turns to stir it while making a wish. Fortunately in this case it does not matter if the royals started a bit late, as the puddings will not be eaten until 2020. The ones made with the royals' help were for the Royal British Legion's new Together at Christmas scheme, and will be among 99 puddings distributed to different projects linked to the armed forces next year. Decades-old Christmas pud 'amazing' Prince Louis' first words inspired by Mary Berry ""As we head towards our centenary in 2021, we are proud to start a new tradition for our community with the support of our patron, Her Majesty the Queen, and three generations of her family,"" the charity said. ""Making and eating Christmas puddings has traditionally been a shared family activity, and we look forward to sharing these special puddings made with the help of the royal family."" Aside from the charity's scheme, it's tradition for the Queen to gift each of her 1,500 staff a Christmas pudding along with a card. They're not homemade though, and are usually shop-bought.

"This video can not be played Florence Widdicombe was writing the cards last Sunday when she discovered the message Tesco has suspended production of charity Christmas cards at a factory in China after a six-year-old girl found a message from workers inside one. The note, found by Florence Widdicombe, was allegedly written by prisoners in Shanghai claiming they were ""forced to work against our will"". ""Please help us and notify human rights organisation,"" the message said. Tesco said it was ""shocked"" by the report, adding: ""We would never allow prison labour in our supply chain."" The supermarket said it would de-list the supplier of the cards, Zhejiang Yunguang Printing, if it was found to have used prison labour. Florence was writing cards to her school friends when she found that one of them - featuring a kitten with a Santa hat - had already been written in. The pack of cards cost Â£1.50 from Tesco In block capitals, it said: ""We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu prison China. Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organisation."" It asked whoever found the message to contact Peter Humphrey, a British journalist who was himself imprisoned there four years ago. Oxfam alleges UK supermarket supply chain abuse âThe SOS in my Halloween decorationsâ Data leak details China's 'brainwashing system' Florence, from Tooting in south London, told BBC News she was writing ""my sixth or eighth card"" when she saw ""somebody had already written in it"". ""It made me feel shocked,"" she said, adding that when it was explained to her what the message meant she felt ""sad"". Her father, Ben Widdicombe, said he first felt ""incredulity"" at discovering the message, adding he first thought it was ""some sort of prank"". ""But on reflection we realised it was potentially quite a serious thing,"" he said. ""I felt very shocked but also felt a responsibility to pass it on to Peter Humphrey as the author asked me to do."" He said: ""It hits home. There are injustices in the world and there are people in difficult situations and we know about that and we read about that each and every day. ""There is something about that message hitting home at Christmas... that really does make it very poignant and very powerful."" Florence Widdicombe, aged six, says finding the message made her feel shocked He added: ""It could have ended up anywhere. And indeed we have many cards as all families do that are left over and we put them in a drawer and forget about them. There is an incredible element of chance in all of this that the card was written, it got to us and we opened it on the day we did."" A Tesco spokeswoman said: ""We were shocked by these allegations and immediately halted production at the factory where these cards are produced and launched an investigation."" The supermarket said it has a ""comprehensive auditing system"" to ensure suppliers are not exploiting forced labour. The factory in question was checked only last month and no evidence of it breaking the ban on prison labour was found, it said. Sales of charity Christmas cards at the company's supermarkets raise Â£300,000 a year for the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK. The retailer has not received any other complaints from customers about messages inside Christmas cards. The message in the card urged the recipient to contact Peter Humphrey, whowas formerly imprisoned at Qingpuon what he described as ""bogus charges that were never heard in court"". After the Widdicombe family sent him a message via Linkedin, Mr Humphrey said he then contacted ex-prisoners who confirmed inmates had been forced to work. He then wrote the storyfor the Sunday Times,external. Mr Humphrey told the BBC: ""I spent two years in captivity in Shanghai between 2013 and 2015 and my final nine months of captivity was in this very prison in this very cell block where this message has come from. ""So this was written by some of my cellmates from that period who are still there serving sentences. This video can not be played Peter Humphrey: ""I think I know who it was but I will never disclose the name"" ""I'm pretty sure this was written as a collective message. Obviously one single hand produced this capital letters' handwriting and I think I know who it was, but I will never disclose that name."" He said the cell block of foreign prisoners has about 250 people in it, who are living a ""very bleak daily life"" with 12 prisoners per cell. ""They sleep in very rusty iron bunkbeds with a mattress which is no more than about 1cm thick underneath,"" he said. ""In the winter it's extremely cold, there's no heating in the building and in the summer it's extremely hot because there is no air conditioning. ""They get up around 5:30-6:00am every day they have to go to bed again at about 9.30."" He said when he was in there, manufacturing labour work was voluntary - to earn money to buy soap or toothpaste - but that work has now become compulsory. ""Everyone I know in there at the time was in there for very questionable reasons,"" he said. ""I met so many people who I considered to be the victims of wrongful imprisonment or at least reckless sentencing for minor offences."" A foreign inmate dries clothes at Shanghai Qingpu prison in 2006 Mr Humphrey said he believes those who wrote the note ""knew very well what risks they were taking and they were prepared to take this risk"". ""They know very well that if they're caught, they will be punished. They could be punished for example by losing some merit points or having some kind of deprivation of some of their food allowance. ""They could be punished by sending them to solitary confinement for a month or something like that where conditions are fairly harsh."" Mr Humphrey also said that censorship in the prison had increased, cutting off his usual methods of contacting prisoners he had met before his release in 2015. ""They resorted to the Qingpu equivalent of a message in a bottle, scribbled on a Tesco Christmas card,"" he said. It is not the first time that prisoners in China have reportedly smuggled out messages in products they have been forced to make for Western markets. In 2012, Julie Keith from Portland, Oregon, discoveredan account of torture and persecutionby a prisoner who said he was forced to manufacture the Halloween decorations she had purchased. And in 2014, Karen Wisinska from Co Fermanagh in Northern Ireland,found a note on a pair of Primark trousersreading: ""Our job inside the prison is to produce fashion clothes for export. We work 15 hours per day and the food we eat wouldn't even be given to dogs or pigs.""

"MPs have called on Whirlpool to offer refunds or ""swift compensation"" as it recalls 519,000 washing machines. A cross-party group on consumer protection said customers had been ""severely let down"" owing to the delay until machines are fixed or replaced. The former head of the Commons Business Committee has also demanded the company give refunds to those who want them. But the company said its priority was to ensure potentially dangerous appliances were removed from homes. About 20% of the Hotpoint and Indesit washing machines sold since 2014 are affected by a safety fault. Up to 519,000 washing machines sold in the UK need to be recalled, a process that will start in early January. Seventy-nine fires are thought to have been caused by an overheating door locking system, a fault which develops over time, according to Whirlpool, which owns the brands. Whirlpool washing machine danger revealed as recall launched 'I've called Whirlpool 40 times and got nowhere' Yvonne Fovargue MP, who chaired the Consumer Protection All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) in the last Parliament and Carolyn Harris MP, who chaired the Electrical Safety APPG in the last Parliament, said that Whirlpool appeared to have learned little from its handling ofa safety problem regarding tumble dryers, ""Whirlpool's advice to affected customers simply not to use the machines until repaired or replaced is wholly inadequate, particularly in the busy holiday period when families are at home,"" said Ms Fovargue. ""It appears that once again customer trust is being abused and eroded. Whirlpool should swiftly compensate customers who have been severely let down."" Whirlpool has set upa model checker online,external. Owners of Hotpoint and Indesit washing machines bought since October 2014 will need to enter the model and serial number of their appliance - found inside the door or on the back - to see if it is one of those affected. There is also a free helpline, open every day, available on 0800 316 1442. Meanwhile, Rachel Reeves, who chaired the Business Committee in the last Parliament, which investigated the Whirlpool saga, called for those affected by the washing machine recall to be offered a refund, rather than just a repair or replacement. ""I understand Whirlpool is refusing to offer refunds to consumers hit by this latest safety problem in what seems to be a never-ending saga,"" she said. ""That refusal will further damage consumer confidence and shows a lack of respect for the people on whom Whirlpool's profits depend."" The company said that a refund would not ensure the fire-prone machines were withdrawn from people's homes, which was its priority. It has put in a range of plans, including hiring engineers and building up call centre staffing. The company said it was in contact with various second-hand sales platforms to alert them to recall and ensure the affected products were not sold, as it had for the tumble dryer recall. It said very few of these appliances would still be in stock with regular retailers and should not be sold.

"Dozens of pesto products from Italian sauce maker Sacla' are being recalled over fears they may contain peanuts without mentioning them on the label. The Food Standards Agency has issued an allergy alert, warning that 25 pesto products may be affected. The list of products also include own-brand jars of pesto from supermarkets Waitrose and Aldi. The FSA said the products are a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy to peanuts. Some customers who had bought any of the pesto jars through supermarkets have been emailed with the warning. One woman was emailed by Morrisons to say: ""Your shopping history shows that you have been sent one or more of these items. Anyone with an allergy or intolerance to peanuts should not consume this product."" In a statement, Sacla' UK's managing director Clare Blampied said: ""The health, safety and welfare of our customers is our number one priority.  We took immediate action to recall every batch of every Sacla' pesto recipe when we were made aware that some cashew nuts, which had been delivered by an external supplier, might contain traces of peanuts. ""Cashew nuts are an integral part of the pesto recipe and, therefore, we contacted all retailers to withdraw our pesto products straightaway from the shelves. ""Anyone who suffers from a peanut allergy should not consume any of these products, and return them to the store where they made the purchase, or contact Sacla' directly. ""We have launched an in-depth investigation into this unusual incident and we are working very closely with the Food Standards Agency.

"Dozens of pesto products from Italian sauce maker Sacla' are being recalled over fears they may contain peanuts without mentioning them on the label. The Food Standards Agency has issued an allergy alert, warning that 25 pesto products may be affected. The list of products also include own-brand jars of pesto from supermarkets Waitrose and Aldi. The FSA said the products are a possible health risk for anyone with an allergy to peanuts. Some customers who had bought any of the pesto jars through supermarkets have been emailed with the warning. One woman was emailed by Morrisons to say: ""Your shopping history shows that you have been sent one or more of these items. Anyone with an allergy or intolerance to peanuts should not consume this product."" In a statement, Sacla' UK's managing director Clare Blampied said: ""The health, safety and welfare of our customers is our number one priority.  We took immediate action to recall every batch of every Sacla' pesto recipe when we were made aware that some cashew nuts, which had been delivered by an external supplier, might contain traces of peanuts. ""Cashew nuts are an integral part of the pesto recipe and, therefore, we contacted all retailers to withdraw our pesto products straightaway from the shelves. ""Anyone who suffers from a peanut allergy should not consume any of these products, and return them to the store where they made the purchase, or contact Sacla' directly.

"MPs have called on Whirlpool to offer refunds or ""swift compensation"" as it recalls 519,000 washing machines. A cross-party group on consumer protection said customers had been ""severely let down"" owing to the delay until machines are fixed or replaced. The former head of the Commons Business Committee has also demanded the company give refunds to those who want them. But the company said its priority was to ensure potentially dangerous appliances were removed from homes. About 20% of the Hotpoint and Indesit washing machines sold since 2014 are affected by a safety fault. Up to 519,000 washing machines sold in the UK need to be recalled, a process that will start in early January. Seventy-nine fires are thought to have been caused by an overheating door locking system, a fault which develops over time, according to Whirlpool, which owns the brands. Whirlpool washing machine danger revealed as recall launched 'I've called Whirlpool 40 times and got nowhere' Yvonne Fovargue MP, who chaired the Consumer Protection All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) in the last Parliament and Carolyn Harris MP, who chaired the Electrical Safety APPG in the last Parliament, said that Whirlpool appeared to have learned little from its handling ofa safety problem regarding tumble dryers, ""Whirlpool's advice to affected customers simply not to use the machines until repaired or replaced is wholly inadequate, particularly in the busy holiday period when families are at home,"" said Ms Fovargue. ""It appears that once again customer trust is being abused and eroded. Whirlpool should swiftly compensate customers who have been severely let down."" Whirlpool has set upa model checker online,external. Owners of Hotpoint and Indesit washing machines bought since October 2014 will need to enter the model and serial number of their appliance - found inside the door or on the back - to see if it is one of those affected. There is also a free helpline, open every day, available on 0800 316 1442. Meanwhile, Rachel Reeves, who chaired the Business Committee in the last Parliament, which investigated the Whirlpool saga, called for those affected by the washing machine recall to be offered a refund, rather than just a repair or replacement. ""I understand Whirlpool is refusing to offer refunds to consumers hit by this latest safety problem in what seems to be a never-ending saga,"" she said. ""That refusal will further damage consumer confidence and shows a lack of respect for the people on whom Whirlpool's profits depend."" The company said that a refund would not ensure the fire-prone machines were withdrawn from people's homes, which was its priority. It has put in a range of plans, including hiring engineers and building up call centre staffing. The company said it was in contact with various second-hand sales platforms to alert them to recall and ensure the affected products were not sold, as it had for the tumble dryer recall. It said very few of these appliances would still be in stock with regular retailers and should not be sold.

"This video can not be played Florence Widdicombe was writing the cards last Sunday when she discovered the message Tesco has suspended production of charity Christmas cards at a factory in China after a six-year-old girl found a message from workers inside one. The note, found by Florence Widdicombe, was allegedly written by prisoners in Shanghai claiming they were ""forced to work against our will"". ""Please help us and notify human rights organisation,"" the message said. Tesco said it was ""shocked"" by the report, adding: ""We would never allow prison labour in our supply chain."" The supermarket said it would de-list the supplier of the cards, Zhejiang Yunguang Printing, if it was found to have used prison labour. Florence was writing cards to her school friends when she found that one of them - featuring a kitten with a Santa hat - had already been written in. The pack of cards cost Â£1.50 from Tesco In block capitals, it said: ""We are foreign prisoners in Shanghai Qingpu prison China. Forced to work against our will. Please help us and notify human rights organisation."" It asked whoever found the message to contact Peter Humphrey, a British journalist who was himself imprisoned there four years ago. Oxfam alleges UK supermarket supply chain abuse âThe SOS in my Halloween decorationsâ Data leak details China's 'brainwashing system' Florence, from Tooting in south London, told BBC News she was writing ""my sixth or eighth card"" when she saw ""somebody had already written in it"". ""It made me feel shocked,"" she said, adding that when it was explained to her what the message meant she felt ""sad"". Her father, Ben Widdicombe, said he first felt ""incredulity"" at discovering the message, adding he first thought it was ""some sort of prank"". ""But on reflection we realised it was potentially quite a serious thing,"" he said. ""I felt very shocked but also felt a responsibility to pass it on to Peter Humphrey as the author asked me to do."" He said: ""It hits home. There are injustices in the world and there are people in difficult situations and we know about that and we read about that each and every day. ""There is something about that message hitting home at Christmas... that really does make it very poignant and very powerful."" Florence Widdicombe, aged six, says finding the message made her feel shocked He added: ""It could have ended up anywhere. And indeed we have many cards as all families do that are left over and we put them in a drawer and forget about them. There is an incredible element of chance in all of this that the card was written, it got to us and we opened it on the day we did."" A Tesco spokeswoman said: ""We were shocked by these allegations and immediately halted production at the factory where these cards are produced and launched an investigation."" The supermarket said it has a ""comprehensive auditing system"" to ensure suppliers are not exploiting forced labour. The factory in question was checked only last month and no evidence of it breaking the ban on prison labour was found, it said. Sales of charity Christmas cards at the company's supermarkets raise Â£300,000 a year for the British Heart Foundation, Cancer Research UK and Diabetes UK. The retailer has not received any other complaints from customers about messages inside Christmas cards. The message in the card urged the recipient to contact Peter Humphrey, whowas formerly imprisoned at Qingpuon what he described as ""bogus charges that were never heard in court"". After the Widdicombe family sent him a message via Linkedin, Mr Humphrey said he then contacted ex-prisoners who confirmed inmates had been forced to work. He then wrote the storyfor the Sunday Times,external. Mr Humphrey told the BBC: ""I spent two years in captivity in Shanghai between 2013 and 2015 and my final nine months of captivity was in this very prison in this very cell block where this message has come from. ""So this was written by some of my cellmates from that period who are still there serving sentences. This video can not be played Peter Humphrey: ""I think I know who it was but I will never disclose the name"" ""I'm pretty sure this was written as a collective message. Obviously one single hand produced this capital letters' handwriting and I think I know who it was, but I will never disclose that name."" He said the cell block of foreign prisoners has about 250 people in it, who are living a ""very bleak daily life"" with 12 prisoners per cell. ""They sleep in very rusty iron bunkbeds with a mattress which is no more than about 1cm thick underneath,"" he said. ""In the winter it's extremely cold, there's no heating in the building and in the summer it's extremely hot because there is no air conditioning. ""They get up around 5:30-6:00am every day they have to go to bed again at about 9.30."" He said when he was in there, manufacturing labour work was voluntary - to earn money to buy soap or toothpaste - but that work has now become compulsory. ""Everyone I know in there at the time was in there for very questionable reasons,"" he said. ""I met so many people who I considered to be the victims of wrongful imprisonment or at least reckless sentencing for minor offences."" A foreign inmate dries clothes at Shanghai Qingpu prison in 2006 Mr Humphrey said he believes those who wrote the note ""knew very well what risks they were taking and they were prepared to take this risk"". ""They know very well that if they're caught, they will be punished. They could be punished for example by losing some merit points or having some kind of deprivation of some of their food allowance. ""They could be punished by sending them to solitary confinement for a month or something like that where conditions are fairly harsh."" Mr Humphrey also said that censorship in the prison had increased, cutting off his usual methods of contacting prisoners he had met before his release in 2015. ""They resorted to the Qingpu equivalent of a message in a bottle, scribbled on a Tesco Christmas card,"" he said. It is not the first time that prisoners in China have reportedly smuggled out messages in products they have been forced to make for Western markets. In 2012, Julie Keith from Portland, Oregon, discoveredan account of torture and persecutionby a prisoner who said he was forced to manufacture the Halloween decorations she had purchased. And in 2014, Karen Wisinska from Co Fermanagh in Northern Ireland,found a note on a pair of Primark trousersreading: ""Our job inside the prison is to produce fashion clothes for export. We work 15 hours per day and the food we eat wouldn't even be given to dogs or pigs.""

"Manuel Marrero Cruz, right, was appointed at a National Assembly session also attended by former president RaÃºl Castro, left Cuban President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel has appointed the country's first prime minister in more than 40 years - the tourism minister, Manuel Marrero Cruz. The post of prime minister was scrapped in 1976 by the then revolutionary leader Fidel Castro. It was reinstated under the rules of a new constitution for the communist-run island passed earlier this year. Mr Marrero, 56, will take on some of the responsibilities that currently fall to the president. ""The head of government will be the administrative right hand of the president of the republic,"" state-run online news outlet Cubadebate said. However, critics say any such changes are purely cosmetic as the Cuban Communist Party and the military remain the only two real decision-making institutions on the island. Mr Marrero's appointment was ratified unanimously by deputies in the National Assembly on Saturday. The state newspaper Granma described Mr Marrero as a politician who had emerged ""from the base"" of the tourism industry, one of Cuba's main sources of foreign exchange. In 2000 he was made president of the military-run Gaviota tourism group, whose hotels are subject to US sanctions under the Trump administration. Mr Marrero was named tourism minister in 2004 by Fidel Castro and has since overseen a major boost in tourism to the island. It is unclear if he will now remain head of the ministry.

With his health failing, Castro handed power to his brother, RaÃºl, in 2006. He died in 2016.

"This video can not be played Gas wars: The problem with Nord Stream 2 Germany and Russia have reacted angrily to sanctions approved by US President Donald Trump on a gas pipeline between the two countries. The sanctions target firms building Nord Stream 2, an undersea pipeline that will allow Russia to increase gas exports to Germany. The US considers it a security risk. But Germany accused Washington of interfering in its internal affairs, while Russia and EU officials also criticised the sanctions. Congress voted through the measures as part of a defence bill last week and the legislation, which described the pipeline as a ""tool of coercion"", was signed off by Mr Trump on Friday. The almost $11bn (Â£8.4bn) Nord Stream 2 project has infuriated the US, with both Republican and Democratic lawmakers opposing it. The Trump administration fears the pipeline will tighten Russia's grip over Europe's energy supply and reduce its own share of the lucrative European market for American liquefied natural gas. Skateboarding protesters occupy gas pipeline in Germany EU agrees tighter rules for Russian pipeline President Trump has said the 1,225km (760-mile) pipeline, owned by Russia's state-owned gas company, Gazprom, could turn Germany into a ""hostage of Russia"". Speaking on German TV, Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said the sanctions were an infringement of sovereignty. ""It is up to the companies involved in the construction of the pipeline to take the next decisions,"" he said. The Nord Stream 2 pipeline in the Baltic Sea has divided Europe and infuriated the US German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas has said the sanctions amount to ""interference in autonomous decisions taken in Europe"". The US sanctions have also angered Russia and the European Union, which says it should be able to decide its own energy policies. ""As a matter of principle, the EU opposes the imposition of sanctions against EU companies conducting legitimate business,"" a spokesman for the trading bloc told AFP news agency on Saturday. Russia's foreign ministry also strongly opposed the move, with ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova accusing Washington of promoting an ""ideology"" that hinders global competition. The consortium behind Nord Stream 2 confirmed that it would build the pipeline as soon as possible, despite the sanctions. ""Completing the project is essential for European supply security. We, together with the companies supporting the project, will work on finishing the pipeline as soon as possible,"" it said. However, Allseas, a Swiss-Dutch company involved in the project, said it had suspended its pipe-laying activities in anticipation of the sanctions. For years EU member states have been concerned about the bloc's reliance on Russian gas. Russia currently supplies about 40% of the EU's gas supplies - just ahead of Norway, which is not in the EU but takes part in its single market. The new pipeline will increase the amount of gas going under the Baltic to 55 billion cubic metres per year. Disagreements among EU nations were so strong that, earlier this year,they even threatened to derail the project entirely. The bloc eventually agreed to strengthen regulations against Nord Stream 2, rather than stop it completely, and to bring it under European control. Businesses in Germany, meanwhile, have invested heavily in the project. Chancellor Merkel has tried to assure Central and Eastern European states that the pipeline would not make Germany reliant on Russia for energy. There is concern in other quarters, too. In May, climate activists opposing the use of fossil fuels occupied part of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline in Germany. The demonstrators, who said the project would be more detrimental to the environment than the authorities had claimed, began skateboarding inside the pipes. Police said at least five people had occupied the pipes near Wrangelsburg in northern Germany.

"January 2010. Barack Obama was one year into his US presidency, Instagram hadn't been invented and the word Brexit had never been uttered. A decade on, we look back at the most read stories on the BBC News website year by year. Miner Juan Illanes celebrates after coming out of the Phoenix capsule Being trapped underground in darkness, with hardly any food or water, is ""the stuff of nightmares"", says BBC Latin America online editor Vanessa Buschschluter, who reported from the San Jose mine in northern Chile after 33 miners became trapped deep underground. It was the nightmarish quality of the miners' situation, she says, that moved not only Chileans, but people around the world. For 17 days the collapse of a Chilean copper and gold mine was not widely covered outside the country. That was until the miners tied a note to a probe sent deep beneath the ground saying they were alive. And with that, ""people were hooked"", says Ms Buschschluter. Rescuers drilled down as the miners' desperate families watched on, keeping vigil from what became known as Camp Hope. ""When one of the drills finally reached the miners,the camp's bell rang out and relatives hugged and jumped for joy, some fell on their knees praying,"" Ms Buschschluter adds. The 33 miners were brought to the surface one by one in a specially-designed capsule via a tunnel just wider than the men's shoulders. Winching them to safety took 22 hours. People sang the national anthem and waved Chilean flags, as champagne corks popped. It was the stuff of movies - and sure enough their ordeal made it on to the big screen in a Hollywood film starring Antonio Banderas. A story with a happy ending? Not quite. Many of the miners, who were trapped underground for a record 69 days, struggled to cope with their newfound fame, and some faced health and financial difficulties in the years after. A 150-year-old furniture store in Croydon is sent up in flames It was the worst case of civil unrest in the UK for a generation. The police shooting of 29-year-old Mark Duggan in Tottenham, north London, prompted a protest that turned violent. Over four hot August nights, looters ran free and armed rioters set fire to two police cars, then a bus, and shops. Theunrest spreadjust like the flames - first across London, to Hackney, then Lewisham, Peckham, Woolwich, Ealing and Clapham - before erupting in other major cities including Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham, Wolverhampton and Liverpool. The Met Police officers later said they had beenoutnumberedand were afraid to take on rioters, some of whom were carrying machetes. Five people died and more than 3,000 were arrested. In the year that followed, 1,400 of them were jailed and handed much tougher sentences than magistrates would usually give for such offences. Research by sociologist Juta Kawalerowicz found deprivation and tensions between communities and police were main factors behind the riots. The issue of police stop and search powers being used to target black people came up in the University of Oxford research. But Ms Kawalerowicz said they were not ""race riots"", and rioters did not come from one ethnic group. Michelle and Barack Obama hug in one of the most re-tweeted posts in social media history The race was expected to be tight. But on election night, America's first black president stormed to another victory, securing a second term. Barack Obama's re-election was particularly important, says our senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher, because it proved US voters ""were comfortable enough with a black man as president to want to keep him in the White House"". Mr Obama, a Democrat, had run a largely solid, professional campaign, painting his Republican opponent - Mitt Romney - as an elite, corporate executive who was out of touch with mainstream American voters, says our reporter. In his first term, Mr Obama, who took office amid one of the worst recessions in decades, had overhauled the US healthcare system and overcome strong Republican opposition to pass a programme designed to boost the economy. And in his first speech after re-election, Mr Obama told America: ""The best is yet to come."" He would go on to strike a climate change agreement in Paris, negotiate a deal to curb Iran's nuclear potential and restore diplomatic relations with Cuba. ButMr Obama's second termwas also punctuated by frustration, notably problems with his healthcare system and his failure to push through gun control legislation. ""Of course, four years later, Democrat Hillary Clinton was unable to rebuild Obama's winning coalition of young, minority and working class Americans,"" says Mr Zurcher. This video can not be played The moment of the first explosion A jubilant scene at the finish line of the 2013 Boston marathon turned into a horrific one when two pressure cooker bombs packed with nails, ball bearings and other shrapnel exploded. Three spectators - including an eight-year-old boy - were killed, while 260 others suffered injuries, with many losing legs. The US has had its share of terror attacks, but this one ""transcended tragedy to become an ongoing national drama"", says Mr Zurcher. The search for the perpetrators shut down Boston for days. ""It was a manhunt that played itself out on both traditional news outlets and social media, as Americans across the country watched every twist and turn with fear and fascination - the false alarms, dead-end leads and dramatic confrontations,"" he says. Three days after the bombing, the FBI released CCTV images of the suspects, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Then a police officer responding to reports of a disturbance near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology campus was found with fatal gunshot wounds. The brothers hijacked a car at gunpoint, and were chased by police, throwing explosives at them, before their car crashed. The elder brother, Tamerlan, was killed in a gunfight that followed, but Dzhokhar fled on foot. The wounded 19-year-old was found hours later hiding in a boat in a local resident's backyard. At a trial, his defence team argued his older brother was the driving force, but prosecutors said Dzhokhar was an equal partner. He was found guilty of 30 charges and sentenced to death. Earlier this month, lawyers for Dzhokhar - who is currently in a high security prison - appealed against his death sentence, alleging jurors at his trial were biased. Peaches Geldof had started using heroin again before her death, an inquest heard Peaches Geldof's death from a heroin overdose at just 25 shocked us all, says BBC senior entertainment reporter Mark Savage. ""Initial reports from the ambulance service called the tragedy 'unexplained and sudden' - immediately and eerily reminding us of the shocking death of Peaches' mother, Paula Yates,"" he adds. Geldof was just 11 when her mother died from a heroin overdose in 2000, aged 41. The model and TV presenter - the second daughter of musician Bob Geldof - was a favourite of paparazzi photographers from a young age, often pictured leaving London parties in the early hours. But later in life, she moved to the countryside with her second husband musician Tom Cohen and her two young sons, posting frequently about her family on social media. She told Mother and Baby magazine a month before her death that ""becoming a mother was like becoming me, finally"". After Geldof died, messages of condolence poured into the BBC from readers.. Aninquestheard she had been addicted to heroin and had been taking the substitute drug methadone for two-and-a-half years. Her husband told the inquest Geldof had started using heroin again before her death. Detectives investigated who had given Geldof the heroin, but closed the case a year later with no answers. Gunmen stormed the Bataclan concert hall, firing at the crowds inside Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson still remembers the sound of bullets ricocheting off the old facades of buildings in the city's 11th arrondissement on the night attackers killed130 peopleand injured hundreds more. Almost simultaneously, gunmen and suicide bombers attacked the Bataclan concert hall, the Stade de France stadium, as well as Parisian restaurants and bars. It came in the middle of a string of attacks in France - 10 months after attacks onthe offices of Charlie Hebdo magazineand nine months beforethe Nice lorry attack. The suspected ringleader of the Paris killings was Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a Belgian national who was killed in a police raid in northern Paris five days later. After months on the run, the sole surviving attacker, Salah Abdeslam, was shot and injured in a dramatic arrest in Brussels. He was later sentenced to 20 years in prison. ""For almost two years, it felt as if France was being bludgeoned again and again,"" says Ms Williamson. But she says there was ""something different"" about the Paris attacks that means four years later ""the impact lives on just below the surface"". ""In the midst of attacks on satirical journalists, police officers, the Jewish community, priests, and symbols of the state, this time the hatred expanded to cover everyone - people at a concert, in restaurants, at a football game,"" she says. ""The target was simply France's joy in its own way of life."" Nigel Farage reacts to the 2016 referendum result at a party in central London on 24 June 2016 BBC News' live coverage of the UK's 2016 EU referendumwas, and still is, the site's most read page ever - by some distance. It was to be the biggest decision ""in our lifetimes"", according to then prime minister, David Cameron, who urged the country to vote to stay in the EU. The campaign that followed saw a ""blizzard of claims, some of them of dubious provenance"", says the BBC's Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris. Across the side of a Vote Leave bus was the message: ""We send the EU Â£350m a week, let's fund the NHS instead."" Mr Cameron and the Remainers were ultimately defeated by 52% to 48% - despite London, Scotland and Northern Ireland backing Remain. Boris Johnson, the public face of Vote Leave, said voters had ""searched in their hearts"" and the UK now had a ""glorious opportunity"" to pass its own laws, set its own taxes and control its own borders. UKIP leader Nigel Farage hailed it the UK's ""independence day"". A day later, Mr Cameron quit. Our correspondent says the referendum ""created the current divide in British politics - a divide the latest election hasn't really resolved"". ""We now know Brexit will happen,"" says Mr Morris. ""But many of the bitter arguments surrounding it aren't going to go away."" This video can not be played Reaction from Bristol: 'You're joking. Why does she need to do it?' ""Not another one,"" was the cry from Brenda from Bristol, after Theresa May announced her intention to call a snap election. Coming after the EU referendum and the 2015 general election, people were tired of politics. ""In just three words, Brenda summed up the thoughts of so many millions of voters,"" says BBC presenter Jon Kay, who interviewed her. ""With her lovely Bristolian accent and her old shopping trolley, we knew immediately that we had struck TV gold."" Mrs May said the election was needed for ""certainty, stability and strong leadership"" after the EU referendum - although, as we now know, she ended up losing her majority and having to rely on the Democratic Unionist Party to prop up her minority government. The BBC's live coverage of the results was the most read page of the year. In its first months, the government got its legislation through Parliament quite comfortably, but as Mrs May found to her cost, political deadlock was about to set in. As for Brenda, Mr Kay still checks in with her from time to time. ""She's doing fine but doesn't want any more fuss. She laughs about how mad the world is,"" he says. Brenda doesn't own a laptop or a mobile phone. So when Mr Kay told her that her catchphrase had gone viral again after the 2019 election was called, she laughed and replied: ""That doesn't sound very pleasant."" For a brief spell in November 2018, it looked as though the UK was headed for an orderly Brexit. But it didn't last long. After years of negotiations, Theresa Mayfinally struck a deal with EU leaders, setting out the terms on which the UK would leave the EU. Mrs May said her cabinet had backed the deal, calling it ""the best that could have been negotiated"". But she soon faced a revolt. Dominic Raab, then Brexit minister, led a wave of resignations, saying he could not ""in good conscience"" support the deal. In the following months, Mrs May faced votes of no confidence in her leadership, but she clung on. However, after MPs rejected a version of her Brexit agreement for a third time,she stepped down, telling the country she deeply regretted being unable to deliver Brexit. Boris Johnson outside his polling station with his dog, Dilyn ""Everything changed"" on the stroke of 22:00 GMT on 12 December, says BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake. As the BBC's Huw Edwards declared the exit poll at the end of a cold and wet December polling day, the Conservatives were about to secure a Commons majority of 80, the party's largest since 1987. ""A campaign focussed relentlessly on the seemingly simple promise to 'get Brexit done' had won over voters in places long-seen as out of reach for the Conservatives,"" says Mr Blake. The Labour Party had its worst election result since 1935, while the SNP made big gains across Scotland.  In Northern Ireland, more nationalists than unionists won seats, putting the union further ""under strain"", says Mr Blake. ""But in Downing Street Mr Johnson's grip on power was stronger, his support-base wider and he now had a freer hand to do, within reason, what he wanted,"" he continued. ""The election result has set the course firmly for the UK's departure from the European Union, left Labour in ruins and all but silenced the arguments for another referendum."" Knife-edge votes and backroom deals between parties have defined the politics of the past decade. But after the Tory's resounding victory, the tone of the next 10 years could be entirely different.

"This video can not be played World Cup final 1966: Martin Peters puts England 2-1 up against West Germany World Cup winner and West Ham legend Martin Peters has died aged 76, his family have announced. Peters, who joined West Ham aged 15, spent 11 years with the club until he became Britain's first Â£200,000 player in a move to Tottenham in 1970. He scored for England in their 1966 World Cup final win over West Germany. West Ham said ""the 1966 World Cup winner passed away peacefully"" on Saturday after ""a long and courageous battle with illness"". 'A trailblazer for modern midfielders' - Martin Peters obituary ""He is the fifth member of English football's greatest-ever team now sadly lost - along with Alan Ball, Ray Wilson, Gordon Banks and his fellow West Ham Academy hero and great friend, Bobby Moore,"" the club added. His former England team-mate Sir Geoff Hurst said it was a ""very sad day for football and for me personally"". ""Martin Peters was one of the all-time greats and a close friend and colleague of mine for in excess of 50 years,"" Hurst continued. ""A fellow World Cup final goalscorer and my West Ham partner for years along with Bobby Moore. RIP old friend."" Sir Bobby Charlton, who also played alongside Peters in 1966 said: ""We shared one of the greatest days of our lives at Wembley and the fact Martin is one of only two Englishman to have scored in a World Cup final gives him a special place in England's history of the game. ""He was a fantastic footballer. As a team-mate he was someone I could trust completely to do his job and I am proud to have shared that great day with him."" Peters won the European Cup Winners' Cup with West Ham in 1965 as well as the Uefa Cup and two League Cups with Spurs. After five years at Norwich he moved to Sheffield United for a season before retiring in 1981. Peters, who was awarded an MBE for services to football in 1978, still regularly attended West Ham games as a club ambassador. Bobby Moore, Geoff Hurst, Martin Peters and Ray Wilson feature in a statue near West Ham's former stadium Peters was only handed his England debut by manager Alf Ramsey shortly before the 1966 World Cup and he impressed in a 2-0 win over Yugoslavia. Two months later his goal looked set to win the final at Wembley, only for West Germany to level with seconds remaining before Hurst sealed a 4-2 win and completed his hat-trick in extra time. Asked about his goal, Peters once said: ""The emotion was like being struck by lightning, it was unbelievable."" Ramsey himself said Peters was ""10 years ahead of his time"". West Ham said Peters, Hurst and Moore were able to ""ensure immortality for Ramsey's team"". The club's joint owners David Sullivan and David Gold, said: ""In many ways, though, Martin's greatest legacy is not the World Cup medal itself, but the example that he provides to every young player who walks through the door of our Academy. ""The word 'legend' is used all too freely nowadays. But Martin Peters is a true legend. A legend of West Ham United. A legend of world football. And his contribution to our club and our game will never, ever be forgotten."" Peters won 67 caps for England and made over 700 appearances for clubs throughout his career. His former West Ham team-mate Trevor Brooking told BBC Sport:""The best description of Martin was that he was very humble. They enjoyed the World Cup but it was probably only when each decade went by and England could never repeat it that the enormity of what they achieved grew. ""Martin never revelled in it. He was very humble, good company and never went looking for any headlines."" Frank Bruno (centre) and Sir Geoff Hurst (right) have both paid tribute to Peters Prime Minister Boris Johnson:Very sad news. No England fan will ever forget the heroics of Martin Peters and his fantastic team-mates. My sympathies go out to all of those who knew and loved him. Former England striker Gary Lineker:Sorry to hear that Martin Peters has passed away. One of our World Cup winning heroes. A great player and a true gentleman. Former England goalkeeper Peter Shilton:So sad to hear of the passing of Martin Peters, World Cup 1966 winner, such a gentleman and a player ahead of his time according to Sir Alf Ramsey. I played with him at England when my career started and was very fond of him, I will miss him. RIP. Former England striker Alan Shearer: He was instrumental in England winning the World Cup in 1966. Football has lost a giant of the game, an absolute legend. Former world heavyweight champion Frank Bruno:Really sad news about Martin Peters. He was one of my heroes as a kid watching West Ham. A brilliant footballer and a gentleman. RIP Martin Peters. Newcastle manager Steve Bruce:He was a complete gentleman. I had the pleasure to play against him when I was young and he was at the end of his career and he gave me a lesson in how to be a footballer. They don't make them like him any more - he was a great, great player. Former England striker Stan Collymore:Extremely sad to hear of the passing of West Ham, Spurs and England legend, Martin Peters.
