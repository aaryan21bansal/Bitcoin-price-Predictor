"The fall of Kabul to the Taliban dominates the front pages The fall of Kabul dominates the front pages, with most featuring images of Taliban fighters in the presidential palace and military helicopters airlifting westerners to safety. TheMetro,externalcalls it a ""humiliating echo"" of the evacuation of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam war. TheDaily Telegraph,externalsays the ""desperate scramble"" to escape saw ""chaotic"" scenes at Kabul airport, with the British and US governments left ""shocked"" by the speed of the Taliban advance, as well as the inability of the Afghan military to repel them. Analysts have told theFinancial Times,externalthe morale of the Afghans was ""severely damaged"" by the abrupt pace of the US troop withdrawal, undermining their will to fight. According to theGuardian,external, the Taliban entered Kabul ""not as fighters, but as policemen"" after looting broke out when the surrender of government forces appeared inevitable. It says there was ""anger"" in the capital about President Ashraf Ghani's decision to flee to Uzbekistan, just a day after he appeared on TV promising to reorganise the army. TheDaily Express,externalwarns of ""dark days"" ahead for women, noting that sales of burqas have increased in Kabul, ""with prices rising tenfold"". TheDaily Mail,externalis scathing in its assessment of the 20-year occupation of Afghanistan by the West. ""What the hell did they all die for?"" its headline asks, alongside a photograph of the funeral of one of the 457 British service personnel killed there. Ministers now stand accused of ""presiding over the biggest foreign policy catastrophe in 65 years"", it says. Writing in theTimes,external, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee, Tom Tugendhat, agrees that the UK is facing its biggest overseas disaster since Suez crisis of 1956 when the UK failed to regain control of the canal in Egypt. He warns that Britain remains ""impotent"" in the face of US policy, and says government cuts to defence, diplomacy, aid and trade ""will look different today from how they did a week ago"". The Sun,externalthinks the retreat from Kabul is ""shameful"", arguing the US intelligence services committed a ""monumental error"" by failing to realise Afghan cities would fall so quickly. TheDaily Mirror,externalaccuses Downing Street of being ""asleep once again"", claiming the way Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab had to ""hurry back"" to the UK from holiday is ""symbolic"" of how Britain and the US underestimated the Taliban. The FT acknowledges it was former US President Donald Trump who announced America would pull out of Afghanistan, but going ahead was his successor Joe Biden's choice. The paper describes the move as a ""miscalculation"" that will ""haunt the rest of his presidency"". That view is shared by theNew York Times,external, which says fairly or unfairly, Mr Biden will go down in history as the president who presided over a humiliating final act in the Afghan experiment. ""After seven months in which his administration seemed to exude much-needed competence"", it says, ""everything about America's last days in Afghanistan shattered the imagery"". TheWall Street Journal,externalis even more damning, arguing Mr Biden's statement on Saturday washing his hands of Afghanistan ""deserves to go down as one of the most shameful in history"" by a president at a moment of American retreat. For theWashington Post,external, this was a ""disaster"" produced by four administrations, but there was ""nothing inevitable"" about the outcome, which will ""leave an indelible stain"" on the current commander-in-chief.

"The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition. Emboldened by the withdrawal of US troops, they now control all key cities in the country, including Kabul. Who are the Taliban? The Taliban took some areas from government by force. In other areas, the Afghan National Army withdrew without a shot being fired. Although renewed clashes had been going on for several weeks, from 6 August the Taliban made a more rapid advance across the country, as they took control of provincial cities. The maps below start in early July and show the 400 or so government districts as they fell to the Taliban. Source: BBC research. Districts are 2005 government boundaries Ten days that shook Afghanistan US forces based outside Afghanistan had launched air strikes against Taliban positions earlier last week, but they failed to slow the advance of the insurgents. Although most US troops left in July, several thousand returned to Kabul at the weekend to help evacuate American and allied personnel from the capital. The airport in the capital was the only official route out of the country after the Taliban took control of all the major border crossings. Customs duty on goods entering the country via crossings they control is now collected by the Taliban - although exact amounts are unclear as the volume of trade has fallen as a result of the fighting. But, Islam Qala on the border with Iran was, for example, capable of generating more than $20 million per month. Disruption to the flow of imports and exports has affected prices of essential goods in the markets - fuel and foodstuffs in particular. US troops and their Nato and regional allies forced the Taliban from power in November 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US. But despite a continued international presence in the region, billions of dollars of support and training for the Afghan government forces, the Taliban regrouped and gradually regained strength in more remote areas. A  BBC study in 2017 showed the Taliban were in full control of a number of districts. But the research also showed they were active in many other parts of the country, mounting weekly or monthly attacks in some areas, suggesting significantly higher strength than previous estimates. In 2017 about 15 million people - half the population - were reported to be living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the Taliban were openly present.

"This video can not be played Tottenham 1-0 Manchester City: Nuno Espirito Santo 'very proud' of Spurs after opening win Tottenham made light of the absence of unsettled Harry Kane to start the Premier League season with a win over champions Manchester City and their Â£100m man Jack Grealish. Kane - heavily linked with a move to Manchester City - sat out this pulsating encounter but Pep Guardiola wasted no time in throwing in his British record signing from Aston Villa. It was Son Heung-min who gave new manager Nuno Espirito Santo the perfect start to his reign with a low shot that snaked beyond Manchester City keeper Ederson 10 minutes after the break. Spurs fully deserved their win as they survived a shaky opening phase to play with real purpose, already showing signs of the Nuno trademark with fierce defensive discipline allied to pace on the break. Grealish had a quiet debut, being shown a yellow card late on, and it was actually Spurs who had the best opportunity after Son's goal, only for Steven Bergwijn to shoot wide when clean through. City had fleeting opportunities but rarely tested Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris as they looked rusty in contrast to the sharpness of their opponents. Reaction to Tottenham's victory over Man City Harry Kane has been at Tottenham since he was a schoolboy Manchester City's pursuit of England captain Kane gave this game an added edge - so how the home fans enjoyed victory against the club attempting to snatch away their main marksman. And Spurs delivered exactly what their supporters, finally back inside their magnificent new stadium, wanted with this opening-weekend victory - the chance to taunt Manchester City and to remind Kane what he might be leaving behind. Late on, those fans sent a chant of 'are you watching, Harry Kane?' reverberating around the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. And it was Son, the man who has been Kane's partner in goals for so many years, who provided the flourish befitting this high-octane Spurs performance with a typical piece of skill and ingenuity to slide the winner low past Ederson. Spurs players - and manager - Nuno rightly took the acclaim at the final whistle. The home side had heroes everywhere in match-winner Son, the outstanding defender Japhet Tanganga and the tireless Lucas Moura. It remains to be seen how the Kane affair plays out but this will be the perfect psychological lift to Spurs that will sustain them until the saga comes to a close one way or the other. This video can not be played Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says new signing Jack Grealish was 'excellent' Manchester City's race appeared run long before the end of this game, with the early spark of promise snuffed out by the endeavour and skill of Spurs. Grealish made some useful contributions early on but his day ended in the frustration of a yellow card and it is clear Guardiola, understandably, still has some work to do to integrate his talents into a squad already packed with creative ability. One look at the City bench hinted at what Guardiola can introduce in the weeks ahead, even if Kane does not make the move to Manchester. Kevin de Bruyne, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus were introduced in the final 20 minutes, while England's Euro 2020 pair Kyle Walker and John Stones were unused substitutes, as were Aymeric Laporte, Rodri and Bernardo Silva - a formidable array of talent. But nothing could save this over-complicated and listless City show with Benjamin Mendy showing yet again what a flawed figure he is at left-back while Nathan Ake was also uncomfortable. And, significantly, City's lack of punch, with the great Sergio Aguero now gone, may just have prompted Guardiola to look even further into the acquisition of Kane, especially as Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United have already given notice that there will be very little margin for error in the title race this season.

"This video can not be played Germany great Muller scores winner in 1974 World Cup final Bayern Munich and Germany legend Gerd Muller has died at the age of 75. One of the best strikers in history, Muller scored 68 goals in 62 appearances for West Germany, including the winning goal in the 1974 World Cup final against the Netherlands. He also scored 547 goals in 594 competitive games during 15 years at Bundesliga giants Bayern. ""Today is a sad, black day for FC Bayern and all of its fans,"" Bayern president Herbert Hainer said. ""Gerd Muller was the greatest striker there has ever been - and a fine person, a personality in world football. We are united in deep sorrow with his wife Uschi and his family. ""Without Gerd Muller, FC Bayern would not be the club we all love today. His name and the memory of him will live on forever."" Muller, a two times German footballer of the year, won the Golden Boot for netting 10 goals at the 1970 World Cup and also won the Ballon d'Or that year. He helped West Germany win the European Championship two years later, scoring twice in a 3-0 win against the Soviet Union in the final. ""The news of Gerd Muller's death deeply saddens us all,"" Bayern chief executive Oliver Kahn said. ""He's one of the greatest legends in the history of FC Bayern, his achievements are unrivalled to this day and will forever be a part of the great history of FC Bayern and all of German football. ""As a player and a person, Gerd Muller stands for FC Bayern and its development into one of the biggest clubs in the world like no other. Gerd will forever be in our hearts."" Gerd Muller scored the winning goal in the 1974 World Cup final During his 15 years at Bayern, Muller was the Bundesliga's top scorer seven times. He also held the record for the most goals in a calendar year after scoring 85 in 1972 until Lionel Messi surpassed his total in 2012. His record of 40 goals in a Bundesliga season - scored in 1971-72 - stood for 49 years before it was broken by Robert Lewandowski in May. In total, Muller helped Bayern win four Bundesliga and DFB Cup titles, three European Cups, a European Cup Winners' Cup and an Intercontinental Cup. In 2015, the club announced he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease. Born on 3 November 1945, Muller joined Bayern in 1964. With his short stature and stocky build he was nicknamed ""short, fat Muller"" by his first coach at the club, Zlatko Cajkovski. However, Muller quickly developed a reputation for being a clinical striker and his goals helped Bayern win the league title four times between 1969 and 1974. His prowess in the penalty box quickly made him one of the most feared forwards at club and international level, with another Bayern great - Karl-Heinz Rummenigge - describing Muller in 2015 as ""the best of all time, the Muhammad Ali of the penalty box"". Muller retired from international football shortly after helping West Germany win the World Cup in 1974, aged just 28, but continued to enjoy success at Bayern before leaving in 1979 to join Fort Lauderdale Strikers. He played three seasons in the United States before announcing his retirement in 1982. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Muller played for no other club than Bayern in the Bundesliga (1964-79). In this picture, he celebrates winning the European Cup in 1974, having scored twice in the final With 365 goals in 427 Bundesliga matches, he is the record scorer in Bundesliga history. He scored 40 goals in 1971-72 - a Bundesliga record which was broken last season by Robert Lewandowski (41). In the 1969-70 season, he scored in 16 successive Bundesliga matches, a mark still unbroken. He was the top scorer in seven Bundesliga seasons - also a record. The ""Bomber der Nation"" (""the nation's Bomber"") is also the best scorer in German Cup history - he scored more often (78 goals) than he played games (62). Only Miroslav Klose has scored more goals for the German national team (71) than Muller (68). However, Klose also played more than twice as many international matches (137) as Muller (62).

"The remains of Esther Dingley, an experienced hiker, were found by Mr Colegate on Monday The partner of a British hiker who went missing in the Pyrenees has paid tribute to French and Spanish police teams involved in the search for her. Daniel Colegate found Esther Dingley's remains on Monday, more than eight months after she disappeared. Investigators have saidMs Dingley's injuries suggested a fall, though the cause was unclear. In a statement on the couple's Facebook page, Mr Colegate said those looking for Ms Dingley were ""heroes"". ""Having experienced first hand how hard it was to find answers, I honestly don't think they could have done more,"" he said. ""The only difference between me and them was that I only had a single task, while they continued to rescue others as well."" Daniel Colegate walked hundreds of miles in the search for his missing partner Esther Dingley The couple met at Oxford University and lived in Durham before setting off to travel around Europe in a campervan six years ago. Ms Dingley, who was an experienced hiker, had been trekking solo when shelast communicated with her partnerfrom the top of Pic de Sauvegarde at about 16:00 on 22 November. Mr Colegate said he did not ""have the vocabulary to fully express how challenging these past months have been"". ""But I am certain that without the support, courage and determination of the individuals assigned to lead this case and their team members, those difficulties would have been significantly increased,"" he said. Investigators said the cause of Ms Dingley's accident was not clear The BBC's Chris Bockman in Toulouse said an autopsy and an examination of Ms Dingley's rucksack had been carried out by forensic teams. He said it was ""unclear"" how the accident had happened but police believe the hiking shoes she was wearing several thousand metres up a mountain ""did not have the grip necessary for the icy conditions at the time and she probably slipped and fell"". He also said French officers had confirmed Mr Colegate, who was 100 miles away in France when Ms Dingley, 37, disappeared, was not a suspect.

"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has called a snap summer general election as Canada enters into its pandemic fourth wave. The general election comes as polls indicate his minority Liberal government looks within reach of forming a majority. The 49-year-old Liberal leader says ""Canadians need to choose how we finish the fight against Covid-19"". Canadians will vote on 20 September, some two years ahead of schedule. On Sunday, Mr Trudeau visited Canada's Governor General Mary Simon - the representative of the Queen, Canada's head of state - and asked her to dissolve Parliament. The leader of the centrist Liberals said a general election was necessary so voters have a voice on the path forward at a ""pivotal moment"". In October 2019, voters handed him a minority, meaning he has had to rely on opposition parties to help him pass his agenda. Opposition parties criticised the Liberals for calling a five-week long campaign during the pandemic's latest wave simply for ""political gain"". ""Politically, I don't really know if there's been a better time for this government,"" says Abacus Data CEO David Coletto. ""The mood of the public is a good one right now."" The pollster says that about 46% of Canadians in their recent surveys say they believe the country is heading in the right direction - the highest it's been in about five years. The global coronavirus pandemic is sure to dominate the campaign, as it has much of Mr Trudeau's second term. Over 25.000 Canadians have died from Covid, but the country fared better than others, such as the US. Still, its record on the pandemic has been mixed. It was slow to close its borders. The military had to be sent to some elderly care homes to help contain outbreaks. The initial vaccine rollout was slow, with Mr Trudeau facing questions over the lack of domestic vaccine production. The government was quick to get pandemic relief spending out the door, though it racked up record levels of debt to do so. Is Torontoâs lockdown one of the world's longest? While the country is entering another pandemic wave, for the moment it seems life is returning slowly to normal. Cases rates remain below last winter's peak. Vaccine supply sped up and now Canada has one of the world's highest vaccination rates. The economy is showing signs of recovery and provinces are cautiously reopening. ""This crisis in some ways has been positive for  [Mr Trudeau], politically,"" says Drew Fagan, professor at the Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy at the University of Toronto. But he says the question is whether ""there's enough momentum there"" to ""get him from a fairly healthy minority government to a slim majority government"". Canada has a fixed election date law and the next vote was scheduled for October 2023. But minority governments, which are not uncommon in the country, tend to last about two years. They can be defeated if they lose a vote of confidence in the House of Commons. Those votes are usually on important pieces of legislation like the federal budget. Or like what happened on Sunday, a prime minister can ask the governor general to formally dissolve Parliament - a request rarely denied. In 2019, months of political scandals, a tough first term and a bumpy campaign where old photos of him in blackface emerged all took a toll on the prime minister's popularity. The Liberals won 157 seats, 13 shy of a majority in the 338 seat House of Commons-  and he lost the popular vote. It was also a sharp turnaround from 2015, when he swept into office as a political fresh face and led his party to a stunning win with 184 seats. It will be both a referendum on Mr Trudeau's handling of the pandemic and a vote on future plans to the recovery. Affordability and cost of living are also at the forefront of voters' minds. Lytton broke heat record in July, before a wildfire devastated the British Columbia town Climate change will be front-and-centre, against a backdrop of the province of British Columbia's summer of devastating heatwaves and wildfires, and with parts of the Prairies experiencing severe drought. Mr Coletto says almost half Canadians say the environment is in their top five concerns, up from 39% two years ago. Why North America's killer heat scares me US-Canada heatwave: Visual guide to the causes Mr Trudeau's government also made two big announcements late last week - a promise to accept up to 20,000 Afghan refugees and a vaccine mandate for federal workers and air and rail travellers. The Conservative leader, Erin O'Toole, has championed vaccines but opposes vaccine mandates in favour of other measures and has been vague on whether all candidates will be required to have the jabs. Vaccine mandates could prove to be a campaign wedge issue, says Mr Coletto. ""Our tracking shows that more and more of [vaccinated Canadians] over time are more open to putting restrictions on what people who are not vaccinated can and cannot do,"" he says. The official opposition, the right-leaning Conservatives, are going into the election as perceived underdogs. Their new leader, Mr O'Toole, 48, is not well known to voters. After the party struggled with social and environmental issues in the last election, he's been trying to broaden its appeal, speaking about his support for LGBT rights and introducing a carbon pricing plan early on. On Sunday, he pitched voters on fiscal responsibility and promised economic growth. Still, they are now at ""anything but at a high water mark"", says Mr Fagan. On the left, NDP leader Jagmeet Singh, 42, will be entering his second campaign with surveys suggesting his popularity among voters is higher than in 2019. Mr Fagan says the party's message for progressives will be a vote for the NDP is ""vote for the real thing"". Quebec's separatist party, the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois, which competes only in that battleground province, is also still popular in the province where they hold 32 seats.

"Estimates suggest the Taliban has a core strength of 60,000 fighters The speed of the Taliban advance in Afghanistan appears to have taken many by surprise - regional capitals seem to be falling like dominoes. The momentum is clearly with the insurgents, while the Afghan government struggles to keep its grip on power. This week, one leaked US intelligence report estimated that Kabul could come under attack within weeks, and the government could collapse within 90 days. So how did it unravel so quickly? The US and its Nato allies - including the UK - have spent the best part of the last 20 years training and equipping the Afghan security forces. Countless American and British generals have claimed to have created a more powerful and capable Afghan army. Promises that today appear pretty empty. EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? FEATURE:The displaced people hoping for safety ON THE GROUND:Taliban back brutal rule as they strike for power PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? The Afghan government should, in theory, still hold the upper hand with a larger force at its disposal. The Afghan security forces number more than 300,000, on paper at least. That includes the Afghan army, Air Force and police. The Afghan army has a troubled history of high casualties, desertions and corruption But in reality the country has always struggled to meet its recruitment targets. The Afghan army and police has a troubled history of high casualties, desertions and corruption - with some unscrupulous commanders claiming the salaries of troops who simply didn't exist - so called ""ghost soldiers"". In its latest report to the US Congress, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR) expressed ""serious concerns about the corrosive effects of corruption... and the questionable accuracy of data on the actual strength of the force"". Jack Watling, of the Royal United Services Institute, says even the Afghan army has never been sure of how many troops it actually has. Added to that, he says there have been problems with maintaining equipment and morale. Soldiers are often sent to areas where they have no tribal or family connections. One reason why some may have been so quick to abandon their posts without putting up a fight. This video can not be played The BBC speaks to two high profile figures in the Taliban chain of command who have very different messages The Taliban's strength is even harder to measure. According to the US Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, estimates suggest a core strength of 60,000 fighters. With the addition of other militia groups and supporters, that number could exceed 200,000. But Dr Mike Martin, a Pashto-speaking former British army officer who tracked the history of the conflict in Helmand in his book An Intimate War, warns of the dangers of defining the Taliban as a single monolithic group. Instead he says ""the Taliban is closer to a coalition of independent franchise holders loosely - and most probably temporarily - affiliated with one another"". He notes the Afghan government, too, is as riven by local factional motivations. Afghanistan's shape changing history illustrates how families, tribes and even government officials have switched sides - often to ensure their own survival. Again, the Afghan government should have the advantage in terms of both funding and weapons. It has received billions of dollars to pay for soldiers' salaries and equipment - mostly by the US. In its July 2021 report, SIGAR said more than $88bn (Â£64bn) had been spent on Afghanistan's security. But it ominously added: ""The question of whether that money was well spent will ultimately be answered by the outcome of the fighting on the ground."" Afghanistan's Air Force should provide it with a critical edge on the battlefield. But it has consistently struggled to maintain and crew its 211 aircraft (a problem that's becoming more acute with the Taliban deliberately targeting pilots). Nor is it able to meet the demands from commanders on the ground. Hence the involvement recently of the US Air Force over cities like Lashkar Gah, which have come under Taliban attack. It's still not clear for how much longer the US is willing to provide that support. Thousands of people are living in makeshift camps in Kabul after fleeing the Taliban offensive The Taliban have often relied on revenue from the drugs trade, but they have also had support from outside - most notably Pakistan. More recently the Taliban have seized weapons and equipment from the Afghan security forces - some of it provided by the US - including Humvees, night sights, machine guns, mortars and artillery. Afghanistan was already awash with weapons after the Soviet invasion, and the Taliban have shown that even the crudest can defeat a much more sophisticated force. Think of the deadly effect of the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) on US and British forces. That and local knowledge and an understanding of the terrain have been their advantage. Despite the disparate nature of the Taliban, some still see evidence of a co-ordinated plan in their recent advance. Ben Barry, a former British army brigadier and now a senior fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies, acknowledges the Taliban gains may be opportunistic, but adds: ""If you were to write a campaign plan I would be hard pressed to come up with something better than this."" He points to the focus of the Taliban attacks in the north and west, not their traditional southern strongholds, with successive regional capitals falling into their hands. The Taliban have also captured key border crossings and checkpoints, funnelling off much needed customs revenue away from the cash-strapped government. They've also stepped up targeted killings of key officials, human rights activists, and journalists. Slowly but surely wiping out some of the small gains made over the last 20 years. As for the Afghan government's strategy - that's proving harder to define. Promises of taking back all the territory captured by the Taliban sound increasingly hollow. Mr Barry says there appears to be a plan to keep hold of the larger cities. Afghan commandos have already been deployed to prevent Lashkar Gah in Helmand from falling. But for how much longer? Afghan special forces are relatively small in number, around 10,000 strong, and they're already stretched. The Taliban also appear to be winning the propaganda war and the battle of the narrative. Mr Barry says their momentum on the battlefield has boosted morale and given them a sense of unity. In contrast, the Afghan government has been on the backfoot, bickering and sacking generals. The situation certainly looks bleak for the Afghan government. But Jack Watling of RUSI says that while it looks increasingly pessimistic for the Afghan military, ""the situation could still be saved by politics"". If the government can win over tribal leaders, he says, there is still the chance of a stalemate. This is a view echoed by Mike Martin, who points to the return of former warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum to Mazar-i-Sharif as a significant moment. He's already cutting deals. The summer fighting season will soon be over as the Afghan winter sets in - making manoeuvre more difficult for forces on the ground. It is still possible that there'll be a stalemate by the end of the year, and the Afghan government will cling on to Kabul and a string of larger cities. The tide could even turn if the Taliban fracture. But at present it appears that the US and Nato's efforts to bring peace, security and stability to Afghanistan have been as futile as the Soviets before them.

"If you like neat lines, tidiness and admire symmetry, what's not to like about the decision of Joe Biden to pull American combat troops out of Afghanistan by 11 September 2021 - exactly 20 years on from 9/11? In modern day America it often feels that all roads lead back to 9/11; the single most defining - and scarring - event since Pearl Harbor: the surprise attack by the Japanese on America's Pacific fleet, which would ultimately bring America into World War Two. And so it was that 9/11 led to this country's longest military encounter. The attack on the Twin Towers, the plane that flew into the Pentagon, and the one that crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, were initially the spur for a surge of US nationalism. Young people - in fact people of all ages - were going along to armed forces recruitment offices wanting to sign up. America had come under attack; these patriots wanted to fight to defend the country the ""land of the free"", and seek revenge on those who would do the US harm. And don't mistake this for some kind of kneejerk jingoism. It wasn't that. I knew many people - not just Americans - who were of a liberal bent and had been no great fans of all the doings of the US of A but who have a visceral sense this was a moment where you had to pick your team. Were you on the side of the rule of law, free and fair elections, due process, sexual equality, universal education? Or were you on the side of those who would fly planes into buildings, or would stone people to death, or throw homosexuals off of buildings, or deny girls schooling? If that seems a massive over-simplification, maybe it is - but in the devastating aftermath of 9/11, that is how it seemed to many. Biden makes a surprise visit to Afghanistan as vice-president in 2011 But by 2016 it was one of the factors that led to Donald Trump's election: the weariness of the ""endless wars"" as candidate Trump would refer to the quagmires of Afghanistan and Iraq; the wariness of America being able to act as the world's policeman. Americans understandably wanted to pull up the drawbridge, bring the troops home, leave it to the people in those countries to sort out their own problems, and finally give up on the idea that a US model of liberal democracy was an exportable commodity that could be imposed. The liberal interventionist crusade was over. Trump, if he had won last November, would have pulled out US troops, probably quicker. Although Joe Biden inherited Trump's promise to withdraw, in policy terms the easiest thing would have been to continue to sign the cheques to pay for American servicemen and women to stay in Afghanistan for another year. And then another. And another after that. Why the Taliban is gaining ground so quickly Fleeing the Taliban, to sleep on city streets The political pressure was by no means overwhelming. If anything, the reverse. The defence top brass, the foreign policy establishment, America's allies abroad thought anything other than the status quo would be reckless. But one question was gnawing at the new president, and it was the one posed by Hillel the Elder back in biblical times: ""If not now, then when?"" Biden - who advised President Barack Obama not to send more troops in 2009 but lost the argument - went with now, in what could be the most consequential single decision of his presidency. This video can not be played Taliban leaders speak to BBC News about conquer and compromise When 9/11 happened I was the BBC's Paris correspondent, reporting on Eurotunnel's attempt to force the closure of a Red Cross refugee centre called Sangatte  - where many of the world's storm-tossed refugees and migrants congregated before making the final leg of the journey to the UK. I was driving to Calais when I got a call from a colleague telling me to stop at the nearest service station to watch TV, and see what was unfolding. We didn't know what would happen next - or where we would end up. One year into the optimism of a new millennium, there was a narrative and it wasn't a happy one - the war on terror, a clash of civilisations, call it what you will. At the time the two stories could not have been more different, but a lot of the bedraggled people we met on the roads around Calais were from Afghanistan fleeing Taliban rule. It's worth remembering why the US, UK and others went into Afghanistan. The Taliban had - in effect - become a finishing school for Islamist terrorists wanting to wage jihad against the west. Al-Qaeda wannabes were going into the country to train for holy war. The 9/11 terrorists had honed their skills and hatched their plot there. Removing the Taliban and tackling al-Qaeda became critical for global security. Within a few weeks of 9/11, I was in northern Afghanistan, travelling via Delhi and then Dushanbe in Tajikistan to get there. We were moving with the US and UK-backed Northern Alliance troops as they pushed the Taliban out. Ousting the Taliban was considered a global priority 20 years ago, writes the author (right) Our first day was spent travelling from Khoja Bahauddin, then the Northern Alliance HQ along a road where the Taliban had killed a number of journalists in an ambush two days earlier. After one night we ended up in a town called Taleqan. It had fallen the night before we arrived. One of the iconic shots was of a girls-school classroom that had become a weapons dump for Taliban rockets that in their hasty retreat they had left behind. The stubborn last stronghold was Kunduz - a vital communication corridor sitting between Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif and then further north to the border with Uzbekistan. Now both Taleqan and Kunduz have come back under Taliban control, with a third of the country's regional capitals now under their control. And that raises a super-uncomfortable question for Joe Biden and his ""if not now, then when"" policy. Twenty years on and so many lives lost, and so many billions of dollars spent, what was it for? What's been achieved? What do you say to the families of all those servicemen killed by the Taliban now that the US is giving up? What's to stop terror groups from re-establishing their jihad training camps? At the UN Security Council hearing last Friday it was reported that up to 20 different terror groups, involving thousands of foreign fighters were already fighting with Taliban forces. The regions where Jon travelled are now back under Taliban control I'm sure as I am writing this more families will be packing up their possessions fearful of what Taliban control will mean, perhaps heading to Calais and then the UK. Will the girls' schools return to become weapons storage facilities again? The scars of 9/11 are clear everywhere - thousands of servicemen have come back with prosthetic limbs and disturbed minds. Suicide rates have been rising. Families have lost loved ones. On America's streets are men with red plastic beer cups begging for loose change, many of them with signs saying they are veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. US-led forces toppled the Taliban:In 2001 US-led forces overthrew Afghanistan's Taliban rulers after the 9/11 attacks masterminded by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was based there. Twenty years of occupation and military operations followed:The US and allies oversaw elections and built up Afghan security forces, but the Taliban continued to launch attacks. Eventually the US made a deal with the Taliban:They would pull out if the militants agreed not to host terrorist groups. But talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government failed. US-led forces withdrew this year and the Taliban have now retaken most of the country. The desire to stay at home and shut yourself away from a troubling world is completely understandable. There is no surprise that ""America First"" as a slogan had such resonance. George W Bush was not advocating that back in 2001 - but there were no US troops in Afghanistan or Iraq then. And that didn't keep America safe when early that morning, across those gin-clear blue skies passenger aeroplanes were hijacked and became al-Qaeda-guided missiles, flying into their targets killing thousands of people doing nothing more provocative than going about their daily lives. There's also a difference between enforcing your will as the world's policeman, and being a peacekeeper. Thousands of American troops are still stationed in South Korea - even though the Korean war was 70 years ago. The calculation of successive US presidents has been that a tense peace is better than a hot war or a destabilised region. Joe Biden was hoping his decision would result in headlines like ""Afghan War Ends"" or ""America's longest war is over"". But 20 years on, and the Taliban now re-establishing control with all that could flow from that, might historians in future judge that the 20th anniversary marked the start of the second Afghan war?

"Work days for midwife Nooria Haya regularly included meetings and discussions with male doctors. They decided on treatments for locals and the priorities for the public clinic she works in. It's in Ishkamish, a rural district with sparse amenities, in Takhar province on Afghanistan's north-eastern border with Tajikistan. But recently, the 29-year-old found out that meetings between male and female staff were prohibited. It was the first order the Taliban gave them when the group took control of the region, she says. She could only ask herself how else her life would change. Ishkamish sits in the Hindu Kush mountain range. It's a key border area that the Taliban, emboldened by Nato's withdrawal of nearly 10,000 troops at the start of May, has taken. Igniting intense fighting with seemingly unprepared government forces in southern Helmand by the middle of the month, the fundamentalist Islamist group then took the northern Burka district at the mountains' foothills. Around the same time, US forces left Kandahar airbase - one of the largest in the nation, in a province containing the country's second largest city, Kandahar. Locals were acutely aware of the Taliban's progress. Kandahar, Afghanistan's turbulent province An untidy end - or ominous beginning? Fearing the Taliban, Kabul's young women plead for help ""Every individual was frightened,"" says Jan Agha, 54, in Arghistan district, on the border with Pakistan, and a windy two-hour drive east of Kandahar city. People locked themselves in their homes. But the Taliban took up positions in almost every village. Locals can't escape them. Armed fighters walk through the streets. In the morning and evening, they knock on people's doors to collect food, which they're given for fear of worse consequences. ""Each house now keeps three or four breads or dishes for them,"" Jan, a fruit seller, says, no matter how poor the residents, in a chronically poor country. If the fighters want to stay in their homes too, they do. Through June, the Taliban claimed the capture of several provinces in the north, including Takhar, Faryab and Badakhshan. They forced the army to strategically retreat, and with it democratic institutions. Most of the 2,500 US troops had left by this time, although a handful remain in the capital Kabul, as does its Air Force. Afghans have criticised the international withdrawal as too hasty. Some argue that peace talks over the last two years between the Americans and the Taliban only enhanced the latter's perceived legitimacy, recruitment and ambition. An end to the conflict - which had been ongoing since the US-led invasion ended half a decade of Taliban rule almost 20 years ago - had never been close. As the Taliban reasserted itself in June, fighters sequestered more than food and lodging. Social and economic rights fought for with limited success over the last two decades were immediately withdrawn. Their privations on women descended on Nooria for the first time in her life. ""There are a lot of restrictions now. When I go out, I have to wear a burka as the Taliban orders us, and a male has to accompany me,"" she says. Travelling as a midwife across the district is especially difficult. Men are not allowed to shave their beards - the Taliban says this is against Islam. Barbers are prohibited from giving purportedly foreign-style short back and sides haircuts. A group within the Taliban, called the Amri bil Marof (literally: order the good), particularly enforces the social rules. Its punishments brought the most terror to Afghans in the 1990s. Now, again, it's imposing a two-strike rule.First a warning, second a punishment - public humiliations, prison, beatings, lashes. ""Suddenly most freedoms have been taken away from us,"" Nooria says. ""It is so hard. But we have no other option. They are brutal. We have to do whatever they say. They are using Islam for their own purposes. We are Muslims ourselves, but their beliefs are different."" Difference has also arrived with some increased security from criminality, and from war - where the conflict has been pushed to other areas. Locals welcome such nuanced calm, as they would if the government were in control - even if they doubt its durability. But other things have been driven away too. Afghans used to visit Takhar, famous among the country's 34 provinces for its clean, crisp mountain air that blankets snowy mountains, green and verdant fields, and clear river waters. In Farkhar district, taxi driver Asif Ahadi says he used to make 900 Afghanis ($11; Â£8) a day. But as the Taliban continued their march, tourists stopped their travels. ""Those visitors were my customers,"" Asif, 35, says. ""The money they paid me I used to feed my family. Now my best day will only earn me 150 Afghanis. It's not even enough to cover the cost of my fuel, which has more than doubled now."" And there's been a deadening impact on social life. ""People used to have parties every Friday night - listen to music and dance - have fun. All of these are completely banned now,"" Asif says. ""Every business has suffered the same."" By 4 July, two days after US and Nato troops left Afghanistan's biggest airbase at Bagram, the linchpin for all US-led operations for the last two decades, the Taliban seized Panjwai district, in Kandahar province - their birthplace and former bastion. Less than a week later, they said they controlled the country's biggest border crossing and trade route with Iran and major port, Islam Qala. By the third week of the month, the insurgency had already claimed to command 90% of Afghanistan's borders and 85% of the country. The government disputed the figures - and they are impossible to independently verify - and it still held more populated urban areas. Fleeing the Taliban, to sleep on city streets Who are the Taliban? As the Taliban solidified their control, people started to come out of hiding at home, Asif says. Some had never seen the Taliban's rapid dispensing of justice and methods of governing before. ""They make decisions very quickly on issues and matters like crime,"" Asif says. ""There's no bureaucracy, no red tape - every sort of problem can be solved in days - and nobody can challenge any decision."" They also collect ""Taliban Usher"" and Zakat, usually freely-given Islamic offerings to the poor, of about 10% of people's harvest or a fraction of income, respectively. But the Taliban distorts them into essentially taxes for their own use. It's another financial pressure, alongside prices for ""all goods that are hiked to sky"", Asif says, as external and internal trade is restricted, and the economy is squeezed. Public works have stopped. ""The people were already very poor, and there's no opportunity for work, and no investment,"" he adds. Some have seen the Taliban's system before, however. ""Their ideology and thinking are exactly as they were during their Emirate time. Nothing has changed at all,"" says Jan. ""The Taliban say they have sacrificed a lot to re-establish the Islamic Emirate, so it can't be cast aside."" He says the Taliban has shut all schools in his area. They've said any education should be according to their strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law. It's one of many worrying indicators for locals. During their last rule from 1996 to 2001, the Taliban banned education and work for women and girls, and restricted their access to healthcare. Since they were forced from power, women retook places in public life, making up a quarter of parliament. Numbers of girls in primary education went up to 50%, although by late secondary school the figure was around 20%. Women's life expectancy grew from 57 to 66 years. The figures are comparatively poor, but improvements have been made. Yet now there are only fears that they will regress. Progress is what the Taliban are making now. In August, they've attacked more urban centres - taking a third of the regional capitals, including Kunduz in the north and Taloqan in Takhar province. This week they took Herat in the west, and southern Kandahar and Lashkar Gah, strategically and symbolically important cities, where, together, well over one million people live. The US Air Force has been supporting the Afghan military with strikes. But the last remaining foreign forces are expected to leave the country by 11 September. The date marks the 20th anniversary of al-Qaeda's 9/11 attacks in the US. They spurred the US-led invasion of Afghanistan to remove the Taliban from power for harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures. The struggle takes its toll on human life. A thousand civilians were killed in the month up to the first week of August, the UN says. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes. Control of the country isn't yet certain. But where the Taliban now rules, the change is clear. ""You have to bow your head to live your life,"" Jan says. ""You cannot dare oppose them. You cannot say things against them at all. If they say 'yes', you have to say 'yes'. If they say 'no', you must say 'no'."" Such fear prevails, Nooria says. ""Although it might seem like people looked relaxed, when you speak with them, you understand the serious worries they have. We sit together, praying for God to take them away from us.""

"The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition. Emboldened by the withdrawal of US troops, they now control all key cities in the country, including Kabul. Who are the Taliban? The Taliban took some areas from government by force. In other areas, the Afghan National Army withdrew without a shot being fired. Although renewed clashes had been going on for several weeks, from 6 August the Taliban made a more rapid advance across the country, as they took control of provincial cities. The maps below start in early July and show the 400 or so government districts as they fell to the Taliban. Source: BBC research. Districts are 2005 government boundaries Ten days that shook Afghanistan US forces based outside Afghanistan had launched air strikes against Taliban positions earlier last week, but they failed to slow the advance of the insurgents. Although most US troops left in July, several thousand returned to Kabul at the weekend to help evacuate American and allied personnel from the capital. The airport in the capital was the only official route out of the country after the Taliban took control of all the major border crossings. Customs duty on goods entering the country via crossings they control is now collected by the Taliban - although exact amounts are unclear as the volume of trade has fallen as a result of the fighting. But, Islam Qala on the border with Iran was, for example, capable of generating more than $20 million per month. Disruption to the flow of imports and exports has affected prices of essential goods in the markets - fuel and foodstuffs in particular. US troops and their Nato and regional allies forced the Taliban from power in November 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US. But despite a continued international presence in the region, billions of dollars of support and training for the Afghan government forces, the Taliban regrouped and gradually regained strength in more remote areas. A  BBC study in 2017 showed the Taliban were in full control of a number of districts. But the research also showed they were active in many other parts of the country, mounting weekly or monthly attacks in some areas, suggesting significantly higher strength than previous estimates. In 2017 about 15 million people - half the population - were reported to be living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the Taliban were openly present.

This video can not be played Taliban leaders speak to BBC News about conquer and compromise When 9/11 happened I was the BBC's Paris correspondent, reporting on Eurotunnel's attempt to force the closure of a Red Cross refugee centre called Sangatte  - where many of the world's storm-tossed refugees and migrants congregated before making the final leg of the journey to the UK. I was driving to Calais when I got a call from a colleague telling me to stop at the nearest service station to watch TV, and see what was unfolding. We didn't know what would happen next - or where we would end up. One year into the optimism of a new millennium, there was a narrative and it wasn't a happy one - the war on terror, a clash of civilisations, call it what you will. At the time the two stories could not have been more different, but a lot of the bedraggled people we met on the roads around Calais were from Afghanistan fleeing Taliban rule. It's worth remembering why the US, UK and others went into Afghanistan. The Taliban had - in effect - become a finishing school for Islamist terrorists wanting to wage jihad against the west. Al-Qaeda wannabes were going into the country to train for holy war. The 9/11 terrorists had honed their skills and hatched their plot there. Removing the Taliban and tackling al-Qaeda became critical for global security. Within a few weeks of 9/11, I was in northern Afghanistan, travelling via Delhi and then Dushanbe in Tajikistan to get there. We were moving with the US and UK-backed Northern Alliance troops as they pushed the Taliban out. Ousting the Taliban was considered a global priority 20 years ago, writes the author (right) Our first day was spent travelling from Khoja Bahauddin, then the Northern Alliance HQ along a road where the Taliban had killed a number of journalists in an ambush two days earlier. After one night we ended up in a town called Taleqan. It had fallen the night before we arrived. One of the iconic shots was of a girls-school classroom that had become a weapons dump for Taliban rockets that in their hasty retreat they had left behind. The stubborn last stronghold was Kunduz - a vital communication corridor sitting between Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif and then further north to the border with Uzbekistan. Now both Taleqan and Kunduz have come back under Taliban control, with a third of the country's regional capitals now under their control. And that raises a super-uncomfortable question for Joe Biden and his ""if not now, then when"" policy. Twenty years on and so many lives lost, and so many billions of dollars spent, what was it for? What's been achieved? What do you say to the families of all those servicemen killed by the Taliban now that the US is giving up? What's to stop terror groups from re-establishing their jihad training camps? At the UN Security Council hearing last Friday it was reported that up to 20 different terror groups, involving thousands of foreign fighters were already fighting with Taliban forces. The regions where Jon travelled are now back under Taliban control I'm sure as I am writing this more families will be packing up their possessions fearful of what Taliban control will mean, perhaps heading to Calais and then the UK. Will the girls' schools return to become weapons storage facilities again? The scars of 9/11 are clear everywhere - thousands of servicemen have come back with prosthetic limbs and disturbed minds. Suicide rates have been rising. Families have lost loved ones. On America's streets are men with red plastic beer cups begging for loose change, many of them with signs saying they are veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. US-led forces toppled the Taliban:In 2001 US-led forces overthrew Afghanistan's Taliban rulers after the 9/11 attacks masterminded by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was based there. Twenty years of occupation and military operations followed:The US and allies oversaw elections and built up Afghan security forces, but the Taliban continued to launch attacks. Eventually the US made a deal with the Taliban:They would pull out if the militants agreed not to host terrorist groups. But talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government failed. US-led forces withdrew this year and the Taliban have now retaken most of the country. The desire to stay at home and shut yourself away from a troubling world is completely understandable. There is no surprise that ""America First"" as a slogan had such resonance. George W Bush was not advocating that back in 2001 - but there were no US troops in Afghanistan or Iraq then. And that didn't keep America safe when early that morning, across those gin-clear blue skies passenger aeroplanes were hijacked and became al-Qaeda-guided missiles, flying into their targets killing thousands of people doing nothing more provocative than going about their daily lives. There's also a difference between enforcing your will as the world's policeman, and being a peacekeeper. Thousands of American troops are still stationed in South Korea - even though the Korean war was 70 years ago. The calculation of successive US presidents has been that a tense peace is better than a hot war or a destabilised region. Joe Biden was hoping his decision would result in headlines like ""Afghan War Ends"" or ""America's longest war is over"". But 20 years on, and the Taliban now re-establishing control with all that could flow from that, might historians in future judge that the 20th anniversary marked the start of the second Afghan war?

"Estimates suggest the Taliban has a core strength of 60,000 fighters The speed of the Taliban advance in Afghanistan appears to have taken many by surprise - regional capitals seem to be falling like dominoes. The momentum is clearly with the insurgents, while the Afghan government struggles to keep its grip on power. This week, one leaked US intelligence report estimated that Kabul could come under attack within weeks, and the government could collapse within 90 days. So how did it unravel so quickly? The US and its Nato allies - including the UK - have spent the best part of the last 20 years training and equipping the Afghan security forces. Countless American and British generals have claimed to have created a more powerful and capable Afghan army. Promises that today appear pretty empty. EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? FEATURE:The displaced people hoping for safety ON THE GROUND:Taliban back brutal rule as they strike for power PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? The Afghan government should, in theory, still hold the upper hand with a larger force at its disposal. The Afghan security forces number more than 300,000, on paper at least. That includes the Afghan army, Air Force and police. The Afghan army has a troubled history of high casualties, desertions and corruption But in reality the country has always struggled to meet its recruitment targets. The Afghan army and police has a troubled history of high casualties, desertions and corruption - with some unscrupulous commanders claiming the salaries of troops who simply didn't exist - so called ""ghost soldiers"". In its latest report to the US Congress, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR) expressed ""serious concerns about the corrosive effects of corruption... and the questionable accuracy of data on the actual strength of the force"". Jack Watling, of the Royal United Services Institute, says even the Afghan army has never been sure of how many troops it actually has. Added to that, he says there have been problems with maintaining equipment and morale. Soldiers are often sent to areas where they have no tribal or family connections. One reason why some may have been so quick to abandon their posts without putting up a fight. This video can not be played The BBC speaks to two high profile figures in the Taliban chain of command who have very different messages The Taliban's strength is even harder to measure. According to the US Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, estimates suggest a core strength of 60,000 fighters. With the addition of other militia groups and supporters, that number could exceed 200,000. But Dr Mike Martin, a Pashto-speaking former British army officer who tracked the history of the conflict in Helmand in his book An Intimate War, warns of the dangers of defining the Taliban as a single monolithic group. Instead he says ""the Taliban is closer to a coalition of independent franchise holders loosely - and most probably temporarily - affiliated with one another"". He notes the Afghan government, too, is as riven by local factional motivations. Afghanistan's shape changing history illustrates how families, tribes and even government officials have switched sides - often to ensure their own survival. Again, the Afghan government should have the advantage in terms of both funding and weapons. It has received billions of dollars to pay for soldiers' salaries and equipment - mostly by the US. In its July 2021 report, SIGAR said more than $88bn (Â£64bn) had been spent on Afghanistan's security. But it ominously added: ""The question of whether that money was well spent will ultimately be answered by the outcome of the fighting on the ground."" Afghanistan's Air Force should provide it with a critical edge on the battlefield. But it has consistently struggled to maintain and crew its 211 aircraft (a problem that's becoming more acute with the Taliban deliberately targeting pilots). Nor is it able to meet the demands from commanders on the ground. Hence the involvement recently of the US Air Force over cities like Lashkar Gah, which have come under Taliban attack. It's still not clear for how much longer the US is willing to provide that support. Thousands of people are living in makeshift camps in Kabul after fleeing the Taliban offensive The Taliban have often relied on revenue from the drugs trade, but they have also had support from outside - most notably Pakistan. More recently the Taliban have seized weapons and equipment from the Afghan security forces - some of it provided by the US - including Humvees, night sights, machine guns, mortars and artillery. Afghanistan was already awash with weapons after the Soviet invasion, and the Taliban have shown that even the crudest can defeat a much more sophisticated force. Think of the deadly effect of the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) on US and British forces. That and local knowledge and an understanding of the terrain have been their advantage. Despite the disparate nature of the Taliban, some still see evidence of a co-ordinated plan in their recent advance. Ben Barry, a former British army brigadier and now a senior fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies, acknowledges the Taliban gains may be opportunistic, but adds: ""If you were to write a campaign plan I would be hard pressed to come up with something better than this."" He points to the focus of the Taliban attacks in the north and west, not their traditional southern strongholds, with successive regional capitals falling into their hands. The Taliban have also captured key border crossings and checkpoints, funnelling off much needed customs revenue away from the cash-strapped government. They've also stepped up targeted killings of key officials, human rights activists, and journalists. Slowly but surely wiping out some of the small gains made over the last 20 years. As for the Afghan government's strategy - that's proving harder to define. Promises of taking back all the territory captured by the Taliban sound increasingly hollow. Mr Barry says there appears to be a plan to keep hold of the larger cities. Afghan commandos have already been deployed to prevent Lashkar Gah in Helmand from falling. But for how much longer? Afghan special forces are relatively small in number, around 10,000 strong, and they're already stretched. The Taliban also appear to be winning the propaganda war and the battle of the narrative. Mr Barry says their momentum on the battlefield has boosted morale and given them a sense of unity. In contrast, the Afghan government has been on the backfoot, bickering and sacking generals. The situation certainly looks bleak for the Afghan government. But Jack Watling of RUSI says that while it looks increasingly pessimistic for the Afghan military, ""the situation could still be saved by politics"". If the government can win over tribal leaders, he says, there is still the chance of a stalemate. This is a view echoed by Mike Martin, who points to the return of former warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum to Mazar-i-Sharif as a significant moment. He's already cutting deals. The summer fighting season will soon be over as the Afghan winter sets in - making manoeuvre more difficult for forces on the ground. It is still possible that there'll be a stalemate by the end of the year, and the Afghan government will cling on to Kabul and a string of larger cities. The tide could even turn if the Taliban fracture. But at present it appears that the US and Nato's efforts to bring peace, security and stability to Afghanistan have been as futile as the Soviets before them.

The 7.2-magnitude quake hit the west of the country on Saturday morning, toppling and damaging buildings including churches and hotels. The prime minister said there was ""extensive damage"" and declared a month-long state of emergency. Haiti is still recovering from a devastating 2010 earthquake. The epicentre of Saturday's quake was about 12km (7.5 miles) from the town of Saint-Louis du Sud, the US Geological Survey (USGS) said. At least 304 people have died and many more are injured The tremor was felt in the densely-populated capital of Port-au-Prince, some 125km away, and in neighbouring countries. ""Lots of homes are destroyed, people are dead and some are at the hospital,"" Christella Saint Hilaire, who lives near the epicentre, told AFP news agency. Prime Minister Ariel Henry said he had mobilised a team to work on the relief effort. ""The most important thing is to recover as many survivors as possible under the rubble,"" he said. ""We have learned that the local hospitals, in particular that of Les Cayes, are overwhelmed with wounded, fractured people."" Mr Henry later revealed he had flown in a plane over the city of Cayes.

"This video can not be played Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat: 'We abandoned the Afghan people' The withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan is Britain's biggest foreign policy disaster since the Suez crisis of 1956, the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee has said. Tory MP Tom Tugendhat said the UK had ""abandoned the Afghan people"". The Taliban have reached the outskirts of the capital Kabul after taking almost every other major city. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee on Sunday afternoon. Parliament will be recalled on Wednesday for one day to discuss the situation in Afghanistan. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had shared his ""deep concerns about the future for Afghanistan"" with Pakistan's foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi. He said they agreed ""it is critical that the international community is united in telling the Taliban that the violence must end and human rights must be protected"". Asked to confirm if Mr Raab had been on holiday, the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said he was ""returning to the UK today, given the situation"". They said he was ""personally overseeing the FCDO response and engaging with international partners"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said,external: ""The government has been silent as Afghanistan collapses, which will have ramifications in the UK."" He said it was a ""very sad day"" and ""our thoughts are with the Afghan people"". The government's priority ""must be to evacuate British personnel and support staff"", he added. Follow live updates on Afghanistan Taliban enter outskirts of Afghan capital Kabul UK scholarships for Afghan students paused The British ambassador remains in Kabul, the FCDO said, but the UK has reduced its diplomatic presence. ""UK government staff continue to work to provide assistance to British nationals and to our Afghan staff,"" said a spokesperson. ""We are doing all we can to enable remaining British nationals, who want to leave Afghanistan, to do so."" Malala Yousafzai, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who found refuge in the UK after being shot in the head by Taliban militants in 2012, saidglobal and regional powers must call for an immediate ceasefire,external, provide humanitarian aid and protect refugees. ""We watch in complete shock as Taliban takes control of Afghanistan. I am deeply worried about women, minorities and human rights advocates,"" she said. Mr Tugendhat compared the Afghanistan withdrawal to the UK's failed invasion of Egypt in 1956, intended to regain control of the Suez canal, which is seen by many historians as marking the end of Britain's role as a major world power. Speaking ahead of Mr Raab's comments on Sunday, he also said: ""We haven't heard from the foreign secretary in about a week, despite this being the biggest single foreign policy disaster since Suez, so I don't know what the Foreign Office is thinking."" This video can not be played UK shadow foreign secretary says withdrawing troops was a ""catastrophic miscalculation"" He said the pull-out in Afghanistan showed a lack of ""strategic patience"", stripped the Afghan army of their logistics and air support and ""convinced them there was no tomorrow"". That emboldened Taliban militants, allowing them to sweep through many major cities, he suggested. The Foreign Office has advised more than 4,000 British citizens thought to be in Afghanistan to leave and on Thursday said it wouldsend 600 troops to help with the departure of Britons, Afghan staff and interpreters. After 20 years of war, foreign forces are pulling out of Afghanistan following a deal between the US and the Taliban militants they removed from power back in 2001. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions. The Taliban has pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West. But the country'shardline former rulers have quickly gained territoryin recent weeks from Afghan army soldiers, who are now being left to protect a fragile government. The Taliban also made a pledge for national peace talks, but many fear a worsening civil war remains a far more likely outcome. Read more about the origins of the conflict Mr Tugendhat, who served in Afghanistan before becoming an MP, said it was ""shameful"" of Nato not to evacuate all the Afghan people who served alongside British forces. Interpreters and guards, Afghans trained as special forces, people who set up schools for girls and helped NGOs are ""all at risk now"", he said. He said: ""The danger is that we're going to see every female MP murdered, we're going to see ministers strung up on streetlamps and this is the decision I'm afraid that has been taken."" But Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC ""there will be no revenge on anyone"". He said militants had been ordered to wait on the outskirts of Kabul for a peaceful transfer of power.

By Tony Bonsignore, BBC political correspondent Wednesday could be a very uncomfortable day for the government, as MPs return to the Commons to debate the UK's response to the deepening crisis in Afghanistan. The government will have to answer questions about why it so badly miscalculated the strength of the Taliban, and its decision to withdraw its forces in the face of impending disaster. In what will be an emotive debate, many MPs - including senior Conservatives like Tom Tugendhat - will stress the sacrifices already made over the past 20 years, and the obligation they believe this country owes to the people of Afghanistan. They are likely to push the government to do much more, in a bid to avert a humanitarian catastrophe, despite the claim by Defence Secretary Ben Wallace that it would be impossible for the UK to act alone. The Home Office said 3,300 Afghan staff who worked for the UK had already been resettled with their families. ""Home Office officials are right now working to protect British nationals and help former UK staff and other eligible people travel to the UK,"" a spokesperson said. But 35 Afghans due to start scholarships at UK universities within weeks have been told their places have beensuspended because their visas cannot be arranged in time. Naimatullah Zafary, who lives in Kabul, told the BBC: ""My daughter was asking me yesterday, are the Taliban coming and are they killing her? I said, no, they are not killing her. She is six-and-a-half years old, can you imagine?"" Chairman of the Commons Defence Committee, Tobias Ellwood, said the UK should have the courage to ""stand up and say 'this is the wrong call' and lead a coalition, or attempt to lead a coalition"" to address the crisis. ""This is a humiliating strategic defeat for the West that we will regret,"" he told the BBC. ""We have a very messy and unpredictable number of months and years ahead - unless we recognise what a gargantuan mistake it has been to withdraw our troops."" Families driven from their homes by the fighting have taken shelter in a public park Interpreters who worked for British forces protested on Friday, demanding protection from the Taliban But Defence Secretary Ben Wallace wrote in the Sunday Telegraph thatit was ""arrogant"" to think the UK could resolve the situation acting alone,external. He said he had approached other allies about taking the place of US forces, but none was willing to do so. ""A unilateral force would very quickly be viewed as an occupying force and, no matter how powerful the country that sends it, history shows us what happens to them in Afghanistan,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Tottenham 1-0 Manchester City: Nuno Espirito Santo 'very proud' of Spurs after opening win Tottenham made light of the absence of unsettled Harry Kane to start the Premier League season with a win over champions Manchester City and their Â£100m man Jack Grealish. Kane - heavily linked with a move to Manchester City - sat out this pulsating encounter but Pep Guardiola wasted no time in throwing in his British record signing from Aston Villa. It was Son Heung-min who gave new manager Nuno Espirito Santo the perfect start to his reign with a low shot that snaked beyond Manchester City keeper Ederson 10 minutes after the break. Spurs fully deserved their win as they survived a shaky opening phase to play with real purpose, already showing signs of the Nuno trademark with fierce defensive discipline allied to pace on the break. Grealish had a quiet debut, being shown a yellow card late on, and it was actually Spurs who had the best opportunity after Son's goal, only for Steven Bergwijn to shoot wide when clean through. City had fleeting opportunities but rarely tested Spurs keeper Hugo Lloris as they looked rusty in contrast to the sharpness of their opponents. Reaction to Tottenham's victory over Man City Harry Kane has been at Tottenham since he was a schoolboy Manchester City's pursuit of England captain Kane gave this game an added edge - so how the home fans enjoyed victory against the club attempting to snatch away their main marksman. And Spurs delivered exactly what their supporters, finally back inside their magnificent new stadium, wanted with this opening-weekend victory - the chance to taunt Manchester City and to remind Kane what he might be leaving behind. Late on, those fans sent a chant of 'are you watching, Harry Kane?' reverberating around the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. And it was Son, the man who has been Kane's partner in goals for so many years, who provided the flourish befitting this high-octane Spurs performance with a typical piece of skill and ingenuity to slide the winner low past Ederson. Spurs players - and manager - Nuno rightly took the acclaim at the final whistle. The home side had heroes everywhere in match-winner Son, the outstanding defender Japhet Tanganga and the tireless Lucas Moura. It remains to be seen how the Kane affair plays out but this will be the perfect psychological lift to Spurs that will sustain them until the saga comes to a close one way or the other. This video can not be played Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola says new signing Jack Grealish was 'excellent' Manchester City's race appeared run long before the end of this game, with the early spark of promise snuffed out by the endeavour and skill of Spurs. Grealish made some useful contributions early on but his day ended in the frustration of a yellow card and it is clear Guardiola, understandably, still has some work to do to integrate his talents into a squad already packed with creative ability. One look at the City bench hinted at what Guardiola can introduce in the weeks ahead, even if Kane does not make the move to Manchester. Kevin de Bruyne, Oleksandr Zinchenko and Gabriel Jesus were introduced in the final 20 minutes, while England's Euro 2020 pair Kyle Walker and John Stones were unused substitutes, as were Aymeric Laporte, Rodri and Bernardo Silva - a formidable array of talent. But nothing could save this over-complicated and listless City show with Benjamin Mendy showing yet again what a flawed figure he is at left-back while Nathan Ake was also uncomfortable. And, significantly, City's lack of punch, with the great Sergio Aguero now gone, may just have prompted Guardiola to look even further into the acquisition of Kane, especially as Chelsea, Liverpool and Manchester United have already given notice that there will be very little margin for error in the title race this season.

"Estimates suggest the Taliban has a core strength of 60,000 fighters The speed of the Taliban advance in Afghanistan appears to have taken many by surprise - regional capitals seem to be falling like dominoes. The momentum is clearly with the insurgents, while the Afghan government struggles to keep its grip on power. This week, one leaked US intelligence report estimated that Kabul could come under attack within weeks, and the government could collapse within 90 days. So how did it unravel so quickly? The US and its Nato allies - including the UK - have spent the best part of the last 20 years training and equipping the Afghan security forces. Countless American and British generals have claimed to have created a more powerful and capable Afghan army. Promises that today appear pretty empty. EXPLAINER:Why is there a war in Afghanistan? FEATURE:The displaced people hoping for safety ON THE GROUND:Taliban back brutal rule as they strike for power PROFILE:Who are the Taliban? The Afghan government should, in theory, still hold the upper hand with a larger force at its disposal. The Afghan security forces number more than 300,000, on paper at least. That includes the Afghan army, Air Force and police. The Afghan army has a troubled history of high casualties, desertions and corruption But in reality the country has always struggled to meet its recruitment targets. The Afghan army and police has a troubled history of high casualties, desertions and corruption - with some unscrupulous commanders claiming the salaries of troops who simply didn't exist - so called ""ghost soldiers"". In its latest report to the US Congress, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan (SIGAR) expressed ""serious concerns about the corrosive effects of corruption... and the questionable accuracy of data on the actual strength of the force"". Jack Watling, of the Royal United Services Institute, says even the Afghan army has never been sure of how many troops it actually has. Added to that, he says there have been problems with maintaining equipment and morale. Soldiers are often sent to areas where they have no tribal or family connections. One reason why some may have been so quick to abandon their posts without putting up a fight. This video can not be played The BBC speaks to two high profile figures in the Taliban chain of command who have very different messages The Taliban's strength is even harder to measure. According to the US Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, estimates suggest a core strength of 60,000 fighters. With the addition of other militia groups and supporters, that number could exceed 200,000. But Dr Mike Martin, a Pashto-speaking former British army officer who tracked the history of the conflict in Helmand in his book An Intimate War, warns of the dangers of defining the Taliban as a single monolithic group. Instead he says ""the Taliban is closer to a coalition of independent franchise holders loosely - and most probably temporarily - affiliated with one another"". He notes the Afghan government, too, is as riven by local factional motivations. Afghanistan's shape changing history illustrates how families, tribes and even government officials have switched sides - often to ensure their own survival. Again, the Afghan government should have the advantage in terms of both funding and weapons. It has received billions of dollars to pay for soldiers' salaries and equipment - mostly by the US. In its July 2021 report, SIGAR said more than $88bn (Â£64bn) had been spent on Afghanistan's security. But it ominously added: ""The question of whether that money was well spent will ultimately be answered by the outcome of the fighting on the ground."" Afghanistan's Air Force should provide it with a critical edge on the battlefield. But it has consistently struggled to maintain and crew its 211 aircraft (a problem that's becoming more acute with the Taliban deliberately targeting pilots). Nor is it able to meet the demands from commanders on the ground. Hence the involvement recently of the US Air Force over cities like Lashkar Gah, which have come under Taliban attack. It's still not clear for how much longer the US is willing to provide that support. Thousands of people are living in makeshift camps in Kabul after fleeing the Taliban offensive The Taliban have often relied on revenue from the drugs trade, but they have also had support from outside - most notably Pakistan. More recently the Taliban have seized weapons and equipment from the Afghan security forces - some of it provided by the US - including Humvees, night sights, machine guns, mortars and artillery. Afghanistan was already awash with weapons after the Soviet invasion, and the Taliban have shown that even the crudest can defeat a much more sophisticated force. Think of the deadly effect of the Improvised Explosive Device (IED) on US and British forces. That and local knowledge and an understanding of the terrain have been their advantage. Despite the disparate nature of the Taliban, some still see evidence of a co-ordinated plan in their recent advance. Ben Barry, a former British army brigadier and now a senior fellow at the Institute of Strategic Studies, acknowledges the Taliban gains may be opportunistic, but adds: ""If you were to write a campaign plan I would be hard pressed to come up with something better than this."" He points to the focus of the Taliban attacks in the north and west, not their traditional southern strongholds, with successive regional capitals falling into their hands. The Taliban have also captured key border crossings and checkpoints, funnelling off much needed customs revenue away from the cash-strapped government. They've also stepped up targeted killings of key officials, human rights activists, and journalists. Slowly but surely wiping out some of the small gains made over the last 20 years. As for the Afghan government's strategy - that's proving harder to define. Promises of taking back all the territory captured by the Taliban sound increasingly hollow. Mr Barry says there appears to be a plan to keep hold of the larger cities. Afghan commandos have already been deployed to prevent Lashkar Gah in Helmand from falling. But for how much longer? Afghan special forces are relatively small in number, around 10,000 strong, and they're already stretched. The Taliban also appear to be winning the propaganda war and the battle of the narrative. Mr Barry says their momentum on the battlefield has boosted morale and given them a sense of unity. In contrast, the Afghan government has been on the backfoot, bickering and sacking generals. The situation certainly looks bleak for the Afghan government. But Jack Watling of RUSI says that while it looks increasingly pessimistic for the Afghan military, ""the situation could still be saved by politics"". If the government can win over tribal leaders, he says, there is still the chance of a stalemate. This is a view echoed by Mike Martin, who points to the return of former warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum to Mazar-i-Sharif as a significant moment. He's already cutting deals. The summer fighting season will soon be over as the Afghan winter sets in - making manoeuvre more difficult for forces on the ground. It is still possible that there'll be a stalemate by the end of the year, and the Afghan government will cling on to Kabul and a string of larger cities. The tide could even turn if the Taliban fracture. But at present it appears that the US and Nato's efforts to bring peace, security and stability to Afghanistan have been as futile as the Soviets before them.

"If you like neat lines, tidiness and admire symmetry, what's not to like about the decision of Joe Biden to pull American combat troops out of Afghanistan by 11 September 2021 - exactly 20 years on from 9/11? In modern day America it often feels that all roads lead back to 9/11; the single most defining - and scarring - event since Pearl Harbor: the surprise attack by the Japanese on America's Pacific fleet, which would ultimately bring America into World War Two. And so it was that 9/11 led to this country's longest military encounter. The attack on the Twin Towers, the plane that flew into the Pentagon, and the one that crashed into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, were initially the spur for a surge of US nationalism. Young people - in fact people of all ages - were going along to armed forces recruitment offices wanting to sign up. America had come under attack; these patriots wanted to fight to defend the country the ""land of the free"", and seek revenge on those who would do the US harm. And don't mistake this for some kind of kneejerk jingoism. It wasn't that. I knew many people - not just Americans - who were of a liberal bent and had been no great fans of all the doings of the US of A but who have a visceral sense this was a moment where you had to pick your team. Were you on the side of the rule of law, free and fair elections, due process, sexual equality, universal education? Or were you on the side of those who would fly planes into buildings, or would stone people to death, or throw homosexuals off of buildings, or deny girls schooling? If that seems a massive over-simplification, maybe it is - but in the devastating aftermath of 9/11, that is how it seemed to many. Biden makes a surprise visit to Afghanistan as vice-president in 2011 But by 2016 it was one of the factors that led to Donald Trump's election: the weariness of the ""endless wars"" as candidate Trump would refer to the quagmires of Afghanistan and Iraq; the wariness of America being able to act as the world's policeman. Americans understandably wanted to pull up the drawbridge, bring the troops home, leave it to the people in those countries to sort out their own problems, and finally give up on the idea that a US model of liberal democracy was an exportable commodity that could be imposed. The liberal interventionist crusade was over. Trump, if he had won last November, would have pulled out US troops, probably quicker. Although Joe Biden inherited Trump's promise to withdraw, in policy terms the easiest thing would have been to continue to sign the cheques to pay for American servicemen and women to stay in Afghanistan for another year. And then another. And another after that. Why the Taliban is gaining ground so quickly Fleeing the Taliban, to sleep on city streets The political pressure was by no means overwhelming. If anything, the reverse. The defence top brass, the foreign policy establishment, America's allies abroad thought anything other than the status quo would be reckless. But one question was gnawing at the new president, and it was the one posed by Hillel the Elder back in biblical times: ""If not now, then when?"" Biden - who advised President Barack Obama not to send more troops in 2009 but lost the argument - went with now, in what could be the most consequential single decision of his presidency. This video can not be played Taliban leaders speak to BBC News about conquer and compromise When 9/11 happened I was the BBC's Paris correspondent, reporting on Eurotunnel's attempt to force the closure of a Red Cross refugee centre called Sangatte  - where many of the world's storm-tossed refugees and migrants congregated before making the final leg of the journey to the UK. I was driving to Calais when I got a call from a colleague telling me to stop at the nearest service station to watch TV, and see what was unfolding. We didn't know what would happen next - or where we would end up. One year into the optimism of a new millennium, there was a narrative and it wasn't a happy one - the war on terror, a clash of civilisations, call it what you will. At the time the two stories could not have been more different, but a lot of the bedraggled people we met on the roads around Calais were from Afghanistan fleeing Taliban rule. It's worth remembering why the US, UK and others went into Afghanistan. The Taliban had - in effect - become a finishing school for Islamist terrorists wanting to wage jihad against the west. Al-Qaeda wannabes were going into the country to train for holy war. The 9/11 terrorists had honed their skills and hatched their plot there. Removing the Taliban and tackling al-Qaeda became critical for global security. Within a few weeks of 9/11, I was in northern Afghanistan, travelling via Delhi and then Dushanbe in Tajikistan to get there. We were moving with the US and UK-backed Northern Alliance troops as they pushed the Taliban out. Ousting the Taliban was considered a global priority 20 years ago, writes the author (right) Our first day was spent travelling from Khoja Bahauddin, then the Northern Alliance HQ along a road where the Taliban had killed a number of journalists in an ambush two days earlier. After one night we ended up in a town called Taleqan. It had fallen the night before we arrived. One of the iconic shots was of a girls-school classroom that had become a weapons dump for Taliban rockets that in their hasty retreat they had left behind. The stubborn last stronghold was Kunduz - a vital communication corridor sitting between Kabul, Mazar-i-Sharif and then further north to the border with Uzbekistan. Now both Taleqan and Kunduz have come back under Taliban control, with a third of the country's regional capitals now under their control. And that raises a super-uncomfortable question for Joe Biden and his ""if not now, then when"" policy. Twenty years on and so many lives lost, and so many billions of dollars spent, what was it for? What's been achieved? What do you say to the families of all those servicemen killed by the Taliban now that the US is giving up? What's to stop terror groups from re-establishing their jihad training camps? At the UN Security Council hearing last Friday it was reported that up to 20 different terror groups, involving thousands of foreign fighters were already fighting with Taliban forces. The regions where Jon travelled are now back under Taliban control I'm sure as I am writing this more families will be packing up their possessions fearful of what Taliban control will mean, perhaps heading to Calais and then the UK. Will the girls' schools return to become weapons storage facilities again? The scars of 9/11 are clear everywhere - thousands of servicemen have come back with prosthetic limbs and disturbed minds. Suicide rates have been rising. Families have lost loved ones. On America's streets are men with red plastic beer cups begging for loose change, many of them with signs saying they are veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan. US-led forces toppled the Taliban:In 2001 US-led forces overthrew Afghanistan's Taliban rulers after the 9/11 attacks masterminded by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, who was based there. Twenty years of occupation and military operations followed:The US and allies oversaw elections and built up Afghan security forces, but the Taliban continued to launch attacks. Eventually the US made a deal with the Taliban:They would pull out if the militants agreed not to host terrorist groups. But talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government failed. US-led forces withdrew this year and the Taliban have now retaken most of the country. The desire to stay at home and shut yourself away from a troubling world is completely understandable. There is no surprise that ""America First"" as a slogan had such resonance. George W Bush was not advocating that back in 2001 - but there were no US troops in Afghanistan or Iraq then. And that didn't keep America safe when early that morning, across those gin-clear blue skies passenger aeroplanes were hijacked and became al-Qaeda-guided missiles, flying into their targets killing thousands of people doing nothing more provocative than going about their daily lives. There's also a difference between enforcing your will as the world's policeman, and being a peacekeeper. Thousands of American troops are still stationed in South Korea - even though the Korean war was 70 years ago. The calculation of successive US presidents has been that a tense peace is better than a hot war or a destabilised region. Joe Biden was hoping his decision would result in headlines like ""Afghan War Ends"" or ""America's longest war is over"". But 20 years on, and the Taliban now re-establishing control with all that could flow from that, might historians in future judge that the 20th anniversary marked the start of the second Afghan war?

Thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of the latest developments:  You can follow the latesthere  This video can not be played Afghanistan: Child handed over Kabul airport wall as chaos continues American soldiers stand guard as Afghan people wait to board a US military aircraft to leave Afghanistan Armed US fighter jets are making passes over Kabul and the international airport as it attempts secure the evacuation of American citizens and allies from Afghanistan, the Pentagon has said. The warplanes are not making âlow passesâ, said Pentagon press secretary, John F Kirby, but only providing âoverwatchâ. âWe will use all of the tools in our arsenal to achieve the goalâ of protecting Americans, Kirby said. Some 7,000 Americans and other evacuees, including Afghan allies, have been airlifted out of the airport since Sunday.. Most Americans doubt the war in Afghanistan was worthwhile, a recent poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found. Roughly two-thirds said they did not think the two-decade war was worth fighting, as the US conducts its hasty exit. And the war has divided Americans on President Joe Biden's handling of foreign policy, with 47% of those polled saying they approve of Biden's management of international affairs. The poll was conducted on 12-16 August, amid the Taliban's capture of Kabul. Biden, who prides himself on his foreign policy experience, has stood by the US exit, saying in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday that he would not acknowledge any mistakes. The Taliban is yet
to announce how it will lead Afghanistan, but a senior leader has given some
hints, according to Tolo News. Wahidullah Hashemi said a council might be formed,externalto govern the country under the authority of the Talibanâs top leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Afghan news site reports. âDiscussions havenât been conducted
on what it will be like - perhaps we will establish a council,â he says. Mullah Hibatullah
Akhundzada has led the Taliban since May 2016 and is in charge of its political, military and religious affairs. Another figure considered a
possible contender for Afghanistan's new leader is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. He co-founded the Taliban in
Afghanistan in 1994 and has been at the heart of political negotiations with the US in recent
years, heading the groupâs political office in Qatar. You can read more on the Taliban leadership here. The first Italian evacuation flight out of Kabul landed in Rome on Wednesday An Italian diplomat has spoken about the challenging conditions in which rescue operations are taking place at Kabul airport. ""We've unfortunately had to witness dramatic scenes but we have managed in conditions of absolute emergency to bring home our compatriots and some of our Afghan colleagues,"" Tommaso Claudi,told Ansa news agency,external. The first Italian evacuation flight carrying 86 people landed in Rome on Wednesday. Later two C130 planes carrying a total of 200 people lifted off from Kabul in the afternoon and evening, Italy's defence ministry said. Claudi remained in Kabul to manage the return operations on site. ""In Afghanistan we are witnessing a great humanitarian tragedy and we are all doing our utmost,"" he said. Italy's minister of defence thanked the ""more than 1,500 Italian soldiers who are carrying out, non-stop, an extraordinary job to ensure the transport of Afghan collaborators and their families"". Taliban militants have shot dead a relative of a journalist they were hunting and seriously injured another. The militants were carrying out a house-to-house search in the western city of Herat to try to find the journalist from Deutsche Welle, who now works in Germany. Other relatives managed to escape and are now on the run. ""The killing of a close relative of one of our editors by the Taliban in Herat yesterday is inconceivably tragic, and testifies to the acute danger in which all our employees and their families in Afghanistan find themselves,"" DW's director general, Peter Limbourg said. It is evident that the Taliban are already carrying out organised searches for journalists, both in Kabul and in the provinces. We are running out of time!"" The Taliban have raided the homes of at least three DW journalists in recent weeks. The news of the killing comes as a UN document said the Taliban are intensifying their hunt for people who worked for and collaborated with Nato and US forces. Reality Check The UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace claimed this morning that Labour
Leader Keir Starmer had supported the deal between the US and the Taliban last
year. The deal â secured by Donald Trump and signed in Doha, Qatar in
February 2020 â committed to the withdrawal of US and allied (including
British) troops from Afghanistan by May 2021. After his election, US President Joe Biden continued the plan
for withdrawal but with an end date of 31 August. At the time, Mr Wallace praised Mr Trumpâs deal as a âsmall but
important step towards the chance for Afghans to live in peace, free from
terrorism"". But in the past week, Mr Wallace has described the deal as
ârottenâ. He has said that just after the deal he publicly expressed that it was a
âmistakeâ, but we have yet to find a reference to this in either Parliamentary
records or news cuttings from the time.

Vikas PandeyBBC News, Delhi The Taliban's blisteringly fast takeover of Afghanistan has stunned security and diplomacy experts worldwide. Days after the fall of Kabul, nations are hurriedly evacuating their diplomats and citizens, leaving behind two decades of work and investments. The Taliban's rout is likely to cause a significant shift in the geopolitics of South Asia, and it could be particularly testing for India, given the country's historically tense relations and borderdisputes with Pakistan and China- both are expected to play a crucial role in Afghanistan's future. Pakistan shares a porous border with Afghanistan and has long been an active player in its northern neighbour's affairs. Now China is showing an interest in playing a bigger role in Afghanistan. Foreign minister Wang Yi's meeting with senior Taliban leaders last month shows Beijing doesn't want to be a silent player anymore. This potential geopolitical realignment could ""change things upside down"", said Gautam Mukhopadhaya, India's former ambassador to Afghanistan and Syria. Read more from Vikas Many in India and Pakistan see the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan as Islamabad's win over India. But experts say that is too simplistic a view and Pakistan's hold over the Taliban has been exaggerated. Former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra told the BBC's Vikas Pandey that the Taliban did not recognise the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""Making the Taliban respect the border will be a top priority for Islamabad,"" he says. But there is no doubt that Pakistan now has better strategic reach in Afghanistan over India but they also have bigger issues to solve. And one of them is to ensure that the Tehrik-i-Taliban - the group responsible for launching attacks in Pakistan - do not get support from the Taliban in Afghanistan. Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Wilson Center think-tank in Washington, says Pakistan shares a long and porous border with Afghanistan and that can cause all kinds of issues. The Taliban has released several known militants from jails and some of them could reenter Pakistan. ""So India is not likely to be the main factor for Pakistan at the moment,"" says Kugelman. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 The former head of the US military has questioned President Biden's decision to withdraw American troops in the middle of Afghanistan's ""fighting season"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Admiral Mike Mullen also criticised Biden's failure to consult with US allies before withdrawing troops. ""We have had a real struggle here with respect to our relationships"" he said. ""I certainly understand how they would be both disappointed and raising questions about who we are and what we stand for"". Admiral Mullen, who oversaw the surge of US troops into Afghanistan under President Obama, noted that the US mission had some successes, including tackling the threat posed by al-Qaeda training camps, but accepted major mistakes had been made over the past 20 years. ""We got it wrong on the nation building side"" he said. ""We got it wrong with respect to the level of corruption under Karzaiâs government and Ghaniâs government, in the police and in the military and all the way up the chain and I think in great part that was the undoing of the mission.""

The Liberal leader is seeking a third term as prime minister in an autumn federal election. Canada now has massive transport aircraft on the ground in Kabul, Trudeau said, and has forces working with Afghans to get them out of the country. âThe limit, however, is not on Canadian capacity or Canadian airlifts; the limit on getting people out is the fact that the Taliban continue to block access for Afghans,â he said.

The BBC fact-checked some of his claims, comparing them with his earlier statements on Afghanistan and the situation on the ground.

Its branch in Yemen â Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula â once considered the most dangerous, has praised the Taliban as ""an honourable and loyal group"". This may not be what the Taliban leadership wants to hear publicly as they have promised to cut their ties to the proscribed terrorist organisation that used Afghanistan to plan the 9/11 attacks 20 years ago. There are currently estimated to be several hundred al-Qaeda militants in the country, some of whom have been reportedly sighted amidst the Talibanâs ranks. A recent UN report stated there were still strong ethnic and marital ties between the two groups. Without a Western military presence in Afghanistan, or a cooperative local intelligence service, it will now be much harder to identify and intercept al-Qaedaâs activities, especially in remote, rugged areas like Kunar province. Elsewhere in the world, al-Qaedaâs affiliates in East and West Africa have been steadily recruiting.

Ned Price said the US is trying to process enough people as they possibly can Ned Price, spokesman for the US Department of State, is currently giving an update on the situation in Afghanistan. He said that the US is continuing to deploy additional consular officers to help evacuate people, including sending teams to Qatar and Kuwait.

Some 20 flights are set to leave on Thursday evening.

The warplanes are not making âlow passesâ, said Pentagon press secretary, John F Kirby, but only providing âoverwatchâ. âWe will use all of the tools in our arsenal to achieve the goalâ of protecting Americans, Kirby said. Some 7,000 Americans and other evacuees, including Afghan allies, have been airlifted out of the airport since Sunday.. Most Americans doubt the war in Afghanistan was worthwhile, a recent poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found. Roughly two-thirds said they did not think the two-decade war was worth fighting, as the US conducts its hasty exit. And the war has divided Americans on President Joe Biden's handling of foreign policy, with 47% of those polled saying they approve of Biden's management of international affairs. The poll was conducted on 12-16 August, amid the Taliban's capture of Kabul. Biden, who prides himself on his foreign policy experience, has stood by the US exit, saying in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday that he would not acknowledge any mistakes. The Taliban is yet
to announce how it will lead Afghanistan, but a senior leader has given some
hints, according to Tolo News. Wahidullah Hashemi said a council might be formed,externalto govern the country under the authority of the Talibanâs top leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Afghan news site reports. âDiscussions havenât been conducted
on what it will be like - perhaps we will establish a council,â he says. Mullah Hibatullah
Akhundzada has led the Taliban since May 2016 and is in charge of its political, military and religious affairs. Another figure considered a
possible contender for Afghanistan's new leader is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. He co-founded the Taliban in
Afghanistan in 1994 and has been at the heart of political negotiations with the US in recent
years, heading the groupâs political office in Qatar. You can read more on the Taliban leadership here. The first Italian evacuation flight out of Kabul landed in Rome on Wednesday An Italian diplomat has spoken about the challenging conditions in which rescue operations are taking place at Kabul airport.

The first Italian evacuation flight carrying 86 people landed in Rome on Wednesday. Later two C130 planes carrying a total of 200 people lifted off from Kabul in the afternoon and evening, Italy's defence ministry said. Claudi remained in Kabul to manage the return operations on site. ""In Afghanistan we are witnessing a great humanitarian tragedy and we are all doing our utmost,"" he said. Italy's minister of defence thanked the ""more than 1,500 Italian soldiers who are carrying out, non-stop, an extraordinary job to ensure the transport of Afghan collaborators and their families"". Taliban militants have shot dead a relative of a journalist they were hunting and seriously injured another. The militants were carrying out a house-to-house search in the western city of Herat to try to find the journalist from Deutsche Welle, who now works in Germany. Other relatives managed to escape and are now on the run. ""The killing of a close relative of one of our editors by the Taliban in Herat yesterday is inconceivably tragic, and testifies to the acute danger in which all our employees and their families in Afghanistan find themselves,"" DW's director general, Peter Limbourg said. It is evident that the Taliban are already carrying out organised searches for journalists, both in Kabul and in the provinces. We are running out of time!"" The Taliban have raided the homes of at least three DW journalists in recent weeks. The news of the killing comes as a UN document said the Taliban are intensifying their hunt for people who worked for and collaborated with Nato and US forces. Reality Check The UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace claimed this morning that Labour
Leader Keir Starmer had supported the deal between the US and the Taliban last
year. The deal â secured by Donald Trump and signed in Doha, Qatar in
February 2020 â committed to the withdrawal of US and allied (including
British) troops from Afghanistan by May 2021. After his election, US President Joe Biden continued the plan
for withdrawal but with an end date of 31 August. At the time, Mr Wallace praised Mr Trumpâs deal as a âsmall but
important step towards the chance for Afghans to live in peace, free from
terrorism"". But in the past week, Mr Wallace has described the deal as
ârottenâ. He has said that just after the deal he publicly expressed that it was a
âmistakeâ, but we have yet to find a reference to this in either Parliamentary
records or news cuttings from the time. Ben Wallace, the UK's defence secretary, initially said Donald Trump's deal with the Taliban was ""rotten"" Mr Wallace said today: âI never heard from a single Labour MP when that deal was done, 18 months agoâ¦ one single criticism. In fact, Keir Starmer supported it, as did all other parties in the House of Commons.â We have found no evidence that Mr Starmer publicly supported last yearâs deal in the period after it was announced. But it should be noted he was not Labour leader then, and nor was there any debate in the Commons over the terms of the deal.

"Liverpool are unbeaten in their last 15 Premier League matches against Norwich Mohamed Salah scored one and provided two assists as Liverpool got their Premier League title bid off to a winning start with a comfortable victory at newly promoted Norwich City. Salah got his side's third to become the first player to score on the opening weekend in five consecutive Premier League campaigns and cap a fine display after earlier setting up Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino. The Reds were boosted before kick off by the return of talismanic defender Virgil van Dijk after 10 months out through injury and their day got even better when they took the lead midway through the first half. Trent Alexander-Arnold found Salah inside the box and the Egypt forward's touch fell into the path of Jota for the Portugal forward to finish clinically. Van Dijk relief at return after ""mentally tough"" 10 months out It was a little harsh on Norwich, who had made a spirited start to the game as they were roared on by a buoyant home crowd making the most of their return to Carrow Road and the top flight. Teemu Pukki, who scored 11 goals in the Premier League two seasons ago, drew an early save out of Alisson after getting in behind the visitors' defence. But once Liverpool went in front they rarely looked in danger of letting their lead slip as Norwich struggled to rediscover their early rhythm. Max Aarons cleared a goal-bound effort from Sadio Mane six minutes after the break but a second goal duly arrived shortly after the hour mark when substitute Firmino struck. The Brazil forward had only been on the pitch for four minutes when he tapped in from close range after unselfish work from Salah, who opted to pass to his team-mate when he had the chance to shoot from a tighter angle. Salah then wrapped up the perfect opening day for the Reds when he collected the ball after a corner had only been half cleared and curled a fine strike into the back of the net. Reaction to Liverpool's win at Norwich in the Premier League This video can not be played Norwich 0-3 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp delighted to have football back Liverpool finished third in the Premier League last season, 17 points behind champions Manchester City after their campaign was derailed by a shocking slump as they struggled to cope with their defensive injuries. But the signs are good that they will be well stocked in that area this campaign. Van Dijk made his first league appearance since October last year and he was joined in the centre of defence by Joel Matip, who is back after seven months out. Joe Gomez, who was also missing for most of the second part of last season, and new signing Ibrahima Konate were on the bench at Norwich as suddenly Liverpool appear well stocked in an area that looked threadbare in the last campaign. There were elements of rustiness to the play from Van Dijk and Matip, particularly early on as Norwich got in behind the visitors' defence on a couple of occasions. But they grew into the game and by the second half were repelling the Canaries' attacks comfortably - although they did require a brilliant close-range stop from Alisson at the end to secure a clean sheet. Bigger tests will come for the Reds this season but with the defence now having depth to it and three of their four attacking players scoring against Norwich, they look in good shape to make a more extended run at the title this term. This video can not be played Norwich City 0-3 Liverpool: Daniel Farke praises Norwich despite 'tricky' Liverpool game Norwich are back in the Premier League after one season in the Championship, which they comfortably won to return to the top flight. Their last stint at this level saw them finish bottom of the table and be relegated with just 21 points, their season characterised by spells of good play in the majority of their games only to fail to capitalise on those. Making the most of their return to Carrow Road and the Premier League, Norwich fans were in buoyant mood before kick off and those good vibes continued as the home side made a bright start. They were the better side for the opening 25 minutes, attacking with pace and a directness that unsettled the returning Liverpool defence. But it soon became an all-too-familiar story as, despite their good play, they were unable to take advantage before their opponents went ahead. From then on they were second best, improving slightly towards the end as Alisson denied Ben Gibson a consolation. An opening-day defeat against Liverpool is not going to be a result that defines their season and historically they have struggled against the Reds, who have now won 13 of their last 15 encounters. But with reigning champions Manchester City up next followed by games against Leicester City and Arsenal it is a reminder of just how tough life in the Premier League is.

"An intelligence briefing for the UN says the Taliban are stepping up the search for ""collaborators"" More anti-Taliban protests have taken place in several cities At least 12 people have been killed at Kabul airport since Sunday, a Taliban official says Western countries continue evacuating nationals and Afghans who worked for them Asked in an ABC TV interview if he made any mistakes with the Afghan exit, US President Biden says: ""No"" The IMF says that Afghanistan will no longer have access to its funds Edited by Toby Luckhurst We're pausing our live page coverage of developments in Afghanistan. Thanks for joining us. Here's a round-up of the latest developments:  You can follow the latesthere  This video can not be played Afghanistan: Child handed over Kabul airport wall as chaos continues American soldiers stand guard as Afghan people wait to board a US military aircraft to leave Afghanistan Armed US fighter jets are making passes over Kabul and the international airport as it attempts secure the evacuation of American citizens and allies from Afghanistan, the Pentagon has said. The warplanes are not making âlow passesâ, said Pentagon press secretary, John F Kirby, but only providing âoverwatchâ. âWe will use all of the tools in our arsenal to achieve the goalâ of protecting Americans, Kirby said. Some 7,000 Americans and other evacuees, including Afghan allies, have been airlifted out of the airport since Sunday.. Most Americans doubt the war in Afghanistan was worthwhile, a recent poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research has found. Roughly two-thirds said they did not think the two-decade war was worth fighting, as the US conducts its hasty exit. And the war has divided Americans on President Joe Biden's handling of foreign policy, with 47% of those polled saying they approve of Biden's management of international affairs. The poll was conducted on 12-16 August, amid the Taliban's capture of Kabul. Biden, who prides himself on his foreign policy experience, has stood by the US exit, saying in an interview with ABC News on Wednesday that he would not acknowledge any mistakes. The Taliban is yet
to announce how it will lead Afghanistan, but a senior leader has given some
hints, according to Tolo News. Wahidullah Hashemi said a council might be formed,externalto govern the country under the authority of the Talibanâs top leader Mullah Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Afghan news site reports. âDiscussions havenât been conducted
on what it will be like - perhaps we will establish a council,â he says. Mullah Hibatullah
Akhundzada has led the Taliban since May 2016 and is in charge of its political, military and religious affairs. Another figure considered a
possible contender for Afghanistan's new leader is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. He co-founded the Taliban in
Afghanistan in 1994 and has been at the heart of political negotiations with the US in recent
years, heading the groupâs political office in Qatar. You can read more on the Taliban leadership here. The first Italian evacuation flight out of Kabul landed in Rome on Wednesday An Italian diplomat has spoken about the challenging conditions in which rescue operations are taking place at Kabul airport. ""We've unfortunately had to witness dramatic scenes but we have managed in conditions of absolute emergency to bring home our compatriots and some of our Afghan colleagues,"" Tommaso Claudi,told Ansa news agency,external. The first Italian evacuation flight carrying 86 people landed in Rome on Wednesday. Later two C130 planes carrying a total of 200 people lifted off from Kabul in the afternoon and evening, Italy's defence ministry said. Claudi remained in Kabul to manage the return operations on site. ""In Afghanistan we are witnessing a great humanitarian tragedy and we are all doing our utmost,"" he said. Italy's minister of defence thanked the ""more than 1,500 Italian soldiers who are carrying out, non-stop, an extraordinary job to ensure the transport of Afghan collaborators and their families"". Taliban militants have shot dead a relative of a journalist they were hunting and seriously injured another. The militants were carrying out a house-to-house search in the western city of Herat to try to find the journalist from Deutsche Welle, who now works in Germany. Other relatives managed to escape and are now on the run. ""The killing of a close relative of one of our editors by the Taliban in Herat yesterday is inconceivably tragic, and testifies to the acute danger in which all our employees and their families in Afghanistan find themselves,"" DW's director general, Peter Limbourg said. It is evident that the Taliban are already carrying out organised searches for journalists, both in Kabul and in the provinces. We are running out of time!"" The Taliban have raided the homes of at least three DW journalists in recent weeks. The news of the killing comes as a UN document said the Taliban are intensifying their hunt for people who worked for and collaborated with Nato and US forces. Reality Check The UK's Defence Secretary Ben Wallace claimed this morning that Labour
Leader Keir Starmer had supported the deal between the US and the Taliban last
year. The deal â secured by Donald Trump and signed in Doha, Qatar in
February 2020 â committed to the withdrawal of US and allied (including
British) troops from Afghanistan by May 2021. After his election, US President Joe Biden continued the plan
for withdrawal but with an end date of 31 August. At the time, Mr Wallace praised Mr Trumpâs deal as a âsmall but
important step towards the chance for Afghans to live in peace, free from
terrorism"". But in the past week, Mr Wallace has described the deal as
ârottenâ. He has said that just after the deal he publicly expressed that it was a
âmistakeâ, but we have yet to find a reference to this in either Parliamentary
records or news cuttings from the time. Ben Wallace, the UK's defence secretary, initially said Donald Trump's deal with the Taliban was ""rotten"" Mr Wallace said today: âI never heard from a single Labour MP when that deal was done, 18 months agoâ¦ one single criticism. In fact, Keir Starmer supported it, as did all other parties in the House of Commons.â We have found no evidence that Mr Starmer publicly supported last yearâs deal in the period after it was announced. But it should be noted he was not Labour leader then, and nor was there any debate in the Commons over the terms of the deal. In yesterdayâs debate Mr Starmer focused on the lack of planning for the withdrawal rather than saying he had opposed it and said: âNobody believes that Britain and our allies could have remained in Afghanistan indefinitely, or that Britain could have fought alone.â Mr Wallace also said this morning that he had âfelt uncomfortableâ about the Doha deal and âmade representations to the US and others at the timeâ. The mother of a soldier killed while serving in Afghanistan has insisted British troops did make a positive difference in the war-torn country. Royal Marine Jason Mackie, who lived in Oxford, died in an explosion in Helmand province in 2009. Marine Mackie's mother said the US-led intervention in the country had provided Afghans with respite from an oppressive regime. ""There was a certain amount of normality, women's rights and education was progressing"" she said. In recent days some veterans and relatives of deceased soldiers have question whether the return of the Taliban to the countrymeant 457 British soldiers had died in vain. Read more here. Vikas PandeyBBC News, Delhi The Taliban's blisteringly fast takeover of Afghanistan has stunned security and diplomacy experts worldwide. Days after the fall of Kabul, nations are hurriedly evacuating their diplomats and citizens, leaving behind two decades of work and investments. The Taliban's rout is likely to cause a significant shift in the geopolitics of South Asia, and it could be particularly testing for India, given the country's historically tense relations and borderdisputes with Pakistan and China- both are expected to play a crucial role in Afghanistan's future. Pakistan shares a porous border with Afghanistan and has long been an active player in its northern neighbour's affairs. Now China is showing an interest in playing a bigger role in Afghanistan. Foreign minister Wang Yi's meeting with senior Taliban leaders last month shows Beijing doesn't want to be a silent player anymore. This potential geopolitical realignment could ""change things upside down"", said Gautam Mukhopadhaya, India's former ambassador to Afghanistan and Syria. Read more from Vikas Many in India and Pakistan see the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan as Islamabad's win over India. But experts say that is too simplistic a view and Pakistan's hold over the Taliban has been exaggerated. Former Indian diplomat Jitendra Nath Misra told the BBC's Vikas Pandey that the Taliban did not recognise the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. ""Making the Taliban respect the border will be a top priority for Islamabad,"" he says. But there is no doubt that Pakistan now has better strategic reach in Afghanistan over India but they also have bigger issues to solve. And one of them is to ensure that the Tehrik-i-Taliban - the group responsible for launching attacks in Pakistan - do not get support from the Taliban in Afghanistan. Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Wilson Center think-tank in Washington, says Pakistan shares a long and porous border with Afghanistan and that can cause all kinds of issues. The Taliban has released several known militants from jails and some of them could reenter Pakistan. ""So India is not likely to be the main factor for Pakistan at the moment,"" says Kugelman. Today ProgrammeBBC Radio 4 The former head of the US military has questioned President Biden's decision to withdraw American troops in the middle of Afghanistan's ""fighting season"". Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Admiral Mike Mullen also criticised Biden's failure to consult with US allies before withdrawing troops. ""We have had a real struggle here with respect to our relationships"" he said. ""I certainly understand how they would be both disappointed and raising questions about who we are and what we stand for"". Admiral Mullen, who oversaw the surge of US troops into Afghanistan under President Obama, noted that the US mission had some successes, including tackling the threat posed by al-Qaeda training camps, but accepted major mistakes had been made over the past 20 years. ""We got it wrong on the nation building side"" he said. ""We got it wrong with respect to the level of corruption under Karzaiâs government and Ghaniâs government, in the police and in the military and all the way up the chain and I think in great part that was the undoing of the mission.""

The Liberal leader is seeking a third term as prime minister in an autumn federal election. Canada now has massive transport aircraft on the ground in Kabul, Trudeau said, and has forces working with Afghans to get them out of the country. âThe limit, however, is not on Canadian capacity or Canadian airlifts; the limit on getting people out is the fact that the Taliban continue to block access for Afghans,â he said. This satellite image shows the traffic jams in Kabul as thousands of citizens and foreign nationals attempt to get to the airport - the last route out of Afghanistan for many. Scenes at the airport have become increasingly desperate with footage showing children being passed over walls to foreign soldiers and people trying to climb over barbed wire into the airport compound. Heavily-armed Taliban fighters now ring the airport's perimeter fence, and there are reports of shots being fired and injuries. One journalist reported seeing Taliban fighters also use sticks and rope to lash civilians. You can read more about the perilous journey to Kabul's airport here.  The government in Uganda says it is yet to decide whether it will take in 2,000 Afghan refugees, local media there is reporting. It comes after reports that the country would temporarily host them after a request made by the US. ""No decision has been made, whether they will come or not. It's a suggestion,  a proposal, discussions are going on... no substantive decision has been made,"" Daily Monitor reported Gen Jeje Odongo, from the foreign affairs committee, as saying on Thursday. He said that Uganda had been approached because it had a reputation internationally of helping people in distress. Uganda has a long history of welcoming refugees, and is currently home to around 1.3 million people. The East African nation has the largest number of refugees in any country in Africa - and the third largest in the world. President Joe Biden on Wednesday made a series of assertions about US policy in Afghanistan and the reasons behind his decision to withdraw forces from the country. But are they true? The BBC fact-checked some of his claims, comparing them with his earlier statements on Afghanistan and the situation on the ground. ""We trained and equipped an Afghan military force of some 300,000 strong"" This figure is contested, and considered by many experts to be a substantial overestimate. A recent investigation by BBC Newsnight has uncovered evidence suggesting thatthe size of the army could be low as 50,000- much lower even than the estimates of the US Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. ""Are we gonna continue to lose thousands of Americans to injury and death to try to unite that country?"" Overall, since US forces invaded Afghanistan in October 2001, a total of1,897 US military personnel were killed in action in Afghanistan,externaland another 415 died from non-hostile causes, according to the US official monitoring body. From a peak at the height of the conflict a decade ago, the number of US casualties in Afghanistan has fallen in recent years. The last American combat deaths in Afghanistan were in February 2020.

Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent A recent UN report said there were still strong ethnic and marital ties between the Taliban and al-Qaeda Al-Qaeda has been relatively quiet these last few years but it hasnât gone away and now it is celebrating the return of the Taliban to power as a historic event and the start of forthcoming victories. Its branch in Yemen â Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula â once considered the most dangerous, has praised the Taliban as ""an honourable and loyal group"". This may not be what the Taliban leadership wants to hear publicly as they have promised to cut their ties to the proscribed terrorist organisation that used Afghanistan to plan the 9/11 attacks 20 years ago. There are currently estimated to be several hundred al-Qaeda militants in the country, some of whom have been reportedly sighted amidst the Talibanâs ranks. A recent UN report stated there were still strong ethnic and marital ties between the two groups. Without a Western military presence in Afghanistan, or a cooperative local intelligence service, it will now be much harder to identify and intercept al-Qaedaâs activities, especially in remote, rugged areas like Kunar province. Elsewhere in the world, al-Qaedaâs affiliates in East and West Africa have been steadily recruiting. They will have had a significant morale boost from what al-Qaeda sees as a humiliating defeat for the West. Read Frank Gardner's piece on foreign fighters in Afghanistan here BBC OS The BBC spoke with two interpreters who are still in the country Two interpreters who are still stuck in Afghanistan have explained how they fear for their lives under Taliban rule. Jay and Marwa have worked with foreign troops and government aid agencies, and spoke to BBC OS on World Service radio. ""I am still in shock, the shock of losing everything. I am not living anymore,"" Marwa said. ""I didn't have a plan to get a visa or get out. I had planned to stay here in my country to work for my people."" Marwa added that one of her former colleagues was killed two months ago and was warned by colleagues that things were getting worse. ""I had this passion to stay here and now I see how cruel people like the Taliban are,"" she added. ""The Taliban have searched my own house, they have messaged me, they have told me that I am the leader of the enemies of the Taliban,"" Jay said. ""They have seized my house, I'm not going to go there again, but it's not enough for them. They're looking for my life and the life of my family and that's exactly what they will be doing with every ally of the international forces.""

Turkey President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday urged Europe's leaders to take responsibility for the migrants now fleeing Afghanistan. Turkey has no intention of becoming ""Europe's migrant storage unit"", in the face of the ongoing chaos, he said, according to Reuters news agency. Since the Taliban's takeover this past weekend, tens of thousands of Afghans have scrambled to evacuate. Many have crossed into Turkey, according to migrant aid groups and state media. Turkey is home to some 4 million refugees, the majority of them Syrians who fled their country's civil war.The UN estimates,externalTurkey currently hosts the most refugees of any country worldwide. Now, somewhere between 500 and 2,000 Afghans are estimated to arrive in Turkey every day. Speaking after a cabinet meeting, Erdogan also said that Turkey could engage in discussions with a Taliban-led government in Afghanistan regarding their ""common agendas"". Ned Price said the US is trying to process enough people as they possibly can Ned Price, spokesman for the US Department of State, is currently giving an update on the situation in Afghanistan. He said that the US is continuing to deploy additional consular officers to help evacuate people, including sending teams to Qatar and Kuwait. Price added that there are currently 6,000 people at Kabul airport that have been fully processed and are waiting to board planes out of the country. Some 20 flights are set to leave on Thursday evening. He said that the US has ""significantly expanded"" how many American citizens, locally employed staff and special immigrant visa applications are eligible to leave Afghanistan. Asked about those unable to reach the airport, Price said the state department had seen reports of ""congestion"" getting to the airport. ""We are doing everything we can,"" he said, adding that the US has made it clear to the Taliban that ""safe passage should be guaranteed for all of those who wish to transit to the airport"". Thursday marks the 102nd anniversary of Afghanistan's independence, and small numbers of Afghans took to the streets waving their national flag in protest against the Taliban. The militants have been replacing the black, red and green national flag with their own white one. There were reports of casualties at a similar protest in Asadabad in the east of the country on Thursday, and three people were reported killed after shots were fired at a protest in the city of Jalalabad on Wednesday.
