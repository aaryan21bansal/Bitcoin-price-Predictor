"A car is abandoned in flood-hit New South Wales Western Sydney is now the ""greatest concern"" from the worst floods in decades to have ravaged eastern Australia, PM Scott Morrison says. Parts of New South Wales have seen almost 1m (3.2ft) of rain, flooding hundreds of homes and severing roads. Mr Morrison warned of more rain and days of danger to come as the emergency became not ""just a coastal event"". He said Sydney's largest dam would overflow for at least another week, threatening highly populated areas. Warragamba Dam discharged 500 gigalitres on Sydney - equivalent to the volume of Sydney Harbour. ""We advise that the rain and flood situation does remain dynamic and extremely complex,"" Mr Morrison said on Tuesday. No deaths had been reported but thousands of people have been evacuated and troops deployed after days of torrential downpours across the country. The prime minister said the rain was expected to ease on Wednesday but the flood threat would remain. Some 18,000 people have been evacuated so far in NSW, including a 37-year-old woman in labour who was airlifted after being trapped by the flooding west of Sydney. Another 15,000 were on evacuation notice on Tuesday. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (Bom) has warned the situation is ""far from over"" as two major weather systems collide. Southern coastal and inland areas now face a significant threat.

A BoM tweet said an area as large as Alaska - stretching from NSW to the Northern Territory - was now being affected by weather warnings. Mr Morrison said ""full impact assessments"" were still to be made in Sydney. In all, 10 million people are under warnings in every state and territory except Western Australia. A low pressure weather system that has been inundating the NSW coast for days has now been met by another weather system inland that is moving east. The bureau has forecast ""increased rainfall, strong winds, damaging surf and abnormally high tides"" in the state on Tuesday. The BoM's flood manager, Justin Field, said it was ""probably the worst flooding that I've experienced"" in 20 years of forecasting. The military is being deployed to help with search and rescue. But the bureau did predict some respite, tweeting: ""Most areas of New South Wales will see a clearing trend early Wednesday as a drier airmass moves into the region."" ""Several hundred homes have been flooded, roads damaged, wildlife lost [and] telecommunications and power outages across the flooded areas have been reported,"" Mr Morrison said. Emergency crews had conducted at least 700 rescues and 9,000 insurance claims had been lodged already, he added. More than 2,500 people had applied for financial assistance. People in many areas have been ordered to evacuate and others have been given evacuation warnings. An order requires people to seek shelter with family or friends well away from flood impacted areas,external, or in a special centre. The warning tells people to prepare for an evacuation order. Areas around the Colo and Hawkesbury rivers are of particular concern. They are seeing the worst flooding since 1961. Among the incidents that have happened: In Port Macquarie's North Shore, one resident was filmed dragging a stingray through what was his front lawn On Sunday a young couplesaw their house north of Sydney swept away by flash floods on what should have been their wedding day Spiders and snakes attempting to escape the floodwaters have been seen swarming inside resident's homes. By Shaimaa Khalil, BBC News Australian correspondent in Windsor The town of Windsor is one of the worst-affected areas. It's hard to make out the newly built Windsor bridge, all but submerged by the swollen Hawkesbury River. Residents tell me they're no strangers to floods but they haven't seen anything like this. ""We've barely had three hours of sleep in the last 24 hours,"" says Cameron Wassens, whose family has been watching water inch ever closer to their home. We stand in their back garden, which is barely visible now. His wife, Joanna, says: ""It's just like a lake full of water for as far as the eye can see."" The view from the Wassens' home It's been an anxious few days for the Wassens and hundreds of other families in the area, especially now as they wait in limbo. ""But we're ready to evacuate. We've packed up ready to go. If we get the order then we will leave to save ourselves,"" Ms Wassens says. The intense summer of rain and floods in eastern Australia is a stark contrast to a year ago, when many of the same areas were scorched by mammoth bushfires and ravaged by drought. This side of the continent is currently experiencing a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during summer. Two of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La NiÃ±a events. Typically a La NiÃ±a sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia. Scientists say that climate change is also intensifying La NiÃ±a's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic. Are you in the affected region?

"One of the car industry's biggest computer chip suppliers has warned that a major fire at one of its factories in Japan could have a ""massive impact"" on its ability to fulfil orders. The incident comes at a time when supplies of chips to the auto industry were already running short. Shares in the semiconductors firm Renesas fell, along with its clients including Toyota, Nissan and Honda. Elsewhere, Volkswagen has said chip scarcity might last until the autumn. ""I think things will get stable by the fall but certainly its going to be complicated, and its going to be challenging but I think we'll navigate it,"" Scott Keogh, VW's North America chief executive told the BBC. He added that some of the company's plants were likely to run fewer shifts a day, but added that he hoped factory shutdowns could be averted. Allow Twitter content?

Renesas has said the blazeoccurred last Friday, and was caused by a plating tank catching fire,externalas a result of an electrical ""overcurrent"", whose cause is still being investigated. It took fire fighters more than five hours to put out. The fire started with plating equipment based on the first floor of the building The pure water supply and air conditioning suffered damage as well as the manufacturing equipment The fabrication plant involved is based in the city of Naka, in the eastern province of Ibaraki. It specialises in 300mm wafers, making it one of the company's most advanced facilities. The firm has said there were no human casualties, but 11 of its manufacturing equipment units were damaged. And because this occurred in one of its environmentally-controlled ""clean rooms"" - which are designed to avoid any dust or other particles from ruining the tiny transistors and circuits involved in a chip - efforts to restart production will involve more than just swapping out the ruined kit. While Renesas said the majority of the products manufactured using the affected machines could in theory be manufactured elsewhere, the wider supply shortfall will make that difficult to achieve in practice. The company has said it hopes to restart production in a month,but the Nikkei Asia news site said,externalit could take three months before output is back to normal. Renesas requires dust-free environments to make chips at its Naka fabrication plant Renesas has said that it has about a one-month stockpile of chips to continue fulfilling automakers' orders - so the impact to car production will not be immediate. But it comes at a time of crisis. New cars often include dozens of microprocessors. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, car-makers cut orders for the components because of a slump in sales of their vehicles. When the market rebounded towards the end of 2020, they found it hard to find supplies because other consumer electronics makers had stepped in with orders of their own to meet higher than normal demand for their gadgets because of lockdowns. In addition, February's freezing weather in Texas closed chip-making plants there. US trade restrictions placed on the telecoms firm Huawei and chip-maker SMIC, among others, have caused other Chinese companies to stockpile supplies of their own. And a drought in Taiwan is threatening production there. Wafer manufacturing requires a lot of water. Many car-makers have slowed or temporarily halted production at some of their plants. It had earlier been estimated that they faced losingmore than $60bn (Â£43.3bn) of sales as a result.,external Toyota is among Renesas's customers ""Given that automotive semiconductor capacity is very stretched right now, this fire is effectively a blow upon a bruise, so to speak,"" commented Richard Windsor, owner of research firm Radio Free Mobile. ""But because following 2011's Fukushima nuclear disaster, Toyota ordered all its suppliers to keep more inventory than it had done in the past, it's quite possible it won't be as badly impacted as Honda and Nissan."" Renesas' stock fell 4.9% in Tokyo trade on Monday. Toyota's fell by 2.6%. Honda's by 3.6%. And Nissan's by 3.7%. Chip shortage: Samsung warns of 'serious imbalance' EU seeks to supercharge computer chip production How will 'chipageddon' affect you? Elsewhere, there has been further evidence of constrained chip production having wider knock-on effects. The Nikkei Asia reported on Sunday that the price of memory chips,externalhad risen 60% since the start of 2021. It noted that supplies of older chips were particularly constrained, which would impact printer-makers among other gadgets that rely on them. And last week, Samsung's co-chief executive Koh Dong-jin warned of a ""serious imbalance in supply and demand of chips in the IT sector globally"". Although the South Korean company is unusual in that it both designs and manufactures state-of-the-art chips for use in its own products and others, it still relies on third-party supplies. And it has faced a shortage of application processors from the US firm Qualcomm. Qualcomm's chief executive commented indirectly on the issue at the China Development Forum in Beijing on Saturday. Steve Mollenkopf predicted that supplies of some older-technology chips would recover before their newer counterparts, adding: ""So, depending on the product, you may be in a position to get some improvement.""

"YouTube star David Dobrik has stepped down from an app he co-founded, following a rape allegation about his former associate.

"This video can not be played No women of colour have been elected to Scotlandâs parliament in its 22-year-history. When the Scottish Parliament was created in 1999 much was made about how it would reflect modern Scotland but fine words and good intentions have not necessarily led to equal representation. Women make up 51% of the population but currently only hold 36% of the seats at Holyrood. And of the 645 members elected since 1999, there has not been a single woman of colour. If the parliament was truly representative of the population, there should have been 12. BBC Scotland's Disclosure has been speaking to five women who are hoping to break the mould. The 53-year-old teacher is standing for the SNP in Glasgow Kelvin. Ms Stewart has been a campaigner for more than 20 years and this is her fifth attempt at being elected. She says the barriers can be quite entrenched and trying to break them down is very difficult. ""We know that people will want to select somebody who is like them,"" she says. ""I'm not like the majority of the population of Scotland, because I'm a different colour. ""Therefore, if people are looking for that familiarity, they're not visually going to get it from me."" She says the challenge is to be embedded in a community and to get to know people. Ms Stewart is clear that having a parliament which represents all of Scotland's diversity is essential. ""It's important because it's a validation,"" she says. ""It's a sense of belonging, that the people who make decisions about shaping policies are the people that live and work and breathe in Scotland."" Born in Burundi, Ms Kanyange came to the UK in 2003. The 40-year-old, who recently finished university, is on the Glasgow list for the Scottish Green Party. This is her first time standing for election and she says we need to get beyond race and gender when electing people. ""Let's normalise it,"" she says. ""It should not be seen as this major thing that's happening, like 'oh first black this, first black that'."" Ms Kanyange says: ""Racism is everywhere, it is in the hospital, it's in schools, it's in politics. ""So the people that have jobs to do, it's not your right to disrespect or decide how you're going to treat a person. ""It's not the right thing to do. Look at what they're capable of doing, rather than what they look like."" She says people need to adjust to this mindset so society can change. Ms Kanyange takes inspiration from Kamala Harris's recent election as the first woman of colour Vice President of the United States. ""It was very, very, very good, because yes, she might be the first, but she 'hopes' that she's not the last. And that's exactly how I feel."" Aisha Mir, 48, is an Edinburgh businesswoman who is standing for the Scottish Liberal Democrats on the Mid-Scotland and Fife regional list. As a Muslim, she says she has encountered barriers within her own community. ""When I stood in my first election, I approached the local mosque, to ask if I could get some time there to speak to the congregation,"" she says. Ms Mir says she offered to observe religious rules, perhaps engaging with women separately. ""We went to speak to the Imam and I got shut down straight away,"" she says. ""I was shut down, told I shouldn't be standing, it wasn't a woman's place and it was quite astounding."" Ms Mir says: ""We have to respect different cultures, traditions and faiths, absolutely. ""But we also have to call out, from within our communities, when this kind of behaviour happens because it's not right."" She says being told not to stand put ""fire in my belly"". ""I thought, 'right, I am so going to do this',"" she says. Pam Gosal, 48, is the Conservative candidate in the Clydebank and Milngavie seat. She ran her family business before working in local government. This is her second election as a candidate. In the 2019 UK general election, she says female candidates got a lot of social media abuse as well as face-to-face comments. She knows standing for election makes her a public figure and therefore a target but says it does not frighten her. Ms Gosal says she has experienced racist abuse throughout her life but it will never stop her. ""I remember what mum and dad had told us: 'Just put your head down and walk past, and don't give them eye contact',"" she says. Offensive comments on social media platforms are something she has learned to deal with. ""In the past month 'go back to your country' was one of them,"" she says. ""I was born in Scotland so I don't know what they were talking about."" Labour has no women of colour standing for election to Holyrood this year. Party activist Deena Tissera, who lives in Aberdeen, hopes to stand in the future, once she has completed her PhD. The 33-year-old, who is originally from Sri Lanka, describes the lack of women of colour at Holyrood as a ""system failure"" which leaves her disappointed. ""I think it's the perception of what leadership is, and what a leader looks like,"" she says. ""That is an in-built race ideology, where most of the time a white, male-presented individual is the most electable. And so there's no point of anyone other than that running for the position."" Ms Tissera says women of colour fall through the cracks when it comes to minority representation. ""You've elected a minority male, so that covers the minority target group,"" she says. ""And then you've elected the females, so that covers the gender target group. ""So there is representation there but there are no minority females. That's where women like myself fall down the gap."" Ms Tissera believes a truly representative parliament benefits everyone. ""We need to elect more people of colour,"" she says. ""It has to be diverse. There needs to be equity in power distribution, in terms of representation. ""That is when we can actually have inclusive policy coming out, which is beneficial for the growth of this country.""

"Non-essential aisles had previously been closed off or covered Supermarkets can sell non-essential items and garden centres can open in Wales from Monday in a further slight easing of Covid lockdown rules. Shops that have already been open, but had non-essential aisles cordoned off, can now sell anything, but shops that only sell non-essential items will remain closed until 12 April. Garden centres will open their doors to customers for the first timesince lockdown began in December. Shops must have strict Covid protocols. They are the latest restrictions to be lifted as Wales' coronavirus case rate has fallen below 50 per 100,000 people and the national Covid positivity rate is below 5% - bothunder the lockdown threshold. Dates for Welsh gym and outdoor hospitality opening plan Welsh tourism reopening decision 'will be last moment' Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? All primary and some secondary school children have returned to the classroom while four people from two different households can now meet outdoors, including in gardens, as the stay-at-home rule was relaxed to a stay local one. Wales' dates for easing Covid lockdown restrictions in the retail sector First Minister Mark Drakeford and the Welsh government have also said more industries could be reopened or considered for reopening if Covid cases rates and test positivity rates remained low. From 27 March, if case rates remain low: Libraries and self-contained accommodation could reopen, but you can only holiday with people from your own household Organised children's activities could restart Stay local restrictions could be lifted From 12 April, if case rates remain low: All shops and remaining close-contact services could resume On 22 April Ministers will consider whengyms and outdoor hospitality in Walescan reopen in its lockdown review Staff from the Fron Goch Garden Centre are looking forward to welcoming customers back Afterhairdressers reopened for appointmentslast week, the reopening of non-essential aisles in supermarkets and garden centres welcoming customers is Wales' latest step towards reopening after being shut for three months. Justin Williams is looking forward to opening Fron Goch Garden Centre near Caernarfon and believes services like his can help people's wellbeing. ""Gardening is important for mental health,"" he said. ""It's important to have an outside or inside space for growing plants or vegetables. It's something to do with the kids but also something for people of any age to get involved with. It also encourages people to stay home and be safe."" Garden centrebosses across Wales have been frustratedbeing shut while centres in England have remained open. Plans are being put in place as parts of society begin to reopen ""We were frustrated this hadn't been recognised in Wales like in England but are happy that's changing now,"" Mr Williams added. ""There's been a lot of interest in us opening. People have been quite lonely without much support, it will be good to get people out and see guests in the garden."" Manynon-essential retailers thought they would be allowed to openwhen hairdressers did on 15 March, but were ""frustrated and disappointed"" they could not open until English non-essential retailers did on 12 April. Welsh ministers said the move to allow supermarkets to start selling non-essential items again while other shops remain shutwas seen as ""the least risky"" Covid rules relaxationas supermarkets were already open. The Welsh Retail Consortium previously said the industry was losing Â£100m in revenue every week while non-essential shops such as clothes outlets and bookshops were shut. Chepstow Bookshop in Monmouthshire will not be able to open next week while the supermarket and high street newsagents nearby will be allowed to sell non-essentials items such as books. ""I can understand why the Welsh government has done it,"" said Matt Taylor, who has owned the 40-year-old book store for 15 years. In pre-Covid times, Chepstow Bookshop had celebrity book signings including fitness guru Joe Wicks ""It's great we've been on a level playing field for so long, although there are a few frustrations."" Mr Taylor's shop, which has been shut for six of the past 12 months, offers click and collect and home delivery but he estimates trade is ""two-thirds"" of what it was the previous year while ""working twice as hard"". ""The thing people seem to miss the most about coming into independent shops like ours is customers not knowing what they want, it's that browsing experience. And in this pandemic, books have given people a refuge or an escape from it all."" Monmouthshire has the third-lowest Covid case rate of Wales' 22 local authorities - behind Ceredigion and Bridgend - and Leeann Davies, who owns Village Treats in Magor, was ""gutted"" her sweet shop didn't open at the same time as hairdressers. ""It seems like along with the pubs and restaurants, we're the only ones not open,"" she said. ""Some of these supermarkets are getting record profits as they've no competition whereas even when we're open, we don't have the amount of customers they do - and we have strict Covid procedures. ""But I understand we're non-essential and you can't differentiate between my little shop and a big store in a city centre."" Leeann Davies has run her sweet shop Village Treats in her local village for almost six years Mr Davies said her her business would not have survived the coronavirus crisis without government support - but does have hope for the future. ""After the first lockdown and, as so many people are working from home, we were the busiest we'd ever been,"" she said. ""Communities have really got behind supporting local businesses and if more people continue to work from home after the pandemic, maybe local shops like ours may have a really encouraging futures.""

"A car is abandoned in flood-hit New South Wales Western Sydney is now the ""greatest concern"" from the worst floods in decades to have ravaged eastern Australia, PM Scott Morrison says. Parts of New South Wales have seen almost 1m (3.2ft) of rain, flooding hundreds of homes and severing roads. Mr Morrison warned of more rain and days of danger to come as the emergency became not ""just a coastal event"". He said Sydney's largest dam would overflow for at least another week, threatening highly populated areas. Warragamba Dam discharged 500 gigalitres on Sydney - equivalent to the volume of Sydney Harbour. ""We advise that the rain and flood situation does remain dynamic and extremely complex,"" Mr Morrison said on Tuesday. No deaths had been reported but thousands of people have been evacuated and troops deployed after days of torrential downpours across the country. The prime minister said the rain was expected to ease on Wednesday but the flood threat would remain. Some 18,000 people have been evacuated so far in NSW, including a 37-year-old woman in labour who was airlifted after being trapped by the flooding west of Sydney. Another 15,000 were on evacuation notice on Tuesday. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (Bom) has warned the situation is ""far from over"" as two major weather systems collide. Southern coastal and inland areas now face a significant threat. Spiders, wallabies and cows flee Australia floods In pictures: Australia's 'one-in-a-50-year' flood This video can not be played Australia floods: Is the jet stream to blame? A BoM tweet said an area as large as Alaska - stretching from NSW to the Northern Territory - was now being affected by weather warnings. Mr Morrison said ""full impact assessments"" were still to be made in Sydney. In all, 10 million people are under warnings in every state and territory except Western Australia. A low pressure weather system that has been inundating the NSW coast for days has now been met by another weather system inland that is moving east. The bureau has forecast ""increased rainfall, strong winds, damaging surf and abnormally high tides"" in the state on Tuesday. The BoM's flood manager, Justin Field, said it was ""probably the worst flooding that I've experienced"" in 20 years of forecasting. The military is being deployed to help with search and rescue. But the bureau did predict some respite, tweeting: ""Most areas of New South Wales will see a clearing trend early Wednesday as a drier airmass moves into the region."" ""Several hundred homes have been flooded, roads damaged, wildlife lost [and] telecommunications and power outages across the flooded areas have been reported,"" Mr Morrison said. Emergency crews had conducted at least 700 rescues and 9,000 insurance claims had been lodged already, he added. More than 2,500 people had applied for financial assistance. People in many areas have been ordered to evacuate and others have been given evacuation warnings. An order requires people to seek shelter with family or friends well away from flood impacted areas,external, or in a special centre. The warning tells people to prepare for an evacuation order. Areas around the Colo and Hawkesbury rivers are of particular concern. They are seeing the worst flooding since 1961. Among the incidents that have happened: In Port Macquarie's North Shore, one resident was filmed dragging a stingray through what was his front lawn On Sunday a young couplesaw their house north of Sydney swept away by flash floods on what should have been their wedding day Spiders and snakes attempting to escape the floodwaters have been seen swarming inside resident's homes. By Shaimaa Khalil, BBC News Australian correspondent in Windsor The town of Windsor is one of the worst-affected areas. It's hard to make out the newly built Windsor bridge, all but submerged by the swollen Hawkesbury River. Residents tell me they're no strangers to floods but they haven't seen anything like this. ""We've barely had three hours of sleep in the last 24 hours,"" says Cameron Wassens, whose family has been watching water inch ever closer to their home. We stand in their back garden, which is barely visible now. His wife, Joanna, says: ""It's just like a lake full of water for as far as the eye can see."" The view from the Wassens' home It's been an anxious few days for the Wassens and hundreds of other families in the area, especially now as they wait in limbo. ""But we're ready to evacuate. We've packed up ready to go. If we get the order then we will leave to save ourselves,"" Ms Wassens says. The intense summer of rain and floods in eastern Australia is a stark contrast to a year ago, when many of the same areas were scorched by mammoth bushfires and ravaged by drought. This side of the continent is currently experiencing a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during summer. Two of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La NiÃ±a events. Typically a La NiÃ±a sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia. Scientists say that climate change is also intensifying La NiÃ±a's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic. Are you in the affected region?

"The size of the Army is to be reduced to 72,500 soldiers by 2025 as part of a move towards drones and cyber warfare. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said ""increased deployability and technological advantage"" meant greater effect could be delivered by fewer people. He set out plans for new capabilities such as electronic warfare and drones in the Commons. Labour has warned that ""size matters"" when it comes to defence. Announcing amajor overhaul of the armed forces,external, Mr Wallace said it marked a shift from ""mass mobilisation to information age speed"", insisting they must be able to ""seek out and understand"" new threats to the country's security. He said the government was increasing the UK defence spending by Â£24bn over the next four years. Mr Wallace said it was tempting to use the ""shield of sentimentality"" to protect ""outdated capabilities"" but doing so would put lives at risk. Defence reforms 'will help make UK match-fit' UK to lift cap on nuclear stockpile after review What is happening to the size of the Army? The Army currently has 76,500 personnel and has not been at its ""established strength"" of 82,000 troops since the middle of the last decade, Mr Wallace said. ""These changes will not require redundancies and we wish to build on the work already done on utilising our reserves to make sure the whole force is better integrated and more productive,"" he said. Shadow defence secretary John Healey warned that while ""threats to Britain are increasing"" the plan was for ""fewer troops, fewer ships, fewer planes, over the next few years"". A cut to the size of the Army had been anticipated - with a reduction of 10,000 widely trailed. What Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced was a cut to the target for the number of fully trained people in the Army, from 82,040 today to 72,500 in 2025. ""Full-time trained strength"" is the number of soldiers who have completed both their general, basic training and a second phase of specialised training for a specific role. But the Army is not currently meeting its target - there are actually 76,350 such soldiers in the Army, which is almost 6,000 short. So the Ministry of Defence is already well on the way to getting down to its new target. The changes set out in the paper - titled Defence in a Competitive Age - include Â£3bn for new vehicles, long-range rocket systems, drones, electronic warfare and cyber capabilities. It sets out how forces will spend more time overseas to support allies and deter hostile powers, such as Russia. Mr Wallace said previous reviews had been ""overambitious and underfunded leaving forces that were overstretched and underequipped"". The size of the Army will be at its smallest since 1714 - with just 72,500 regular soldiers. The number of tanks will be cut from 227 to 148 upgraded ones. The RAF will lose 24 of its older Typhoon jets and its fleet of Hercules transport aircraft. And the Royal Navy will be retiring two of its older frigates early before new ones come into service. All this while the government says the threats are rising. There will certainly be some pain before the armed forces experience the gains of extra investment. But there will be more money to invest in new technologies like robots and drones - and to compete in the domains of space and cyber. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told MPs that his plans would equip the armed forces to fight the wars of the future. They may be very different to what we saw in Iraq and Afghanistan. Small teams of troops will be sent all over the world to train and assist partner nations with the focus on conflict prevention. British forces should be better able to counter cyber attacks and disinformation - the new front line of the so called ""greyzone"" now being exploited by Russia and China. But defence chiefs still insist that a smaller armed forces would be able to pack a punch in any serious conflict. The armed forces are being asked to match the government's ""Global Britain"" ambitions. But opposition parties, and some allies, question whether Britain's military can really do more with less. As part of the military restructure, the Royal Marines will be transformed into a new Future Commando Force, taking on many of the traditional tasks of the special forces - the SAS and SBS (Special Air Service and Special Boat Service). The force will receive more than Â£200m of direct investment over the next decade to carry out maritime security operations and to ""pre-empt and deter sub-threshold activity, and counter state threats"". Space is another area of investment with the Ministry of Defence to prioritise more than Â£6.6bn for research and development over the next four years. Numerous aging RAF planes will be retired, as will the oldest Chinook helicopters, while Navy frigates and destroyers drop from 19 to 17 in the coming years. A third of the 227 Challenger tanks will be scrapped, with the rest of the fleet being upgraded at a cost of Â£1.3bn. Among other changes announced: the Army will reorganise into seven brigade combat teams a newly formed Security Force Assistance Brigade will provide skills to build capacity of partner nations a Â£2bn investment in the Future Combat Air System over the next four years Â£1.5bn to be invested over the next decade to build a ""digital backbone"" to share and exploit vast amounts of data the creation of the National Cyber Force based in the North West of England Conservative chairman of the Commons Defence Select Committee Tobias Ellwood congratulated Mr Wallace for investments in ""cyber and autonomous platforms"" but warned that they came at a ""huge price to our conventional defence posture with dramatic cuts to our troop numbers, tanks, armoured fighting vehicles"". Followingthe publication last week of the separate so-called integrated reviewof foreign and defence policy, ministers have said big changes are necessary to create a more agile military. As part of that review, the government increased the cap on UK nuclear warheads from 180 to 260. Boris Johnson spoke to Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg ahead of the announcement and gave reassurances that increased investment would take the UK's total defence spending to 2.2% of GDP - above the Nato target, a Downing Street spokeswoman said.

"The size of the Army is to be reduced to 72,500 soldiers by 2025 as part of a move towards drones and cyber warfare. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said ""increased deployability and technological advantage"" meant greater effect could be delivered by fewer people. He set out plans for new capabilities such as electronic warfare and drones in the Commons. Labour has warned that ""size matters"" when it comes to defence. Announcing amajor overhaul of the armed forces,external, Mr Wallace said it marked a shift from ""mass mobilisation to information age speed"", insisting they must be able to ""seek out and understand"" new threats to the country's security. He said the government was increasing the UK defence spending by Â£24bn over the next four years. Mr Wallace said it was tempting to use the ""shield of sentimentality"" to protect ""outdated capabilities"" but doing so would put lives at risk. Defence reforms 'will help make UK match-fit' UK to lift cap on nuclear stockpile after review What is happening to the size of the Army? The Army currently has 76,500 personnel and has not been at its ""established strength"" of 82,000 troops since the middle of the last decade, Mr Wallace said. ""These changes will not require redundancies and we wish to build on the work already done on utilising our reserves to make sure the whole force is better integrated and more productive,"" he said. Shadow defence secretary John Healey warned that while ""threats to Britain are increasing"" the plan was for ""fewer troops, fewer ships, fewer planes, over the next few years"". A cut to the size of the Army had been anticipated - with a reduction of 10,000 widely trailed. What Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced was a cut to the target for the number of fully trained people in the Army, from 82,040 today to 72,500 in 2025. ""Full-time trained strength"" is the number of soldiers who have completed both their general, basic training and a second phase of specialised training for a specific role. But the Army is not currently meeting its target - there are actually 76,350 such soldiers in the Army, which is almost 6,000 short. So the Ministry of Defence is already well on the way to getting down to its new target. The changes set out in the paper - titled Defence in a Competitive Age - include Â£3bn for new vehicles, long-range rocket systems, drones, electronic warfare and cyber capabilities. It sets out how forces will spend more time overseas to support allies and deter hostile powers, such as Russia. Mr Wallace said previous reviews had been ""overambitious and underfunded leaving forces that were overstretched and underequipped"". The size of the Army will be at its smallest since 1714 - with just 72,500 regular soldiers. The number of tanks will be cut from 227 to 148 upgraded ones. The RAF will lose 24 of its older Typhoon jets and its fleet of Hercules transport aircraft. And the Royal Navy will be retiring two of its older frigates early before new ones come into service. All this while the government says the threats are rising. There will certainly be some pain before the armed forces experience the gains of extra investment. But there will be more money to invest in new technologies like robots and drones - and to compete in the domains of space and cyber. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told MPs that his plans would equip the armed forces to fight the wars of the future. They may be very different to what we saw in Iraq and Afghanistan. Small teams of troops will be sent all over the world to train and assist partner nations with the focus on conflict prevention. British forces should be better able to counter cyber attacks and disinformation - the new front line of the so called ""greyzone"" now being exploited by Russia and China. But defence chiefs still insist that a smaller armed forces would be able to pack a punch in any serious conflict. The armed forces are being asked to match the government's ""Global Britain"" ambitions. But opposition parties, and some allies, question whether Britain's military can really do more with less. As part of the military restructure, the Royal Marines will be transformed into a new Future Commando Force, taking on many of the traditional tasks of the special forces - the SAS and SBS (Special Air Service and Special Boat Service). The force will receive more than Â£200m of direct investment over the next decade to carry out maritime security operations and to ""pre-empt and deter sub-threshold activity, and counter state threats"". Space is another area of investment with the Ministry of Defence to prioritise more than Â£6.6bn for research and development over the next four years. Numerous aging RAF planes will be retired, as will the oldest Chinook helicopters, while Navy frigates and destroyers drop from 19 to 17 in the coming years. A third of the 227 Challenger tanks will be scrapped, with the rest of the fleet being upgraded at a cost of Â£1.3bn. Among other changes announced: the Army will reorganise into seven brigade combat teams a newly formed Security Force Assistance Brigade will provide skills to build capacity of partner nations a Â£2bn investment in the Future Combat Air System over the next four years Â£1.5bn to be invested over the next decade to build a ""digital backbone"" to share and exploit vast amounts of data the creation of the National Cyber Force based in the North West of England Conservative chairman of the Commons Defence Select Committee Tobias Ellwood congratulated Mr Wallace for investments in ""cyber and autonomous platforms"" but warned that they came at a ""huge price to our conventional defence posture with dramatic cuts to our troop numbers, tanks, armoured fighting vehicles"". Followingthe publication last week of the separate so-called integrated reviewof foreign and defence policy, ministers have said big changes are necessary to create a more agile military. As part of that review, the government increased the cap on UK nuclear warheads from 180 to 260. Boris Johnson spoke to Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg ahead of the announcement and gave reassurances that increased investment would take the UK's total defence spending to 2.2% of GDP - above the Nato target, a Downing Street spokeswoman said.

"YouTube star David Dobrik has stepped down from an app he co-founded, following a rape allegation about his former associate. One woman who appeared in a video on Mr Dobrikâs channel says she was raped by another person involved during filming. Mr Dobrik, who has almost 19 million subscribers on the platform, denies any wrongdoing. But the claim has led brands and investors to ""sever ties"" with the influencer. Mr Dobrik rose to fame through prank videos, sometimes in collaboration with a number of other YouTubers called the Vlog Squad. During the coronavirus pandemic, he stepped back from posting regularly on YouTube, in order to launch his own photo app Dispo. A recent investigation published,externalby Kat Tenbarge at the business news website Insider, detailed the womanâs account of rape in 2018 by a - now former - Vlog Squad member. Since the claims, support for the app and Mr Dobrik has collapsed. Venture capital firm and a leading investor in the app, Spark Capital, announced it would âsever all tiesâ with the company.

Hello Fresh, EA Sports and HBO Max are among brands to have dropped him. In the account, published in Insider, a woman alleged she was raped during the filming of a Vlog Squad video in 2018. She reportedly says she was given alcohol despite being under the legal age of 21, and became drunk to the point of unconsciousness. Later, she said she was involved in group sex which included a Vlog Squad member, when she was too intoxicated to consent. The video - which does not explicitly show the alleged incident - was published on Mr Dobrikâs channel, and later removed.

"Non-essential aisles had previously been closed off or covered Supermarkets can sell non-essential items and garden centres can open in Wales from Monday in a further slight easing of Covid lockdown rules. Shops that have already been open, but had non-essential aisles cordoned off, can now sell anything, but shops that only sell non-essential items will remain closed until 12 April. Garden centres will open their doors to customers for the first timesince lockdown began in December. Shops must have strict Covid protocols. They are the latest restrictions to be lifted as Wales' coronavirus case rate has fallen below 50 per 100,000 people and the national Covid positivity rate is below 5% - bothunder the lockdown threshold. Dates for Welsh gym and outdoor hospitality opening plan Welsh tourism reopening decision 'will be last moment' Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? All primary and some secondary school children have returned to the classroom while four people from two different households can now meet outdoors, including in gardens, as the stay-at-home rule was relaxed to a stay local one. Wales' dates for easing Covid lockdown restrictions in the retail sector First Minister Mark Drakeford and the Welsh government have also said more industries could be reopened or considered for reopening if Covid cases rates and test positivity rates remained low. From 27 March, if case rates remain low: Libraries and self-contained accommodation could reopen, but you can only holiday with people from your own household Organised children's activities could restart Stay local restrictions could be lifted From 12 April, if case rates remain low: All shops and remaining close-contact services could resume On 22 April Ministers will consider whengyms and outdoor hospitality in Walescan reopen in its lockdown review Staff from the Fron Goch Garden Centre are looking forward to welcoming customers back Afterhairdressers reopened for appointmentslast week, the reopening of non-essential aisles in supermarkets and garden centres welcoming customers is Wales' latest step towards reopening after being shut for three months. Justin Williams is looking forward to opening Fron Goch Garden Centre near Caernarfon and believes services like his can help people's wellbeing. ""Gardening is important for mental health,"" he said. ""It's important to have an outside or inside space for growing plants or vegetables. It's something to do with the kids but also something for people of any age to get involved with. It also encourages people to stay home and be safe."" Garden centrebosses across Wales have been frustratedbeing shut while centres in England have remained open. Plans are being put in place as parts of society begin to reopen ""We were frustrated this hadn't been recognised in Wales like in England but are happy that's changing now,"" Mr Williams added. ""There's been a lot of interest in us opening. People have been quite lonely without much support, it will be good to get people out and see guests in the garden."" Manynon-essential retailers thought they would be allowed to openwhen hairdressers did on 15 March, but were ""frustrated and disappointed"" they could not open until English non-essential retailers did on 12 April. Welsh ministers said the move to allow supermarkets to start selling non-essential items again while other shops remain shutwas seen as ""the least risky"" Covid rules relaxationas supermarkets were already open. The Welsh Retail Consortium previously said the industry was losing Â£100m in revenue every week while non-essential shops such as clothes outlets and bookshops were shut. Chepstow Bookshop in Monmouthshire will not be able to open next week while the supermarket and high street newsagents nearby will be allowed to sell non-essentials items such as books. ""I can understand why the Welsh government has done it,"" said Matt Taylor, who has owned the 40-year-old book store for 15 years. In pre-Covid times, Chepstow Bookshop had celebrity book signings including fitness guru Joe Wicks ""It's great we've been on a level playing field for so long, although there are a few frustrations."" Mr Taylor's shop, which has been shut for six of the past 12 months, offers click and collect and home delivery but he estimates trade is ""two-thirds"" of what it was the previous year while ""working twice as hard"". ""The thing people seem to miss the most about coming into independent shops like ours is customers not knowing what they want, it's that browsing experience. And in this pandemic, books have given people a refuge or an escape from it all."" Monmouthshire has the third-lowest Covid case rate of Wales' 22 local authorities - behind Ceredigion and Bridgend - and Leeann Davies, who owns Village Treats in Magor, was ""gutted"" her sweet shop didn't open at the same time as hairdressers. ""It seems like along with the pubs and restaurants, we're the only ones not open,"" she said. ""Some of these supermarkets are getting record profits as they've no competition whereas even when we're open, we don't have the amount of customers they do - and we have strict Covid procedures. ""But I understand we're non-essential and you can't differentiate between my little shop and a big store in a city centre."" Leeann Davies has run her sweet shop Village Treats in her local village for almost six years Mr Davies said her her business would not have survived the coronavirus crisis without government support - but does have hope for the future. ""After the first lockdown and, as so many people are working from home, we were the busiest we'd ever been,"" she said. ""Communities have really got behind supporting local businesses and if more people continue to work from home after the pandemic, maybe local shops like ours may have a really encouraging futures.""

"This video can not be played PM: European third wave ""will wash up on our shores"" Boris Johnson has warned the effects of a third wave of coronavirus will ""wash up on our shores"" from Europe. The PM said the UK should be ""under no illusion"" we will ""feel effects"" of growing cases on the continent. One of his ministers, Lord Bethell, also warned the UK might put ""all our European neighbours"" onthe red list of countries, where arrivals are either banned or put in quarantine hotels. The comments come amid a row over Covid-19 vaccine supplies in the EU. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen has warned the EU could ""forbid"" doses made in the bloc from being exported to the UK. EU leaders will hold a virtual meeting on Thursday to discuss their plans. Officials confirmed the PM spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday about the ongoing issue, which would affect exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made in Europe. Mr Johnson said he ""talked to EU friends repeatedly"" during the pandemic and had been ""reassured... over the last few month they don't want to see blockades"". Downing Street also said President von der Leyen, had told Mr Johnson earlier this year that the EU was not intending to restrict exports of vaccines. PM hails record-breaking day with 844,285 jabs EU should not 'build walls' around vaccines Why is the EU having vaccine problems? EU legislation allows measures to be taken ""if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products"" - which, in theory, could include export bans and the waiving of patent and intellectual property rights on vaccines. But earlier, Mrs von der Leyen's chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, insisted that Brussels was not seeking to ban vaccine exports, but wanted pharmaceutical firms to meet their contractual obligations to the bloc. Mr Mamer said: ""In that context, the president has said that, of course, we see that, actually, companies that manufacture doses in the EU have been exporting very widely - which is in itself a good thing - but that we want to see reciprocity and proportionality in these exports."" Ursula von der Leyen has said the EU could ""forbid"" exports of vaccines to the UK Asked if he was worried about the row, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""I am reassured by talking to EU partners over the last few months that they don't want to see blockades."" But he went on to issue a warning about what the growing infections in Europe could mean for the UK. The PM said: ""On the continent right now you can see, sadly, there is a third wave under way. ""And people in this country should be under no illusions that previous experience has taught us that when a wave hits our friends, I'm afraid it washes up on our shores as well."" He added: ""I expect we will feel those effects in due course. That's why we're getting on with our vaccination programme as fast as we can."" Later, Health Minister Lord Bethell warned how the rising cases and issues with vaccines could affect travel to European countries going forward. He told the House of Lords: ""I don't know how that will play out and it's certainly above my pay grade to speculate, but we are all aware that the possibility lies that will have to red list all of our European neighbours - but that would be done with huge regret.""

"This video can not be played PM: European third wave ""will wash up on our shores"" Boris Johnson has warned the effects of a third wave of coronavirus will ""wash up on our shores"" from Europe. The PM said the UK should be ""under no illusion"" we will ""feel effects"" of growing cases on the continent. One of his ministers, Lord Bethell, also warned the UK might put ""all our European neighbours"" onthe red list of countries, where arrivals are either banned or put in quarantine hotels. The comments come amid a row over Covid-19 vaccine supplies in the EU. The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen has warned the EU could ""forbid"" doses made in the bloc from being exported to the UK. EU leaders will hold a virtual meeting on Thursday to discuss their plans. Officials confirmed the PM spoke to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday about the ongoing issue, which would affect exports of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made in Europe. Mr Johnson said he ""talked to EU friends repeatedly"" during the pandemic and had been ""reassured... over the last few month they don't want to see blockades"". Downing Street also said President von der Leyen, had told Mr Johnson earlier this year that the EU was not intending to restrict exports of vaccines. PM hails record-breaking day with 844,285 jabs EU should not 'build walls' around vaccines Why is the EU having vaccine problems? EU legislation allows measures to be taken ""if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products"" - which, in theory, could include export bans and the waiving of patent and intellectual property rights on vaccines. But earlier, Mrs von der Leyen's chief spokesman, Eric Mamer, insisted that Brussels was not seeking to ban vaccine exports, but wanted pharmaceutical firms to meet their contractual obligations to the bloc. Mr Mamer said: ""In that context, the president has said that, of course, we see that, actually, companies that manufacture doses in the EU have been exporting very widely - which is in itself a good thing - but that we want to see reciprocity and proportionality in these exports."" Ursula von der Leyen has said the EU could ""forbid"" exports of vaccines to the UK Asked if he was worried about the row, Mr Johnson told reporters: ""I am reassured by talking to EU partners over the last few months that they don't want to see blockades."" But he went on to issue a warning about what the growing infections in Europe could mean for the UK. The PM said: ""On the continent right now you can see, sadly, there is a third wave under way. ""And people in this country should be under no illusions that previous experience has taught us that when a wave hits our friends, I'm afraid it washes up on our shores as well."" He added: ""I expect we will feel those effects in due course. That's why we're getting on with our vaccination programme as fast as we can."" Later, Health Minister Lord Bethell warned how the rising cases and issues with vaccines could affect travel to European countries going forward. He told the House of Lords: ""I don't know how that will play out and it's certainly above my pay grade to speculate, but we are all aware that the possibility lies that will have to red list all of our European neighbours - but that would be done with huge regret."" On Monday, the UK reported 17 deaths over the last 24 hours of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 in the past 28 days.

"The size of the Army is to be reduced to 72,500 soldiers by 2025 as part of a move towards drones and cyber warfare. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said ""increased deployability and technological advantage"" meant greater effect could be delivered by fewer people. He set out plans for new capabilities such as electronic warfare and drones in the Commons. Labour has warned that ""size matters"" when it comes to defence. Announcing amajor overhaul of the armed forces,external, Mr Wallace said it marked a shift from ""mass mobilisation to information age speed"", insisting they must be able to ""seek out and understand"" new threats to the country's security. He said the government was increasing the UK defence spending by Â£24bn over the next four years. Mr Wallace said it was tempting to use the ""shield of sentimentality"" to protect ""outdated capabilities"" but doing so would put lives at risk. Defence reforms 'will help make UK match-fit' UK to lift cap on nuclear stockpile after review What is happening to the size of the Army? The Army currently has 76,500 personnel and has not been at its ""established strength"" of 82,000 troops since the middle of the last decade, Mr Wallace said. ""These changes will not require redundancies and we wish to build on the work already done on utilising our reserves to make sure the whole force is better integrated and more productive,"" he said. Shadow defence secretary John Healey warned that while ""threats to Britain are increasing"" the plan was for ""fewer troops, fewer ships, fewer planes, over the next few years"". A cut to the size of the Army had been anticipated - with a reduction of 10,000 widely trailed. What Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced was a cut to the target for the number of fully trained people in the Army, from 82,040 today to 72,500 in 2025. ""Full-time trained strength"" is the number of soldiers who have completed both their general, basic training and a second phase of specialised training for a specific role. But the Army is not currently meeting its target - there are actually 76,350 such soldiers in the Army, which is almost 6,000 short. So the Ministry of Defence is already well on the way to getting down to its new target. The changes set out in the paper - titled Defence in a Competitive Age - include Â£3bn for new vehicles, long-range rocket systems, drones, electronic warfare and cyber capabilities. It sets out how forces will spend more time overseas to support allies and deter hostile powers, such as Russia. Mr Wallace said previous reviews had been ""overambitious and underfunded leaving forces that were overstretched and underequipped"". The size of the Army will be at its smallest since 1714 - with just 72,500 regular soldiers. The number of tanks will be cut from 227 to 148 upgraded ones. The RAF will lose 24 of its older Typhoon jets and its fleet of Hercules transport aircraft. And the Royal Navy will be retiring two of its older frigates early before new ones come into service. All this while the government says the threats are rising. There will certainly be some pain before the armed forces experience the gains of extra investment. But there will be more money to invest in new technologies like robots and drones - and to compete in the domains of space and cyber. The defence secretary, Ben Wallace, told MPs that his plans would equip the armed forces to fight the wars of the future. They may be very different to what we saw in Iraq and Afghanistan. Small teams of troops will be sent all over the world to train and assist partner nations with the focus on conflict prevention. British forces should be better able to counter cyber attacks and disinformation - the new front line of the so called ""greyzone"" now being exploited by Russia and China. But defence chiefs still insist that a smaller armed forces would be able to pack a punch in any serious conflict. The armed forces are being asked to match the government's ""Global Britain"" ambitions. But opposition parties, and some allies, question whether Britain's military can really do more with less. As part of the military restructure, the Royal Marines will be transformed into a new Future Commando Force, taking on many of the traditional tasks of the special forces - the SAS and SBS (Special Air Service and Special Boat Service). The force will receive more than Â£200m of direct investment over the next decade to carry out maritime security operations and to ""pre-empt and deter sub-threshold activity, and counter state threats"". Space is another area of investment with the Ministry of Defence to prioritise more than Â£6.6bn for research and development over the next four years. Numerous aging RAF planes will be retired, as will the oldest Chinook helicopters, while Navy frigates and destroyers drop from 19 to 17 in the coming years. A third of the 227 Challenger tanks will be scrapped, with the rest of the fleet being upgraded at a cost of Â£1.3bn. Among other changes announced: the Army will reorganise into seven brigade combat teams a newly formed Security Force Assistance Brigade will provide skills to build capacity of partner nations a Â£2bn investment in the Future Combat Air System over the next four years Â£1.5bn to be invested over the next decade to build a ""digital backbone"" to share and exploit vast amounts of data the creation of the National Cyber Force based in the North West of England Conservative chairman of the Commons Defence Select Committee Tobias Ellwood congratulated Mr Wallace for investments in ""cyber and autonomous platforms"" but warned that they came at a ""huge price to our conventional defence posture with dramatic cuts to our troop numbers, tanks, armoured fighting vehicles"". Followingthe publication last week of the separate so-called integrated reviewof foreign and defence policy, ministers have said big changes are necessary to create a more agile military. As part of that review, the government increased the cap on UK nuclear warheads from 180 to 260. Boris Johnson spoke to Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg ahead of the announcement and gave reassurances that increased investment would take the UK's total defence spending to 2.2% of GDP - above the Nato target, a Downing Street spokeswoman said.

During the coronavirus pandemic, he stepped back from posting regularly on YouTube, in order to launch his own photo app Dispo. A recent investigation published,externalby Kat Tenbarge at the business news website Insider, detailed the womanâs account of rape in 2018 by a - now former - Vlog Squad member.

But the family say they were cut out of the production process and asked fans to boycott it, saying: ""This is about common, decent respect for our family.""

""During the process of writing, directing, and filming this movie, we've reached out to Genius as a family on multiple occasions where we have been disrespected and told we will not be worked with. ""As the immediate family - emphasis on immediate - we do not support this film and we ask that you also do not support this film, as we feel extremely disrespected, and we feel there will be many inaccuracies about my grandmother's life."" Aretha Franklin's music moved millions of people and sound-tracked social change over five decades Aretha Franklin was one of the biggest stars of pop, soul, gospel and R&B, who scored more than 100 hit singles on the US Billboard charts - from Chain of Fools and Respect to Think and (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman. Her extraordinary success was matched by an equally dramatic personal life, in which she survived abusive relationships and worked with civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King. A separate big-screen biopic of her life was already in production when she died of pancreatic cancer in 2018.

"A car is abandoned in flood-hit New South Wales Western Sydney is now the ""greatest concern"" from the worst floods in decades to have ravaged eastern Australia, PM Scott Morrison says. Parts of New South Wales have seen almost 1m (3.2ft) of rain, flooding hundreds of homes and severing roads. Mr Morrison warned of more rain and days of danger to come as the emergency became not ""just a coastal event"". He said Sydney's largest dam would overflow for at least another week, threatening highly populated areas. Warragamba Dam discharged 500 gigalitres on Sydney - equivalent to the volume of Sydney Harbour. ""We advise that the rain and flood situation does remain dynamic and extremely complex,"" Mr Morrison said on Tuesday. No deaths had been reported but thousands of people have been evacuated and troops deployed after days of torrential downpours across the country. The prime minister said the rain was expected to ease on Wednesday but the flood threat would remain. Some 18,000 people have been evacuated so far in NSW, including a 37-year-old woman in labour who was airlifted after being trapped by the flooding west of Sydney. Another 15,000 were on evacuation notice on Tuesday. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (Bom) has warned the situation is ""far from over"" as two major weather systems collide.

The intense summer of rain and floods in eastern Australia is a stark contrast to a year ago, when many of the same areas were scorched by mammoth bushfires and ravaged by drought. This side of the continent is currently experiencing a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during summer. Two of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La NiÃ±a events. Typically a La NiÃ±a sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia. Scientists say that climate change is also intensifying La NiÃ±a's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic. Are you in the affected region?

"A car is abandoned in flood-hit New South Wales Western Sydney is now the ""greatest concern"" from the worst floods in decades to have ravaged eastern Australia, PM Scott Morrison says. Parts of New South Wales have seen almost 1m (3.2ft) of rain, flooding hundreds of homes and severing roads. Mr Morrison warned of more rain and days of danger to come as the emergency became not ""just a coastal event"". He said Sydney's largest dam would overflow for at least another week, threatening highly populated areas. Warragamba Dam discharged 500 gigalitres on Sydney - equivalent to the volume of Sydney Harbour. ""We advise that the rain and flood situation does remain dynamic and extremely complex,"" Mr Morrison said on Tuesday. No deaths had been reported but thousands of people have been evacuated and troops deployed after days of torrential downpours across the country. The prime minister said the rain was expected to ease on Wednesday but the flood threat would remain. Some 18,000 people have been evacuated so far in NSW, including a 37-year-old woman in labour who was airlifted after being trapped by the flooding west of Sydney. Another 15,000 were on evacuation notice on Tuesday. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (Bom) has warned the situation is ""far from over"" as two major weather systems collide.

"Kingfisher, the owner of DIY retailer B&Q, has reported a sharp rise in full-year sales and profits, boosted by a new generation of ""young DIY-ers"". The company said underlying pre-tax profit jumped 44% while sales climbed to Â£12.3bn in the year to 31 January. Kingfisher boss Thierry Garnier said that the Covid-crisis had led to 18-34 year-olds doing more home improvements than any other age group. ""All of this is very encouraging for the future of our industry,"" he said. Kingfisher, which also owns the builders' merchant Screwfix, added that 20% of young ""DIY-ers"" had tried home improvement for the first time during lockdown. The company surveyed customers last year and again in February. The company also said home-working had helped lift sales and profits, as people invested in making their houses more comfortable. It expects people to continue working from home once Covid restrictions are lifted. Kingfisher said this would result in ""'wear and tear' on the home, and the need to organise living space differently, thereby creating further demand for home improvement"". Underlying pre-tax profit for the year rose to Â£786m from Â£544m in the previous 12 months. Total sales rose by 7.2%. Like-for-like sales, which strips out revenue from stores opened during the year, rose by 7.1% over the year with the strongest growth in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Under government guidelines, hardware stores are considered essential retailers. B&Q was closed during the first few weeks of lockdown a year ago before gradually reopening. Kingfisher said the pandemic had accelerated growth in online sales. E-commerce sales accounted for 18% of total sales compared to 8% in the year before. Mr Garnier said the company was also restructuring its shops in the UK and Ireland and is looking at introducing smaller B&Q Express stores in urban areas and retail parks. It is ""right-sizing"" a small number of its bigger stores and investigating using excess space solely to fulfil online orders. It is also launching two more B&Q shops with Asda stores this week, adding to the two it has already opened within the supermarket. Kingfisher said it had made a strong start to its current financial year with group like-for-like sales up more than 24% between February and 18 March. It said there had been particular demand for plants and vegetable seeds, compost and pressure washers. Kingfisher's share pricerose by 3.2% to 322.8p.

The actress and producer, who plays Eve Polastri in the BBC drama series Killing Eve, also urged people to help protect against violence and support ""sisters and brothers"" in need.

"The BBC will show a minimum 18 matches a season live across its main channels as part of the broadcast deal The BBC will show the Women's Super League on network free-to-air TV for the first time in a ""landmark"" three-year broadcast deal. From next season, WSL games will be shown live across the BBC and Sky in the deal worth Â£7m-Â£8m per season. Remaining matches not selected for broadcast by the BBC or Sky will be shown live on FA Player. The BBC will broadcast 22 live matches, with a minimum of 18 shown on BBC One or BBC Two. Sky Sports will provide coverage of up to 44 matches screened across the Main Event, Premier League and Sky Sports Football channels. The agreements with both broadcasters will run until the summer of 2024. The Football Association's Kelly Simmons expects the deal will give the WSL a massive audience boost. ""It is one of the biggest deals commercially, definitely for women's football in terms of a domestic deal, and up there for women's sport,"" she said. ""We have benchmarks for what we think are the most successful, high-profile women's sport leagues in the world like the WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association) and the NWSL (National Women's Soccer League), and they are low hundreds of thousands in terms of an average peak per week.

England and Manchester City captain Steph Houghton told BBC Sport it was an ""amazing step forward"" for women's football and the players can't wait to ""show the world what an unbelievable league we have"". ""The way this sport has developed in this country over the last few years has been unbelievable,"" she added. ""I think this will really push our league to be the best in Europe, if not the world."" The BBC has previously shown WSL matches on the Red Button and iPlayer as well as a weekly highlights show 22 live matches on BBC TV, including a minimum of 18 on BBC One and BBC Two (remaining matches on the Red Button and online) Up to 44 live matches, with a minimum of 35, shown on Sky Sports Football, Premier League and Main Event channels Selected fixtures will also be simulcast on Sky One and Sky Sports Mix All broadcasters will have rights to online coverage, in-play clips and highlights (WSL clubs also have rights to in-play clips and highlights) Remaining matches not selected for broadcast shown live on FA Player There will be one free-to-air game on BBC every weekend, with Sky having two other picks Selected matches expected to be scheduled on Friday 18:30 GMT, Saturday 11:30 GMT, Sunday 12:30 GMT and Sunday 18:30 GMT 75% of investment revenue to go to WSL clubs, 25% to the Women's Championship Simmons, the FA's director of the women's professional game, said the deal combined two major priorities for the FA: increasing visibility of the WSL, as well as attracting investment to further develop the quality of the league. ""We just desperately want more and better. It's always about looking forward and trying to fix the things that we're not happy with. This feels like one of those real step-change moments for the women's game,"" said Simmons. ""The work we do now will be to project those future revenues down the line. We always said to the clubs to believe and invest and now this will be the start of seeing that there's an ability for the game to take profits and [move away from] reliance, long term, on the men's game. ""It's going to be hugely visible next season. I'm sure it'll inspire thousands and thousands of girls to play the game so I just can't wait."" Kathryn Swarbrick, the FA's commercial and marketing director, added: ""This is a moment to celebrate - a watershed moment in the WSL future - with just an incredible outlook. ""That reach, combined with this huge investment into the game, makes us really confident that this is going to be a huge leap forward in achieving our ambition of having the world's best domestic women's professional league."" Manchester United's Christen Press (right) was one of a number of USA World Cup winners who joined the WSL in the summer The FA said it expects the audience figures to be ""significantly above"" the most successful and ""high-profile"" women's domestic sport leagues in the world. They also said it is ""definitely"" the biggest commercial broadcast agreement in women's football. ""We're going to be broadcasting more live games, reaching a bigger audience and bringing in more revenue than any other women's domestic league in the world,"" said Swarbrick.

""We're attracting players from all over the world but at the same time, English players in this league are testing themselves against the best,"" said Houghton. ""The standard of the league is increasing and that's mainly because people are training full-time.

"This video can not be played Neighbours filmed one couple's home being carried along by flash floods in Taree north of Sydney Some 18,000 people have been evacuated from severe floods across New South Wales (NSW) in Australia, with more heavy rainfall predicted. The state's entire coast is now under a severe weather warning. Days of torrential downpours have caused rivers and dams to overflow around Sydney - the state capital - and in south-east Queensland. The military is being deployed to help with search and rescue, in what has been called a ""one-in-50-years event"". Australia's Bureau of Meteorology has forecast ""increased rainfall, strong winds, damaging surf and abnormally high tides"" in New South Wales on Tuesday. It also said that some 10 million people across every state and territory except Western Australia were now under a weather warning. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said no deaths had been reported by late Monday - describing it as ""a miracle given what we have been through"". But there has been widespread damage in the affected areas, which are home to about a third of Australia's 25 million people. In pictures: Australia's 'one-in-a-50-year' flood Ms Berejiklian said many of the communities ""being battered by the floods"" had been affected by bushfires and drought the previous summer. ""I don't know any time in state history where we have had these extreme weather conditions in such quick succession in the middle of a pandemic,"" she said. PM Scott Morrison has offered funds for those forced to evacuate. He told parliament there was ""serious risk still ahead"". Swollen rivers cut off roads and bridges, and almost 200 schools in NSW will remain shut on Tuesday. People in more than 15 mostly low-lying areas have been ordered to evacuate and a similar number have been given evacuation warnings. This infant was rescued alongside another child, four adults and three dogs in Sydney's west An order requires people to seek shelter with family or friends well away from flood impacted areas,external, or in a special centre. The warning tells people to prepare for an evacuation order. Areas north and west of Sydney, the NSW Central Coast and the Hawkesbury valley have been of particular concern. There have been some 15,000 evacuations from the Mid-North Coast and a further 3,000 in Sydney, officials said. The Australian Defence Force will provide search and rescue helicopters on Tuesday, after a request from the NSW government. PM Morrison told MPs: ""Across NSW, 1,400 first responders have conducted over 700 flood rescues and responded to over 7,500 requests for assistance."" He added: ""This is an ongoing situation that is evolving and is extremely dangerous."" One stranded family was lifted from their flooded home by a helicopter. Responders also saved a family with a baby from flooding in their home in Sydney's west. There have been images of dead wildlife, livestock floating through flooded areas and rows of houses engulfed up to their windows. The Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers - which border Sydney to the north and west - reached higher levels on Monday than during a devastating flood in 1961. Meanwhile, the Warragamba Dam, Sydney's main water source, began spilling over for the first time in five years. It reached a peak daily discharge on Sunday of 500 gigalitres - equivalent to the volume of Sydney Harbour - before falling back to 300 GL on Monday. On Sunday a young couplesaw their house north of Sydney swept away by flash floods on what should have been their wedding day. Shocked neighbours filmed the uprooted three-bedroom cottage bobbing along the Manning river after it burst its banks. Parramatta River, in central suburban Sydney, broke its banks and flooded the ferry wharf In Port Macquarie's North Shore, one resident was filmed dragging a stingray through what was his front lawn. In south-east Queensland, flash floods also affected Brisbane and the Gold Coast at the weekend. Conditions in many areas of New South Wales are expected to worsen, with officials warning that two weather systems could collide, creating a ""last blast"" of rain and storms going into Wednesday. The Bureau of Meteorology said heavy rainfall would affect the whole NSW coast and several inland areas on Tuesday, bringing a ""serious risk"" of flash flooding. ""This situation is far from over,"" it tweeted. But it added: ""Most areas of New South Wales will see a clearing trend early Wednesday as a drier airmass moves into the region."" It alsosent out a tweet saying 10 million Australians were now under a weather warning,external- affecting an area the size of Alaska. The bureau said the rainfall so far - up to 90cm in some areas - had been ""extraordinary"", with many areas across NSW resembling an ""inland sea"". Allow Twitter content?

Ms Berejiklian, the NSW premier, said: ""What we're going through now is different to what you've been through for the last 50 years, so please take it seriously."" Jamisontown resident Ellen Brabin told ABC News that she had not seen floods as severe as this in more than 40 years. ""I've seen all the floods and stuff, and never had to move before so this is different,"" she said. The intense summer of rain and floods in eastern Australia is a stark contrast to a year ago, when many of the same areas were scorched by mammoth bushfires and ravaged by drought. This side of the continent is currently experiencing a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during summer. Two of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La NiÃ±a events. Typically a La NiÃ±a sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia. Scientists say that climate change is also intensifying La NiÃ±a's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic. Are you in the affected region?

Here's a reminder of today's top coronavirus stories in Wales:  This was the last of the regular briefings before the Senedd elections on 6 May, but we'll be back for a Welsh Government update following the next lockdown review with First Minister Mark Drakeford on 1 April. In the meantime, you can keep up to date with the latest developments via the BBC Wales News website and social media channels. Have a good afternoon, and stay safe.   This video can not be played Covid survivor Scott Howell thanks hospital staff for saving his life This time a year ago, Scott Howell from Blackwood, Caerphilly county, was on a ventilator and in an induced coma at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport after contracting coronavirus. He has since returned to the hospital to thank the staff who helped ""rebuild"" him. Mr Howell's heart stopped beating twice while he was sick. He said he would always be ""eternally grateful"" to Dr Nick Mason and ITU nurses Shannon Williams and Charlotte Tottle, along with other staff. Police broke up a party of 14 rugby fans at the weekend as many people gathered to watch Wales' defeat to France in the Six Nations in breach of Covid rules. At least 32 fines were issued in Merthyr Tydfil, as South Wales Police dealt with a total of 1,500 incidents over the weekend. One officer said Saturday was ""one of the busiest days of 2021"" for the force. Police, health officials and politicians had all warned people against gathering to watch the match in case it led to a spike in Covid infections. Residents of an Anglesey townhave been urged to get tested for coronavirus after a surge in cases. According to Sunday's figures from Public Health Wales, Holyhead had a seven-day coronavirus infection rate of 466.5 cases per 100,000 people - compared to an average of just 42 across the whole of Wales. There have been 50 cases in the town in the past week. Anglesey has the second highest infection rate of any Welsh local authority area, behind Merthyr Tydfil. The leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd has welcomeda recovery plan for the NHS in Walesbut questioned whether Welsh Labour could deliver it. Andrew RT Davies said Wales had poor waiting times before the pandemic, claiming that was âthe reality of 22 years of Labour in governmentâ. He asked: âCan you seriously tell me that the current health minister is the person who could be the author of solving the problem of waiting times, when before we went into this Covid crisis we had the worse waiting times of any part of the United Kingdom?"" The leader of Plaid Cymru has welcomedthe announcement of extra investment for the NHS in Walesbut said there needed to be more staff. Adam Price said the NHS needed 1,000 additional doctors, 4,000 new nurses and another 1,000 allied health professionals over the next five years. He told BBC Wales: âThe one thing that we didn't hear much about today was the need to invest in the NHS workforce."" Mr Price said he agreed with First Minister Mark Drakefordâs criticism ofthe UK government's timetable for easing restrictions in England. He said announcing nightclubs will open on 21 June âsends out the wrong messageâ. âIt risks having an effect in terms of people's behaviour,â he said. âSo I think we've got to be very very careful that we take this step by step, and we don't undo the good work that has been achieved.â The health minister says Wales' seven health boards will need to collaborate much more after the pandemic in order to provide the necessary services. Vaughan Gething said he wants to avoid a ""postcode lottery for services"" after the pandemic. He said: ""There are a range of areas where we're expecting health boards to work locally but there's also an expectation that they're not just looking within the borders of their own health board boundary but looking to work expansively with others. ""We're going to need to see lots of collaboration across planned care as well. We can expect to see the way that elective care is delivered being delivered on a different footprint on a different basis, but that should deliver the volume and the quality will need,"" he added. People in Wales want the Welsh Government to be cautious in easing Covid restrictions, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. âThere are noises from the fringes of politics that demand to have a more ambitious and more urgent programme - a road map that is driven by dates, not data - but that isn't where the Welsh Government is and it isn't where the people of Wales are,"" he said. Mr Gething insisted that all the scientific and medical advice is telling ministers that âif we move too quickly, we could throw away all of the hard work and collective sacrifice of people in Wales and other parts of the UK"". âI think people want to know that we're doing this in a way that is responsible, that follows and respects the evidence and the science, and that's the approach that we have taken,"" he said. Recovering from the coronavirus pandemic ""will take a full Welsh Parliament term"", according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said it is therefore important to take care of NHS staff as part of that recovery. He said: ""I know there are some voices who claim that we can already be making a start to essentially go hammer and tongs at undertaking more elective [non-emergency] activity. ""And actually we know that the waiting list is likely to expand further before we're out of the pandemic - that's because as I've set out in this statement, and in others that I've made, we know that our NHS can't operate at full capacity."" Mr Gething added: ""It's actually about how we take care of our staff, how leaders behave in the expectations we set that are consistent with NHS values, but recognises how exhausted our staff are."" The impact of coronavirus has given an ""opportunity to remake and rebuild"" the healthcare system in Wales, Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. Asked if Covidâs impact on waiting times might make health inequalities worse, Mr Gething said hisNHS recovery planhas a âcomplete sectionâ on the issue. He said: âThe biggest challenges in our healthcare inequalities are about people waiting or potentially coming to harm. âIt is the case that those people more likely to come to harm are more likely from our least well-off communities.â âThat's why there's such a significant focus on healthcare inequalities in the plan, and there's an opportunity to remake and rebuild our health and care system so it becomes a generally sustainable endeavour, for the future. âThat must go alongside what we could all do to live our lives differently, and all the things outside the health service that have a direct impact on health inequalities.â Dealing with long Covid is one of the four priorities for primary care in the NHS Wales recovery plan, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said people with the condition should have care as close to home as possible, adding that a new Covid-19 evidence centre had been set up. He said: âIt will work closely with the NHS and social care to analyse the impact of coronavirus and use evidence to address new challenges. Its work programme will include research into long Covid."" Mr Gething said ministers from across the UK had agreed to work on long Covid, including research and understanding how many people are affected. Wales' health minister says there could be up to a 40% increase in demand for primary care mental health services. Vaughan Gething said this âcould translate into up to 31,000 referralsâ. He said said the mental health budget was the single largest area of spending in the NHS. âIf we are to prevent life-long mental health problems, we need to spend more on services for children and young people who are experiencing mental health issues,â he added. âHealth boards also need to do more to make easy-to-access mental health support available locally."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Government is providing an ""initial investment"" of Â£100m to help the NHS and care service in Wales recover from the pandemic. The recovery plan, published today, sets out new ways of working which includes changes for outpatients. Mr Gething said: âWe want people to be sent straight for tests before they see a consultant, instead of multiple appointments and trips to and from hospital before they have diagnostic tests. âAnd we want greater use of virtual appointments â before the pandemic only 8% of outpatient consultations were virtual; this now stands at 34% - more than one in three."" The plan, Mr Gething said, looks at the entire range of NHS services, from primary care to emergencies and mental health services. More than 540,000 people are on NHS waiting lists in Wales, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said the huge number of people who have needed hospital treatment for coronavirus over the past 12 months has ""unfortunately led to delays to planned appointments and treatment"". He said more than 200,000 people had tested positive for coronavirus and there had been more than 30,000 coronavirus-related hospital admissions. âAs a result, we have seen waiting lists grow as people continue to be referred to hospital,â Mr Gething said. âThe list currently stands at more than 540,000. Around 60% of the list relates to new outpatient appointments."" The minister said the expansion of critical care capacity to treat seriously ill patients, combined with measures to protect people from contracting coronavirus in outpatient clinics and surgeries, had âdramatically reduced NHS capacity to see and treat peopleâ. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has confirmed that todayâs briefing would be the last of the regular three-times-a-week Welsh Government Covid press conferences ahead of the Senedd/Welsh Parliament elections in May. Last Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would hold briefings following the next two 21-day reviews of the coronavirus regulations. These will be on 1 April and 23 April, before the Senedd elections on 6 May. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has hailed ""remarkable progress"" on Covid vaccinations, saying more than half the population of Wales had now had a first dose. More than 1.6 million coronavirus jabs have now been administered in Wales after a further 21,516 new doses were given. A further 14,417 people received their first jab on Sunday, while 7,099 people were given their second dose. More than 1,273,000 people have received their first dose and 346,058 have completed a full course. It takes the total number of doses given to 1,619,244. Health Minister Vaughan Gething is about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic. You can watch the press conference live on BBC One Wales, on theBBC iPlayer, onS4Cor via the Coronavirus Update video link at the top of this page. Boris Johnson is expected to speak to his EU counterparts this week asa row over Covid vaccine suppliescontinues. EU leaders will hold a virtual meeting on Thursday to discuss a ban on Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine exports to the UK - but the PM aims to put the UK's case in one-on-one phone calls before that. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the EU can ""forbid"" vaccines made on the continent being sent to the UK. However, UK health and social care minister Helen Whately urged the EU to stand by its commitment and warned against ""vaccine nationalism and protectionism"". No further deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in the latest coronavirus figures from Public Health Wales (PHW). It means the total number of Covid deaths reported by PHW remains at 5,488. However, officials have previously pointed out that there is often a delay in reporting deaths that happen at weekends. Meanwhile, 150 new coronavirus cases have been reported in Wales. Wales' overall case rate - which measures the number of new infections per 100,000 people over a seven-day period - remains at 42. A former MP is calling for an investigation into her husband's death amid growing concern over the use of ""do not resuscitate"" (DNR) orders. Former Conwy Labour MP Betty Williams's husband Evan died at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor last April after contracting Covid. She said she had not been told about the decision on a DNR order- which she said was made the day he died - despite speaking to staff before his death. Ms Williams said neither she nor her husband had given consent for such an order. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was unable to comment on individual cases but invited Ms Williams to get in touch. However, she told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplementprogramme she had already written to the new chief executive to highlight her concerns. Â© 2025 BBC.

Andrew RT Davies said Wales had poor waiting times before the pandemic, claiming that was âthe reality of 22 years of Labour in governmentâ. He asked: âCan you seriously tell me that the current health minister is the person who could be the author of solving the problem of waiting times, when before we went into this Covid crisis we had the worse waiting times of any part of the United Kingdom?"" The leader of Plaid Cymru has welcomedthe announcement of extra investment for the NHS in Walesbut said there needed to be more staff. Adam Price said the NHS needed 1,000 additional doctors, 4,000 new nurses and another 1,000 allied health professionals over the next five years. He told BBC Wales: âThe one thing that we didn't hear much about today was the need to invest in the NHS workforce."" Mr Price said he agreed with First Minister Mark Drakefordâs criticism ofthe UK government's timetable for easing restrictions in England. He said announcing nightclubs will open on 21 June âsends out the wrong messageâ. âIt risks having an effect in terms of people's behaviour,â he said. âSo I think we've got to be very very careful that we take this step by step, and we don't undo the good work that has been achieved.â The health minister says Wales' seven health boards will need to collaborate much more after the pandemic in order to provide the necessary services. Vaughan Gething said he wants to avoid a ""postcode lottery for services"" after the pandemic. He said: ""There are a range of areas where we're expecting health boards to work locally but there's also an expectation that they're not just looking within the borders of their own health board boundary but looking to work expansively with others. ""We're going to need to see lots of collaboration across planned care as well. We can expect to see the way that elective care is delivered being delivered on a different footprint on a different basis, but that should deliver the volume and the quality will need,"" he added. People in Wales want the Welsh Government to be cautious in easing Covid restrictions, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. âThere are noises from the fringes of politics that demand to have a more ambitious and more urgent programme - a road map that is driven by dates, not data - but that isn't where the Welsh Government is and it isn't where the people of Wales are,"" he said. Mr Gething insisted that all the scientific and medical advice is telling ministers that âif we move too quickly, we could throw away all of the hard work and collective sacrifice of people in Wales and other parts of the UK"". âI think people want to know that we're doing this in a way that is responsible, that follows and respects the evidence and the science, and that's the approach that we have taken,"" he said. Recovering from the coronavirus pandemic ""will take a full Welsh Parliament term"", according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said it is therefore important to take care of NHS staff as part of that recovery. He said: ""I know there are some voices who claim that we can already be making a start to essentially go hammer and tongs at undertaking more elective [non-emergency] activity. ""And actually we know that the waiting list is likely to expand further before we're out of the pandemic - that's because as I've set out in this statement, and in others that I've made, we know that our NHS can't operate at full capacity."" Mr Gething added: ""It's actually about how we take care of our staff, how leaders behave in the expectations we set that are consistent with NHS values, but recognises how exhausted our staff are."" The impact of coronavirus has given an ""opportunity to remake and rebuild"" the healthcare system in Wales, Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. Asked if Covidâs impact on waiting times might make health inequalities worse, Mr Gething said hisNHS recovery planhas a âcomplete sectionâ on the issue. He said: âThe biggest challenges in our healthcare inequalities are about people waiting or potentially coming to harm. âIt is the case that those people more likely to come to harm are more likely from our least well-off communities.â âThat's why there's such a significant focus on healthcare inequalities in the plan, and there's an opportunity to remake and rebuild our health and care system so it becomes a generally sustainable endeavour, for the future. âThat must go alongside what we could all do to live our lives differently, and all the things outside the health service that have a direct impact on health inequalities.â Dealing with long Covid is one of the four priorities for primary care in the NHS Wales recovery plan, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said people with the condition should have care as close to home as possible, adding that a new Covid-19 evidence centre had been set up. He said: âIt will work closely with the NHS and social care to analyse the impact of coronavirus and use evidence to address new challenges. Its work programme will include research into long Covid."" Mr Gething said ministers from across the UK had agreed to work on long Covid, including research and understanding how many people are affected. Wales' health minister says there could be up to a 40% increase in demand for primary care mental health services. Vaughan Gething said this âcould translate into up to 31,000 referralsâ. He said said the mental health budget was the single largest area of spending in the NHS. âIf we are to prevent life-long mental health problems, we need to spend more on services for children and young people who are experiencing mental health issues,â he added. âHealth boards also need to do more to make easy-to-access mental health support available locally."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Government is providing an ""initial investment"" of Â£100m to help the NHS and care service in Wales recover from the pandemic. The recovery plan, published today, sets out new ways of working which includes changes for outpatients. Mr Gething said: âWe want people to be sent straight for tests before they see a consultant, instead of multiple appointments and trips to and from hospital before they have diagnostic tests. âAnd we want greater use of virtual appointments â before the pandemic only 8% of outpatient consultations were virtual; this now stands at 34% - more than one in three."" The plan, Mr Gething said, looks at the entire range of NHS services, from primary care to emergencies and mental health services. More than 540,000 people are on NHS waiting lists in Wales, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said the huge number of people who have needed hospital treatment for coronavirus over the past 12 months has ""unfortunately led to delays to planned appointments and treatment"". He said more than 200,000 people had tested positive for coronavirus and there had been more than 30,000 coronavirus-related hospital admissions. âAs a result, we have seen waiting lists grow as people continue to be referred to hospital,â Mr Gething said. âThe list currently stands at more than 540,000. Around 60% of the list relates to new outpatient appointments."" The minister said the expansion of critical care capacity to treat seriously ill patients, combined with measures to protect people from contracting coronavirus in outpatient clinics and surgeries, had âdramatically reduced NHS capacity to see and treat peopleâ. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has confirmed that todayâs briefing would be the last of the regular three-times-a-week Welsh Government Covid press conferences ahead of the Senedd/Welsh Parliament elections in May. Last Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would hold briefings following the next two 21-day reviews of the coronavirus regulations. These will be on 1 April and 23 April, before the Senedd elections on 6 May. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has hailed ""remarkable progress"" on Covid vaccinations, saying more than half the population of Wales had now had a first dose. More than 1.6 million coronavirus jabs have now been administered in Wales after a further 21,516 new doses were given. A further 14,417 people received their first jab on Sunday, while 7,099 people were given their second dose. More than 1,273,000 people have received their first dose and 346,058 have completed a full course. It takes the total number of doses given to 1,619,244. Health Minister Vaughan Gething is about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic. You can watch the press conference live on BBC One Wales, on theBBC iPlayer, onS4Cor via the Coronavirus Update video link at the top of this page. Boris Johnson is expected to speak to his EU counterparts this week asa row over Covid vaccine suppliescontinues. EU leaders will hold a virtual meeting on Thursday to discuss a ban on Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine exports to the UK - but the PM aims to put the UK's case in one-on-one phone calls before that. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the EU can ""forbid"" vaccines made on the continent being sent to the UK. However, UK health and social care minister Helen Whately urged the EU to stand by its commitment and warned against ""vaccine nationalism and protectionism"". No further deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in the latest coronavirus figures from Public Health Wales (PHW). It means the total number of Covid deaths reported by PHW remains at 5,488. However, officials have previously pointed out that there is often a delay in reporting deaths that happen at weekends. Meanwhile, 150 new coronavirus cases have been reported in Wales. Wales' overall case rate - which measures the number of new infections per 100,000 people over a seven-day period - remains at 42. A former MP is calling for an investigation into her husband's death amid growing concern over the use of ""do not resuscitate"" (DNR) orders. Former Conwy Labour MP Betty Williams's husband Evan died at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor last April after contracting Covid. She said she had not been told about the decision on a DNR order- which she said was made the day he died - despite speaking to staff before his death. Ms Williams said neither she nor her husband had given consent for such an order. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was unable to comment on individual cases but invited Ms Williams to get in touch. However, she told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplementprogramme she had already written to the new chief executive to highlight her concerns. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Boris Johnson is expected to speak to his EU counterparts this week as a row over Covid vaccine supplies continues. EU leaders will hold a virtual meeting on Thursday to discuss a ban on Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine exports to the UK - but the PM aims to put the UK's case in one-on-one phone calls before that. The European Commission president says the EU can ""forbid"" vaccines made on the continent being sent to the UK. The PM said the vaccination rollout requires ""international cooperation"". Mr Johnson said ""we are all facing the same pandemic, we all have the same problems"", as he reiterated that if cases rose on the continent,it could have a knock-on effect in the UK. Downing Street said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had told Mr Johnson earlier this year that the EU was not intending to restrict exports of vaccines. Helen Whately, health and social care minister, urged the EU to stand by this commitment and warned against ""vaccine nationalism and protectionism"". PM hails record-breaking day with 844,285 jabs EU should not 'build walls' around vaccines Why is the EU having vaccine problems? European Commission spokesperson Eric Mamer insisted that Brussels was not seeking to ban vaccine exports, but wanted pharmaceutical firms to meet their contractual obligations to the bloc. Mr Mamer said: ""In that context, the president has said that of course we see that, actually, companies that manufacture doses in the EU have been exporting very widely - which is in itself a good thing - but that we want to see reciprocity and proportionality in these exports."" The latest flashpoint appears to be over doses made in a Dutch factory. Meanwhile,the long-awaited results of the US trial of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which involved more than 32,000 volunteers, showed that the jab was safe and highly effective. Several European leaders paused rollout of the vaccine amid concerns about a possible link with blood clots. UK and EU regulators said there was no evidence the vaccine caused blood clots. European leaders have faced criticism for the slow pace of the vaccine rollout on the continent. Less than 12% of theEU's population is reported to have received the vaccine,external, compared with nearly 40% in the UK. The EU has encountered production problems with the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines. British-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca said the fact that EU contracts were signed later than with the UK caused problems with supplying their vaccine. Downing Street has previously said that it does not believe that vaccine supply issues will affect the current road map for easing lockdown restrictions. Ms Whately told BBC Breakfast the UK was ""on track"" to meet its target of offering the vaccine to the top nine priority groups by 15 April and to all adults by the end of July. There is also enough supply to ensure people have their second doses, she added. ""We always knew that there could be ups and downs in supply but we have a... diverse supply chain and we are absolutely determined to keep on deploying the vaccine,"" she said. Butthe Guardian said a report by data analysts Airfinity,externalsuggested that if an export ban was applied to all vaccines - including those from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson that are yet to be deployed in the UK - it would see the offer of a first vaccine to every adult completed in late August rather than the target date of 31 July. Ministers say that countries should work together for the benefit of everyone. Is that a hint that Boris Johnson will try to defuse this row by proposing joint working between the UK and the EU to boost vaccine production on the continent? The UK already has a team of engineers at a plant in the Netherlands. That might not be enough to satisfy the European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, who clearly wants to see doses being sent to Europe from AstraZeneca facilities in the UK. But it's not up to her - it's up to EU leaders to decide at their virtual summit on Thursday. If they decide to up the ante then the UK will have to choose whether to maintain its diplomatic silence or to retaliate. Mrs von der Leyen said that 41 million vaccine doses have been exported from the bloc to 33 countries in six weeks, with more than 10 million jabs going to the UK. She has said that, in contrast, the EU is still waiting for vaccine exports from the UK and she warned last week that if supplies in Europe do not improve, the bloc ""will reflect whether exports to countries who have higher vaccination rates than us are still proportionate"". Article 122 of the EU treaty allows measures to be taken ""if severe difficulties arise in the supply of certain products"". Those measures could in theory include export bans and the waiving of patent and intellectual property rights on vaccines. Mrs von der Leyen said this weekend that the bloc has the power to ""forbid"" exports, adding: ""That is the message to AstraZeneca."" A government source has described the latest reports from the EU as ""concerning"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the UK government was right to say that contractual obligations needed to be honoured. Sir Keir told LBC that the EU was not ""helping itself"", adding: ""I don't think that they should go down this road of banning exports."" The latest point of contention between the UK and the EU appears to be over vaccine doses being manufactured at a plant in the Netherlands, with an EU official telling Reuters that those doses should be distributed among member states, and not sent to Britain. Mr Johnson is expected to use his calls to European leaders in the first half of this week to persuade them to veto any proposal that would prevent vaccine exports from entering the UK. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel are among those likely to be on the PM's list, according to British officials quoted by theFinancial Times.,external SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:What will happen if children catch coronavirus? TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:How will I be kept safe at work? Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Sunday that theEU should not ""build walls"" around the distribution of vaccinesand should seek to meet its contractual ""obligations"". Mr Wallace told the BBC that the language being used by the European Commission was ""counterproductive"", adding: ""Trying to... build walls around this would only damage both EU citizens and United Kingdom."" EU commissioner Mairead McGuinness said that no decisions had been made over any possible export ban and urged all sides to ""calm down"". The EU row over vaccines also comes as speculation continues over whether summer holidays abroad will be permitted for those in the UK this year. Mr Wallace saidan extension on the ban on foreign holidays could not be ruled out. Meanwhile, the prime minister hailed a ""record-breaking day"" for the UK's vaccine rollout, after a combined total of844,285 first or second doses were given on Saturday, up from 711,157 on Friday. It means that more than 27.6 million people in the UK - more than half the adult population - have now received at least one dose of a vaccine.

"The BBC will show a minimum 18 matches a season live across its main channels as part of the broadcast deal The BBC will show the Women's Super League on network free-to-air TV for the first time in a ""landmark"" three-year broadcast deal. From next season, WSL games will be shown live across the BBC and Sky in the deal worth Â£7m-Â£8m per season. Remaining matches not selected for broadcast by the BBC or Sky will be shown live on FA Player. The BBC will broadcast 22 live matches, with a minimum of 18 shown on BBC One or BBC Two. Sky Sports will provide coverage of up to 44 matches screened across the Main Event, Premier League and Sky Sports Football channels. The agreements with both broadcasters will run until the summer of 2024. The Football Association's Kelly Simmons expects the deal will give the WSL a massive audience boost. ""It is one of the biggest deals commercially, definitely for women's football in terms of a domestic deal, and up there for women's sport,"" she said. ""We have benchmarks for what we think are the most successful, high-profile women's sport leagues in the world like the WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association) and the NWSL (National Women's Soccer League), and they are low hundreds of thousands in terms of an average peak per week.

England and Manchester City captain Steph Houghton told BBC Sport it was an ""amazing step forward"" for women's football and the players can't wait to ""show the world what an unbelievable league we have"". ""The way this sport has developed in this country over the last few years has been unbelievable,"" she added. ""I think this will really push our league to be the best in Europe, if not the world."" The BBC has previously shown WSL matches on the Red Button and iPlayer as well as a weekly highlights show 22 live matches on BBC TV, including a minimum of 18 on BBC One and BBC Two (remaining matches on the Red Button and online) Up to 44 live matches, with a minimum of 35, shown on Sky Sports Football, Premier League and Main Event channels Selected fixtures will also be simulcast on Sky One and Sky Sports Mix All broadcasters will have rights to online coverage, in-play clips and highlights (WSL clubs also have rights to in-play clips and highlights) Remaining matches not selected for broadcast shown live on FA Player There will be one free-to-air game on BBC every weekend, with Sky having two other picks Selected matches expected to be scheduled on Friday 18:30 GMT, Saturday 11:30 GMT, Sunday 12:30 GMT and Sunday 18:30 GMT 75% of investment revenue to go to WSL clubs, 25% to the Women's Championship Simmons, the FA's director of the women's professional game, said the deal combined two major priorities for the FA: increasing visibility of the WSL, as well as attracting investment to further develop the quality of the league. ""We just desperately want more and better. It's always about looking forward and trying to fix the things that we're not happy with. This feels like one of those real step-change moments for the women's game,"" said Simmons. ""The work we do now will be to project those future revenues down the line. We always said to the clubs to believe and invest and now this will be the start of seeing that there's an ability for the game to take profits and [move away from] reliance, long term, on the men's game. ""It's going to be hugely visible next season. I'm sure it'll inspire thousands and thousands of girls to play the game so I just can't wait."" Kathryn Swarbrick, the FA's commercial and marketing director, added: ""This is a moment to celebrate - a watershed moment in the WSL future - with just an incredible outlook. ""That reach, combined with this huge investment into the game, makes us really confident that this is going to be a huge leap forward in achieving our ambition of having the world's best domestic women's professional league."" Manchester United's Christen Press (right) was one of a number of USA World Cup winners who joined the WSL in the summer The FA said it expects the audience figures to be ""significantly above"" the most successful and ""high-profile"" women's domestic sport leagues in the world. They also said it is ""definitely"" the biggest commercial broadcast agreement in women's football. ""We're going to be broadcasting more live games, reaching a bigger audience and bringing in more revenue than any other women's domestic league in the world,"" said Swarbrick. ""I think that is a pretty big testament to the strength of the product that the WSL now is.""

""We're attracting players from all over the world but at the same time, English players in this league are testing themselves against the best,"" said Houghton. ""The standard of the league is increasing and that's mainly because people are training full-time.

"This video can not be played Bury councillor Tamoor Tariq shares his experience of catching coronavirus twice A councillor who issued a stark warning from his sick bed a year ago for people to start taking Covid-19 seriously says he has ""still not fully recovered"". Bury Council deputy leader Tamoor Tariq collapsed and was taken to hospital just before the UK's first lockdown. Gasping for breath in his 2020 YouTube video, he warned it was not just the old or clinically vulnerable at risk. Mr Tariq, 31, said he contracted coronavirus again in December and felt ""fortunate"" to have survived. The Bury Council deputy leader has urged people to get vaccinated When he first fell ill last year Mr Tariq said he struggled to talk about Covid because he ""felt so drained"". But the Labour councillor said he felt compelled to sound the alarm at a time when some commentators were wrongly downplaying the severity of the novel coronavirus. Mr Tariq said his message - that someone with no serious health issues could still become severely ill or even die with Covid - really ""hit home"" with his community. ""It was an awful experience,"" he told the BBC. ""It hit me hard, and that shook people up. ""There were very few cases here then and people underestimated it, including me."" This video can not be played Tamoor Tariq warned of the dangers of Covid in March 2020 Mr Tariq said it took him weeks to even be able to walk downstairs again and said his energy levels had still not recovered when he contracted the virus for a second time. ""It was 26 December and I knew from the symptoms I had it again - even before I got a positive test,"" he said. He recalled a nurse telling him last March if he did get the virus again it would not be so severe. ""It wasn't, but my wife, sister and my mum all got it so it was a very worrying time,"" he added. Mr Tariq said his 55-year-old mother ended up in hospital before recovering. Nearly three months after his second bout of Covid, he said he could still only manage 2km when he goes running, as opposed to the 5km he used to run routinely. Mr Tariq's mother was initially very sceptical about having the Covid vaccine Mr Tariq has been campaigning for more members of the black, Asian and minority ethnic communities to accept the vaccine, organising events to dispel false information circulating about it and helping to set up a pop-up jab clinic at the Jinnah Day Care Centre in Bury. ""It is our duty to protect ourselves and our loved ones, and the NHS,"" he said. The cause is one he feels passionately about, not least because he initially failed to convince his mother to have the jab. He said she had fallen for ""myths"" and false information spread on social media about the vaccine. To his relief a staff member at Bury Council managed to reassure her enough that she has now been vaccinated. Reflecting on what has been a harrowing 12 months, Mr Tariq said: ""I feel very fortunate that myself and my family have all recovered and I am so pleased and proud of the incredible vaccine roll-out.""

At least 32 fines were issued in Merthyr Tydfil, as South Wales Police dealt with a total of 1,500 incidents over the weekend. One officer said Saturday was ""one of the busiest days of 2021"" for the force. Police, health officials and politicians had all warned people against gathering to watch the match in case it led to a spike in Covid infections. Residents of an Anglesey townhave been urged to get tested for coronavirus after a surge in cases. According to Sunday's figures from Public Health Wales, Holyhead had a seven-day coronavirus infection rate of 466.5 cases per 100,000 people - compared to an average of just 42 across the whole of Wales. There have been 50 cases in the town in the past week. Anglesey has the second highest infection rate of any Welsh local authority area, behind Merthyr Tydfil. The leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd has welcomeda recovery plan for the NHS in Walesbut questioned whether Welsh Labour could deliver it. Andrew RT Davies said Wales had poor waiting times before the pandemic, claiming that was âthe reality of 22 years of Labour in governmentâ. He asked: âCan you seriously tell me that the current health minister is the person who could be the author of solving the problem of waiting times, when before we went into this Covid crisis we had the worse waiting times of any part of the United Kingdom?"" The leader of Plaid Cymru has welcomedthe announcement of extra investment for the NHS in Walesbut said there needed to be more staff. Adam Price said the NHS needed 1,000 additional doctors, 4,000 new nurses and another 1,000 allied health professionals over the next five years. He told BBC Wales: âThe one thing that we didn't hear much about today was the need to invest in the NHS workforce."" Mr Price said he agreed with First Minister Mark Drakefordâs criticism ofthe UK government's timetable for easing restrictions in England. He said announcing nightclubs will open on 21 June âsends out the wrong messageâ. âIt risks having an effect in terms of people's behaviour,â he said. âSo I think we've got to be very very careful that we take this step by step, and we don't undo the good work that has been achieved.â The health minister says Wales' seven health boards will need to collaborate much more after the pandemic in order to provide the necessary services. Vaughan Gething said he wants to avoid a ""postcode lottery for services"" after the pandemic. He said: ""There are a range of areas where we're expecting health boards to work locally but there's also an expectation that they're not just looking within the borders of their own health board boundary but looking to work expansively with others. ""We're going to need to see lots of collaboration across planned care as well. We can expect to see the way that elective care is delivered being delivered on a different footprint on a different basis, but that should deliver the volume and the quality will need,"" he added. People in Wales want the Welsh Government to be cautious in easing Covid restrictions, Health Minister Vaughan Gething has said. âThere are noises from the fringes of politics that demand to have a more ambitious and more urgent programme - a road map that is driven by dates, not data - but that isn't where the Welsh Government is and it isn't where the people of Wales are,"" he said. Mr Gething insisted that all the scientific and medical advice is telling ministers that âif we move too quickly, we could throw away all of the hard work and collective sacrifice of people in Wales and other parts of the UK"". âI think people want to know that we're doing this in a way that is responsible, that follows and respects the evidence and the science, and that's the approach that we have taken,"" he said. Recovering from the coronavirus pandemic ""will take a full Welsh Parliament term"", according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said it is therefore important to take care of NHS staff as part of that recovery. He said: ""I know there are some voices who claim that we can already be making a start to essentially go hammer and tongs at undertaking more elective [non-emergency] activity. ""And actually we know that the waiting list is likely to expand further before we're out of the pandemic - that's because as I've set out in this statement, and in others that I've made, we know that our NHS can't operate at full capacity."" Mr Gething added: ""It's actually about how we take care of our staff, how leaders behave in the expectations we set that are consistent with NHS values, but recognises how exhausted our staff are."" The impact of coronavirus has given an ""opportunity to remake and rebuild"" the healthcare system in Wales, Health Minister Vaughan Gething says. Asked if Covidâs impact on waiting times might make health inequalities worse, Mr Gething said hisNHS recovery planhas a âcomplete sectionâ on the issue. He said: âThe biggest challenges in our healthcare inequalities are about people waiting or potentially coming to harm. âIt is the case that those people more likely to come to harm are more likely from our least well-off communities.â âThat's why there's such a significant focus on healthcare inequalities in the plan, and there's an opportunity to remake and rebuild our health and care system so it becomes a generally sustainable endeavour, for the future. âThat must go alongside what we could all do to live our lives differently, and all the things outside the health service that have a direct impact on health inequalities.â Dealing with long Covid is one of the four priorities for primary care in the NHS Wales recovery plan, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said people with the condition should have care as close to home as possible, adding that a new Covid-19 evidence centre had been set up. He said: âIt will work closely with the NHS and social care to analyse the impact of coronavirus and use evidence to address new challenges. Its work programme will include research into long Covid."" Mr Gething said ministers from across the UK had agreed to work on long Covid, including research and understanding how many people are affected. Wales' health minister says there could be up to a 40% increase in demand for primary care mental health services. Vaughan Gething said this âcould translate into up to 31,000 referralsâ. He said said the mental health budget was the single largest area of spending in the NHS. âIf we are to prevent life-long mental health problems, we need to spend more on services for children and young people who are experiencing mental health issues,â he added. âHealth boards also need to do more to make easy-to-access mental health support available locally."" Health Minister Vaughan Gething says the Welsh Government is providing an ""initial investment"" of Â£100m to help the NHS and care service in Wales recover from the pandemic. The recovery plan, published today, sets out new ways of working which includes changes for outpatients. Mr Gething said: âWe want people to be sent straight for tests before they see a consultant, instead of multiple appointments and trips to and from hospital before they have diagnostic tests. âAnd we want greater use of virtual appointments â before the pandemic only 8% of outpatient consultations were virtual; this now stands at 34% - more than one in three."" The plan, Mr Gething said, looks at the entire range of NHS services, from primary care to emergencies and mental health services. More than 540,000 people are on NHS waiting lists in Wales, according to the health minister. Vaughan Gething said the huge number of people who have needed hospital treatment for coronavirus over the past 12 months has ""unfortunately led to delays to planned appointments and treatment"". He said more than 200,000 people had tested positive for coronavirus and there had been more than 30,000 coronavirus-related hospital admissions. âAs a result, we have seen waiting lists grow as people continue to be referred to hospital,â Mr Gething said. âThe list currently stands at more than 540,000. Around 60% of the list relates to new outpatient appointments."" The minister said the expansion of critical care capacity to treat seriously ill patients, combined with measures to protect people from contracting coronavirus in outpatient clinics and surgeries, had âdramatically reduced NHS capacity to see and treat peopleâ. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has confirmed that todayâs briefing would be the last of the regular three-times-a-week Welsh Government Covid press conferences ahead of the Senedd/Welsh Parliament elections in May. Last Friday, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he would hold briefings following the next two 21-day reviews of the coronavirus regulations. These will be on 1 April and 23 April, before the Senedd elections on 6 May. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has hailed ""remarkable progress"" on Covid vaccinations, saying more than half the population of Wales had now had a first dose. More than 1.6 million coronavirus jabs have now been administered in Wales after a further 21,516 new doses were given. A further 14,417 people received their first jab on Sunday, while 7,099 people were given their second dose. More than 1,273,000 people have received their first dose and 346,058 have completed a full course. It takes the total number of doses given to 1,619,244. Health Minister Vaughan Gething is about to give a Welsh Government update on the pandemic. You can watch the press conference live on BBC One Wales, on theBBC iPlayer, onS4Cor via the Coronavirus Update video link at the top of this page. Boris Johnson is expected to speak to his EU counterparts this week asa row over Covid vaccine suppliescontinues. EU leaders will hold a virtual meeting on Thursday to discuss a ban on Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine exports to the UK - but the PM aims to put the UK's case in one-on-one phone calls before that. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says the EU can ""forbid"" vaccines made on the continent being sent to the UK. However, UK health and social care minister Helen Whately urged the EU to stand by its commitment and warned against ""vaccine nationalism and protectionism"". No further deaths of people with coronavirus have been reported in the latest coronavirus figures from Public Health Wales (PHW). It means the total number of Covid deaths reported by PHW remains at 5,488. However, officials have previously pointed out that there is often a delay in reporting deaths that happen at weekends. Meanwhile, 150 new coronavirus cases have been reported in Wales. Wales' overall case rate - which measures the number of new infections per 100,000 people over a seven-day period - remains at 42. A former MP is calling for an investigation into her husband's death amid growing concern over the use of ""do not resuscitate"" (DNR) orders. Former Conwy Labour MP Betty Williams's husband Evan died at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor last April after contracting Covid. She said she had not been told about the decision on a DNR order- which she said was made the day he died - despite speaking to staff before his death. Ms Williams said neither she nor her husband had given consent for such an order. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said it was unable to comment on individual cases but invited Ms Williams to get in touch. However, she told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplementprogramme she had already written to the new chief executive to highlight her concerns. Â© 2025 BBC.

"This video can not be played Neighbours filmed one couple's home being carried along by flash floods in Taree north of Sydney Some 18,000 people have been evacuated from severe floods across New South Wales (NSW) in Australia, with more heavy rainfall predicted. The state's entire coast is now under a severe weather warning. Days of torrential downpours have caused rivers and dams to overflow around Sydney - the state capital - and in south-east Queensland. The military is being deployed to help with search and rescue, in what has been called a ""one-in-50-years event"". Australia's Bureau of Meteorology has forecast ""increased rainfall, strong winds, damaging surf and abnormally high tides"" in New South Wales on Tuesday. It also said that some 10 million people across every state and territory except Western Australia were now under a weather warning. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said no deaths had been reported by late Monday - describing it as ""a miracle given what we have been through"". But there has been widespread damage in the affected areas, which are home to about a third of Australia's 25 million people. In pictures: Australia's 'one-in-a-50-year' flood Ms Berejiklian said many of the communities ""being battered by the floods"" had been affected by bushfires and drought the previous summer. ""I don't know any time in state history where we have had these extreme weather conditions in such quick succession in the middle of a pandemic,"" she said. PM Scott Morrison has offered funds for those forced to evacuate. He told parliament there was ""serious risk still ahead"". Swollen rivers cut off roads and bridges, and almost 200 schools in NSW will remain shut on Tuesday. People in more than 15 mostly low-lying areas have been ordered to evacuate and a similar number have been given evacuation warnings. This infant was rescued alongside another child, four adults and three dogs in Sydney's west An order requires people to seek shelter with family or friends well away from flood impacted areas,external, or in a special centre. The warning tells people to prepare for an evacuation order. Areas north and west of Sydney, the NSW Central Coast and the Hawkesbury valley have been of particular concern. There have been some 15,000 evacuations from the Mid-North Coast and a further 3,000 in Sydney, officials said. The Australian Defence Force will provide search and rescue helicopters on Tuesday, after a request from the NSW government. PM Morrison told MPs: ""Across NSW, 1,400 first responders have conducted over 700 flood rescues and responded to over 7,500 requests for assistance."" He added: ""This is an ongoing situation that is evolving and is extremely dangerous."" One stranded family was lifted from their flooded home by a helicopter. Responders also saved a family with a baby from flooding in their home in Sydney's west. There have been images of dead wildlife, livestock floating through flooded areas and rows of houses engulfed up to their windows. The Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers - which border Sydney to the north and west - reached higher levels on Monday than during a devastating flood in 1961. Meanwhile, the Warragamba Dam, Sydney's main water source, began spilling over for the first time in five years. It reached a peak daily discharge on Sunday of 500 gigalitres - equivalent to the volume of Sydney Harbour - before falling back to 300 GL on Monday. On Sunday a young couplesaw their house north of Sydney swept away by flash floods on what should have been their wedding day. Shocked neighbours filmed the uprooted three-bedroom cottage bobbing along the Manning river after it burst its banks. Parramatta River, in central suburban Sydney, broke its banks and flooded the ferry wharf In Port Macquarie's North Shore, one resident was filmed dragging a stingray through what was his front lawn. In south-east Queensland, flash floods also affected Brisbane and the Gold Coast at the weekend. Conditions in many areas of New South Wales are expected to worsen, with officials warning that two weather systems could collide, creating a ""last blast"" of rain and storms going into Wednesday. The Bureau of Meteorology said heavy rainfall would affect the whole NSW coast and several inland areas on Tuesday, bringing a ""serious risk"" of flash flooding. ""This situation is far from over,"" it tweeted. But it added: ""Most areas of New South Wales will see a clearing trend early Wednesday as a drier airmass moves into the region."" It alsosent out a tweet saying 10 million Australians were now under a weather warning,external- affecting an area the size of Alaska. The bureau said the rainfall so far - up to 90cm in some areas - had been ""extraordinary"", with many areas across NSW resembling an ""inland sea"". Allow Twitter content?

Ms Berejiklian, the NSW premier, said: ""What we're going through now is different to what you've been through for the last 50 years, so please take it seriously."" Jamisontown resident Ellen Brabin told ABC News that she had not seen floods as severe as this in more than 40 years. ""I've seen all the floods and stuff, and never had to move before so this is different,"" she said. The intense summer of rain and floods in eastern Australia is a stark contrast to a year ago, when many of the same areas were scorched by mammoth bushfires and ravaged by drought. This side of the continent is currently experiencing a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during summer. Two of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La NiÃ±a events. Typically a La NiÃ±a sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia. Scientists say that climate change is also intensifying La NiÃ±a's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic. Are you in the affected region?

"Non-essential aisles had previously been closed off or covered Supermarkets can sell non-essential items and garden centres can open in Wales from Monday in a further slight easing of Covid lockdown rules. Shops that have already been open, but had non-essential aisles cordoned off, can now sell anything, but shops that only sell non-essential items will remain closed until 12 April. Garden centres will open their doors to customers for the first timesince lockdown began in December. Shops must have strict Covid protocols. They are the latest restrictions to be lifted as Wales' coronavirus case rate has fallen below 50 per 100,000 people and the national Covid positivity rate is below 5% - bothunder the lockdown threshold. Dates for Welsh gym and outdoor hospitality opening plan Welsh tourism reopening decision 'will be last moment' Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? All primary and some secondary school children have returned to the classroom while four people from two different households can now meet outdoors, including in gardens, as the stay-at-home rule was relaxed to a stay local one. Wales' dates for easing Covid lockdown restrictions in the retail sector First Minister Mark Drakeford and the Welsh government have also said more industries could be reopened or considered for reopening if Covid cases rates and test positivity rates remained low. From 27 March, if case rates remain low: Libraries and self-contained accommodation could reopen, but you can only holiday with people from your own household Organised children's activities could restart Stay local restrictions could be lifted From 12 April, if case rates remain low: All shops and remaining close-contact services could resume On 22 April Ministers will consider whengyms and outdoor hospitality in Walescan reopen in its lockdown review Staff from the Fron Goch Garden Centre are looking forward to welcoming customers back Afterhairdressers reopened for appointmentslast week, the reopening of non-essential aisles in supermarkets and garden centres welcoming customers is Wales' latest step towards reopening after being shut for three months. Justin Williams is looking forward to opening Fron Goch Garden Centre near Caernarfon and believes services like his can help people's wellbeing. ""Gardening is important for mental health,"" he said. ""It's important to have an outside or inside space for growing plants or vegetables. It's something to do with the kids but also something for people of any age to get involved with. It also encourages people to stay home and be safe."" Garden centrebosses across Wales have been frustratedbeing shut while centres in England have remained open. Plans are being put in place as parts of society begin to reopen ""We were frustrated this hadn't been recognised in Wales like in England but are happy that's changing now,"" Mr Williams added. ""There's been a lot of interest in us opening. People have been quite lonely without much support, it will be good to get people out and see guests in the garden."" Manynon-essential retailers thought they would be allowed to openwhen hairdressers did on 15 March, but were ""frustrated and disappointed"" they could not open until English non-essential retailers did on 12 April. Welsh ministers said the move to allow supermarkets to start selling non-essential items again while other shops remain shutwas seen as ""the least risky"" Covid rules relaxationas supermarkets were already open. The Welsh Retail Consortium previously said the industry was losing Â£100m in revenue every week while non-essential shops such as clothes outlets and bookshops were shut. Chepstow Bookshop in Monmouthshire will not be able to open next week while the supermarket and high street newsagents nearby will be allowed to sell non-essentials items such as books. ""I can understand why the Welsh government has done it,"" said Matt Taylor, who has owned the 40-year-old book store for 15 years. In pre-Covid times, Chepstow Bookshop had celebrity book signings including fitness guru Joe Wicks ""It's great we've been on a level playing field for so long, although there are a few frustrations."" Mr Taylor's shop, which has been shut for six of the past 12 months, offers click and collect and home delivery but he estimates trade is ""two-thirds"" of what it was the previous year while ""working twice as hard"". ""The thing people seem to miss the most about coming into independent shops like ours is customers not knowing what they want, it's that browsing experience. And in this pandemic, books have given people a refuge or an escape from it all."" Monmouthshire has the third-lowest Covid case rate of Wales' 22 local authorities - behind Ceredigion and Bridgend - and Leeann Davies, who owns Village Treats in Magor, was ""gutted"" her sweet shop didn't open at the same time as hairdressers. ""It seems like along with the pubs and restaurants, we're the only ones not open,"" she said. ""Some of these supermarkets are getting record profits as they've no competition whereas even when we're open, we don't have the amount of customers they do - and we have strict Covid procedures. ""But I understand we're non-essential and you can't differentiate between my little shop and a big store in a city centre."" Leeann Davies has run her sweet shop Village Treats in her local village for almost six years Mr Davies said her her business would not have survived the coronavirus crisis without government support - but does have hope for the future. ""After the first lockdown and, as so many people are working from home, we were the busiest we'd ever been,"" she said. ""Communities have really got behind supporting local businesses and if more people continue to work from home after the pandemic, maybe local shops like ours may have a really encouraging futures.""

"All businesses in Guernsey can return to operating as normal Guernsey has removed the majority of its Covid-19 restrictions for the second time during the pandemic. The island's first coronavirus lockdown lasted for 88 days between 24 March and 20 June 2020, with this second lockdown lasting 57 days. Businesses in Guernsey and Herm can return to normal, with no social distancing or mask requirements. However, all arrivals into the bailiwick are still required to self-isolate for at least two weeks. Since the lockdown started on 23 January, 569 cases of the virus have been found in the islands and one person hasdied with the virus. During the pandemic the islands have seen a total of 821 known cases and 14 Covid-related deaths. The higher number of cases in the second lockdown has been put down to improved testing capability as well as themore virulent nature of the Kent variant detected in the island. Peter Ferbrache, chairman of the Civil Contingencies Authority, described the move out of lockdown as a ""huge achievement"" and thanked islanders for sticking to lockdown rules. He said: ""We protected our health service, kept our vaccine programme moving forward and prevented a much higher loss of life."" With more than29,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines distributed,external, 44 doses per 100 people have been administered to Guernsey residents. People walked through town in Guernsey without face coverings This means 30% of over-16s have had one dose, with 11% having received both. By Euan Duncan, BBC Channel Islands News Music played on Monday afternoon in St Peter Port as people walked through town with a spring in their step and a smile on their face. Almost all chose not to wear face coverings, and groups of islanders gathered to catch up again after two months of lockdown restrictions. Spring naturally provides some hope of better days to come and this optimism was a contagious feeling around others thinking similarly. The freedoms now afforded to residents are not taken for granted or lightly, there is simply relief that better days are ahead of us all. Deputy Ferbrache emphasised that while border restrictions will remain in place for a ""little while longer"", he said the success of the island's vaccination programme meant the island was ""getting closer to that tipping point"" where some travel could resume. ""We have good reason to be optimistic as we look forward,"" he added. Sark and Alderney moved out of lockdown on 4 March and 9 March respectively and have lifted quarantine requirements on people coming from Guernsey. Non-essential travel to the bailiwick has resumed, but arrivals are still obliged to self-isolate for two weeks and be tested on days one and 13 after arrival.

Peter Ferbrache, chairman of the Civil Contingencies Authority, described the move out of lockdown as a ""huge achievement"" and thanked islanders for sticking to lockdown rules. He said: ""We protected our health service, kept our vaccine programme moving forward and prevented a much higher loss of life."" With more than29,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines distributed,external, 44 doses per 100 people have been administered to Guernsey residents. People walked through town in Guernsey without face coverings This means 30% of over-16s have had one dose, with 11% having received both. By Euan Duncan, BBC Channel Islands News Music played on Monday afternoon in St Peter Port as people walked through town with a spring in their step and a smile on their face. Almost all chose not to wear face coverings, and groups of islanders gathered to catch up again after two months of lockdown restrictions. Spring naturally provides some hope of better days to come and this optimism was a contagious feeling around others thinking similarly. The freedoms now afforded to residents are not taken for granted or lightly, there is simply relief that better days are ahead of us all. Deputy Ferbrache emphasised that while border restrictions will remain in place for a ""little while longer"", he said the success of the island's vaccination programme meant the island was ""getting closer to that tipping point"" where some travel could resume. ""We have good reason to be optimistic as we look forward,"" he added. Sark and Alderney moved out of lockdown on 4 March and 9 March respectively and have lifted quarantine requirements on people coming from Guernsey. Non-essential travel to the bailiwick has resumed, but arrivals are still obliged to self-isolate for two weeks and be tested on days one and 13 after arrival. Anyone who declines to be tested must self isolate for 21 days. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"The masterplan to help people upgrade the UKâs homes has been âbotchedâ and must be urgently overhauled, MPs say. The environmental audit select committee says the Green Homes Grant (GHG), which offers people up to Â£10,000 for insulation, is so inept that it is actually damaging the building sector. It adds that 19 million UK homes are poorly insulated and accuses ministers of âfailing to grasp"" the challenge. The government says it is ""committed to going further and faster"". But the MPs warn that unless urgent action is taken to improve energy efficiency of homes this decade, the UK will fail to meet its climate targets. That is because the UKâs housing stock accounts for 20% of its carbon emissions through heating, hot water and cooking. The MPs said the scheme had ""only achieved 10% of its target to improve 600,000 homes in six months"". Free home insulation: Too good to be true? MPs criticise government home insulation programme Sunak to unveil Â£2bn home insulation scheme It has been rumoured that the Treasury wants to scrap the GHG scheme, but the committee says the system needs to be reformed, not abolished. And crucially, the MPs insist, the grants need long-term funding so there is time to build a supply chain of materials, and a well-trained workforce. The government is preparing a Heat and Buildings Strategy, and has previously denied wanting to scrap the scheme. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said over 33,000 GHG vouchers worth more than Â£142m have already been issued, helping to improve the energy efficiency of homes. The GHG scheme went awry because too many householders were chasing too few installers. There were also delays in the grant payments which have left many installers out of pocket. The report says: âThe impact of botched implementation of the GHG has had devastating consequences on many of the builders and installers that can do the work, who have been left in limbo as a result of the orders cancelled and time taken to approve applications."" The committee also warns that the government may have underestimated the costs to decarbonise UK homes by 2050, by between Â£35bn and Â£65bn. It says these figures do not include properties with solid walls, or those in conservation areas, which could make energy efficiency installations more challenging â and increase the bill. âThe GHG scheme should not be scrapped or quietly wound down,"" said the select committee's chairman Philip Dunne. âThe government must address the design and administration issues, and all funding not spent by the end of March 2021 should be rolled over into the next financial year. âGovernment investment to improve energy efficiency has been woefully inadequate. The Â£9bn the government pledged at the election was welcome, but 16 months on, there appears to be no plan nor meaningful delivery."" Don't raid green homes scheme, MPs urge ministers Government 'not checking' if green taxes work Brian Berry, from the Federation of Master Builders, told the committee: âThe market needs certainty because small companies are not going to invest unless they know there is a long-term market. âIf we want to tackle energy efficiency in our homes, we need to give encouragement to these small companies that this is not just a flash in the pan, it is not going to be a repeat of the previous Green Deal [for housing loans, which was scrapped]. âThis is a 20-year programme to transform our existing homes.â Insulation campaigner Dr Joanne Wade said: âThe committee is right to call for a âgenuine long-term stimulus to the domestic energy efficiency sectorâ â it is something that we have repeatedly urged government to do. âIf we donât do this, we wonât achieve net zero.â Jess Ralston from the Energy and Climate Information Unit added: âThe benefits of getting this right are crystal clear; hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs, lower bills, less carbon and more comfortable homes. The only barrier to climate-proofing our homes is government inaction. âWith a recent litany of policy decisions undermining the UKâs credibility on climate ahead of this yearâs crucial COP26 summit, it would be a mistake to add another to the list.â The BEIS spokesman said: ""The UK has a strong track record in improving the energy performance of its homes. ""However, we âare committed to going further and faster, and are investing Â£9bn in improving the energy efficiency of our buildings, while creating hundreds of thousands of skilled green jobs. ""This includes funding for the first hydrogen powered houses and allocating more than Â£500m this year alone to improve the energy efficiency of 50,000 households in social and local authority housing across the UK, as we work to eliminate our contribution to climate change by 2050.""

"Jair Bolsonaro has been widely criticised over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has described as ""tyrants"" state governors and mayors who have imposed lockdowns to contain the coronavirus outbreak. Addressing supporters at his birthday celebrations in Brasilia, he said his government had done all it could and it was now time to reopen the economy. Last week, the country's leadinghealth institute Fiocruz warned of a historic collapse of Brazil's health service. It said intensive care units in hospitals were running out of capacity. Brazil Covid surge reaches critical new peak Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Mr Bolsonaro, who was 66 on Sunday, has consistently opposed quarantine measures, arguing that the collateral damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the virus itself. Earlier this month,the president told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the pandemic. Mr Bolsonaro's handling of the outbreak has triggered widespread criticism both home and abroad. Brazil's intensive care units are struggling to cope with a new influx of patients In a separate development, Brazil's health ministry said on Sunday it was lifting its requirement for local authorities to reserve half their vaccine stockpiles for second doses. Outgoing Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello said the aim was to get at least one vaccine dose to the maximum number of people as fast as possible, according to the AFP news agency. Brazil has been struggling with the rollout of its vaccination programme across the vast country. So far, it has been using the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and China's CoronaVac, both of which require two jabs. Brazil has also placed orders for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Johnson & Johnson and Sputnik V vaccines. Brazil has the world's second-highest number of Covid-related deaths - only behind the US. More than 294,000 people have died since the start of the pandemic, with nearly 12 million confirmed infections, according to America's Johns Hopkins University. More than 2,200 people on average are dying of Covid in Brazil daily. The latest surge in cases has been attributed to the spread of highly contagious variants of the virus. In last week's statement [in Portuguese], Fiocruz warned the situation was ""extremely critical in the entire country"",external. ""The analysis by our researchers suggests it's the biggest collapse of the hospital and health service in Brazil's history."" Covid-19 units in all but two of Brazil's 27 states were at or above 80% capacity, according to Fiocruz. In Rio Grande do Sul, the institute said, there were no intensive care beds available at all.

"This video can not be played Protesters clashed with police and threw fireworks into the crowd Protesters have attacked police after thousands of people turned up to a demonstration that officers had ""strongly advised"" against attending. Officers suffered broken bones and police vans were set alight as angry scenes unfolded in Bristol city centre. Crowds had gathered for the Kill the Bill demonstration in opposition to thePolice and Crime Bill. Demonstrators scaled a police station, threw fireworks into the crowd and daubed graffiti on the walls. Home Secretary Priti Patel described the events as ""unacceptable"". ""Thuggery and disorder by a minority will never be tolerated,"" she said. ""Our police officers put themselves in harm's way to protect us all."" Avon and Somerset Police said what had started ""as a peaceful protest"" had been ""turned by a small minority into a violent disorder"". Two police vehicles were set on fire, damage was caused to a police station, one officer suffered a broken arm and another suffered broken ribs, the force added. Police vehicles were set alight as scene turned ugly A protester smashes the window of Bridewell Police Station Protesters watch a police van burn By Joanna Prior, BBC News At the beginning of the night the mood was generally lively but not aggressive. There was broken glass across the road and some people had climbed on top of traffic lights but there was no police intervention. The dense crowd eventually splintered, with some moving away to carry on drinking and listen to music. The atmosphere among those who remained became more volatile. Riot police in full protective gear formed a barricade in front of the station, but the officers didn't engage with the protesters at all. They stood by as their shields and vans were daubed with graffiti - some of it profane and some of it hostile towards the police themselves and Home Secretary Priti Patel. Then the atmosphere took a marked turn when the first police vehicle was set on fire. Huge plumes of black smoke rose up from Bridewell Street. A small number of protesters jumped on to the roof of a second police van, thumping on the glass as the officers tried to reverse. Objects were being thrown by protesters into the crowd and still the police did not move from their positions. As well as the police vehicles set on fire, others were smashed up and their tyres let down as the crowd chanted ""shame on you"". Police said perpetrators would be ""identified and brought to justice"". It is not clear if any arrests have been made but a spokesman for Avon and Somerset Police said there would be ""significant consequences for behaviour such as this"". Police in riot gear pushed back against a crowd in Bristol city centre Protesters scaled the police station roof and threw fireworks into the crowd Fireworks exploded in the middle of the demonstration Avon and Somerset Police Federation chairman Andy Roebuck said: ""This is the worst violence in Bristol for many, many years. ""It's really unprecedented violence. Between four and six or possibly more officers are seriously injured and some have broken bones. ""No-one had any indication it would erupt this way."" Bristol mayor Marvin Rees said he recognised ""the frustrations"" with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill but said that ""smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the bill going through"". Thangam Debbonaire, shadow housing secretary and MP for Bristol West,added,external: ""The scenes of violence and direct attack on the police in Bristol city centre will distress most people, including anyone who believes in defending the right to peaceful democratic protest."" Darren Jones, Labour MP for Bristol North West,tweeted,externalthat the scenes in the city were ""completely unacceptable"". ""You don't campaign for the right to peaceful protest by setting police vans on fire or graffitiing buildings,"" he said. Videos on Twitter showed protesters rocking and kicking a police van while officers on horseback were pushed by the crowd. ""Officers are continuing to deal with a smaller number of protesters in Bridewell Street,"" a police spokesman said earlier. ""They've had projectiles thrown at them, including a firework, and have been verbally abused. ""This is unacceptable behaviour and those responsible for offences will be identified and brought to justice."" Protesters climbed on top of a police van which was later rocked by a crowd of demonstrators Graffiti was daubed on police vehicles and fireworks thrown Campaigners have staged a string of protests against the bill, which would give the police more powers to deal with non-violent demonstrations. Many attendees in Bristol wore face masks and carried placards with slogans such as: ""Say no to UK police state"", ""Freedom to protest is fundamental to democracy"", and ""Kill the Bill"". Avon and Somerset Police had encouraged people to stay away from the demo and attend virtual protests instead. Mass gatherings are currently banned under coronavirus legislation and anyone breaching regulations could be fined, though someMPs have said the law should change to allow protests. This weekend has seen a number of protests and demonstrations, with campaigners gathering in support of various causes. The day started with thousands turning up to protest against the Police and Crime Bill despite mass gatherings being against current lockdown rules The protest began peacefully before later turning violent Under coronavirus legislation, people can only leave their for a small number of permitted reasons and police point out that attending a protest is not among them Have you witnessed the protests?

"Non-essential aisles had previously been closed off or covered Supermarkets can sell non-essential items and garden centres can open in Wales from Monday in a further slight easing of Covid lockdown rules. Shops that have already been open, but had non-essential aisles cordoned off, can now sell anything, but shops that only sell non-essential items will remain closed until 12 April. Garden centres will open their doors to customers for the first timesince lockdown began in December. Shops must have strict Covid protocols. They are the latest restrictions to be lifted as Wales' coronavirus case rate has fallen below 50 per 100,000 people and the national Covid positivity rate is below 5% - bothunder the lockdown threshold. Dates for Welsh gym and outdoor hospitality opening plan Welsh tourism reopening decision 'will be last moment' Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? All primary and some secondary school children have returned to the classroom while four people from two different households can now meet outdoors, including in gardens, as the stay-at-home rule was relaxed to a stay local one. Wales' dates for easing Covid lockdown restrictions in the retail sector First Minister Mark Drakeford and the Welsh government have also said more industries could be reopened or considered for reopening if Covid cases rates and test positivity rates remained low. From 27 March, if case rates remain low: Libraries and self-contained accommodation could reopen, but you can only holiday with people from your own household Organised children's activities could restart Stay local restrictions could be lifted From 12 April, if case rates remain low: All shops and remaining close-contact services could resume On 22 April Ministers will consider whengyms and outdoor hospitality in Walescan reopen in its lockdown review Staff from the Fron Goch Garden Centre are looking forward to welcoming customers back Afterhairdressers reopened for appointmentslast week, the reopening of non-essential aisles in supermarkets and garden centres welcoming customers is Wales' latest step towards reopening after being shut for three months. Justin Williams is looking forward to opening Fron Goch Garden Centre near Caernarfon and believes services like his can help people's wellbeing. ""Gardening is important for mental health,"" he said. ""It's important to have an outside or inside space for growing plants or vegetables. It's something to do with the kids but also something for people of any age to get involved with. It also encourages people to stay home and be safe."" Garden centrebosses across Wales have been frustratedbeing shut while centres in England have remained open. Plans are being put in place as parts of society begin to reopen ""We were frustrated this hadn't been recognised in Wales like in England but are happy that's changing now,"" Mr Williams added. ""There's been a lot of interest in us opening. People have been quite lonely without much support, it will be good to get people out and see guests in the garden."" Manynon-essential retailers thought they would be allowed to openwhen hairdressers did on 15 March, but were ""frustrated and disappointed"" they could not open until English non-essential retailers did on 12 April. Welsh ministers said the move to allow supermarkets to start selling non-essential items again while other shops remain shutwas seen as ""the least risky"" Covid rules relaxationas supermarkets were already open. The Welsh Retail Consortium previously said the industry was losing Â£100m in revenue every week while non-essential shops such as clothes outlets and bookshops were shut. Chepstow Bookshop in Monmouthshire will not be able to open next week while the supermarket and high street newsagents nearby will be allowed to sell non-essentials items such as books. ""I can understand why the Welsh government has done it,"" said Matt Taylor, who has owned the 40-year-old book store for 15 years. In pre-Covid times, Chepstow Bookshop had celebrity book signings including fitness guru Joe Wicks ""It's great we've been on a level playing field for so long, although there are a few frustrations."" Mr Taylor's shop, which has been shut for six of the past 12 months, offers click and collect and home delivery but he estimates trade is ""two-thirds"" of what it was the previous year while ""working twice as hard"". ""The thing people seem to miss the most about coming into independent shops like ours is customers not knowing what they want, it's that browsing experience. And in this pandemic, books have given people a refuge or an escape from it all."" Monmouthshire has the third-lowest Covid case rate of Wales' 22 local authorities - behind Ceredigion and Bridgend - and Leeann Davies, who owns Village Treats in Magor, was ""gutted"" her sweet shop didn't open at the same time as hairdressers. ""It seems like along with the pubs and restaurants, we're the only ones not open,"" she said. ""Some of these supermarkets are getting record profits as they've no competition whereas even when we're open, we don't have the amount of customers they do - and we have strict Covid procedures. ""But I understand we're non-essential and you can't differentiate between my little shop and a big store in a city centre."" Leeann Davies has run her sweet shop Village Treats in her local village for almost six years Mr Davies said her her business would not have survived the coronavirus crisis without government support - but does have hope for the future. ""After the first lockdown and, as so many people are working from home, we were the busiest we'd ever been,"" she said. ""Communities have really got behind supporting local businesses and if more people continue to work from home after the pandemic, maybe local shops like ours may have a really encouraging futures.""

"This video can not be played Neighbours filmed one couple's home being carried along by flash floods in Taree north of Sydney Some 18,000 people have been evacuated from severe floods across New South Wales (NSW) in Australia, with more heavy rainfall predicted. The state's entire coast is now under a severe weather warning. Days of torrential downpours have caused rivers and dams to overflow around Sydney - the state capital - and in south-east Queensland. The military is being deployed to help with search and rescue, in what has been called a ""one-in-50-years event"". Australia's Bureau of Meteorology has forecast ""increased rainfall, strong winds, damaging surf and abnormally high tides"" in New South Wales on Tuesday. It also said that some 10 million people across every state and territory except Western Australia were now under a weather warning. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said no deaths had been reported by late Monday - describing it as ""a miracle given what we have been through"". But there has been widespread damage in the affected areas, which are home to about a third of Australia's 25 million people. In pictures: Australia's 'one-in-a-50-year' flood Ms Berejiklian said many of the communities ""being battered by the floods"" had been affected by bushfires and drought the previous summer. ""I don't know any time in state history where we have had these extreme weather conditions in such quick succession in the middle of a pandemic,"" she said. PM Scott Morrison has offered funds for those forced to evacuate. He told parliament there was ""serious risk still ahead"". Swollen rivers cut off roads and bridges, and almost 200 schools in NSW will remain shut on Tuesday. People in more than 15 mostly low-lying areas have been ordered to evacuate and a similar number have been given evacuation warnings. This infant was rescued alongside another child, four adults and three dogs in Sydney's west An order requires people to seek shelter with family or friends well away from flood impacted areas,external, or in a special centre. The warning tells people to prepare for an evacuation order. Areas north and west of Sydney, the NSW Central Coast and the Hawkesbury valley have been of particular concern. There have been some 15,000 evacuations from the Mid-North Coast and a further 3,000 in Sydney, officials said. The Australian Defence Force will provide search and rescue helicopters on Tuesday, after a request from the NSW government. PM Morrison told MPs: ""Across NSW, 1,400 first responders have conducted over 700 flood rescues and responded to over 7,500 requests for assistance."" He added: ""This is an ongoing situation that is evolving and is extremely dangerous."" One stranded family was lifted from their flooded home by a helicopter. Responders also saved a family with a baby from flooding in their home in Sydney's west. There have been images of dead wildlife, livestock floating through flooded areas and rows of houses engulfed up to their windows. The Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers - which border Sydney to the north and west - reached higher levels on Monday than during a devastating flood in 1961. Meanwhile, the Warragamba Dam, Sydney's main water source, began spilling over for the first time in five years. It reached a peak daily discharge on Sunday of 500 gigalitres - equivalent to the volume of Sydney Harbour - before falling back to 300 GL on Monday. On Sunday a young couplesaw their house north of Sydney swept away by flash floods on what should have been their wedding day. Shocked neighbours filmed the uprooted three-bedroom cottage bobbing along the Manning river after it burst its banks. Parramatta River, in central suburban Sydney, broke its banks and flooded the ferry wharf In Port Macquarie's North Shore, one resident was filmed dragging a stingray through what was his front lawn. In south-east Queensland, flash floods also affected Brisbane and the Gold Coast at the weekend. Conditions in many areas of New South Wales are expected to worsen, with officials warning that two weather systems could collide, creating a ""last blast"" of rain and storms going into Wednesday. The Bureau of Meteorology said heavy rainfall would affect the whole NSW coast and several inland areas on Tuesday, bringing a ""serious risk"" of flash flooding. ""This situation is far from over,"" it tweeted. But it added: ""Most areas of New South Wales will see a clearing trend early Wednesday as a drier airmass moves into the region."" It alsosent out a tweet saying 10 million Australians were now under a weather warning,external- affecting an area the size of Alaska. The bureau said the rainfall so far - up to 90cm in some areas - had been ""extraordinary"", with many areas across NSW resembling an ""inland sea"". Allow Twitter content?

Ms Berejiklian, the NSW premier, said: ""What we're going through now is different to what you've been through for the last 50 years, so please take it seriously."" Jamisontown resident Ellen Brabin told ABC News that she had not seen floods as severe as this in more than 40 years. ""I've seen all the floods and stuff, and never had to move before so this is different,"" she said. The intense summer of rain and floods in eastern Australia is a stark contrast to a year ago, when many of the same areas were scorched by mammoth bushfires and ravaged by drought. This side of the continent is currently experiencing a La NiÃ±a weather pattern, which typically brings more rainfall and tropical cyclones during summer. Two of Australia's three wettest years on record have been during La NiÃ±a events. Typically a La NiÃ±a sees a 20% increase in average rainfall from December to March in eastern Australia. Scientists say that climate change is also intensifying La NiÃ±a's impact, and making weather patterns more erratic. Are you in the affected region?

"Voters in Mitzpe Ramon are hoping this election will break a succession of deadlocks The town of Mitzpe Ramon is recovering from its isolation in the desert. Often the inhabitants had only themselves and their crater for company. The population of 5,211 lives on a cliff edge above a naturally formed chasm in the Negev desert - a site of stunning beauty that entices tourists. But the visitors vanished amid the Covid closures. The lockdown laid waste to work for the tour guides. In Israel, joblessness has soared. The country suffered badly as the virus surged last year and there were claims of government blunders. Then came a dramatically swift vaccine rollout. A battered economy is starting to reopen. Many of these things were weighing on Israel's already crisis-hit coalition, when gridlock triggered yet another election. There are not many tourists to be seen these days in Mitzpe Ramon But in Mitzpe - the town whose name means ""lookout"" - no-one seems to be watching much. The streets don't echo with the sound of political rallying. Election posters are as unlikely to be seen as foreign tourists. Instead there's a desert wind and weariness. The same bitter divisions over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership - splits formed years ago - look set to play the major role in Tuesday's poll, the fourth since 2019. ""It's no, no, no to Bibi and his friends,"" says Boaz Katz, who runs Desert Prime tours. He has seen business drop by two-thirds since the start of the pandemic. Netanyahu trial: What are the allegations? Netanyahu: Commando turned PM He steers his 4x4 over rocks into the crater's core, hinting at worries shared by many Israelis. ""I think about the future a lot and it spooks me to see Benjamin Netanyahu and his natural companions - I want to live in a free, democratic country,"" says Mr Katz, who used to vote for Mr Netanyahu's Likud party. Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking a clear mandate, but polls suggest results could be tight The prime minister has been met with protests over his desire to rewire parts of the justice system while on trial for corruption. Others oppose his long-standing pact with ultra-religious parties. The tour guide scratches a heart shape in the sand and explains the landscape. The crater was not formed by an asteroid smashing into Earth. Instead, it was scoured out over millennia through water erosion, as torrents eviscerated soft rock. Likewise, those who rival for Israel's leadership feel they are fighting an unstoppable force. The last election with no winner led to an ""emergency coalition"" to fight the pandemic. Mr Netanyahu's rival Benny Gantz - a former general and political novice - agreed to a rotating premiership. But Mr Gantz never got to take his turn. The remnants of his Blue and White party are facing near wipe-out, according to opinion polls. The drive back into town passes the only shopping centre. There's a queue at the shawarma restaurant. Others sit inside a franchise coffee shop, masks on. Business is also back by the crater. Rachel Amsalem lives on the edge. Her home close to the clifftop is covered in Israeli flags. Rachel Amsalem credits Israel's achievements to Mr Netanyahu A Likud cap rests on a rail in the porch, ready for outings when she faces off against the ""black flag"" protesters who oppose Mr Netanyahu. ""He doesn't sleep. He is the guardian of Israel,"" says Mrs Amsalem, borrowing a biblical phrase. She knew him decades ago, working as a maid in the Netanyahu family home in Jerusalem. Her parents fled Algeria in the 1940s. Decades later, she came to Mitzpe Ramon, a development town providing low-cost homes for Jewish immigrants, many from Arab countries. The community now forms a base of working-class support for Mr Netanyahu. Mrs Amsalem credits him with the speedy vaccine deal helping bring the pandemic under control. Last year, her daughter-in-law, also called Rachel, died with Covid-19. ""Nobody else has the courage to pick up the phone and call [vaccine-maker] Pfizer,"" she says. ""He works day and night, whether it's [the diplomatic deals] with Arab countries, [countering] Iran, on corona, on the economyâ¦ there's one person we should say thanks to."" But Mr Netanyahu's opponents have instead been scrambling to find another viable challenger to him. The ""anti-Bibi"" bloc now includes a former ally-turned-rival, Gideon Saar, who left Likud. Many more opposition votes are being soaked up by the centrist party led by a former TV host, Yair Lapid. The outcome could rest on how smaller parties do. In an unlikely move, Mr Netanyahu has tried to get support from Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up a fifth of the population. A drive further north in the Negev - al-Naqab in Arabic - reveals deep scepticism over the motives of a politician who once warned his base to get to the polling stations as ""the Arabs are voting in droves"". ""We all know he is lying to people,"" says Huda Abu Obaid, a community organiser in the Bedouin town of Lakiya. Huda Abu Obaid: Benjamin Netanyahu ""has been the worst one for us"" She believes Mr Netanyahu wants to further divide support for a group of Arab parties, which could strengthen his hand in coalition building. ""We know very well that he was the worst one for us, for the Arab community, and I think that he will not change himself,"" she says. The sun is setting back by the crater where the Mitzpe Ramon desert circus school - closed for much of the last year - is warming up. A juggler appears at the cliff edge.

"The masterplan to help people upgrade the UKâs homes has been âbotchedâ and must be urgently overhauled, MPs say. The environmental audit select committee says the Green Homes Grant (GHG), which offers people up to Â£10,000 for insulation, is so inept that it is actually damaging the building sector. It adds that 19 million UK homes are poorly insulated and accuses ministers of âfailing to grasp"" the challenge. The government says it is ""committed to going further and faster"". But the MPs warn that unless urgent action is taken to improve energy efficiency of homes this decade, the UK will fail to meet its climate targets. That is because the UKâs housing stock accounts for 20% of its carbon emissions through heating, hot water and cooking. The MPs said the scheme had ""only achieved 10% of its target to improve 600,000 homes in six months"". Free home insulation: Too good to be true? MPs criticise government home insulation programme Sunak to unveil Â£2bn home insulation scheme It has been rumoured that the Treasury wants to scrap the GHG scheme, but the committee says the system needs to be reformed, not abolished. And crucially, the MPs insist, the grants need long-term funding so there is time to build a supply chain of materials, and a well-trained workforce. The government is preparing a Heat and Buildings Strategy, and has previously denied wanting to scrap the scheme. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said over 33,000 GHG vouchers worth more than Â£142m have already been issued, helping to improve the energy efficiency of homes. The GHG scheme went awry because too many householders were chasing too few installers. There were also delays in the grant payments which have left many installers out of pocket. The report says: âThe impact of botched implementation of the GHG has had devastating consequences on many of the builders and installers that can do the work, who have been left in limbo as a result of the orders cancelled and time taken to approve applications."" The committee also warns that the government may have underestimated the costs to decarbonise UK homes by 2050, by between Â£35bn and Â£65bn. It says these figures do not include properties with solid walls, or those in conservation areas, which could make energy efficiency installations more challenging â and increase the bill. âThe GHG scheme should not be scrapped or quietly wound down,"" said the select committee's chairman Philip Dunne. âThe government must address the design and administration issues, and all funding not spent by the end of March 2021 should be rolled over into the next financial year. âGovernment investment to improve energy efficiency has been woefully inadequate. The Â£9bn the government pledged at the election was welcome, but 16 months on, there appears to be no plan nor meaningful delivery."" Don't raid green homes scheme, MPs urge ministers Government 'not checking' if green taxes work Brian Berry, from the Federation of Master Builders, told the committee: âThe market needs certainty because small companies are not going to invest unless they know there is a long-term market. âIf we want to tackle energy efficiency in our homes, we need to give encouragement to these small companies that this is not just a flash in the pan, it is not going to be a repeat of the previous Green Deal [for housing loans, which was scrapped]. âThis is a 20-year programme to transform our existing homes.â Insulation campaigner Dr Joanne Wade said: âThe committee is right to call for a âgenuine long-term stimulus to the domestic energy efficiency sectorâ â it is something that we have repeatedly urged government to do. âIf we donât do this, we wonât achieve net zero.â Jess Ralston from the Energy and Climate Information Unit added: âThe benefits of getting this right are crystal clear; hundreds of thousands of skilled jobs, lower bills, less carbon and more comfortable homes. The only barrier to climate-proofing our homes is government inaction. âWith a recent litany of policy decisions undermining the UKâs credibility on climate ahead of this yearâs crucial COP26 summit, it would be a mistake to add another to the list.â The BEIS spokesman said: ""The UK has a strong track record in improving the energy performance of its homes. ""However, we âare committed to going further and faster, and are investing Â£9bn in improving the energy efficiency of our buildings, while creating hundreds of thousands of skilled green jobs. ""This includes funding for the first hydrogen powered houses and allocating more than Â£500m this year alone to improve the energy efficiency of 50,000 households in social and local authority housing across the UK, as we work to eliminate our contribution to climate change by 2050.""

"This video can not be played FA Cup: Leicester City 3-1 Manchester United highlights Leicester City reached their first FA Cup semi-final for 39 years with a fully deserved win over Manchester United at King Power Stadium. Brendan Rodgers' side will face Southampton at Wembley with Chelsea and Manchester City meeting in the other semi-final. Leicester, who lost to eventual winners Tottenham in the 1982 semi-final, were the more vibrant and positive team against off-colour United as manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer once again tasted defeat in the latter stages of a cup competition, his ploy of resting the likes of Bruno Fernandes and Luke Shaw failing to produce the desired result. The Foxes' hero was in-form striker Kelechi Iheanacho, who struck twice and now has nine goals in nine games. He took advantage of Fred's awful backpass to round Dean Henderson to score in the 24th minute after the hapless Brazilian was played into trouble by captain Harry Maguire. Mason Greenwood crowned a crisp United move to equalise before half-time but Youri Tielemans restored Leicester City's lead with a fine low shot seven minutes after the break before Iheanacho took advantage of shocking marking at a free-kick to head in Leicester's third after 78 minutes. 'It is in Man Utd manager's job description to win trophies' Man Utd's Fred subjected to racist abuse Can you name Leicester and Man Utd starting XIs from 2016? Injuries have robbed Leicester of the creative edge provided by James Maddison and Harvey Barnes, as well as the defensive excellence of James Justin, but they still had too much for miserable Manchester United here. And it was fitting that the two players who got the goals to secure that precious semi-final place, and only their second win over United in 23 years, were Iheanacho and Tielemans - the Foxes' two most influential performers. Iheanacho has had mixed fortunes since his Â£25m move from Manchester City in August 2017 but it is testimony to the player's own attitude and persistence, alongside the patience and coaching of manager Rodgers, that he has re-emerged as such an influential figure. He has always had the natural scorer's instinct but here he provided goals and link-up play while the cultured Belgian Tielemans was the architect of most good things. Leicester City will now face Southampton - the team they beat 9-0 at St Mary's last season - but the prize at stake is now so enticing it is unlikely there will be a hint of complacency from Rodgers and his players. There could have been nerves when Jamie Vardy missed the sort of opportunity he normally gobbles up at 2-1 but there was no wavering in self-belief and Iheanacho's second sealed the deal. Leicester are in a very favourable position in the Premier League's top four and now have an FA Cup semi-final to look forward to in what is shaping up to be a potentially memorable season. Solskjaer rolled the dice with his team selection, leaving two of his outstanding recent performers Bruno Fernandes and Luke Shaw on the bench. It backfired as United produced a lacklustre, error-strewn display, the flaws in Solskjaer's plan made clear by the desperate decision to introduce four substitutes - Fernandes, Shaw, Edinson Cavani and Scott McTominay - in one full hit after 64 minutes. He kept faith with Fred amid all this despite the Brazilian being central to their struggles, especially when he gifted Iheanacho his first - although he was put out of his misery later. United have shown progress this season but Solskjaer can now add an FA Cup quarter-final loss to his four semi-final defeats since taking charge at Old Trafford - and he can have no complaints here. Solskjaer's team were uninspired, with captain Maguire having a torrid time with the pace and running of Iheanacho and Vardy. Maguire must also take his share of the blame for a high-risk pass that played Fred into a measure of jeopardy for Leicester's opener. United look safe in the Premier League's top four and have a favourable Europa League quarter-final draw against Granada from Spain but this was once again a very disappointing performance when the prize for the winners was an FA Cup semi-final against Southampton. Leicester City have reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time since 1981-82 - they had lost five consecutive FA Cup quarter-final matches before today. Manchester United have lost an away match against English opposition for the first time in 30 matches, with the previous such defeat coming against Liverpool in January 2020. This was Leicester's first victory in 14 attempts against Manchester United, since beating them 5-3 in a Premier League match in September 2014. Leicester City have beaten both Manchester United and Manchester City in a single campaign for the first time since 1975-76. Brendan Rodgers took charge of his 100th match as Leicester manager, earning his 53rd win; his 53% win rate as Leicester boss is his best for any English side. Since the start of last season, Mason Greenwood has scored 22 goals in all competitions, the most by a teenager for clubs in the top five European leagues over this period. Kelechi Iheanacho has scored 16 goals in 22 starts in English domestic cup competitions, including 11 in 11 in the FA Cup. Kelechi Iheanacho has scored 13 goals in 18 FA Cup games, the most of any player in the competition since making his debut in January 2016. Leicester City manager Brendan Rodgers to BBC Sport:""I'm obviously delighted. It was a great team performance. Every aspect of the game was complete. We showed courage to play football against one of Europe's greatest teams. I'm so happy for the players. I thought we thoroughly deserved it. ""Kelechi has always contributed. Maybe his confidence was lower but he works so hard every day and always comes in and gives his all. You see his confidence now. He's at the top of his game. It's a different structure [up front]. Kelechi is probably best with someone up there with him. Those two are working very well. ""Our solidity and intensity of press was very good. When we dropped into our shape we denied them space. To beat Manchester United 3-1 you have to be complete in all aspects of the game and the players did that. ""[The semi-final] is a way off yet. I told the players they were three games from history. Now it's two. We're making the right steps, we're on the right path. We're very ambitious to be the best we can be. That's the challenge and it's the test we're enjoying."" Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to BBC Sport:""We didn't have the spark tonight - but it's understandable. This team have been fantastic in the last three or four months. We played every three days and been on a great run. It just caught up with us - all the games and travels. Thursday night in Milan was a big night and took a lot of out of us physically. We didn't have the extra zip, authority and confidence. ""We tried to get on the front foot and start well because sometimes you can get that adrenaline boost and confidence if you get a goal and that can carry you over the line. We've got too many players that have played too many games and too many that haven't really had much football; Anthony Martial, Donny van de Beek, Paul Pogba and others are trying to get in who haven't had enough football. We didn't have enough against a tough team. ""When we win, we win together and when we lose, we lose together. We're not pointing fingers and blaming - the second one is a good goal by the boy but maybe with a zip of energy we could've got to him and wouldn't have been done as easily in the middle. ""We've got the Europa League and Premier League to concentrate on - yes, we would've liked to go to Wembley but now the focus is on the games we have. We're in a good position in the league and we want to keep improving. Of course Leicester are just behind us so it won't be easy but we want to keep going and get as far as possible in the Europa as well."" On changing the line-up, Solskjaer added: ""I would've done the same again, the changes were necessary to do. We knew Paul [Pogba] wouldn't last more than an hour and I don't think I would do anything differently. What goes on behind the scenes isn't always known.""

"Turkey's currency tumbled as much as 15% after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan sacked the country's central bank governor over the weekend. Naci Agbal had been credited as a key force in pulling the lira back from historic lows. Mr Erdogan replaced him in a surprise move on Saturday, the third central bank governor exit in under two years. Mr Agbal, appointed in November, had been raising interest rates to fight an inflation rate running above 15%. The removal has shocked both local and foreign investors who had praised Turkey's central bank's recent monetary policy. The appointment of Sahap Kavcioglu, a former banker and ruling party lawmaker, sparked concerns of a reversal of recent rate hikes. The fallout from the sacking hit shares on the Istanbul stock exchange, and raised concerns about the impact Turkey's borrowing costs. Trading on the exchange was suspended for a period after a sharp fall in share prices triggered automatic circuit breakers. After dropping sharply, the lira then recovered some ground to stand about 8% lower against the US dollar after Finance Minister Lutfi Elvan said Turkey would stick to free market rules. US condemns Turkey for quitting violence treaty  Turkey moves to ban pro-Kurdish opposition party ""The authorities will be left with two choices, either it pledges to use interest rates to stabilise markets, or it imposes capital controls,"" said Per Hammarlund, senior strategist at SEB Research. ""Given the increasingly authoritarian approach that President Erdogan has taken, capital controls are looking like the most likely choice."" The lira was at one point the best performing emerging-market currency of 2021, having recovered almost a fifth from a low against the US dollar. Last week, the Turkish currency rose strongly after Mr Agbal increased interest rates by 2 percentage points, double what economists expected. Investors have been calling for tighter monetary policy in Turkey to tame its high inflation rate, as prices rise rapidly in the country. There are now concerns that Mr Erdogan's decision to install Mr Kavcioglu in the role could erode the gains made during Mr Agbal's short tenure. Mr Kavcioglu is a little-known professor of banking and a former lawmaker from the ruling Justice and Development party. He shares Mr Erdogan's unorthodox view that high interest rates can fuel inflation. Turkey's interest rate stands at 19% which has attracted foreign investors to park their cash in the currency. In a statement on Sunday, the central bank said it ""will continue to use the monetary policy tools effectively in line with its main objective of achieving a permanent fall in inflation"". Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at currency exchange firm Oanda said that President Erdogan has his own brand of economics - Erdonomics. ""The base premise of Erdonomics is that higher interest rates cause higher inflation, a theory that flies in the face of conventional economic theory everywhere,"" Mr Halley told the BBC. Higher interest rates lead to higher costs of borrowing which deters consumers from over-spending, while encouraging people to save. However, the downside is often slower economic growth. ""Mr Agbal was widely respected for his attempts to stabilise inflation."" Ulrich Leuchtmann, head of foreign exchange at Commerzbank, said: ""It may well be that interest rate hikes are once again permitted by Mr Erdogan in a phase of crisis-like lira depreciation but the recent developments should have shown currency traders that even then a sustainable monetary policy regime change is not to be expected."" ""The calming effect of interest rate hikes has probably been largely destroyed.""
