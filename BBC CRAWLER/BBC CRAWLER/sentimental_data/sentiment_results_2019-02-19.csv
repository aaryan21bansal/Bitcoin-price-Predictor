"This video can not be played Honda Europe boss Ian Howells says the decision was driven by big changes in the industry Honda has confirmed it will close its Swindon car plant in 2021, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. The Japanese company builds 160,000 Honda Civics a year in Swindon, its only car factory in the EU. Honda said the move was due to global changes in the car industry and the need to launch electric vehicles, and it had nothing to do with Brexit. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the decision was ""devastating"" for Swindon and the UK. A fall in demand for diesel cars and tougher emissions regulations have shaken up the car industry. Honda workers 'betrayed' by Swindon plant closure Ian Howells, senior vice-president for Honda in Europe, told the BBC: ""We're seeing unprecedented change in the industry on a global scale. We have to move very swiftly to electrification of our vehicles because of demand of our customers and legislation. ""This is not a Brexit-related issue for us, it's being made on the global-related changes I've spoken about. ""We've always seen Brexit as something we'll get through, but these changes globally are something we will have to respond to. We deeply regret the impact it will have on the Swindon community.""  3,500total employees in Swindon 160,000Honda Civic cars built annually at the plant 90%of production sold to the UK, Europe and US 1989start of industrial operations Mr Howells said that, in the light of changes in the industry, the company had to ""look very closely"" at where it was putting its investment. The company sells many more vehicles in North America, Japan and China than it does in Europe. ""It has to be in a marketplace of a size for Honda, where it makes investment worthwhile. ""The conclusion coming out of that is that that doesn't include Swindon - the relative size of the marketplace in Europe is significantly different."" Honda said it would begin consulting immediately about the proposed closure with potentially affected employees. A union source told the BBC that Honda had sent the workforce at its Swindon factory home for the day. Honda also announced it would stop making the Civic at its plant in Turkey in 2021. Its European HQ will continue to be located in the UK after the changes. Earlier this month, Nissan switched plans to build its X-Trail SUV from the UK to Japan. At that time the firm's Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said that ""the continued uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future"". Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter Honda says the Swindon closure is not Brexit-related. Is this the unvarnished truth, or is the company simply trying to avoid a political storm? Honda has in the past been vocal about the difficulties a disorderly Brexit would bring, and the timing of the announcement, a little more than a month before the UK leaves the European Union, is curious. But the Honda statement makes no mention of Brexit at all, instead pointing to the greater forces that are reshaping the car industry. Honda is not, on the world stage, a big player, being dwarfed by the likes of Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors and Ford. It needs to find the resources to invest in electric power plants and autonomous vehicles - a strain that has already led to its larger rivals closing plants and cutting jobs. Honda said it needed to invest in these new frontiers and concentrate its production resources where it could be sure there would be high volumes. Swindon, which has had one of its two production lines shut for several years and which makes only 160,000 cars a year, does not fit that future. Nor does an even smaller plant in Turkey. Brexit issues may be lurking in the background, but Honda's real reasons for closing Swindon are about the future of the global car industry, not Britain's future relationship with Europe. Nissan Â£60m in doubt after investment U-turn Panasonic to move European HQ from UK Sony to shift EU headquarters to avoid Brexit disruption Jaguar Land Rover posts Â£3.4bn loss The EU and Japan recently struck a trade deal which lowers tariffs on both parties' car exports to zero. BBC business editorSimon Jack said the trade deal means there is a dwindling rationaleto base manufacturing inside the EU. He said production at Swindon had also been in decline for some time, with the plant currently running at about half its capacity. Business Secretary Greg Clark said he would convene a taskforce with local MPs, civic and business leaders, as well as trade union representatives, to help Honda workers get new skilled jobs. ""The automotive industry is undergoing a rapid transition to new technology,"" he said. ""The UK is one of the leaders in the development of these technologies and so it is deeply disappointing that this decision has been taken now."" Alan Tomala from Unite said the scale of job losses was ""enormous"" Unite union official Alan Tomala said employees at the Swindon factory felt ""betrayed"" by the closure announcement. ""They feel that the company owes them a little more than hearing the news in the media. ""I left work yesterday to 57 missed calls and around 130 emails, and not one from Honda.  It surprises me and I'm angered by it."" Outside the factory gates, employee Chris, whose son also works at the plant, told the BBC he was ""extremely disappointed"". ""I've been here 19 years and it's devastating for all involved,"" he said. ""You've only got to look across the road at the large warehouses here too, I don't know what the jobs will be replaced with."" Local employment agencies have begun setting up meetings to prepare employees. Kath Curr, managing director of C&D Recruitment in Swindon, said the closure was ""devastating for the town as a whole"", but Honda workers' skills were ""completely transferrable"" . In a joint statement, Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Phil Smith, chief executive of Business West, and Paul Britton, chief executive of Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the planned closure of the Swindon plant would have a major impact, not only on Honda staff but also on the company's supply chain. ""Given the size of the operation, there will be a wide and diverse network of regional suppliers that will now be hugely concerned about their future business prospects. ""Employers, government and local authorities must do all they can to deliver tangible assistance and guidance for the people and communities that will be affected by an announcement of this scale,"" they added.

"This video can not be played ""We're going to win"": Bernie Sanders on what's different this time US Senator Bernie Sanders says he will run again for president in 2020, making a second attempt to win the Democratic Party's nomination. The 77-year-old Vermont senator became a progressive political star in 2016 although he lost his candidacy bid. His campaign says it raised $1m (Â£777,000) within three and half hours of launching. An outspoken critic of President Donald Trump, Mr Sanders has described him as a ""pathological liar"" and ""racist"". Mr Sanders - an independent who caucuses with the Democrats - is one of the best-known names to join a crowded and diverse field of Democratic candidates, and early polls suggest he is far ahead. Who is Bernie Sanders? Which Democrats are running in 2020? The lessons Democrats can learn for 2020 His calls for universal government-provided healthcare, a $15 national minimum wage and free college education electrified young voters, raised millions of dollars in small donations and are now pillars of the party's left wing. Mr Sanders, who lost the 2016 Democratic primary to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, said in his email: ""Three years ago, when we talked about these and other ideas, we were told that they were 'radical' and 'extreme'. ""Together, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution. Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for."" Mr Trump, speaking to White House reporters on Tuesday, wished Mr Sanders well on his second bid. ""Personally I think he missed his time,"" the president said. ""But I wish Bernie well. It will be interesting to see how he does."" ""He ran great four years ago and he was not treated with respect by [Hillary] Clinton and that was too bad,"" he added. The president added that he liked Mr Sanders as they both have been ""tough on trade"". After building a grass-roots political movement that roiled the Democratic Party in 2016, Bernie Sanders is making another run at the prize. This time, he won't be the rumpled underdog. He'll start the race near the front of the pack - with advantages in small-donor fundraising, name recognition and a 50-state organisation of loyalists. His front-runner status will come with a price, however. Unlike 2016, when Hillary Clinton largely avoided confronting the Vermont senator for fear of alienating his supporters, his opponents will have no such reluctance this time. In 2016, the self-proclaimed ""Democratic socialist"" staked out a progressive agenda in contrast with Ms Clinton's pragmatic centrism. Now, in part because of Mr Sanders's efforts, the party has moved left on issues like healthcare, education and income inequality. His message is no longer unique. The senator will keep his devoted base, but will some former supporters opt for a fresh face? That could lead to conflict with those who believe a Bernie ""revolution"" is the only way forward, inflaming Democratic wounds not fully healed from the last campaign. In a crowded field, Mr Sanders has a realistic shot - but it could be a bumpy ride. Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris, John Delaney and Julian Castro are among those who have also announced their intention to run in the Democratic primary in 2020, the first time more than one woman has competed. If Mr Sanders is successful in his bid, he will become the oldest presidential candidate in US history. In his email, which lays out a series of policy issues, Mr Sanders also says: ""You know as well as I do that we are living in a pivotal and dangerous moment in American history. ""We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction."" In response to the announcement, Trump campaign national press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said: ""Bernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism. ""But the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela."" Mr Sanders speaks at a Committee on Racial Equality Sit-In in 1962 Mr Sanders is the longest-serving independent in congressional history, but competes for the Democratic nomination as he says standing as a third-party candidate would diminish his chances of winning the presidency. He attended the University of Chicago, and in the 1960s and 1970s participated in anti-war and civil rights activism, likethe 1963 March on Washington. 17 things Bernie Sanders believes The Sanders brothers: A tale of two underdogs He was first elected to the House of Representatives in 1990, the first independent to achieve such a feat in 40 years. He served there until he ran for and won a seat in the Senate in 2007. Mr Sanders entered the race for the 2016 Democratic nomination as a long-shot candidate but emerged as a surprise star during a series of televised debates. He labels himself a Democratic socialist, which he has defined as someone who seeks to ""create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy"". Mr Sanders also has a diplomacy-first attitude towards foreign policy and voted against the US invasion of Iraq in 2002. Mr Sanders attracted a large amount of younger voters during his 2016 campaign He became Mrs Clinton's closest rival, but she ultimately won the nomination before losing the presidential election to Mr Trump. In January,Mr Sanders apologised to female staff members on his 2016 campaignafter allegations of harassment against senior aides emerged. Several aides complained of a ""predatory culture"" in his campaign and alleged that senior male staff had mistreated younger workers.

"Alesha MacPhail was holidaying on the Isle of Bute where her body was found The 16-year-old accused of murdering Alesha MacPhail has told a jury he did not kill the child. The teenager also denied abducting and raping the six-year-old, who had been holidaying on the Isle of Bute. The boy, who cannot be named because he is under 18, told the High Court trial: ""I have never met Alesha MacPhail."" The body of the schoolgirl, who died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck, was discovered in a wooded area on 2 July last year. Alesha, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, was only days into a summer break in Rothesay when she was killed. At the High Court in Glasgow, the teenager has lodged a special defence claiming the crime was committed by 18-year-old Toni McLachlan, the girlfriend of the victim's father. The accused claimed he had sex with Ms McLachlan, who then planted his DNA - from a used condom - at the scene. In previous evidence, Ms McLachlan insisted she did not have sex with the accused and had nothing to do with Alesha's death. The boy was called as the first witness for the defence after the prosecution closed its case. The teenager said he had been having sex with Ms McLachlan ""fairly frequently"". He said that from October 2017 they were ""friends with benefits"" and were ""meeting up, having sex, smoking joints"". This arrangement lasted most of the winter and stopped when he got back together with a former girlfriend, the court heard. He said that early on 2 July, he and Ms McLachlan were messaging on Instagram, and he had asked her for cannabis. She said she had none, but asked if he wanted to meet for a cigarette. The accused said they met in a shelter outside the home where she was staying with Mr MacPhail, Alesha and her grandparents, then went to a garage and had sex, before going their separate ways. The teenager said that out of concern for Ms McLachlan, he had lied to his mother and the police about having had sex. Defence QC Brian McConnachie asked the accused about a video he posted on social media that day which showed the top half of his body with the written message ""found who done it"". He replied: ""It was a video of my feet walking to the bathroom and the camera points up to the mirror and I pretend to get a fright and it says 'found who done it'."" Asked why he did that, he said: ""People were talking about who might have done it and one of my friends said my name and I didn't want to take it to heart so I just thought I would build on it."" Mr McConnachie said: ""You were making people know you were responsible."" The accused replied: ""No, we didn't even know it was a murder at that time, we were just speculating."" Questioned about messages he exchanged with a friend where he says he might ""kill one day for the lifetime experience"", he said these were ""not serious"". The teenager has lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming Ms McLachlan. In her evidence at the trial, Ms McLachlan denied being responsible for Alesha's death, saying she ""loved"" Alesha. She also denied suggestions by the defence that she had sex with the accused on 2 July, then planted his semen on Alesha, before ""attacking and brutalising her"" and murdering her. Under cross examination Iain McSporran QC, for the prosecution, put it to the accused that it would be ""extraordinarily wicked"" for someone to falsely allege Ms McLachlan abducted, raped and murdered Alesha. The teenager replied: ""It would be evil."" Mr McSporran later put it to the witness that it was either him or Ms McLachlan who was responsible. The accused replied: ""It is not me. ""Absolutely not. ""I could never do something like that."" The 16-year-old was also questioned about his strength and revealed he could bench press 50kg. The court was told Alesha weighed 22kg. The trial previously heard forensic evidence that Alesha's unmarked feet proved she had been carried to her death. The witness said he had no idea if Ms McLachlan could have carried the child. Mr McSporran replied: ""You could have."" The accused replied: ""I have never carried weights such a distance before."" Earlier the prosecution closed its case withevidence from forensic scientist Stuart Bailey. He told the court DNA found on Alesha's body matched the 16-year-old accused of her murder. Mr Bailey told the jury that the odds of the intimate samples belonging to anyone else were more than a billion to one. Samples of DNA matching the accused were also found on the child's body and clothing. The trial, before judge Lord Matthews, continues. DNA found on Alesha 'matched accused' Alesha trial told of DNA Google search Alesha accused had 'fantasy' killing chat Alesha, six, had 'catastrophic' injuries Woman denies killing six-year-old Alesha Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

"The European Commission is investigating alleged anti-competitive practices in the industry Raids have been carried out at several salmon farming sites in Scotland in connection with an EU-wide probe into alleged illegal cartels. Officials visited offices in Shetland, Stirling and Fife amid concerns they may have violated anti-trust rules. The European Commission (EC) has said the investigation is at a preliminary stage. One of the companies raided, Grieg Seafood, denied wrongdoing and said it would co-operate with the inquiry. The investigation focuses on alleged anti-competitive business practices. BBC Scotland understands it is principally centred on Norway which is outside the EU. The Scottish sites visited have Norwegian links including Marine Harvest - recently rebranded as Mowi - in Rosyth, Scottish Sea Farms in Stirling and Grieg Seafood in Lerwick. A statement from the EC said: ""The European Commission can confirm that on 19 February 2019 its officials carried out unannounced inspections in several member states at the premises of several companies in the sector of farmed Atlantic salmon. ""The commission has concerns that the inspected companies may have violated EU anti-trust rules that prohibit cartels and restrictive business practices. ""The commission officials were accompanied by their counterparts from the relevant national competition authorities. ""Unannounced inspections are a preliminary investigatory step into suspected anti-competitive practices. The fact that the commission carries out such inspections does not mean that the companies are guilty of anti-competitive behaviour nor does it prejudge the outcome of the investigation itself."" Salmon farming has become a significant industry in Scotland The Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation said it was aware of the inspections. ""However, we understand the focus of the investigation is another jurisdiction, not Scotland,"" said a spokesperson. ""The companies concerned are co-operating fully with the investigatory authorities and all further inquiries should be referred to the EC."" One of the companies, Grieg Seafood, said the industry was very competitive and that it was not aware of any illegal practices. It added: ""We have been informed that The European Commission DG (Director General) Competition is exploring potential anti-competitive behaviour in the salmon industry. They have performed an inspection today (Tuesday) at Grieg Seafood Shetland. ""The salmon market is very competitive and we are not aware of any anti-competitive behaviour. We are fully co-operating with the European Commission DG Competition's investigation."" A spokesperson for Scottish Sea Farms said: ""We can confirm that we, like other Norwegian-owned companies in Scotland, have been visited by EC officials and are co-operating fully."" Mowi, the world's biggest producer of farmed Atlantic salmon, said officials visited two of its businesses, in Scotland and the Netherlands. A spokeswoman said: ""We have nothing to hide, we are co-operating with the European Commission.""

"Ms Ryan was chair of the Labour Friends of Israel group Joan Ryan has become the eighth Labour MP to quit the party in the past 48 hours, citing its tolerance of a ""culture of anti-Jewish racism"". The Enfield North MP said she was ""horrified, appalled and angered"" by Labour's failure to tackle anti-Semitism, saying its leadership allowed ""Jews to be abused with impunity"". Ms Ryan said she did not believe Jeremy Corbyn was fit to lead the country. Seven other MPs quit on Monday to form the Independent Group in Parliament. There is mounting speculation that a number of Conservative MPs disillusioned with the government's policy on Brexit could join forces with them. One source has told the BBC's assistant political editor, Norman Smith, to ""be on standby mode"". BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said Conservative whips were reporting three MPs - Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry - had gone ""very, very silent"". We'll listen to critics, vows McDonnell Labour MP sorry for Israeli breakaway claim Who are the Labour MPs resigning? While the Independent Group are not confirming anything, he said he had been told by one member that Wednesday would be a ""very busy day"". Announcing her decision on Twitter,external, Ms Ryan said she would continue to represent the north London seat in Parliament. On Tuesday, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she would not trigger a by-election in her constituency, as she won her seat in 2017 ""in spite of [Mr Corbyn], not because of him"". ""I didn't win my seat on his coat tails,"" she added. Ms Ryan, who served as a minister under Tony Blair, follows Chuka Umunna, Mike Gapes, Luciana Berger, Ann Coffey, Angela Smith, Gavin Shuker and Chris Leslie in quitting the party. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I regret that seven MPs decided they would no longer remain part of the Labour Party"" In her resignation statement, she said Mr Corbyn and the ""Stalinist clique which surrounds him"" was not providing real opposition at a moment of crisis for the country. Instead, she said the leadership was focused on ""purging their perceived ideological enemies within and obsessing over issues of little interest to British people"". Corbyn critics lose no-confidence votes Ms Ryan, chair of the Friends of Israel group, repeated Ms Berger's claim that the party had become ""institutionally anti-Semitic"", suggesting that under Mr Corbyn's leadership Israel had been ""singled out for demonisation and de-legitimisation"". ""The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn has become infected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism. The problem simply did not exist in the party before his election as leader. ""No previous Labour leader would have allowed this huge shame to befall the party. I have been horrified, appalled and angered to see the Labour leader's dereliction of duty in the face of this evil."" Ms Ryan lost a non-binding confidence vote of her party members in September which she blamed on ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and the assorted hard left"". Conservative MP Phillip Lee told BBC Radio Berkshire he had considered leaving his party. He said: ""I do feel like my party is drifting from beneath me. There is this danger of some form of 'Ukip-lite' party developingâ¦ and I don't remember a vote of the parliamentary party to become the Brexit Party. ""So yes, I'd be lyingâ¦if I hadn't considered all these things. But my own firm belief isâ¦the Conservative Party has always been a broad church. I'm going to stand and fight until it ceases to be so."" Members of the Independent Group, who have cited what they say is a culture of bullying in the party and Labour's stance on Brexit for quitting, welcomed Ms Ryan's decision to join them. Mr Shuker, the MP for Luton South, tweeted that the group was ""building something powerful together"". The seven have said their grouping could be the basis for a new political party and have urged like-minded MPs from other parties to join them. Mr Corbyn has said he wants to ""take MPs with him"" but insisted that the direction he has taken the party in since 2015 is hugely popular within the country. Chris Williamson, the MP for Derby North, said he was ""not entirely surprised"" by Ms Ryan's exit. ""She was probably facing a de-selection in any event,"" he told BBC's Newsnight. He said he had never known Labour to be ""more united"" than it was now and it was ""regrettable that a minority of MPs"" were out of step with the popular mood in the country. The embryonic Independent Group of MPs has no leader but has set out its principles Labour has suggested MPs who change political allegiance have a duty to seek a fresh mandate from their constituents. The party is considering giving voters the power to force MPs who switch parties between general elections to face by-elections by strengthening the existing recall laws. In a statement released before the news of Ms Ryan's exit, shadow Cabinet minister Jon Trickett said voters should not have to wait years to hold to account MPs who they believe are not ""properly representing their interests"".

"Rescuers have been digging through the snow looking for survivors One person has died and three people are injured after an unexpected avalanche on a marked ski slope at a popular resort in the Swiss Alps. Hundreds of rescuers searched through the night, but called off the search Wednesday morning after no-one was reported missing. A 34-year-old French national died in hospital, Swiss police said. The avalanche was unusual in that it fell on a popular, marked slope when the avalanche risk was deemed low. Most people caught in avalanches are skiing ""off-piste"", away from the slopes maintained by ski resorts and used by the majority of tourists. Such slopes are usually very safe, as the snow around them is carefully monitored and managed to avoid risks. The avalanche risk in the region was set at only two out of five on Tuesday. It happened in Crans-Montana at about 14:20 local time (13:20 GMT), when the avalanche engulfed 400m (1300ft) of piste marked out for skiers, local police commander Christian Varone said. The dead person had been working in Crans Montana's ski patrol service, police said. Analysis by Imogen Foulkes, BBC Geneva Correspondent This was the avalanche that was never supposed to happen. Alpine villages, roads, railways and ski runs are all extensively risk mapped.  Skiers caught up in avalanches tend to be off-piste, but this snow slide hit the lower stretch of a very popular slope. It is too early to determine the cause, but serious questions will have to be answered about alpine safety. It is half-term across much of Europe and the ski slopes are crowded with families. Eight thousand people were on Crans-Montana's slopes when the avalanche struck. An official investigation, involving rescue services, but also, significantly, weather experts, is already under way. Just a few weeks ago there was heavy snow across the Alps, but the last few days have seen strong sunshine. Some are already asking whether this avalanche, unthinkable for many, might be connected to climate change. In the initial aftermath, Mr Varone told reporters that witnesses said there may have been other people buried, and a major search and rescue operation was launched. About 240 rescuers continued to search the scene, aided by dogs and helicopters. But after failing to find anyone, and in the absence of any missing persons reports, the search was abandoned on Wednesday. Officials said they were ready to resume the search if necessary. Thousands were on the resort's slopes at the time Valais Public Prosecutor Catherine Seppey has opened an investigation into the reasons behind the avalanche. Ms Seppey said it was not clear if the incident was triggered by skiers or by weather conditions. Temperatures in the area have reportedly warmed in recent days, causing some snow to melt.

"The unofficial Fortnite Live festival based around the survival game was organised by Exciting Events The company behind Fortnite is suing the organisers of a live event based on the video game. Exciting Events ran the unofficial ""Fortnite event of the year"" in Norwich last weekend, which was criticised for having underwhelming attractions. American firm Epic Games confirmed it had ""issued a claim against the organisers"" in London's High Court. In an email sent to a ticket holder, Exciting Events said the festival was set-up as an ""unofficial"" fan event. But a spokesman for Epic Games said: ""The quality of our player experience is incredibly important to us, whether it's inside the game or at official public events like last year's Fortnite Pro-Am. ""Epic Games was not in any way associated with the event that took place in Norwich."" The festival's cave event was a trailer with a tunnel through it Angry parents hit out at the live event,complaining of long queues and underwhelming attractions. Justine Petersen, who queued for 90 minutes to get in with her husband and her nine-year-old son, said it was ""like the episode of Father Ted when the fair comes to Craggy Island"". Tickets for the event, themed around theglobal video game sensation, started at about Â£12, with wristbands for unlimited access to activities costing an extra Â£20. Since the event people have demanded refunds on Facebook. People said they gave up waiting before they made it to the front of the queue for the gaming activities In an email sent to a ticket holder seeking a refund, Shaun Lord, a director of Exciting Events, admitted problems with queues but said: ""The vast majority of children loved Fortnite Live Norwich."" He added: ""Fortnite Live has always been an unofficial event created by Fortnite fans... with the activities brainstormed by an audience of 10-14 year olds. ""These proceedings by Epic Games has forced Exciting Events Limited to cease all trading activities immediately and the director of Exciting Events will now seek to limit the losses to third parties as far as possible."" Exciting Events has removed Fortnite festivals planned for Spalding and Newark from its website. The BBC has asked Exciting Events for a comment.

"Blink and you'll miss it... the rat was painted on a wall beneath a shop sign a decade ago, it is claimed A sheet of protective plastic has been placed over graffiti showing a rat holding a cigarette as council officials determine if it could be a work by artist Banksy. Llanelli mayor David Darkin has sent images to the art dealer who bought Banksy's designSeason's Greetings, painted on a garage in Port Talbot. ""It's better to have it protected in case it is a Banksy,"" said the mayor. The graffiti on a charity shop wall is said to have been painted a decade ago. Essex-based gallery owner John Brandler, who paid a six-figure sum for the artwork in Port Talbot, said the Llanelli rat could be authentic and he planned to visit soon to judge for himself. He based his opinion on the photographs he had seen, and the claim that the graffiti was said to be at least a decade old, which is when""Banksy rats""appeared in industrial towns. ""I'm happy to go with 50-50 for now that it's a Banksy,"" Mr Brandler said. Llanelli artist and photographer Roz Moreton, 53, is more convinced. She said she recognised the work when she moved back to the area a decade ago. ""I studied in Bristol and lived in London and I've been exposed to a lot of Banksy including his rats on Westminster Bridge,"" she said. Graffiti: Is it culture or vandalism? Banksy artwork sold for 'six-figure sum' Port Talbot in new graffiti surprise ""So I knew right away when I saw the Llanelli rat. I didn't tell anybody because I wanted to be able to come back and see it."" Ms Moreton said she revealed her suspicions to the town council after hearing reports that vandals had tried to steal pieces from the Banksy in Port Talbot. About 20,000 people are thought to have visited that artwork over Christmas. Community leaders in Llanelli are hopeful their rat could also prove popular. Mr Darkin said: ""The hope is that if it is a Banksy it will bring much needed visitors to Llanelli and the town centre."" Councillor John Jenkins, who represents Llanelli Centre, said: ""Fingers crossed it is a Banksy, but worst-case scenario it isn't and is still a talking point and people still come and see him.""

"Wallace Broecker, the US climate scientist who helped popularise the term ""global warming"" has died in New York at the age of 87. Prof Broecker was among the first to connect emissions of CO2 to rising temperatures back in the 1970s. He also studied the ocean conveyor belt, linking oceanography to climate change. Scientists the world over have paid tribute, calling Prof Broecker a ""genius and pioneer"". Lab-grown meat may have climate cost Schoolchildren 'strike' over climate change UK carbon capture project begins Widely known as Wally, Prof Broecker spent a career that spanned nearly 67 years at Columbia University in New York. In 1975, he published a paper in the journal Science that had a profound effect on thinking about the connection between carbon dioxide and temperatures around the world. It was titledClimatic Change: Are we on the brink of a pronounced global warming?,externalThe paper was said to be the first time the phrase was used in a research paper. This video can not be played Prof Wallace Broecker speaking to BBC World Service radio in 2009 The study outlined the idea that humans were having a significant impact on the climate by emitting CO2. He argued that the world in the 1970s was experiencing what he believed was a 40-year cooling cycle that would soon end and the signal of human induced warming would soon be evident. Just a year later in 1976, temperatures started to go up and have gone up since along the lines that Wally Broecker predicted. In the 1980s, he told US political leaders that the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere warranted a ""bold, new national effort aimed at understanding the operation of the realms of the atmosphere, oceans, ice and terrestrial biosphere"". Prof Broecker's work on the ocean current conveyor was also hugely important. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He outlined the idea that the scale of circulation of these currents must help regulate the climate system by moving large amounts of heat from one place to another. He also developed the idea that the conveyor could suddenly change, leading to dramatic climatic shifts that could occur over decades not millennia, as previously thought. Prof Broecker was hugely concerned about the ability of humans to tackle the root causes of climate change. He became an early advocate for the idea of extracting CO2 from the atmosphere using machines. ""I don't like the idea of a technological solution any more than anyone else does but I'm saying that unless we have a technological solution CO2 is going to keep on going up,"" he explained to the BBC in an interview back in 2009. ""We can put a tax on CO2, society has learned how to keep water clean, now we have to learn how to keep the atmosphere in a nearly natural state. ""We are not going to be able to do that because we are predestined, I think, to double CO2 in the atmosphere."" ""And that means a 3.5C warming if the models are right, it means precipitation will change almost everywhere on the planet, polar ice will melt and sea level is going to slowly rise and these things are going to change the world we live in."" Prof Broecker's high standing as a scientist was reflected in the many messages and tweets that have followed his passing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""He has singlehandedly pushed more understanding than probably anybody in our field,"" said Richard Alley, a climatologist at Pennsylvania State University. ""He is intellectually so huge in how the Earth system works and what its history is, that all of us are following Wally in one way or other."" Prof Broecker was known for his friendly, humble demeanour. He suffered from dyslexia, and never learned how to type or use a personal computer. He was somewhat embarrassed at the fuss over coining the term ""global warming"", which he put down to ""dumb luck"". In anobituary on the Columbia University website,external, Prof Broecker is quoted as warning that he would turn over in his grave if someone put the phrase on his tombstone.

"Guidelines warned black people were being discriminated against under the guise of professionalism The New York City Commission on Human Rights has released guidelines against targeting people on the basis of their hairstyle, classing this as racist discrimination. The guidelines aim to protect the rights of New Yorkers in schools, work places and public places, where black people are disproportionately affected by policies banning hairstyles such as afros, cornrows and locs. A report from the commission said black hairstyles are often deemed ""unprofessional"" and by limiting how workers and students wear their hair, organisations ""perpetuate racist stereotypes"". NYC Human Rights Commissioner Chair Carmelyn P Malalis said hairstyle policies were not about professionalism but rather a way of ""limiting the way black people move through workplaces, public spaces and other settings"". She said the guidelines will help organisations ""understand that black New Yorkers have the right to wear their hair however they choose without fear of stigma or retaliation"". Brittny Saunders and Demoya Gordon were both part of the team at the commission writing the guidelines and could offer personal experiences of hair discrimination. ""When I started work, I chemically straightened my hair because I understood that the expectation would be that I would present myself with straight hair,"" said Ms Saunders. ""It would be against expectations to have natural hair."" ""You police yourself accordingly,"" agreed Ms Gordon. ""When I started going to interviews at law firms I knew that there would already be a lot of scepticism about my place as a black woman in that space and that wearing my locs down would not be considered 'professional'. Brittny Saunders and Demoya Gordon have both experienced discrimination for their hairstyles ""It was almost 6 years into my career that I stopped pinning my locs up and started wearing them down most of the time. ""It was only when I moved from working in a law firm to a non-profit organisation that I felt able to do this and even then I would still wear it up when I had to go to court or take a deposition."" Businesses found to have flouted the guidelines could face fines of up to $250,000 (Â£191,000). But this is not a problem specific to New York. One woman from London, who preferred not to be named, said she was once sent home from working in a clothes shop because she wore her hair in braids. She was 18 at the time. ""They said: 'Go home, take those braids out of your hair- this is not our look.' But the hairstyle they did want was a straight hair weave, which is not natural. They wanted me to adhere to European standards of beauty,"" she said. 'A white family raised me - I learned to love being black' Freckles accused of insulting China Now aged 26, she said that at the time she did not question her managers because she did not feel she could. ""I wish someone would,"" she added. Now working in a more relaxed workplace, she wears her hair in an afro, but has black female friends who wear a ""work wig"" in an attempt to ""fit in, to cause less tension for themselves"". A 23-year-old from the UK said her school which was majority white, banned ""extreme"" hairstyles. ""I wasn't sure what that meant, but it meant cornrows. They said they were gang affiliated,"" she said. Afros were also banned, described as ""distracting"". ""I relaxed my hair when I was 13 because when it was straight they didn't mind,"" she added. Commissioner Malalis emphasised the importance of the guidelines in schools. ""It's so important for young people to themselves and to be valued for who they are,"" she said.

"Rescuers have been digging through the snow looking for survivors One person has died and three people are injured after an unexpected avalanche on a marked ski slope at a popular resort in the Swiss Alps. Hundreds of rescuers searched through the night, but called off the search Wednesday morning after no-one was reported missing. A 34-year-old French national died in hospital, Swiss police said.

"The number of people in work in the UK has continued to climb, with a record 32.6 million employed between October and December,the latest Office for National Statistics figures show.,external Unemployment was little-changed in the three-month period at 1.36 million. The jobless rate, remaining at 4%, is at its lowest since early 1975. Weekly average earnings went up by 3.4% to Â£494.50 in the year to December - after adjusting for inflation, that is the highest level since March 2011. The number of people in work between October and December was up 167,000 from the previous quarter and 444,000 higher than at the same time in 2017. The employment rate - defined as the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who are working - was estimated at 75.8%, higher than the 75.2% from a year earlier and the joint-highest figure since comparable estimates began in 1971. Employment Minister Alok Sharma said: ""While the global economy is facing many challenges, particularly in sectors like manufacturing, these figures show the underlying resilience of our jobs market - once again delivering record employment levels."" ONS deputy head of labour market Matt Hughes said: ""The labour market remains robust, with the employment rate remaining at a record high and vacancies reaching a new record level. ""The unemployment rate has also fallen, and for women has dropped below 4% for the first time ever."" However, Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, warned that next month's figures may not be so buoyant. ""The labour market data didn't reflect the slip in hiring surveys in December, with employment rising,"" he said. ""However, the surveys deteriorated more markedly in January, so a Brexit effect might start to weaken employment growth in the next batch of official data."" By Dharshini David, BBC economics correspondent The jobs market remains in a robust shape despite the loss of momentum in the economy towards the end of last year - although the Brexit fog effect may be yet to register. Continuing recent trends, the majority of those entering work were previously inactive (students, looking after home, long-term sick etc). The demand for labour continues to bolster wage growth. Real wages increased by more than 1% per year, better on the whole than in recent years although about half the rate of the pre-crisis era. So little sign of Brexit uncertainty hitting hiring so far - but demand in the labour market tends to lag significantly behind changes in output. More recent employment surveys show a marked deterioration in January, so a Brexit effect might start to weaken employment growth in the next batch of official data. And productivity - output per hour - was down by 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus a year previously, as output rose more slowly than employment. The lack of progress in this area could weigh on wage growth in the longer term. Looking at the average earnings figures, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""With surplus labour extremely scarce and job vacancies rising to a new record high, workers are having more success in obtaining above-inflation pay increases. ""Looking ahead, we doubt that wage growth will slip below 3% this year."" Despite the wage increases and low unemployment figures, Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, did not think that struggling High Streets would benefit. He said: ""The uplift to consumer spending from the recent improvement in real pay growth is likely to be limited by weak consumer confidence and high household debt levels. ""The increase in the number of vacancies to a new record high confirms that labour and skills shortages are set to remain a significant a drag on business activity for some time to come, impeding UK growth and productivity.""

Weekly average earnings went up by 3.4% to Â£494.50 in the year to December - after adjusting for inflation, that is the highest level since March 2011. The number of people in work between October and December was up 167,000 from the previous quarter and 444,000 higher than at the same time in 2017. The employment rate - defined as the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who are working - was estimated at 75.8%, higher than the 75.2% from a year earlier and the joint-highest figure since comparable estimates began in 1971. Employment Minister Alok Sharma said: ""While the global economy is facing many challenges, particularly in sectors like manufacturing, these figures show the underlying resilience of our jobs market - once again delivering record employment levels."" ONS deputy head of labour market Matt Hughes said: ""The labour market remains robust, with the employment rate remaining at a record high and vacancies reaching a new record level. ""The unemployment rate has also fallen, and for women has dropped below 4% for the first time ever."" However, Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, warned that next month's figures may not be so buoyant. ""The labour market data didn't reflect the slip in hiring surveys in December, with employment rising,"" he said. ""However, the surveys deteriorated more markedly in January, so a Brexit effect might start to weaken employment growth in the next batch of official data."" By Dharshini David, BBC economics correspondent The jobs market remains in a robust shape despite the loss of momentum in the economy towards the end of last year - although the Brexit fog effect may be yet to register. Continuing recent trends, the majority of those entering work were previously inactive (students, looking after home, long-term sick etc). The demand for labour continues to bolster wage growth. Real wages increased by more than 1% per year, better on the whole than in recent years although about half the rate of the pre-crisis era. So little sign of Brexit uncertainty hitting hiring so far - but demand in the labour market tends to lag significantly behind changes in output. More recent employment surveys show a marked deterioration in January, so a Brexit effect might start to weaken employment growth in the next batch of official data. And productivity - output per hour - was down by 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus a year previously, as output rose more slowly than employment. The lack of progress in this area could weigh on wage growth in the longer term. Looking at the average earnings figures, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""With surplus labour extremely scarce and job vacancies rising to a new record high, workers are having more success in obtaining above-inflation pay increases. ""Looking ahead, we doubt that wage growth will slip below 3% this year."" Despite the wage increases and low unemployment figures, Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, did not think that struggling High Streets would benefit. He said: ""The uplift to consumer spending from the recent improvement in real pay growth is likely to be limited by weak consumer confidence and high household debt levels. ""The increase in the number of vacancies to a new record high confirms that labour and skills shortages are set to remain a significant a drag on business activity for some time to come, impeding UK growth and productivity.""

"Some 20,000 people who have fled Baghuz in recent weeks have been taken to a camp The UN has expressed concern about the fate of some 200 families reportedly trapped in the last tiny area of Syria still held by the Islamic State group. Human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said they were apparently being prevented from leaving by IS militants. They were also being subjected to intense bombardment by US-led coalition and allied Syrian forces, she added. On Tuesday evening, dozens of lorries reportedly arrived on the outskirts of the IS enclave to evacuate civilians. Could a defeated IS rebound? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, cited its sources as saying wives and children of militants would be taken to an undisclosed location as part of a deal with the coalition. Earlier, it reported that a request by militants to be given safe passage to the opposition-held Syrian province of Idlib or neighbouring Iraq had been rejected by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance. IS militants are reportedly confined to tents pitched on top of a network of tunnels and caves SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali appeared to dismiss such an idea on Tuesday morning, insisting the militants had ""only two options - either they surrender or they will be killed in battle"". ""We are working on secluding and evacuating civilians and then we will attack. This could happen soon,"" Mr Bali was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? How many IS foreign fighters are left? Five years ago, IS controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. It proclaimed the creation of a ""caliphate"", imposing its brutal rule on almost eight million people and generating billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. Now, an estimated 300 militants and hundreds of civilians are surrounded inside about 0.5 sq km (0.2 square miles) of land in the Baghuz area, which is in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, near the border with Iraq. ""Civilians continue to be used as pawns by the various parties,"" Ms Bachelet said. ""I call on them to provide safe passage to those who wish to flee, while those wish to remain must also be protected as much as possible. ""They should not be sacrificed to ideology on the one hand, or military expediency on the other. If protecting civilian lives means taking a few more days to capture the last fraction of land controlled by [IS], then so be it."" US-backed SDF fighters launched an assault on Baghuz this month Although no-one has reportedly made it out of Baghuz in the past three days, some 20,000 civilians have been taken by the SDF to a makeshift camp for displaced people at al-Hol, in Hassakeh province, in recent weeks. Among them are the wives and children of IS militants and many foreign nationals, including the British teenager Shamima Begum, who was 15 when she ran away from her home to join IS four years ago. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said on Monday that at least 62 people had died on their way to al-Hol, two thirds of them children under the age of one. Exhaustion and malnutrition were the principal causes of the deaths. This video can not be played On Monday Shamima Begum told the BBC she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" Ms Bachelet also said she was alarmed by an upsurge in attacks and civilian casualties in Idlib province, where a takeover by a jihadist group linked to al-Qaeda, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has jeopardised a truce brokered by Turkey and Russia in September. The Syrian government's bombardment of a demilitarised buffer zone, which runs along the frontline in Idlib and areas of northern Hama and western Aleppo provinces, started to escalate in December and has further intensified in recent days, according to the UN. Islamic State group: The full story At the same time, there has been an increase in fighting among rebel and jihadist factions, and also in the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in areas they control. On Monday, at least 16 civilians, including women and children, were reportedly killed by two bomb explosions in the Qusour district of Idlib city. The second blast appeared to have been designed to kill those, including medical workers, coming to the aid of victims of the first. Another nine civilians, including four women and two boys, were meanwhile reportedly killed by government strikes on Khan Sheikhoun on Friday and Saturday.

"Stephen Lawrence had wanted to be an architect when he was murdered at the age of 18 It could be 100 years before the Met Police has the same ethnic mix as the population it serves, the force said. Currently 14% of Met officers are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, but the 2011 Census shows 40.2% of Londoners identify as BAME. As a result the force says it wants to recruit 250 extra BAME officers a year. It comes as the force announced how it has changed since it was branded ""institutionally racist"" following Stephen Lawrence's murder in 1999. The force said its prediction that it could take 100 years to have a workforce that reflects Londoners would happen if it did not take further steps to ""attract and retain"" BAME officers. Eighteen-year-old Lawrence was set upon by a gang, stabbed and left to die in Eltham, south-east London, on the evening of 22 April 1993. The bungled initial investigation into his death was hampered by claims of racism, corruption and incompetence, and it took nearly 20 years for two of his five or six killers to finally be brought to justice. David Norris and Gary Dobson areboth serving life sentenceswhile the rest have evaded justice. Stephen Lawrence: How has his murder changed policing? Stephen Lawrence Day to be held annually Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline of how the story unfolded Stephen Lawrence filmmaker wants viewers to feel family's emotions Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said theMacpherson report,externalinto the aftermath of his murder had ""defined my generation of policing"" but she said she did not believe the force was now institutionally racist. ""We are ambitious for the future, we are not going to forget Stephen or his legacy and we will continue to educate our officers about why it is that this police service does what it does now, and how that comes from the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry,"" she said. The latest report from the force's HR found 16% of PCs were BAME, and fewer than 10% for higher ranks. The proportion is 4% for chief officers. BAME officers and staff are also more likely to resign from the force or raise grievances. Since 1999, BAME officers have increased from 3% to 14%, while last year 30% of new recruits were from that background. How have police attitudes to race changed?

"A British man flew from the Czech Republic to Newcastle on the wrong passport after accidentally taking his friend's and leaving him stranded. Allan Poole, 43, from Whitley Bay, travelled from Prague to Newcastle via Amsterdam on a KLM flight. The passport was checked at least four times during the journey, but the mistake was not picked up. KLM described the incident as ""undesirable"", but stressed no passengers or crew were ever at risk. Mr Poole's friend, Steve Vincent, 43, also from Whitley Bay, is now getting help from UK officials to get home. It has emerged that Border control agents who checked Mr Poole's passport when leaving the Schengen area at Schiphol airport, Amsterdam, and UK immigration officials who checked it when he arrived in Newcastle did not identify the mistake. KLM staff at the boarding gate in Amsterdam also did not notice the name on his boarding card did not match the passport. Mr Vincent tweeted KLM asking, ""Hey KLM you let my friend travel from Prague to Newcastle on my passport (after we swapped by mistake). ""You shouldn't have let him on the plane. I'm trapped in Prague. What are you going to do about it?"" In a statement, the airline described the incident as ""undesirable"". It added: ""One of the passengers flew from Prague to Newcastle via Amsterdam, without it being noticed at the various airports that he was travelling on someone else's passport. ""KLM works with competent authorities to ensure that the aircraft, passengers and crew are safe and secure during flight. ""Although this is an undesirable, but exceptional situation, the passenger went through all security checks. The safety of passengers and crew has never been compromised."" A spokesman for the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee, which is responsible for border checks at Schiphol Airport, said: ""When mistakes do happen, we are committed to acknowledging them and putting things right for the future."" Mr Poole travelled to Newcastle from Prague A spokesman for the British Embassy in Prague said it was not unusual for people to travel on other people's passports. He said: ""People do travel on (the wrong passport), they don't get checked when they come out and stuff like that. ""It's quite common actually, to be honest with you, people do travel on other people's passports accidentally, it does happen. ""Border controls sometimes don't look, I don't know for what reason."" Mr Poole said no-one noticed he was travelling on the wrong passport and he only realised himself when he got back to the UK.

"This video can not be played John McDonnell: ""We need a mammoth listening exercise"" Labour needs to carry out a ""mammoth listening exercise"" to address criticisms from its own MPs, says the shadow chancellor. John McDonnell had called for the seven MPs who resigned from Labour on Mondayto face by-elections for their seats. But speaking on Tuesday, he focused on ""finding a way forward"" and the need to ""bring people in [and] talk to them."" Jeremy Corbyn was ""disappointed"" MPs had left, but defended his polices as having ""huge public support"". The reactions followedwarnings that more Labour MPs could quit the partyto join the new group of independent MPs. The BBC has also been told two Conservative MPs are thinking of joining the group in Parliament. Labour warned more MPs could quit party What next for Labour's breakaway MPs? Who are the Labour MPs resigning? 'Cowards and traitors' - how Twitter reacted Derek Hatton rejoins Labour after 34 years The seven Labour defectors - Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey - quit the party in protest at what they said was a culture of ""bullying and bigotry"" in the party and frustration over the leadership's reluctance to back another EU referendum. Mr Umunna told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that they also believed Mr Corbyn could not be trusted with national security, if he became prime minister. Others could follow, with Labour MP Ian Austin telling BBC West Midlands: ""I'm thinking about this, as lots of people are."" Chris Leslie speaks in the Commons on Tuesday as part of the Independent Group, flanked by Angela Smith and Mike Gapes Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, said it was ""a moment for regret and reflection, not for a mood of anger or a tone of triumph"", and time for the party to ""broaden out so that all the members of our broad church feel welcome in our congregation"". The Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) had a ""heated"" and ""tense"" meeting on Monday night, with one MP telling the BBC there was an abject failure of leadership and ""no emotional intelligence was shown"". This video can not be played MPs resign from Labour over Brexit and anti-Semitism Speaking on Tuesday morning, Mr McDonnell said people had been ""very straightforward"" at the PLP meeting. He said:  ""I think we need a mammoth, massive listening exercise and to address some of those criticisms that have been made. I think we are finding a way forward, but it has got to be on the basis of taking the advice of people like Tom Watson, the PLP and others. ""If there are issues that we have to address, we'll address them; if it is about the style of the leadership, we'll address that; if it is about policy, we will listen to that as well."" Mr McDonnell also said he was ""really disappointed"" at the seven resignations, adding: ""I don't understand why they've gone, I still can't understand it. All the issues that they've raised, we are addressing and I would have rather they'd stayed with us and helped us sort those problems out than walk away."" Labour leader Mr Corbyn did not avoid the topic when appearing at the MAKE manufacturers conference in London on Tuesday. During his speech about Labour proposals to create jobs, he said: ""These policies won huge public support at the general election only 18 months ago, so I am disappointed that a small number of MPs decided to take a different path. ""But this is an agenda that unites half a million Labour Party members, inside and outside Parliament, along with millions of people across this country."" Pushed further by the BBC's deputy political editor, John Pienaar, during a Q&A, he added: ""I regret that seven MPs decided that they would no longer remain part of the Labour Party. I thank them for their work. ""I hope they realise they were elected to Parliament on a manifesto that was based around investment in the future, was based around a more equal and fairer society, was based around social justice. ""They were elected to carry out those policies. They've decided to go somewhere else and I regret that because I want our party to be strong. I want our party to be united around the policies we put forward."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Umunna told Today that the new group was not yet a new political party, but he believed it could become one in time. He urged members from all parties to join them in building an ""alternative"" to the current two party system, which he said was ""fundamentally broken"". When asked who the two Tory MPs considering joining their ranks could be, he refused to speculate, but added: ""There are a lot of Labour MPs wrestling with their conscience on this issue but also Conservatives who have become demoralised by the UKIPisation, if you like, of the Conservative Party."" A number of Conservative MPs are at the centre of rumours about joining the new group, including Sarah Wollaston, a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum. On Monday evening, she tweeted: ""#BLUKIP has been busy taking over the Tory Party alongside the ERG. Soon there will be nothing left at all to appeal to moderate centre ground voters."" Other Conservative MPs unhappy with the party's direction include Anna Soubry, another People's Vote supporter, who has called in the past for a new centre party. This splintering might, just might - in time - turn into a much bigger redrawing of the landscape. For now though that is way off.

"This video can not be played On Monday Shamima Begum told the BBC she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" Shamima Begum, who joined the Islamic State group in Syria aged 15, is to lose her UK citizenship. Whitehall sources said it was possible to strip the 19-year-old of British nationality as she was eligible for citizenship of another country. Herfamily's lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said they were ""disappointed"",externalwith the decision and were considering ""all legal avenues"" to challenge it. Ms Begum, who left east London in 2015, had said she wanted to return home. She was found in a Syrian refugee camp last week after reportedly leaving Baghuz - IS's last stronghold - and gave birth to a son at the weekend. In aninterview with the BBC on Monday,Ms Begum said she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" and now simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. ITV News obtained the letter,externalsent to Ms Begum's mother, asking her to inform her daughter of the decision. Under the1981 British Nationality Act,external, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be ""conducive to the public good"" and they would not become stateless as a result. Ms Begum said she travelled to Syria with her sister's UK passport but it was taken from her when she crossed the border. 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? IS 'traps 200 families' in last bastion She is believed to be of Bangladeshi heritage but when asked by the BBC, she said did not have a Bangladesh passport and had never been to the country. On the question of Ms Begum's son, a child born to a British parent before they are deprived of their citizenship would still be considered British. While it would theoretically be possible for the UK to then remove citizenship from the child, officials would need to balance their rights against any potential threat they posed. Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 A Home Office spokesman said: ""In recent days the home secretary has clearly stated that his priority is the safety and security of Britain and the people who live here."" He said the department did not comment on individual cases but decisions to remove citizenship were ""based on all available evidence and not taken lightly"". Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said that if Ms Begum's mother was a Bangladeshi national - as is believed to be the case - under Bangladesh law Ms Begum would be too. Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent and friend of Ms Begum's family, said they were ""very surprised"" by what seemed to be a ""kneejerk reaction"" by the Home Office. Stressing that Ms Begum had never been to Bangladesh, Mr Babu said: ""It seems to be a bizarre decision and I'm not entirely sure how that will stand up legally."" Conservative MP George Freeman said the move was a ""mistake"" that would set a ""dangerous precedent"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Liberal Democrats MP Ed Davey said Ms Begum should be allowed to return to the UK. He said: ""Membership of a terrorist group is a serious crime, as is encouraging or supporting terrorism, but Shamima Begum should face justice for those crimes in the UK."" A friend of Ms Begum's family, Dal Babu, said the Home Office's decision was ""bizarre"" Islamic State has lost most of the territory it once controlled, but between 1,000 and 1,500 militants are believed to be left in a 50 sq km (20 sq mile) near Syria's border with Iraq. Mr Javid told MPs earlier this week that more than 100 dual nationals had already lost their UK citizenship after travelling in support of terrorist groups. Last year, two British men, accused of being members of an IS cell dubbed ""The Beatles""were stripped of their citizenshipafter being captured in Syria. Ms Begum has said she does not regret travelling to Syria, however, she said she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She told the BBC she was ""shocked"" by the2017 Manchester Arena attack- which killed 22 people and was claimed by IS - but she also compared it to military assaults on IS strongholds, saying it was ""retaliation"". Robbie Potter was injured in the Manchester Arena attack Robbie Potter, who was seriously injured in the attack while he waited for his children in the foyer of Manchester Arena, said he felt ""angry"" and sickened by Ms Begum's comments. Ms Begum left the UK with two school friends, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase in February 2015. Ms Sultana is thought to have died when a house was blown up, and the fate of Ms Abase is unknown. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police after they left the UK Ms Begum gave birth to a baby boy last weekend, having previously lost two children. Her husband, a Dutch convert to Islam, is thought to have surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters about two weeks ago. Ms Begum has the right to appeal the Home Office's decision.

"Fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld has died, aged 85, in Paris. He was one of the world's most iconic designers, at the heart of not one, not two, but three fashion houses. Karl Lagerfeld had been at the creative helm of Chanel since 1983 and had been designing for Fendi since 1965. He also designed collections for his own brand. Lagerfeld was born Karl Otto Lagerfeldt in pre-war Germany. He changed his name because he believed Lagerfeld sounded ""more commercial"". The designer emigrated to Paris as a teenager, and became a design assistant for Pierre Balmain. Karl Lagerfeld seen in around 1960, then the artistic director of the Jean Patou fashion brand Lagerfeld fits one of his designs on top model Ines de la Fressange at Chloe's Paris studio. Lagerfeld works on design sketches at Chloe's Paris studio. He began his career with Chanel in 1983, a decade after Coco Chanel died. In 1984 he launched his own name label. He cut a striking figure wearing a distinctive ensemble of crisp white, high-collared shirts with black tailored jacket and jeans, punctuated with a tie, shades, fingerless gloves and black boots. As a designer he transformed the fortunes of Chanel, one of the leading names in high fashion. Naomi Campbell models the Chanel ready to wear collection Linda Evangelista walks the runway at the Chanel Ready to Wear Fall/Winter 1991-1992 fashion show. In 2018 Chanel become the first luxury fashion house in the world to stop using exotic animal skins, like snake, crocodile, lizard and stingray. ""We did it because it's in the air, but it's not an air people imposed to us,"" Mr Lagerfeld said. He argued ""there was not much fur"" in Chanel's work to begin with. German model Claudia Schiffer and English model Kate Moss though displayed fur creations designed by Karl Lagerfeld for the Fall-Winter ready-to-wear collection of Chanel  in Paris. Lagerfeld also transformed the catwalk. For the Chanel AW14 show in Paris it became a high-end supermarket. In 2016 Chanel staged its show in the Cuban capital Havana - the first international fashion show since the 1959 communist revolution, shown in the two images below. World celebrities gathered at a leafy promenade that was turned into a catwalk for the firm's Cruise collection, even though Chanel goods are not sold in Cuba. Celebrities - including actor Vin Diesel and supermodel Gisele Bundchen - attended the show at Havana's Prado promenade to see Lagerfeld displaying the new collection. Lagerfeld said the line was inspired by Cuba's ""cultural richness"".

"The late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld will be remembered by some as much for his barbs as his outfits. Karl Lagerfeld, the king of the fashion world Here he is in his own words: ""I am very much down to Earth. Just not this earth."" ""When I was four I asked my mother for a valet for my birthday."" ""I have a sort of Alzheimer's for my own work, which I think is a very good thing. Today too many people remember what they did - just forget it all and start again."" ""We created a product nobody needs, but people want. If you need an ugly old car, it can wait, but if you want a new fashion item, it cannot wait."" ""Vanity is the healthiest thing in life."" ""I am like a caricature of myself, and I like that. It is like a mask. And for me the Carnival of Venice lasts all year long."" ""Don't sacrifice yourself too much, because if you sacrifice too much there's nothing else you can give and nobody will care for you."" ""Whatever it is, good or bad, it influences fashion. You can see that in fashion quicker than in any other thing going on. Fashion is something that reflects our lives and times with the shortest release because, cars, design and architecture take years to realise."" ""Why should I stop working? If I do, I'll die and it'll be all finished."" ""I have nothing to say. I'm actually trying to make sure that I won't be remembered.""

"This video can not be played His pet cat, Choupette, has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers online There is a reason why Karl Lagerfeld, who has died at the age of 85, was called the emperor - or ""Kaiser"" in his native German - by fashion insiders. After all, he was one of the world's most iconic fashion designers, at the heart of not one, not two, but three fashion houses. The man who steered Chanel for more than 30 years combined artistic flair with business acumen which would see the Parisian label's sales reach $10bn (Â£7.7bn) in 2017. But Lagerfeld's brand reached beyond his business ventures and into every aspect of his life. Karl Lagerfeld: The life of a design icon in pictures ""I am very much down to Earth. Just not this earth"" - Lagerfeld in quotes He was instantly recognisable, thanks to his powdered white ponytail, dark glasses and high-collared white shirts. But then, what else would you expect of a man who once noted ""anyone who wears jogging pants has lost control of their life"". ""I'm a walking label,"" he told CNN in 2011. ""My name is Labelfeld not Lagerfeld."" Karl Lagerfeld's exact date of birth has been a contentious issue for some time. According to his eponymous website, he was born in 1938. However, others have settled on September 1933 as a more likely date of birth Either way, he was born in Hamburg to a German mother and Swedish father, Otto, who imported condensed milk. Within a few years, they had moved to the town of Bad Bremstedt, where he would spend the war years. This video can not be played Karl Lagerfeld often appeared at shows alongside his models However, it seems a young Lagerfeld had no intention of staying in the country of his birth, having already got a taste for fashion - and a sense he might be destined for big things. ""As a child, a very young person, I had the feeling: 'It doesn't matter what you do - you're compelling!' I thought I was sacrosanct - wasted on dismal post-war Germany,"" Lagerfeld told German media. In 1952 - having seen a Dior fashion show in Hamburg - the teenage Lagerfeld moved to Paris. His big break came in 1954, when he won first prize for a sketch of a coat which was then made by Pierre Balmain. The designer, impressed, offered him a job as his assistant. Just three years later, he was named Jean Patou's art director. Then, in 1965, after a short stint with Chloe, he would begin a collaboration that was to last to the end of his life, with Italian fashion house Fendi. Karl Lagerfeld smiles for the camera after receiving an award in 1973 But it would be his role as Chanel's artistic director, beginning in 1983, which would truly thrust him into the limelight and create the fashion icon known for the next three decades. However, he acknowledged the brand's founder may not have been thrilled with the direction he took the label. ""What I do Coco would have hated,"" he said. ""The label has an image and it's up to me to update it. I do what she never did. I had to go from what Chanel was to what it should be, could be, what it had been to something else."" He still did not sit on his laurels. His appointment at Chanel was followed the next year by the creation of his own brand, Karl Lagerfeld. Not happy with simply designing clothes, however, in 1987 he started to photograph his own campaigns. But in 1989 tragedy struck: his partner of almost two decades, the French aristocrat Jacques de Bascher died of an Aids-related illness. Lagerfeld following Chanel's ready-to-wear show in March 1984 According to his biographer, Alicia Drake, the death of de Bascher - who had cheated on Lagerfeld with his long-term rival Yves Saint Laurent - was followed by a period of weight gain and becoming infatuated with several young men. The turn of the century saw Lagerfeld enter a new market: that of the diet industry. He proudly shed some 43kg (93lb) and turned his experience into a book, The 3D Diet, which would go on to sell thousands. ""I suddenly wanted to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane,external, who used to work for Saint Laurent and now creates the Dior Homme collections,""  he explained in The Telegraph in 2004. That same year, he became the first fashion designer to collaborate with high street clothes store H&M. More collaborations followed - not least, one designing three different bottles for Diet Coke, his drink of choice. The collaboration's 2011 launch was a suitably glitzy affair, withCosmopolitan reporting he was followed around all night ""by a male model,externalcarrying a goblet of the drink atop a silver platter"". Walking the catwalk with his godson, Hudson Kroenig, in 2017 Despite his advancing years, he kept up to date with the changes in the world of celebrity, embracing the likes of the Kardashians, while last year he released a capsule collection with Kaia Gerber - daughter of 90s supermodel Cindy Crawford. Selfies, however, were not something he could get on board with; ""electronic masturbation"" was his scathing assessment. Age also failed to blunt his sharp tongue and, at times, shocking views, includingattacking Germany's decision to open the door to Syrian refugees,external, andslamming the #metoo movement in an interview with Numero,external. His pace of work did not slow up either, so when he missed a Chanel show in January - the first time he had ever done so - speculation began to mount over his health. Lagerfeld's death was met with an outpouring of grief from the fashion world he had presided over for so many years. Many paid tribute to his genius and the legacy he was leaving behind. But, it seems, Lagerfeld was less impressed with his legacy than those paying tribute. Two months before his death, the octogenarian dismissed rumours he was writing his memoirs. ""I have nothing to say,"" he said. ""I'm actually trying to make sure that I won't be remembered."" Karl Lagerfeld: Five things you should know.

"This video can not be played Honda Europe boss Ian Howells says the decision was driven by big changes in the industry Honda has confirmed it will close its Swindon car plant in 2021, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. The Japanese company builds 160,000 Honda Civics a year in Swindon, its only car factory in the EU. Honda said the move was due to global changes in the car industry and the need to launch electric vehicles, and it had nothing to do with Brexit. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the decision was ""devastating"" for Swindon and the UK. A fall in demand for diesel cars and tougher emissions regulations have shaken up the car industry. Honda workers 'betrayed' by Swindon plant closure Ian Howells, senior vice-president for Honda in Europe, told the BBC: ""We're seeing unprecedented change in the industry on a global scale. We have to move very swiftly to electrification of our vehicles because of demand of our customers and legislation. ""This is not a Brexit-related issue for us, it's being made on the global-related changes I've spoken about. ""We've always seen Brexit as something we'll get through, but these changes globally are something we will have to respond to. We deeply regret the impact it will have on the Swindon community.""  3,500total employees in Swindon 160,000Honda Civic cars built annually at the plant 90%of production sold to the UK, Europe and US 1989start of industrial operations Mr Howells said that, in the light of changes in the industry, the company had to ""look very closely"" at where it was putting its investment. The company sells many more vehicles in North America, Japan and China than it does in Europe. ""It has to be in a marketplace of a size for Honda, where it makes investment worthwhile. ""The conclusion coming out of that is that that doesn't include Swindon - the relative size of the marketplace in Europe is significantly different."" Honda said it would begin consulting immediately about the proposed closure with potentially affected employees. A union source told the BBC that Honda had sent the workforce at its Swindon factory home for the day. Honda also announced it would stop making the Civic at its plant in Turkey in 2021. Its European HQ will continue to be located in the UK after the changes. Earlier this month, Nissan switched plans to build its X-Trail SUV from the UK to Japan. At that time the firm's Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said that ""the continued uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future"". Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter Honda says the Swindon closure is not Brexit-related. Is this the unvarnished truth, or is the company simply trying to avoid a political storm? Honda has in the past been vocal about the difficulties a disorderly Brexit would bring, and the timing of the announcement, a little more than a month before the UK leaves the European Union, is curious. But the Honda statement makes no mention of Brexit at all, instead pointing to the greater forces that are reshaping the car industry. Honda is not, on the world stage, a big player, being dwarfed by the likes of Toyota, Volkswagen, General Motors and Ford. It needs to find the resources to invest in electric power plants and autonomous vehicles - a strain that has already led to its larger rivals closing plants and cutting jobs. Honda said it needed to invest in these new frontiers and concentrate its production resources where it could be sure there would be high volumes. Swindon, which has had one of its two production lines shut for several years and which makes only 160,000 cars a year, does not fit that future. Nor does an even smaller plant in Turkey. Brexit issues may be lurking in the background, but Honda's real reasons for closing Swindon are about the future of the global car industry, not Britain's future relationship with Europe. Nissan Â£60m in doubt after investment U-turn Panasonic to move European HQ from UK Sony to shift EU headquarters to avoid Brexit disruption Jaguar Land Rover posts Â£3.4bn loss The EU and Japan recently struck a trade deal which lowers tariffs on both parties' car exports to zero. BBC business editorSimon Jack said the trade deal means there is a dwindling rationaleto base manufacturing inside the EU. He said production at Swindon had also been in decline for some time, with the plant currently running at about half its capacity. Business Secretary Greg Clark said he would convene a taskforce with local MPs, civic and business leaders, as well as trade union representatives, to help Honda workers get new skilled jobs. ""The automotive industry is undergoing a rapid transition to new technology,"" he said. ""The UK is one of the leaders in the development of these technologies and so it is deeply disappointing that this decision has been taken now."" Alan Tomala from Unite said the scale of job losses was ""enormous"" Unite union official Alan Tomala said employees at the Swindon factory felt ""betrayed"" by the closure announcement. ""They feel that the company owes them a little more than hearing the news in the media. ""I left work yesterday to 57 missed calls and around 130 emails, and not one from Honda.  It surprises me and I'm angered by it."" Outside the factory gates, employee Chris, whose son also works at the plant, told the BBC he was ""extremely disappointed"". ""I've been here 19 years and it's devastating for all involved,"" he said. ""You've only got to look across the road at the large warehouses here too, I don't know what the jobs will be replaced with."" Local employment agencies have begun setting up meetings to prepare employees. Kath Curr, managing director of C&D Recruitment in Swindon, said the closure was ""devastating for the town as a whole"", but Honda workers' skills were ""completely transferrable"" . In a joint statement, Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, Phil Smith, chief executive of Business West, and Paul Britton, chief executive of Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce, said the planned closure of the Swindon plant would have a major impact, not only on Honda staff but also on the company's supply chain. ""Given the size of the operation, there will be a wide and diverse network of regional suppliers that will now be hugely concerned about their future business prospects. ""Employers, government and local authorities must do all they can to deliver tangible assistance and guidance for the people and communities that will be affected by an announcement of this scale,"" they added.

"Growing meat in the laboratory may do more damage to the climate in the long run than meat from cattle, say scientists. Researchers are looking for alternatives to traditional meat because farming animals is helping to drive up global temperatures. However, meat grown in the lab may make matters worse in some circumstances. Researchers say it depends on how the energy to make the lab meat is produced. Schoolchildren 'strike' over climate change UK carbon capture project begins ''Future proofing' forests for orangutans There's increasing concern about the impact of meat consumption on the planet. Around a quarter of the greenhouse gas emissions that are driving up temperatures are estimated to have come from agriculture. Beef production is considered the worst offender with cattle emitting methane and nitrous oxide from their manures, but also from their digestive processes. There are also additional gases from fertiliser application to land, from the conversion of land for pasture or feed production. Because of these impacts on the climate and because of a range of other concerns about issues such as welfare and sustainability, scientists have in recent years sought to develop meat that can be grown from animal cells in factories or laboratories. One perceived advantage would be much lower greenhouse gas emissions, especially methane. Back in 2013 aDutch team of scientistsproduced what they claimed was the world's first burger grown in a lab. Since then, there's been a lot of hype and noise but some real progress as well. This video can not be played These chicken nuggets were grown in a lab from cells taken from a living animal Essentially, the process involves collecting stem cells from animal tissue and then getting them to differentiate into fibres, these are then developed and grown into a sufficient mass of muscle tissue that can be harvested and sold as meat. Firms in California have taken some important steps. Last year, chicken nuggets, developed by a firm called Just, weretasted by my colleague James Cook. Tyson Foods, one of the biggest US meat processors, has also invested an undisclosed amount in Memphis Meats, another firm in this field that says it is ""harvesting cells instead of animals"". But despite the promises, no-one has yet mass-produced cultured meat for sale to the general public. Researchers from the Oxford Martin School looked at the long-term climate implications of cultured meat versus meat from cattle. The scientists say that previous studies had tended to look at the various emissions from cattle and converted them all to their carbon dioxide equivalent. The team says this doesn't give you the full picture as methane and nitrous oxide have different impacts on the climate. ""Per tonne emitted, methane has a much larger warming impact than carbon dioxide. However, it only remains in the atmosphere for about 12 years, whereas carbon dioxide persists and accumulates for millennia,"" said co-author Prof Raymond Pierrehumbert. ""This means methane's impact on long-term warming is not cumulative and is impacted greatly if emissions increase or decrease over time."" The scientists' climate model found that in some circumstance and over the very long term, the manufacture of lab meat can result in more warming. This is because the emissions from the lab are related to the production of energy which is almost entirely made up of carbon dioxide, which persists in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. Emissions from cattle are a significant cause of warming ""The climate impacts of cultured meat production will depend on what level of sustainable energy generation can be achieved, as well as the efficiency of future culture processes,"" said lead author Dr John Lynch. ""If the lab-grown meat is quite energy intensive to produce then they could end up being worse for the climate than cows are."" One of the scenarios that the researchers looked at saw meat consumption increase initially and then decline to more sustainable levels over time. The scientists found that the cattle production systems generally showed greater peak warming within this time frame, but as a result of the persistence of large scale CO2 emissions in the early period of production for cultured meat, ""any long-term benefits of this production are further reduced compared to cattle systems. ""It may well be that these things are so energy efficient that it would simply be replacing a high-impact activity with a low one,"" said Dr Lynch. ""But from the cultured meat systems that are out there at the moment, we can't make that assessment for sure yet."" Yes, the authors say that a number of other factors should be considered including water pollution that cultured meat may avoid. But other experts say that isn't so clear cut. ""Artificial meat may result in the presence of organic or chemical molecule residues in water, because the process would need to produce huge amounts of chemical and organic molecules, such as hormones, growth factors, to add to the culture medium to grow the meat"" said Prof Jean-Francois Hocquette, at the French National Institute for Agricultural Research, who wasn't involved with the study. It's far too early to tell as the products really haven't emerged from the laboratory yet. Some researchers say that cultured meat has many other barriers to overcome before it's a huge hit with consumers. ""It is worth noting that most consumers have never heard of cultured meat, and many don't know that conventional meat production damages the environment,"" said Dr Chris Bryant from the University of Bath who has studied the issue. ""Consumers who learn about cultured meat usually think primarily of the benefits to animals. Having said that, environmental factors will be an issue for some consumers, and many environmentally conscious buyers are already moving away from meat and dairy consumption.""

"This video can not be played John McDonnell: ""We need a mammoth listening exercise"" Labour needs to carry out a ""mammoth listening exercise"" to address criticisms from its own MPs, says the shadow chancellor. John McDonnell had called for the seven MPs who resigned from Labour on Mondayto face by-elections for their seats. But speaking on Tuesday, he focused on ""finding a way forward"" and the need to ""bring people in [and] talk to them."" Jeremy Corbyn was ""disappointed"" MPs had left, but defended his polices as having ""huge public support"". The reactions followedwarnings that more Labour MPs could quit the partyto join the new group of independent MPs. The BBC has also been told two Conservative MPs are thinking of joining the group in Parliament. Labour warned more MPs could quit party What next for Labour's breakaway MPs? Who are the Labour MPs resigning? 'Cowards and traitors' - how Twitter reacted Derek Hatton rejoins Labour after 34 years The seven Labour defectors - Chuka Umunna, Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey - quit the party in protest at what they said was a culture of ""bullying and bigotry"" in the party and frustration over the leadership's reluctance to back another EU referendum. Mr Umunna told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that they also believed Mr Corbyn could not be trusted with national security, if he became prime minister. Others could follow, with Labour MP Ian Austin telling BBC West Midlands: ""I'm thinking about this, as lots of people are."" Chris Leslie speaks in the Commons on Tuesday as part of the Independent Group, flanked by Angela Smith and Mike Gapes Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, said it was ""a moment for regret and reflection, not for a mood of anger or a tone of triumph"", and time for the party to ""broaden out so that all the members of our broad church feel welcome in our congregation"". The Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) had a ""heated"" and ""tense"" meeting on Monday night, with one MP telling the BBC there was an abject failure of leadership and ""no emotional intelligence was shown"". This video can not be played MPs resign from Labour over Brexit and anti-Semitism Speaking on Tuesday morning, Mr McDonnell said people had been ""very straightforward"" at the PLP meeting. He said:  ""I think we need a mammoth, massive listening exercise and to address some of those criticisms that have been made. I think we are finding a way forward, but it has got to be on the basis of taking the advice of people like Tom Watson, the PLP and others. ""If there are issues that we have to address, we'll address them; if it is about the style of the leadership, we'll address that; if it is about policy, we will listen to that as well."" Mr McDonnell also said he was ""really disappointed"" at the seven resignations, adding: ""I don't understand why they've gone, I still can't understand it. All the issues that they've raised, we are addressing and I would have rather they'd stayed with us and helped us sort those problems out than walk away."" Labour leader Mr Corbyn did not avoid the topic when appearing at the MAKE manufacturers conference in London on Tuesday. During his speech about Labour proposals to create jobs, he said: ""These policies won huge public support at the general election only 18 months ago, so I am disappointed that a small number of MPs decided to take a different path. ""But this is an agenda that unites half a million Labour Party members, inside and outside Parliament, along with millions of people across this country."" Pushed further by the BBC's deputy political editor, John Pienaar, during a Q&A, he added: ""I regret that seven MPs decided that they would no longer remain part of the Labour Party. I thank them for their work. ""I hope they realise they were elected to Parliament on a manifesto that was based around investment in the future, was based around a more equal and fairer society, was based around social justice. ""They were elected to carry out those policies. They've decided to go somewhere else and I regret that because I want our party to be strong.

Mr Umunna told Today that the new group was not yet a new political party, but he believed it could become one in time. He urged members from all parties to join them in building an ""alternative"" to the current two party system, which he said was ""fundamentally broken"". When asked who the two Tory MPs considering joining their ranks could be, he refused to speculate, but added: ""There are a lot of Labour MPs wrestling with their conscience on this issue but also Conservatives who have become demoralised by the UKIPisation, if you like, of the Conservative Party."" A number of Conservative MPs are at the centre of rumours about joining the new group, including Sarah Wollaston, a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum. On Monday evening, she tweeted: ""#BLUKIP has been busy taking over the Tory Party alongside the ERG. Soon there will be nothing left at all to appeal to moderate centre ground voters."" Other Conservative MPs unhappy with the party's direction include Anna Soubry, another People's Vote supporter, who has called in the past for a new centre party. This splintering might, just might - in time - turn into a much bigger redrawing of the landscape. For now though that is way off. And this is first and foremost about the Labour Party - the seeds of the splinter sown more than three years ago, bearing bitter fruit just when Parliament's biggest decisions over Brexit are about to be made.

"Stephen Lawrence had wanted to be an architect when he was murdered at the age of 18 It could be 100 years before the Met Police has the same ethnic mix as the population it serves, the force said. Currently 14% of Met officers are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds, but the 2011 Census shows 40.2% of Londoners identify as BAME. As a result the force says it wants to recruit 250 extra BAME officers a year. It comes as the force announced how it has changed since it was branded ""institutionally racist"" following Stephen Lawrence's murder in 1999. The force said its prediction that it could take 100 years to have a workforce that reflects Londoners would happen if it did not take further steps to ""attract and retain"" BAME officers. Eighteen-year-old Lawrence was set upon by a gang, stabbed and left to die in Eltham, south-east London, on the evening of 22 April 1993. The bungled initial investigation into his death was hampered by claims of racism, corruption and incompetence, and it took nearly 20 years for two of his five or six killers to finally be brought to justice. David Norris and Gary Dobson areboth serving life sentenceswhile the rest have evaded justice. Stephen Lawrence: How has his murder changed policing? Stephen Lawrence Day to be held annually Stephen Lawrence murder: A timeline of how the story unfolded Stephen Lawrence filmmaker wants viewers to feel family's emotions Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said theMacpherson report,externalinto the aftermath of his murder had ""defined my generation of policing"" but she said she did not believe the force was now institutionally racist. ""We are ambitious for the future, we are not going to forget Stephen or his legacy and we will continue to educate our officers about why it is that this police service does what it does now, and how that comes from the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry,"" she said. The latest report from the force's HR found 16% of PCs were BAME, and fewer than 10% for higher ranks. The proportion is 4% for chief officers. BAME officers and staff are also more likely to resign from the force or raise grievances. Since 1999, BAME officers have increased from 3% to 14%, while last year 30% of new recruits were from that background. How have police attitudes to race changed?

"Great white sharks may hold the secrets to curing cancer and other age-related diseases, experts believe. The first map of great whites sharks' DNA has revealed ""mutations"" that protect the animals against cancer and other illnesses. Scientists hope more research could help apply the findings to treating age-related illnesses in humans. The great white's ability to repair its own DNA has evolved in ways ours hasn't. The research was carried out by a team of scientists at the Save Our Seas Foundation Shark Research Centre at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. Unstable genes in humans are what make us vulnerable to aged-related diseases such as cancer. Because sharks have been around and at the top of their game for so long, they have evolved so their DNA can repair itself and is more tolerant to damage. ""Genome instability is a very important issue in many serious human diseases,"" says study co-leader Dr Mahmood Shivji. ""Now we find that nature has developed clever strategies to maintain the stability of genomes in these large-bodied, long-lived sharks. ""There's still tonnes to be learned from these evolutionary marvels, including information that will potentially be useful to fight cancer and age-related diseases, and improve wound-healing treatments in humans, as we uncover how these animals do it."" Great white sharks have been patrolling the seas for at least 16 million years and at their biggest, can grow up up to 20 feet long and weigh as much as three tonnes. Ignore the teeth, the most striking thing about sharks may be the secrets they hold in their DNA Shark DNA is one-and-a-half times bigger than human DNA, meaning there are things coded into the animals that, at the moment, humans can't do. And scientists hope to unlock those secrets and use them to treat the problems that DNA is already solving in sharks. They believe sharks could also help wound-healing and blood-clotting, because of their ability to recover quickly from serious injuries. This research could be a step towards a more positive reputation for one of the most feared animals in nature. Photographer Kimberly Jeffries recently told Radio 1 Newsbeat she felt ""no danger whatsoever"" when she swam with one of the biggest great whites in the world, who's named Deep Blue. ""It's an incredibly humbling experience,"" she said. Although she wasn't recommending that anyone hop in the water with some sharks. ""These are apex predators so they are to be respected,"" Kimberly said. Sharks already play an important role in the ecosystem of our oceans And through hunting fish and other animals in the sea, they can alsohelp their prey flourish,externalby targeting slower and weaker creatures. Studies also show thatsharks are even important in the fight against global warming,,externalas their hunting keeps the numbers of smaller creatures, who produce more carbon dioxide, in check.

"DNA was found on Alesha MacPhail's body which matched the 16-year-old accused of her murder, a court has heard. Forensic scientist Stuart Bailey told the jury that the odds of the intimate samples belonging to anyone else were more than a billion to one. The teenager denies abducting, raping and murdering six-year-old Alesha. Her body was discovered in a wooded area on the Isle of Bute on 2 July last year. Alesha trial told of DNA Google search Alesha accused had 'fantasy' killing chat Alesha, six, had 'catastrophic' injuries Woman denies killing six-year-old Alesha Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman The High Court in Glasgow previously heard Alesha suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. Stuart Bailey is the last prosecution witness to be called in the case by Iain MacSporran QC. The Scottish Police Authority forensic scientist authored or co-authored three reports on the case. Mr Bailey visited the crime scene, the flat on Ardbeg Road from where Alesha was abducted, and the home of the accused. He also examined clothing found on the shoreline. The court heard DNA samples from the accused, his mother, Alesha's grandparents, her father and his girlfriend were taken for comparative purposes. The jury was told various samples were taken from the child's body. Mr Bailey said the accused's DNA was detected on the front of Alesha's neck. The odds of it being from anyone else were more than one in a billion. Traces from the accused were also found on the back of her neck and her face, but those samples were not subject to a statistical forecast. A match for the accused's DNA was also detected on 14 parts of Alesha's body, including bruising. Given the volume of samples, Mr Bailey said it was ""highly unlikely"" they had got on the child through anything other than direct contact. The court also heard samples of the accused's DNA were detected on some of Alesha's clothing, which had been discarded next to her body. Mr Bailey later told the jury that DNA matching the accused was recovered from a pair of jogging bottoms found on the shoreline, intertwined with a pair of boxer shorts. The court heard the recovery of forensic material from the clothing had been hampered by their immersion in salt water. But the witness said a DNA sample was recovered from the inside seam of the waistband of the jogging bottoms. The six-year-old was staying at her grandparents' house before she disappeared He told the jury the odds of it being from anyone other than the accused was more than a billion to one. The court heard a knife found on the beach opposite Alesha's grandparents' home on Ardbeg Road and a hooded top discovered further along the shoreline were also examined. No blood or DNA was found on either the knife or the hooded top. Mr Bailey said the top was deemed insufficient for DNA recovery as it had been immersed in salt water and then dumped in a skip. Under cross-examination by Brian McConnachie QC, Mr Bailey said no traces of Alesha's DNA were found in the accused's home. The court also heard that no traces of the accused's DNA were recovered from Alesha's grandparents' home. Alesha, from Airdrie in North Lanarkshire, was only days into a summer break in Rothesay when she was killed. The teenager has lodged a special defence claiming the crime was committed by 18-year-old Toni McLachlan, who is the girlfriend of the victim's father. The court previously heard that the accused claimed he had sex with Ms McLachlan, and that she then planted his DNA - from a used condom - at the scene. In previous evidence, Ms McLachlan insisted she did not have sex with the accused and had nothing to do with Alesha's death. The defence case is expected to get under way on Tuesday afternoon. The trial, before judge Lord Matthews, continues. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

"Alesha MacPhail was holidaying on the Isle of Bute where her body was found The 16-year-old accused of murdering Alesha MacPhail has told a jury he did not kill the child. The teenager also denied abducting and raping the six-year-old, who had been holidaying on the Isle of Bute. The boy, who cannot be named because he is under 18, told the High Court trial: ""I have never met Alesha MacPhail."" The body of the schoolgirl, who died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck, was discovered in a wooded area on 2 July last year. Alesha, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, was only days into a summer break in Rothesay when she was killed. At the High Court in Glasgow, the teenager has lodged a special defence claiming the crime was committed by 18-year-old Toni McLachlan, the girlfriend of the victim's father. The accused claimed he had sex with Ms McLachlan, who then planted his DNA - from a used condom - at the scene. In previous evidence, Ms McLachlan insisted she did not have sex with the accused and had nothing to do with Alesha's death. The boy was called as the first witness for the defence after the prosecution closed its case. The teenager said he had been having sex with Ms McLachlan ""fairly frequently"". He said that from October 2017 they were ""friends with benefits"" and were ""meeting up, having sex, smoking joints"". This arrangement lasted most of the winter and stopped when he got back together with a former girlfriend, the court heard. He said that early on 2 July, he and Ms McLachlan were messaging on Instagram, and he had asked her for cannabis. She said she had none, but asked if he wanted to meet for a cigarette. The accused said they met in a shelter outside the home where she was staying with Mr MacPhail, Alesha and her grandparents, then went to a garage and had sex, before going their separate ways. The teenager said that out of concern for Ms McLachlan, he had lied to his mother and the police about having had sex. Defence QC Brian McConnachie asked the accused about a video he posted on social media that day which showed the top half of his body with the written message ""found who done it"". He replied: ""It was a video of my feet walking to the bathroom and the camera points up to the mirror and I pretend to get a fright and it says 'found who done it'."" Asked why he did that, he said: ""People were talking about who might have done it and one of my friends said my name and I didn't want to take it to heart so I just thought I would build on it."" Mr McConnachie said: ""You were making people know you were responsible."" The accused replied: ""No, we didn't even know it was a murder at that time, we were just speculating."" Questioned about messages he exchanged with a friend where he says he might ""kill one day for the lifetime experience"", he said these were ""not serious"". The teenager has lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming Ms McLachlan. In her evidence at the trial, Ms McLachlan denied being responsible for Alesha's death, saying she ""loved"" Alesha. She also denied suggestions by the defence that she had sex with the accused on 2 July, then planted his semen on Alesha, before ""attacking and brutalising her"" and murdering her. Under cross examination Iain McSporran QC, for the prosecution, put it to the accused that it would be ""extraordinarily wicked"" for someone to falsely allege Ms McLachlan abducted, raped and murdered Alesha. The teenager replied: ""It would be evil."" Mr McSporran later put it to the witness that it was either him or Ms McLachlan who was responsible. The accused replied: ""It is not me. ""Absolutely not. ""I could never do something like that."" The 16-year-old was also questioned about his strength and revealed he could bench press 50kg. The court was told Alesha weighed 22kg. The trial previously heard forensic evidence that Alesha's unmarked feet proved she had been carried to her death. The witness said he had no idea if Ms McLachlan could have carried the child. Mr McSporran replied: ""You could have."" The accused replied: ""I have never carried weights such a distance before."" Earlier the prosecution closed its case withevidence from forensic scientist Stuart Bailey. He told the court DNA found on Alesha's body matched the 16-year-old accused of her murder. Mr Bailey told the jury that the odds of the intimate samples belonging to anyone else were more than a billion to one. Samples of DNA matching the accused were also found on the child's body and clothing. The trial, before judge Lord Matthews, continues. DNA found on Alesha 'matched accused' Alesha trial told of DNA Google search Alesha accused had 'fantasy' killing chat Alesha, six, had 'catastrophic' injuries Woman denies killing six-year-old Alesha Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

"Mr Khan called on India to provide evidence to support its claims that Pakistan was involved Pakistan has warned it will retaliate if India takes military action against it after a militant attack on Indian forces in Indian-administered Kashmir. Prime Minister Imran Khan went on television to call on India to provide evidence to support its claims that Pakistan was involved. India responded that Mr Khan was again making excuses. More than 40 members of India's security forces died in Thursday's suicide bombing on their convoy. Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad said it was behind it. The attack has raised tensions between India and Pakistan, which have fought two wars and a limited conflict in the region and are both nuclear powers. In his first comments addressing the attack, he said India should ""stop blaming Pakistan without any proof or evidence"" and urged Indian authorities to share any ""actionable intelligence"". ""If you think that you will launch any kind of attack on Pakistan, Pakistan will not just think about retaliation, Pakistan will retaliate,"" he said, adding that only dialogue could help solve issues in Kashmir. Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Pulwama attack: What are Modi's options? India has long accused Pakistan of backing militant separatists in Indian-administered Kashmir. Mr Khan, who took office last year, said his government was ready to co-operate with India in investigating the attack. But he also said Delhi should reflect on why Kashmiri youth had reached a point where they no longer feared death. The prime minister said he had not addressed the attack earlier because ofSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's high-profile visit to Pakistanon Sunday and Monday. In a statement, the foreign ministry said that Mr Khan had failed to condemn the ""heinous act"" nor offer condolences to victims' families. ""It is a well-known fact that Jaish-e-Mohammad and its leader Masood Azhar are based in Pakistan. [This] should be sufficient proof for Pakistan to take action,"" the ministry said. It said that past attacks in India attributed to Pakistan-based militants had not been investigated properly by Islamabad. Mr Khan had also mentioned India's upcoming elections in the context of calls for retaliation against Pakistan - saying politicians believed strong action would boost votes. The Indian foreign ministry said the insinuation was ""regrettable"", adding: ""India's democracy is a model for the world which Pakistan would never understand."" Earlier, India's top military commander in Kashmir, Lt Gen KJS Dhillon, accused Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency of ""controlling"" the attack with Jaish-e-Mohammad commanders, but he provided no evidence. The funerals driving youth to militancy Viewpoint: How far might India go to 'punish' Pakistan? ""I'd request all the mothers in Kashmir to please request their sons who have joined terrorism to surrender and get back to the mainstream,"" he said. ""Otherwise anyone who has picked up the gun will be killed."" The suicide bomber has been identified as a young man from the region. Correspondents say a significant number of young Kashmiris have joined militant groups in recent years. By BBC Pakistan correspondent, Secunder Kermani, in Islamabad When Imran Khan took office last year he said he wanted to improve relations with India, and that for every one step India took, Pakistan would take two. The traditional wisdom in Pakistan is that the country's army hasn't wanted closer ties between the two. However, as the military seems supportive of Imran Khan's administration it had been hoped progress could now be made. In fact, over the past few months, Indian officials have been the ones more reluctant to pursue negotiations - probably because of the upcoming elections. In his speech, Imran Khan said there was ""a new mindset"" in Pakistan, and that any militant group using Pakistani soil was an ""enemy"" of the country. He asked the Indian government what gain they thought Pakistan could hope to achieve from an attack like this. But while his confident and measured speech will go down well domestically, uncomfortable questions remain about the state's relationship with Kashmir-focused militant groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad. While JeM is a banned organisation, many international observers believe Pakistani intelligence services allow it operate under the radar. Allow Twitter content?

Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir, but control only parts of it. Thursday's bombing was the deadliest attack on Indian forces in the region for decades. Indian mourners held a candlelit vigil in Siliguri, West Bengal So far India has focused on retaliation by economic and diplomatic means. It has revoked Pakistan's Most Favoured Nation trading status and raised customs duties to 200%. Both countries have recalled top diplomats. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is facing an election later this year, has vowed a strong response and says he will give the military free rein. The last time an attack on Indian forces close to this magnitude occurred in Kashmir was in 2016, when 19 soldiers were killed at a base. In response to that,India carried out ""surgical strikes""which involved Indian soldiers crossing the de facto border to hit Pakistani posts. This video can not be played In December Yogita Limaye examined why there had been a rise in violence in Kashmir This time heavy snow in the region could make that kind of limited ground response impossible, analysts say. But there are fears that going further - with air strikes, for example - could lead to Pakistani retaliation and a significant escalation.

"A close-up of the test device A new rapid test for earlier diagnosis of sepsis is being developed by University of Strathclyde researchers. The device, which has been tested in a laboratory, may be capable of producing results in two-and-a-half minutes, theBiosensors and Bioelectronics journal,externalstudy suggests. Diagnosing sepsis can be a complex process. The UK Sepsis Trust said it welcomed the research but added that no test was perfect at spotting the condition. It is estimated that 52,000 people in the UK die every year from sepsis, which is a serious complication of an infection. There is a lot of research going on to attempt to find out what exactly triggers the sometimes fatal reaction involved in sepsis. The initial problem can be quite mild and start anywhere - from a cut on the finger to a chest or urine infection - but if left untreated can set off a cascade of reactions, from shock to organ failure and in some cases, death. The biggest killer you may not know Sepsis: What is it - and how to spot it? Sepsis: Ambulance call handlers 'must spot condition' Early diagnosis is key because for every hour that antibiotic treatment is delayed, the likelihood of death increases. Diagnosis of sepsis is usually based on clinical judgement, body temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, and a series of blood tests. As soon as sepsis is suspected, broad-acting antibiotics should be given to the patient. A blood test that aims to determine the best antibiotic to treat the infection can take up to 72 hours. The new test uses a device,externalto detect if one of the protein biomarkers of sepsis, interleukin-6 (IL-6), is present in the blood. Dr Damion Corrigan with the microelectrode biosensor device Dr Damion Corrigan, who helped develop the test, said IL-6 is one of the best markers of sepsis. ""The type of test we envisage could be at the bedside and involve doctors or nurses being able to monitor levels of sepsis biomarkers for themselves."" He said the test would work well in GP surgeries and in A&E to quickly rule sepsis in or out, if it was eventually approved through clinical trials. Dr Corrigan added that sepsis not only kills people but can also leave them with life-changing problems, such as limb loss, kidney failure and even post-traumatic stress disorder. The idea is that the device could be implanted and used on patients in intensive care. Symptoms in adults: Slurred speech or confusion Extreme shivering or muscle pain Passing no urine in a day Severe breathlessness It feels like you're going to die Skin mottled or discoloured Symptoms in children: Breathing very fast Fit or convulsion Looks mottled, bluish, or pale Has a rash that does not fade when you press it Is very lethargic or difficult to wake Feels abnormally cold to touch With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, normally antibiotics, most people make a full recovery. Source: UK Sepsis Trust,external The project's clinical adviser and co-author, Dr David Alcorn, from Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital, said the tiny electrode had the potential to detect sepsis and, at the same time, diagnose the type of infection and the recommended antibiotic. ""The implications for this are massive, and the ability to give the right antibiotic at the right time to the right patient is extraordinary. ""I can definitely see this having a clear use in hospitals, not only in this country, but all round the world."" The researchers have applied for funding to develop a prototype device and hope to get commercial interest in taking it forward. They hope the low-cost test could come into everyday use in three to five years. Ryan, who contracted sepsis in 2015, lost three stone in weight and struggled to walk after being in a coma Ryan Sutherland, from Clackmannanshire, ended up in a coma with sepsis, which had been misdiagnosed. He had felt unwell with a sore throat that got worse, but was told by a doctor it was a viral infection. ""As the week went on, it got worse and by the Thursday it was really bad. My wife took me to the out-of-hours doctor that night and by this point I was really unwell and could barely move. But I was given an anti-sickness injection and then I was sent home."" Hours later he collapsed. He was taken to hospital and suffered two cardiac arrests. His body went into shock with the sepsis and his organs started to shut down. After eight days in a coma, Ryan woke up and made an almost complete recovery. ""No-one mentioned sepsis, although looking back I had all the symptoms,"" said Ryan. ""It's hard to diagnose, so if this test had been around it could have made all the difference to what happened with me."" The UK Sepsis Trust estimates that earlier diagnosis and treatment across the UK would save at least 14,000 lives a year. Dr Ron Daniels, the trust's chief executive officer, said: ""Any kind of test that enables us to identify sepsis earlier, before symptoms even present themselves, could help save even more lives and bring us closer to our goal of ending preventable deaths from sepsis. ""Systems like this are so important as, with every hour before the right antibiotics are administered, risk of death increases. ""No test is perfect in the identification of sepsis, so it's crucial we continue to educate clinicians to think sepsis in order to prompt them to use such tests.""

"This video can not be played His pet cat, Choupette, has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers online There is a reason why Karl Lagerfeld, who has died at the age of 85, was called the emperor - or ""Kaiser"" in his native German - by fashion insiders. After all, he was one of the world's most iconic fashion designers, at the heart of not one, not two, but three fashion houses. The man who steered Chanel for more than 30 years combined artistic flair with business acumen which would see the Parisian label's sales reach $10bn (Â£7.7bn) in 2017. But Lagerfeld's brand reached beyond his business ventures and into every aspect of his life. Karl Lagerfeld: The life of a design icon in pictures ""I am very much down to Earth. Just not this earth"" - Lagerfeld in quotes He was instantly recognisable, thanks to his powdered white ponytail, dark glasses and high-collared white shirts. But then, what else would you expect of a man who once noted ""anyone who wears jogging pants has lost control of their life"". ""I'm a walking label,"" he told CNN in 2011. ""My name is Labelfeld not Lagerfeld."" Karl Lagerfeld's exact date of birth has been a contentious issue for some time. According to his eponymous website, he was born in 1938. However, others have settled on September 1933 as a more likely date of birth Either way, he was born in Hamburg to a German mother and Swedish father, Otto, who imported condensed milk. Within a few years, they had moved to the town of Bad Bremstedt, where he would spend the war years. This video can not be played Karl Lagerfeld often appeared at shows alongside his models However, it seems a young Lagerfeld had no intention of staying in the country of his birth, having already got a taste for fashion - and a sense he might be destined for big things. ""As a child, a very young person, I had the feeling: 'It doesn't matter what you do - you're compelling!' I thought I was sacrosanct - wasted on dismal post-war Germany,"" Lagerfeld told German media. In 1952 - having seen a Dior fashion show in Hamburg - the teenage Lagerfeld moved to Paris. His big break came in 1954, when he won first prize for a sketch of a coat which was then made by Pierre Balmain. The designer, impressed, offered him a job as his assistant. Just three years later, he was named Jean Patou's art director. Then, in 1965, after a short stint with Chloe, he would begin a collaboration that was to last to the end of his life, with Italian fashion house Fendi. Karl Lagerfeld smiles for the camera after receiving an award in 1973 But it would be his role as Chanel's artistic director, beginning in 1983, which would truly thrust him into the limelight and create the fashion icon known for the next three decades. However, he acknowledged the brand's founder may not have been thrilled with the direction he took the label. ""What I do Coco would have hated,"" he said. ""The label has an image and it's up to me to update it. I do what she never did. I had to go from what Chanel was to what it should be, could be, what it had been to something else."" He still did not sit on his laurels. His appointment at Chanel was followed the next year by the creation of his own brand, Karl Lagerfeld. Not happy with simply designing clothes, however, in 1987 he started to photograph his own campaigns. But in 1989 tragedy struck: his partner of almost two decades, the French aristocrat Jacques de Bascher died of an Aids-related illness. Lagerfeld following Chanel's ready-to-wear show in March 1984 According to his biographer, Alicia Drake, the death of de Bascher - who had cheated on Lagerfeld with his long-term rival Yves Saint Laurent - was followed by a period of weight gain and becoming infatuated with several young men. The turn of the century saw Lagerfeld enter a new market: that of the diet industry. He proudly shed some 43kg (93lb) and turned his experience into a book, The 3D Diet, which would go on to sell thousands. ""I suddenly wanted to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane,external, who used to work for Saint Laurent and now creates the Dior Homme collections,""  he explained in The Telegraph in 2004. That same year, he became the first fashion designer to collaborate with high street clothes store H&M.

"This video can not be played His pet cat, Choupette, has amassed hundreds of thousands of followers online There is a reason why Karl Lagerfeld, who has died at the age of 85, was called the emperor - or ""Kaiser"" in his native German - by fashion insiders. After all, he was one of the world's most iconic fashion designers, at the heart of not one, not two, but three fashion houses. The man who steered Chanel for more than 30 years combined artistic flair with business acumen which would see the Parisian label's sales reach $10bn (Â£7.7bn) in 2017. But Lagerfeld's brand reached beyond his business ventures and into every aspect of his life. Karl Lagerfeld: The life of a design icon in pictures ""I am very much down to Earth. Just not this earth"" - Lagerfeld in quotes He was instantly recognisable, thanks to his powdered white ponytail, dark glasses and high-collared white shirts. But then, what else would you expect of a man who once noted ""anyone who wears jogging pants has lost control of their life"". ""I'm a walking label,"" he told CNN in 2011. ""My name is Labelfeld not Lagerfeld."" Karl Lagerfeld's exact date of birth has been a contentious issue for some time. According to his eponymous website, he was born in 1938. However, others have settled on September 1933 as a more likely date of birth Either way, he was born in Hamburg to a German mother and Swedish father, Otto, who imported condensed milk. Within a few years, they had moved to the town of Bad Bremstedt, where he would spend the war years. This video can not be played Karl Lagerfeld often appeared at shows alongside his models However, it seems a young Lagerfeld had no intention of staying in the country of his birth, having already got a taste for fashion - and a sense he might be destined for big things. ""As a child, a very young person, I had the feeling: 'It doesn't matter what you do - you're compelling!' I thought I was sacrosanct - wasted on dismal post-war Germany,"" Lagerfeld told German media. In 1952 - having seen a Dior fashion show in Hamburg - the teenage Lagerfeld moved to Paris. His big break came in 1954, when he won first prize for a sketch of a coat which was then made by Pierre Balmain. The designer, impressed, offered him a job as his assistant. Just three years later, he was named Jean Patou's art director. Then, in 1965, after a short stint with Chloe, he would begin a collaboration that was to last to the end of his life, with Italian fashion house Fendi. Karl Lagerfeld smiles for the camera after receiving an award in 1973 But it would be his role as Chanel's artistic director, beginning in 1983, which would truly thrust him into the limelight and create the fashion icon known for the next three decades. However, he acknowledged the brand's founder may not have been thrilled with the direction he took the label. ""What I do Coco would have hated,"" he said. ""The label has an image and it's up to me to update it. I do what she never did. I had to go from what Chanel was to what it should be, could be, what it had been to something else."" He still did not sit on his laurels. His appointment at Chanel was followed the next year by the creation of his own brand, Karl Lagerfeld. Not happy with simply designing clothes, however, in 1987 he started to photograph his own campaigns. But in 1989 tragedy struck: his partner of almost two decades, the French aristocrat Jacques de Bascher died of an Aids-related illness. Lagerfeld following Chanel's ready-to-wear show in March 1984 According to his biographer, Alicia Drake, the death of de Bascher - who had cheated on Lagerfeld with his long-term rival Yves Saint Laurent - was followed by a period of weight gain and becoming infatuated with several young men. The turn of the century saw Lagerfeld enter a new market: that of the diet industry. He proudly shed some 43kg (93lb) and turned his experience into a book, The 3D Diet, which would go on to sell thousands. ""I suddenly wanted to wear clothes designed by Hedi Slimane,external, who used to work for Saint Laurent and now creates the Dior Homme collections,""  he explained in The Telegraph in 2004. That same year, he became the first fashion designer to collaborate with high street clothes store H&M.

"Karl Lagerfeld has responded to criticism over his recent comments that Adele is ""a little too fat"".

In the statement,external, Lagerfeld said his comments were actually in relation to American singer Lana Del Rey.

""I lost over 30 kilos over 10 years ago and have kept it off,"" said Lagerfeld. ""I know how it feels when the press is mean to you in regards to your appearance.""

"Some 20,000 people who have fled Baghuz in recent weeks have been taken to a camp The UN has expressed concern about the fate of some 200 families reportedly trapped in the last tiny area of Syria still held by the Islamic State group. Human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said they were apparently being prevented from leaving by IS militants. They were also being subjected to intense bombardment by US-led coalition and allied Syrian forces, she added. On Tuesday evening, dozens of lorries reportedly arrived on the outskirts of the IS enclave to evacuate civilians. Could a defeated IS rebound? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, cited its sources as saying wives and children of militants would be taken to an undisclosed location as part of a deal with the coalition. Earlier, it reported that a request by militants to be given safe passage to the opposition-held Syrian province of Idlib or neighbouring Iraq had been rejected by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance. IS militants are reportedly confined to tents pitched on top of a network of tunnels and caves SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali appeared to dismiss such an idea on Tuesday morning, insisting the militants had ""only two options - either they surrender or they will be killed in battle"". ""We are working on secluding and evacuating civilians and then we will attack. This could happen soon,"" Mr Bali was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? How many IS foreign fighters are left? Five years ago, IS controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. It proclaimed the creation of a ""caliphate"", imposing its brutal rule on almost eight million people and generating billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. Now, an estimated 300 militants and hundreds of civilians are surrounded inside about 0.5 sq km (0.2 square miles) of land in the Baghuz area, which is in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, near the border with Iraq. ""Civilians continue to be used as pawns by the various parties,"" Ms Bachelet said. ""I call on them to provide safe passage to those who wish to flee, while those wish to remain must also be protected as much as possible. ""They should not be sacrificed to ideology on the one hand, or military expediency on the other. If protecting civilian lives means taking a few more days to capture the last fraction of land controlled by [IS], then so be it."" US-backed SDF fighters launched an assault on Baghuz this month Although no-one has reportedly made it out of Baghuz in the past three days, some 20,000 civilians have been taken by the SDF to a makeshift camp for displaced people at al-Hol, in Hassakeh province, in recent weeks. Among them are the wives and children of IS militants and many foreign nationals, including the British teenager Shamima Begum, who was 15 when she ran away from her home to join IS four years ago. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said on Monday that at least 62 people had died on their way to al-Hol, two thirds of them children under the age of one. Exhaustion and malnutrition were the principal causes of the deaths. This video can not be played On Monday Shamima Begum told the BBC she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" Ms Bachelet also said she was alarmed by an upsurge in attacks and civilian casualties in Idlib province, where a takeover by a jihadist group linked to al-Qaeda, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has jeopardised a truce brokered by Turkey and Russia in September. The Syrian government's bombardment of a demilitarised buffer zone, which runs along the frontline in Idlib and areas of northern Hama and western Aleppo provinces, started to escalate in December and has further intensified in recent days, according to the UN. Islamic State group: The full story At the same time, there has been an increase in fighting among rebel and jihadist factions, and also in the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in areas they control. On Monday, at least 16 civilians, including women and children, were reportedly killed by two bomb explosions in the Qusour district of Idlib city. The second blast appeared to have been designed to kill those, including medical workers, coming to the aid of victims of the first. Another nine civilians, including four women and two boys, were meanwhile reportedly killed by government strikes on Khan Sheikhoun on Friday and Saturday.

"This video can not be played Birmingham bin strike: Workers start industrial action More than 300 Birmingham bin workers have started the first of a series of strikes in a dispute with the council. It stems from claims some staff have been ""blacklisted"" for taking part in industrial action in 2017, when piles of rubbish were left on the streets. The Unite members have worked to rule since 29 December over what it calls ""secret payments"" given to GMB members who abstained from a previous strike. A ""reasonable"" offer had been made to unions, Birmingham City Council said. Bin workers on the picket line at the Redfern Road depot in Tyseley held placards with the words ""betrayed"" on them Collections in the city have moved to fortnightly, which the council said was to ensure ""reliability of service"" until the dispute is resolved. Picket lines were in place at four council refuse depots from 05:00 GMT until 14:00, Unite said. What's going to happen to Birmingham's rubbish? Unite's assistant general secretary Howard Beckett described the action as a ""last resort"" after six weeks of talks to resolve the row collapsed last week. ""This industrial action is entirely of Birmingham council's making,"" he said. Rubbish is already starting to pile up in Birmingham during the second industrial action The three-month long strike action that started in June 2017 was part of a dispute over job losses, but GMB members were not involved. Unite said it discovered the ""secret payments"" to GMB members late last year and is demanding its members receive equal payments. The council and GMB said the payments were not because members kept working, but because they had been left out of conciliatory talks which resolved the strike last year. GMB made a claim against the council as their members were affected by the agreement, which they were not consulted on. The council has offered to pay Unite members up to Â£3,000, however the union said this was still about Â£600 less than GMB members received. Unite members claim they have been ""blacklisted"" for striking in 2017 Mr Beckett said: ""On one hand, it [the council] has said the payments were justified, but also said that they would make offers up to Â£3,000 to our members. ""Where is the logic in that?"" The offer tabled by the council last week ""was worse than the one which Unite had already rejected"", he said and demanded that ""everyone will get the same"". But the council has urged the unions to put it to members ""so they can give it the serious consideration it deserves"". Birmingham Council announced fortnightly collections to deal with the industrial action Residents said there was already ""mess everywhere"" in Birmingham Up to 150 members were expected at the Redfern Road Depot in Tyseley during the day of action. Those gathered earlier had placards which read ""betrayed by a Labour council"" and ""bin your blacklisting Birmingham Council"". Among the crowd was councillor Majid Mahmood, former cabinet member for clean streets, waste and recycling, who resigned last month when industrial action was announced. Mr Mahmood told the BBC he was ""disappointed with the cabinet"" and had joined the picket ""to show support and solidarity with the workers who I firmly believe have been discriminated against"". Former cabinet member for clean streets councillor Majid Mahmood (far right) joined the picket in Tyseley ""I'm hoping they [the council] will see sense and end the discrimination against these workers,"" he said. During his time in the cabinet, from May last year until January, he said he ""did not know about any payment made to other workers"" and criticised the council's lack of transparency. Resident Luke Service said his street in the Stechford area of the city had been ""covered in rubbish"" with bins ""overflowing"" since before official strike action began. He said his recycling had not been taken since 18 December, meaning he still has waste from Christmas piling up. ""There's rubbish all over the street as people leave it next to the bins and then it gets blown by the weather,"" Mr Service said. ""This has even led to us having rats and foxes in our street at various points. ""It's a tough situation, but there needs to be some sort of compromise."" Workers will be striking for two days a week over the next five weeks, with Unison workers, who are also involved, due to stage their first walk-out on Friday. Bin workers 'getting grief over strikes' Workers 'offered Â£3k' to end strike 2017 Birmingham bin strike 'cost Â£6m' Usually, Birmingham residents receive a weekly general waste collection and a recycling service every two weeks, though some residents in the city have complained of missed collections over the past few months, even before industrial action began. Household rubbish on the streets of Alum Rock in August 2017 The council has said that from Monday,residents should put both bins out on what would be their normal recycling collection day,external, and that a reasonable amount of ""side waste"" could also be left. Collections were not being suspended during any strike action, the authority said.  402,337tonnes of household rubbish collected by Birmingham City Council in 2017-18 345 kgcollected per resident 21%of household waste sent for recycling Speaking last week, councillor Brett O'Reilly, cabinet member for clean streets, waste and recycling, said the authority was ""determined"" to resolve the dispute and apologised for any missed collections so far. ""But until we reach a resolution we must do everything we can to minimise the disruption to the people who live in Birmingham,"" he said. Both unions are also pursuing legal action against the council as part of the dispute, which will be holding an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

"Honda employee Martin Huggins said the news was ""a sad day for Swindon"" Workers at Honda's factory in Swindon say the announcement that it is to close is ""devastating"" for the town. The carmaker has confirmed it will shut the plant in 2021, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. Factory worker Martin Huggins called the news ""a sad day for Swindon"", while a Unite union leader said the workforce had been ""betrayed"". Honda has said the closure is a result of ""unprecedented changes in the automotive industry"". Outside the factory gates, employee Chris, whose son also works at the plant, told BBC Wiltshire he was ""extremely disappointed"". ""I've been here 19 years and it's devastating for all involved,"" he said. ""You've only got to look across the road at the large warehouses here too, I don't know what the jobs will be replaced with. ""We're just going to find out what will happen and take it from there really."" Sue Newall's husband Steve has worked at the factory for 23 years. She told the BBC he found out about the closure when a colleague who was off sick saw it on the news and called in to tell the others. ""The managers didn't know. There were rumours but we didn't expect such big news. My husband was sent home with a pack to read up on,"" she said. ""It's going to be a big salary that won't be coming into our house soon but you just have to deal with the shock to our system."" Another worker, Keith Murray, said the news reminded him of how the closure of the railway works in the 1980s affected the town. ""Things do change, and other businesses will come in to take over. I don't want to see anyone out of work,"" he said. Alan Tomala, from Unite, said employees at the factory felt ""betrayed"". He added: ""They feel that the company owes them a little more than hearing the news in the media. It should have been the employer telling them yesterday. ""I left work yesterday to 57 missed calls and around 130 emails, and not one from Honda.  It surprises me and I'm angered by it."" Alan Tomala from Unite said the scale of job losses was ""enormous"" Local employment agencies have begun setting up meetings to prepare employees, who were all sent home from the factory on Tuesday morning and told to spend the day with their families. Kath Curr, managing director of C&D Recruitment in Swindon, said the closure was ""devastating for the town as a whole"", but Honda workers' skills were ""completely transferrable"" . ""Swindon is one of the fastest growing towns in Europe and let's hope Honda doesn't make the local economy suffer because of that,"" she added. Swindon Borough Council leader David Renard said: ""I don't think there's anything we could have done to keep [Honda] here. ""We wanted them to stay, but they made a different decision."" Honda said in a statement that it would be making a commitment to electrified cars in response to ""unprecedented changes in the automotive industry"". ""We deeply regret how unsettling today's announcement will be,"" it added. Are you an employee at the Honda car plant in Swindon?

"There is rarely a single reason why a company takes a very significant decision. Many will be quick to pin the blame for Honda's decision to close its Swindon plant solely on Brexit, but there are other forces at work. A new trade deal between the EU and Japan will see tariffs on cars exported from Japan to Europe reduced to zero over time. That means a dwindling rationale to base manufacturing inside the EU, and indeed, Honda plans to move production back to Japan rather than relocate elsewhere in Europe. Production at Swindon has been in decline for some time and is currently running at about half its capacity - another strike against it. But having said all that, Japanese companies are very long-term investors. In the mid-1980s, Margaret Thatcher championed the UK as the perfect outpost for Japanese carmakers looking for access to European markets. It worked. Honda, along with Toyota and Nissan, poured tens of billions of pounds into reviving the UK car industry. Since the referendum, the Japanese government, its UK ambassador and company managements have repeatedly warned about the corrosive effect of Brexit uncertainty and the possibility of losing frictionless trade with the EU. Honda is not alone in pulling investment from the UK. Nissan reversed its decision to build the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, while Sony and Panasonic moved their European HQs to the EU. In each case, the rationale was slightly different, but many in Japan feel that failure to provide Brexit certainty counts as a broken promise, permitting the loosening of ties that used to bind the two countries.

"Nissan will be forced to reapply for nearly Â£60m of taxpayer support after backtracking on a promise to build its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland. A letter from the government to Nissan, written in 2016, revealed that the Japanese carmaker would only get the money if it made the car in the UK. The government clarified that Nissan had received just Â£2.6m of the funds, but would have to reapply for the rest. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the X-Trail would have created 741 UK jobs. But he told the House of Commons that Nissan had committed to building its Qashqai, Juke and Leaf models in Sunderland, where it employs 7,000 workers. Mr Clark also said: ""While the decision was made on broader business grounds, Nissan commented on the need for us to come together and resolve the question of our future trading relationship with the EU. I believe their advice should be listened to and acted upon."" In the 2016 letter from Mr Clark,externalto Nissan's then boss, Carlos Ghosn, he said the funding was contingent ""on a positive decision by the Nissan board to allocate production of the Qashqai and X-Trail models to the Sunderland plant"". Mr Ghosn has since been sacked as Nissan's chairman and is in detention in Japanfollowing claims of financial misconduct. Mr Ghosn has denied the allegations. Simon Jack: The real reasons Nissan pulled its investment Nissan chooses Japan over UK for new car Carmakers fear rising trade barriers after Brexit Nissan had originally asked for Â£80m in state support, but following a review by an independent advisory committee, that figure was reduced to Â£61m. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said Nissan has been given Â£2.6m and would have to reapply for the remaining Â£58.4m. On Sunday, when Nissan announced its decision not to build the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, the firm's Europe chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said that ""the continued uncertainty around the UK's future relationship with the EU is not helping companies like ours to plan for the future"". The government had to clarify its position after Business Minister Richard Harrington told the BBC that Nissan would get the Â£61m support payment. Mr Harrington told BBC Newcastle: ""The Â£60m still stands. It's to do with research and development and developing alternative technologies and making sure Nissan is at the forefront of that. ""This was nothing to do with the X-Trail."" Following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, Mr Ghosn had hinted that he would seek compensation if car exports to Europe were subject to tariffs. Mr Ghosn met Prime Minister Theresa May to discuss the future of Nissan's plant in Sunderland, after which he said he was ""confident"" that the government would keep the UK a competitive place to do business after it leaves the EU. In the letter to Mr Ghosn, Mr Clark said: ""It will be a critical priority of our negotiation to support UK car manufacturers and ensure that their ability to export to and from the EU is not adversely affected by the UK's future relationship with the EU."" Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee said Nissan's decision not to built the X-Trail in the UK ""is a blow to production at Sunderland"". She added: ""The government's mishandling of Brexit, the reluctance to rule out 'no deal' and the lack of certainty around our future trading relationship with our biggest and nearest trading partner has made this decision sadly predictable, no matter what assurances may have been provided in the past.""

"Great white sharks may hold the secrets to curing cancer and other age-related diseases, experts believe. The first map of great whites sharks' DNA has revealed ""mutations"" that protect the animals against cancer and other illnesses. Scientists hope more research could help apply the findings to treating age-related illnesses in humans. The great white's ability to repair its own DNA has evolved in ways ours hasn't. The research was carried out by a team of scientists at the Save Our Seas Foundation Shark Research Centre at Nova Southeastern University in Florida. Unstable genes in humans are what make us vulnerable to aged-related diseases such as cancer. Because sharks have been around and at the top of their game for so long, they have evolved so their DNA can repair itself and is more tolerant to damage. ""Genome instability is a very important issue in many serious human diseases,"" says study co-leader Dr Mahmood Shivji. ""Now we find that nature has developed clever strategies to maintain the stability of genomes in these large-bodied, long-lived sharks. ""There's still tonnes to be learned from these evolutionary marvels, including information that will potentially be useful to fight cancer and age-related diseases, and improve wound-healing treatments in humans, as we uncover how these animals do it."" Great white sharks have been patrolling the seas for at least 16 million years and at their biggest, can grow up up to 20 feet long and weigh as much as three tonnes. Ignore the teeth, the most striking thing about sharks may be the secrets they hold in their DNA Shark DNA is one-and-a-half times bigger than human DNA, meaning there are things coded into the animals that, at the moment, humans can't do. And scientists hope to unlock those secrets and use them to treat the problems that DNA is already solving in sharks. They believe sharks could also help wound-healing and blood-clotting, because of their ability to recover quickly from serious injuries. This research could be a step towards a more positive reputation for one of the most feared animals in nature. Photographer Kimberly Jeffries recently told Radio 1 Newsbeat she felt ""no danger whatsoever"" when she swam with one of the biggest great whites in the world, who's named Deep Blue. ""It's an incredibly humbling experience,"" she said. Although she wasn't recommending that anyone hop in the water with some sharks. ""These are apex predators so they are to be respected,"" Kimberly said. Sharks already play an important role in the ecosystem of our oceans And through hunting fish and other animals in the sea, they can alsohelp their prey flourish,externalby targeting slower and weaker creatures. Studies also show thatsharks are even important in the fight against global warming,,externalas their hunting keeps the numbers of smaller creatures, who produce more carbon dioxide, in check.

"MPs want to see more sustainable designs and repair services Clothing brands and retailers should pay a penny on every garment they sell to fund a Â£35m annual recycling scheme. That's the view of MPs, who say ""fast fashion"" is a major contributor to greenhouse gases, water pollution, air pollution and over-use of water. And they urge the government to force clothing manufacturers to pay more towards collecting and recycling the waste they create. Green campaigners argue the MPs' recommendations are really quite tame. They're calling for an end to what they regard as the over-consumption of clothes. The fashion industry creates jobs worldwide and is said to be worth Â£28bn to the UK economy - but it is estimated to produce as many greenhouse gases as all the planes flying in the world. Libby Peake, from the think-tank Green Alliance, told BBC News: ""One of the areas in which you could make a big difference in terms of your personal climate change impact is by reducing the amount of clothes you buy and keeping them for longer, then donating them to charity shops to keep them in the national wardrobe."" The clothing trade consumes vast volumes of fresh water and creates chemical and plastic pollution. Manmade fibres are found in the bellies of creatures in the deep ocean. The Environmental Audit Committee is also concerned about the use of child labour, prison labour, forced labour and bonded labour in the manufacture of clothes. Quiz: Are your clothes damaging the environment? 5 fashion materials that are bad for wildlife,external Some progressive firms now offer vouchers to shoppers taking back used garments. Marks & Spencer is among the leaders with its ""Plan A"" (because there's no Plan B). The Global Recycling Council commends other firms, including Adidas, which will use only recycled polyester in all shoes and clothing by 2024; and Bottletop, which collaborated with Mulberry to launch a luxury bag made entirely from up-cycled materials (pre-used goods given extra value). But the MPs say they've received inadequate commitments from JD Sports, Sports Direct, Amazon UK and Boohoo. Spokespeople for some of these firms say they've taken other positive measures that haven't been properly registered by the MPs. The MPs' report says it is an open secret that some fast-fashion factories in places such as Leicester are not paying the minimum wage - and the same firms are selling clothes so cheaply that they are being treated as single-use items. The MPs say in the UK we buy more clothes per person than any other country in Europe - and a glut of second-hand clothing is swamping the market and depressing prices for used textiles. Less than 1% of material used to produce clothing is recycled into new garments at the end of its life. Would you rent rather than buy your clothes? Recycled clothes: The dress made out of old jeans This video can not be played Fashion bloggers give their tips on loving what you have and recycling The committee chair, Mary Creagh, said: ""Fashion retailers should be forced to pay for the impact of their clothes when they're thrown away."" She said the government should end throwaway fashion by incentivising companies that offer sustainable designs and repair services. ""Children should be taught the joy of making and mending clothes in school,"" she told us. ""We've got to help teenagers get an emotional attachment to their clothes instead of just wearing them a couple of times, getting photographed for Instagram and then chucking them away. ""All consumers have got to accept they need to buy fewer clothes - then mend them if they're torn, or rent or share them."" The MPs conclude that a voluntary approach to improving the sustainability of the fashion industry is failing - with just 11 fashion retailers signed up to an agreement to reduce their water, waste and carbon footprints. The committee says big retailers should be obliged by ministers to comply with high standards on the manufacture and recycling of clothing. Peter Andrews, from the British Retail Consortium (BRC), told us a growing number of stores were providing take-back schemes for unwanted clothes, and introducing stock made from recycled materials. He didn't immediately reject the idea of a penny levy on clothes, and said retailers were willing to discuss how much of a role they should take in dealing with garments where they're thrown away. He said: ""The sustainability of fashion is a high priority for BRC members - the transparency they have shown and the level of engagement with the inquiry reflects that."" Sophie Gorton, an associate lecturer in textiles at Chelsea College, is a long-standing proponent of sustainable fashion. She told us there were signs of hope that the industry was starting to change. ""For years we have asked the people who make textiles and yarn about the sustainability of their products and they just haven't wanted to know,"" she said. ""Now, suddenly, they're interested in what makes sustainable hemp or linen - they really want to think about it. It's a very exciting time."" This video can not be played Claire and Emily are trying to empower people to make their own clothes Clare Farrell, a member of the climate group Extinction Rebellion and also a fashion lecturer, says the committee is aiming at the wrong target. She admits it's better to recycle clothing fibres than throw garments away, but she says the real problem is consumer capitalism: people are putting an intolerable strain on resources simply because they're buying too many clothes in the first place. ""We need a change in mindset,"" she told us. ""Kids buy clothes, wear them a few times and then get rid of them. How do we tackle that? It's the nature of consumer capitalism and it's a very, very big problem for us all. ""Fashion is a big part of the economy, but we can't tackle the problems unless we admit that economy is killing us the way it's currently run.""

"This video can not be played MPs resign from Labour over Brexit and anti-Semitism More Labour MPs could quit the party unless it listens to their concerns, Jeremy Corbyn has been warned. Seven MPs have walked out in protest at the Labour leader's handling of anti-Semitism and Brexit. One of the seven, Chuka Umunna, said ""a lot of Labour MPs"" could follow suit, together with Tories ""demoralised by the UKIPisation of their party"". Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson has warned his party could see more defections if it did not change. He said Labour had to do more to tackle anti-Semitism and he also urged Mr Corbyn to reshuffle his shadow cabinet to reflect a wider range of MPs. Mr Corbyn has said in a statement he was ""disappointed"" by the defections, which represent the biggest split in the Labour Party since the Social Democratic Party was set up 40 years ago. Who were the Social Democratic Party? Derek Hatton rejoins Labour after 34 years Who are the Labour MPs resigning? 'Cowards and traitors' - how Twitter reacted Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the seven should now stand down as MPs and seek re-election against Labour Party candidates. The seven MPs - Mr Umunna, Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey - quit Labour in protest at what they said was a culture of ""bullying and bigotry"" in the party and frustration over the leadership's reluctance to back another EU referendum. Mr Umunna said another ""big issue for us"" was the belief that Mr Corbyn could not be trusted with national security, if he became prime minister. ""Many Labour MPs agree with us on that,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Umunna said the new Independent Group was not yet a new political party, but he believed it could become one in time. He urged members of all parties to join them in building an ""alternative"" to the current two party system, which he said was ""fundamentally broken"". The BBC has been told two Conservative MPs are thinking of joining the new Independent Group in Parliament. Mr Umunna refused to speculate on who they could be but he added: ""There are a lot of Labour MPs wrestling with their conscience on this issue but also Conservatives who have become demoralised by the UKIPisation, if you like, of the Conservative Party."" Labour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 months A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims A number of Conservative MPs are at the centre of rumours about joining the new group. Sarah Wollaston, a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum, along with the seven Labour defectors, has warned about former UKIP members joining local Tory parties and the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) pushing the party to the right. On Monday evening, she tweeted: ""#BLUKIP has been busy taking over the Tory Party alongside the ERG. Soon there will be nothing left at all to appeal to moderate centre ground voters."" Other Conservative MPs unhappy with the party's direction include Anna Soubry, another People's Vote supporter, who has called in the past for a new centre party. This splintering might, just might - in time - turn into a much bigger redrawing of the landscape. For now though that is way off. And this is first and foremost about the Labour Party - the seeds of the splinter sown more than three years ago, bearing bitter fruit just when Parliament's biggest decisions over Brexit are about to be made. Read Laura's full blog Several Labour MPs have said they are considering their future in the party - but more have said they are sticking with it. Former shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh told Today: ""I have [been approached] and I've said no. I think what is important is we now take a long hard look at ourselves as a political party. ""It is clear that Brexit is pushing both parties to the brink, it is clear that anti-Semitism has taken root in our party."" This video can not be played John McDonnell: Resigning MPs have 'responsibility' to call by-elections Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray told the BBC he was sticking with Labour but ""may change his mind"" unless the party responded to concerns about its culture and direction. Labour MP Jess Phillips,writing in the Daily Telegraph,,externalcalled on Mr Corbyn to listen to why the MPs had quit and ""act on it"", warning that reacting with bitterness could cause the party to ""burst apart"". However, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberrytold the Daily Mirror,externalthat the resignations were a ""distracting and divisive exercise"". Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Labour MPs had to ""listen to each other"". But she added: ""Equally, I think we also have a duty to unify and make sure that we provide a force for change within Britain.""

"This video can not be played Birmingham bin strike: Workers start industrial action More than 300 Birmingham bin workers have started the first of a series of strikes in a dispute with the council. It stems from claims some staff have been ""blacklisted"" for taking part in industrial action in 2017, when piles of rubbish were left on the streets. The Unite members have worked to rule since 29 December over what it calls ""secret payments"" given to GMB members who abstained from a previous strike. A ""reasonable"" offer had been made to unions, Birmingham City Council said. Bin workers on the picket line at the Redfern Road depot in Tyseley held placards with the words ""betrayed"" on them Collections in the city have moved to fortnightly, which the council said was to ensure ""reliability of service"" until the dispute is resolved. Picket lines were in place at four council refuse depots from 05:00 GMT until 14:00, Unite said. What's going to happen to Birmingham's rubbish? Unite's assistant general secretary Howard Beckett described the action as a ""last resort"" after six weeks of talks to resolve the row collapsed last week. ""This industrial action is entirely of Birmingham council's making,"" he said. Rubbish is already starting to pile up in Birmingham during the second industrial action The three-month long strike action that started in June 2017 was part of a dispute over job losses, but GMB members were not involved. Unite said it discovered the ""secret payments"" to GMB members late last year and is demanding its members receive equal payments. The council and GMB said the payments were not because members kept working, but because they had been left out of conciliatory talks which resolved the strike last year. GMB made a claim against the council as their members were affected by the agreement, which they were not consulted on. The council has offered to pay Unite members up to Â£3,000, however the union said this was still about Â£600 less than GMB members received. Unite members claim they have been ""blacklisted"" for striking in 2017 Mr Beckett said: ""On one hand, it [the council] has said the payments were justified, but also said that they would make offers up to Â£3,000 to our members. ""Where is the logic in that?"" The offer tabled by the council last week ""was worse than the one which Unite had already rejected"", he said and demanded that ""everyone will get the same"". But the council has urged the unions to put it to members ""so they can give it the serious consideration it deserves"". Birmingham Council announced fortnightly collections to deal with the industrial action Residents said there was already ""mess everywhere"" in Birmingham Up to 150 members were expected at the Redfern Road Depot in Tyseley during the day of action. Those gathered earlier had placards which read ""betrayed by a Labour council"" and ""bin your blacklisting Birmingham Council"". Among the crowd was councillor Majid Mahmood, former cabinet member for clean streets, waste and recycling, who resigned last month when industrial action was announced. Mr Mahmood told the BBC he was ""disappointed with the cabinet"" and had joined the picket ""to show support and solidarity with the workers who I firmly believe have been discriminated against"". Former cabinet member for clean streets councillor Majid Mahmood (far right) joined the picket in Tyseley ""I'm hoping they [the council] will see sense and end the discrimination against these workers,"" he said. During his time in the cabinet, from May last year until January, he said he ""did not know about any payment made to other workers"" and criticised the council's lack of transparency. Resident Luke Service said his street in the Stechford area of the city had been ""covered in rubbish"" with bins ""overflowing"" since before official strike action began. He said his recycling had not been taken since 18 December, meaning he still has waste from Christmas piling up. ""There's rubbish all over the street as people leave it next to the bins and then it gets blown by the weather,"" Mr Service said. ""This has even led to us having rats and foxes in our street at various points. ""It's a tough situation, but there needs to be some sort of compromise."" Workers will be striking for two days a week over the next five weeks, with Unison workers, who are also involved, due to stage their first walk-out on Friday. Bin workers 'getting grief over strikes' Workers 'offered Â£3k' to end strike 2017 Birmingham bin strike 'cost Â£6m' Usually, Birmingham residents receive a weekly general waste collection and a recycling service every two weeks, though some residents in the city have complained of missed collections over the past few months, even before industrial action began. Household rubbish on the streets of Alum Rock in August 2017 The council has said that from Monday,residents should put both bins out on what would be their normal recycling collection day,external, and that a reasonable amount of ""side waste"" could also be left. Collections were not being suspended during any strike action, the authority said.  402,337tonnes of household rubbish collected by Birmingham City Council in 2017-18 345 kgcollected per resident 21%of household waste sent for recycling Speaking last week, councillor Brett O'Reilly, cabinet member for clean streets, waste and recycling, said the authority was ""determined"" to resolve the dispute and apologised for any missed collections so far. ""But until we reach a resolution we must do everything we can to minimise the disruption to the people who live in Birmingham,"" he said. Both unions are also pursuing legal action against the council as part of the dispute, which will be holding an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

"A close-up of the test device A new rapid test for earlier diagnosis of sepsis is being developed by University of Strathclyde researchers. The device, which has been tested in a laboratory, may be capable of producing results in two-and-a-half minutes, theBiosensors and Bioelectronics journal,externalstudy suggests. Diagnosing sepsis can be a complex process. The UK Sepsis Trust said it welcomed the research but added that no test was perfect at spotting the condition. It is estimated that 52,000 people in the UK die every year from sepsis, which is a serious complication of an infection. There is a lot of research going on to attempt to find out what exactly triggers the sometimes fatal reaction involved in sepsis. The initial problem can be quite mild and start anywhere - from a cut on the finger to a chest or urine infection - but if left untreated can set off a cascade of reactions, from shock to organ failure and in some cases, death. The biggest killer you may not know Sepsis: What is it - and how to spot it? Sepsis: Ambulance call handlers 'must spot condition' Early diagnosis is key because for every hour that antibiotic treatment is delayed, the likelihood of death increases. Diagnosis of sepsis is usually based on clinical judgement, body temperature, heart rate, breathing rate, and a series of blood tests. As soon as sepsis is suspected, broad-acting antibiotics should be given to the patient. A blood test that aims to determine the best antibiotic to treat the infection can take up to 72 hours. The new test uses a device,externalto detect if one of the protein biomarkers of sepsis, interleukin-6 (IL-6), is present in the blood. Dr Damion Corrigan with the microelectrode biosensor device Dr Damion Corrigan, who helped develop the test, said IL-6 is one of the best markers of sepsis. ""The type of test we envisage could be at the bedside and involve doctors or nurses being able to monitor levels of sepsis biomarkers for themselves."" He said the test would work well in GP surgeries and in A&E to quickly rule sepsis in or out, if it was eventually approved through clinical trials. Dr Corrigan added that sepsis not only kills people but can also leave them with life-changing problems, such as limb loss, kidney failure and even post-traumatic stress disorder. The idea is that the device could be implanted and used on patients in intensive care. Symptoms in adults: Slurred speech or confusion Extreme shivering or muscle pain Passing no urine in a day Severe breathlessness It feels like you're going to die Skin mottled or discoloured Symptoms in children: Breathing very fast Fit or convulsion Looks mottled, bluish, or pale Has a rash that does not fade when you press it Is very lethargic or difficult to wake Feels abnormally cold to touch With early diagnosis and the correct treatment, normally antibiotics, most people make a full recovery. Source: UK Sepsis Trust,external The project's clinical adviser and co-author, Dr David Alcorn, from Paisley's Royal Alexandra Hospital, said the tiny electrode had the potential to detect sepsis and, at the same time, diagnose the type of infection and the recommended antibiotic. ""The implications for this are massive, and the ability to give the right antibiotic at the right time to the right patient is extraordinary. ""I can definitely see this having a clear use in hospitals, not only in this country, but all round the world."" The researchers have applied for funding to develop a prototype device and hope to get commercial interest in taking it forward. They hope the low-cost test could come into everyday use in three to five years. Ryan, who contracted sepsis in 2015, lost three stone in weight and struggled to walk after being in a coma Ryan Sutherland, from Clackmannanshire, ended up in a coma with sepsis, which had been misdiagnosed. He had felt unwell with a sore throat that got worse, but was told by a doctor it was a viral infection. ""As the week went on, it got worse and by the Thursday it was really bad. My wife took me to the out-of-hours doctor that night and by this point I was really unwell and could barely move. But I was given an anti-sickness injection and then I was sent home."" Hours later he collapsed. He was taken to hospital and suffered two cardiac arrests. His body went into shock with the sepsis and his organs started to shut down. After eight days in a coma, Ryan woke up and made an almost complete recovery. ""No-one mentioned sepsis, although looking back I had all the symptoms,"" said Ryan. ""It's hard to diagnose, so if this test had been around it could have made all the difference to what happened with me."" The UK Sepsis Trust estimates that earlier diagnosis and treatment across the UK would save at least 14,000 lives a year. Dr Ron Daniels, the trust's chief executive officer, said: ""Any kind of test that enables us to identify sepsis earlier, before symptoms even present themselves, could help save even more lives and bring us closer to our goal of ending preventable deaths from sepsis. ""Systems like this are so important as, with every hour before the right antibiotics are administered, risk of death increases. ""No test is perfect in the identification of sepsis, so it's crucial we continue to educate clinicians to think sepsis in order to prompt them to use such tests.""

"Calvin Harris, Ed Sheeran, Drake, George Ezra, Keala Settle, Jess Glynne, Dua Lipa and Ariana Grande had big hits last year Three times as many male as female pop stars appeared on last year's biggest hit singles, BBC research has found. Ninety-one men or all-male groups were credited on the Official Chart Company's top 100 most popular songs of 2018 - compared with 30 female acts. And despite the success of singers like Dua Lipa and Ariana Grande, the gender gap has grown over the past decade. Thirteen of the most popular 100 songs of 2018 were credited only to female acts - down from 35 in 2008. Singer Mabel, who is currently in the top 10, said she wasn't surprised by the gender gap, telling BBC News: ""No, I think we still have a lot of work to do."" Rita Ora and Bebe Rexha's manager Sarah Stennett said: ""The gap that exists is not acceptable. I do not believe the consumer says, 'I want to listen to more men than women'. It's the choice they're given."" Yes and no. Dua Lipa, Kacey Musgraves, Cardi B and Lady Gaga took the limelight and many of the top prizesat the Grammy Awards last weekend. On Friday, Ariana Grande becamethe first female artist in UK singles chart history to replace herself at number one. And women like Dua, Anne-Marie and Jorja Smithdominate the nominations for the Brit Awards, which will be handed out on Wednesday. There are no fewer women in the UK charts now than there were a decade ago - in 2008, 30 female acts were credited on the best-selling 100 songs of the year. In 2018, the figure was still 30. But the number of men has risen by more than 50% as the number of collaborations has grown over that time - from 59 men in 2008 to 91 in 2018. Which means the gender gap has grown. It's become much more common for hit songs to be collaborations - Pop Star A ""featuring"" Pop Star B. That means the total number of artists credited on songs in the end-of-year top 100 list has risen over the past decade. You might have expected the number of men and women to have risen equally, but no. Only the number of male acts has risen. In 2008, stars like Alexandra Burke, Duffy and Katy Perry were among the 35 female acts to have hit singles on their own. Last year, that number was 13, including Dua, Ariana and Anne-Marie as well as Jess Glynne, Loren Allred and Rita Ora. At the same time, the number of songs credited to both a female and a male act has risen from 10 to 25. So songs by a man AND a woman have replaced many of those that were JUST credited to a single female act a decade ago. Meanwhile, men are also collaborating more with other men - hence the steep rise in the overall number of male acts appearing on the top 100 singles. But women are largely not collaborating with other women - or if they are, those songs aren't as popular. None of the top 100 songs of 2018 were collaborations just between female-only acts. But there's no change there - that was the same in 2008. There's always been a gender imbalance in pop music - just think about the genders of the biggest stars of the past 60 years. Part of the reason collaborations are now more common is because it's a good way for one act to get exposure with the fans of another - especially in the streaming age, when it's harder to break through. Often the other artist will be from a different genre. And these days, the charts are dominated by dance and rap - which are both overwhelmingly male - at the expense of traditional pop, singer-songwriters and girl groups. Dance music often has female vocalists, but the DJs/producers/hitmakers who they appear with - people like Calvin Harris, Marshmello, David Guetta, Zedd, Jax Jones - are almost always men. In rap, Cardi B may have broken the glass ceiling but she is still far outnumbered by the likes of Drake, Post Malone, Macklemore, Kendrick Lamar and French Montana. Fine Line by Mabel (featuring Not3s) was the 70th best-selling single of 2018 SingerMabel, who had a hit last year with Fine Line (featuring Not3s) and is now in the charts on her own with Don't Call Me Up, says she is ""very aware of the fact there's a long way to go"". She explains: ""I think it's about encouraging young female artists, to give them the space to experiment. I think that's the issue. ""As women, we get moulded in to something that we don't necessarily want to be, whereas as a boy I think you're encouraged to just sort of figure it out [and] do whatever you want to do. I think it's just about encouraging the younger generations to have fun with it."" Soul superstarJohn Legendsaid: ""That's surprising when you have people like Adele, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande - women who I think of as the biggest things in music right now. ""But I guess if you count those DJs [eg Calvin Harris and DJ Khaled], it's a little different because the voices people are hearing are women, even though it's the DJ's record. ""It's also probably a product of hip-hop being predominantly male, because hip-hop is such an important part of music, and 95% of popular hip-hop artists are men."" Sarah Stennett (second left) with singers Nicola Roberts, Bebe Rexha, Rita Ora, Kara Marni and RAY BLK at a Women In Harmony dinner Sarah Stennett, who runs First Access Entertainment, says she isn't surprised by the figures, and thinks a lot of it is down to the ""gatekeepers"" - the people who decide what gets promoted on streaming platforms, on the radio and at festivals. They aren't sexist as individuals, but there is a ""systemic"" problem, she believes. ""To underestimate the challenge that these women have to make music would be a disservice to them, because they walk into rooms to make records with men. Everything that happens in a boardroom - 'You're crazy, you're on your period' - happens in a creative space, too."" Collaborations are healthy, as long as it's an equal partnership and women aren't always relegated to being the featured artist, she adds. ""If you try and redress the balance as an industry - because women are every bit as creative and brilliant - then it will be redressed, but it has to be a conscious effort by everybody."" ""It's not really surprising that the number of artists has gone up, but it does seem counterintuitive that that should be so male-dominated,"" says Music Week magazine editorMark Sutherland. ""If you feature more people on your record, the idea is that fans of that person are more likely to play it and get into it and repeat play it, and it crosses you over to different audiences in a way that's quite hard to do in a more streaming-orientated business. ""Generally, you don't want to pick an artist with a similar fanbase to yours because you're just reaching the same people, and a lot of featured artists are rappers, so maybe female pop artists are putting rappers on their records to reach a new audience, and vice versa. But maybe it's less prevalent the other way around."" Lara Baker, a music industry diversity consultant, says there has long been a gender imbalance in the charts and behind the scenes, but adds that the figures showing a growing gap are ""really worrying"". ""I'd like to see streaming platforms, festivals and radio stations giving more attention to equal representation than they currently do,"" she says. ""If you look at any of the major streaming playlists, or a radio station's playlist, or a festival line-up on any given day - chances are in many cases you'll find male artists taking up more slots than female artists. ""They might argue that they're reflecting the market and what the consumer or listener wants, but are they? Or are they part of the problem that causes this imbalance? We all have our part to play in building a more equal music business."" She adds: ""There is no lack of appetite and lack of talent when it comes to women writing and making music, so clearly what we do have is an old-fashioned and biased industry which needs to work together to achieve better gender balance."" The BPI, which represents the UK's recorded music industry, said: ""Solo female credits may have been responsible for just 13 of the top 100, but, if you broaden the definition a little, female artists were the lead, or co-credited artists on a further 17 songs, while there were additional songs, including three Clean Bandit tracks and others, where women are featured.""

"Honda employee Martin Huggins said the news was ""a sad day for Swindon"" Workers at Honda's factory in Swindon say the announcement that it is to close is ""devastating"" for the town. The carmaker has confirmed it will shut the plant in 2021, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. Factory worker Martin Huggins called the news ""a sad day for Swindon"", while a Unite union leader said the workforce had been ""betrayed"". Honda has said the closure is a result of ""unprecedented changes in the automotive industry"". Outside the factory gates, employee Chris, whose son also works at the plant, told BBC Wiltshire he was ""extremely disappointed"". ""I've been here 19 years and it's devastating for all involved,"" he said. ""You've only got to look across the road at the large warehouses here too, I don't know what the jobs will be replaced with. ""We're just going to find out what will happen and take it from there really."" Sue Newall's husband Steve has worked at the factory for 23 years. She told the BBC he found out about the closure when a colleague who was off sick saw it on the news and called in to tell the others. ""The managers didn't know. There were rumours but we didn't expect such big news. My husband was sent home with a pack to read up on,"" she said. ""It's going to be a big salary that won't be coming into our house soon but you just have to deal with the shock to our system."" Another worker, Keith Murray, said the news reminded him of how the closure of the railway works in the 1980s affected the town. ""Things do change, and other businesses will come in to take over. I don't want to see anyone out of work,"" he said. Alan Tomala, from Unite, said employees at the factory felt ""betrayed"". He added: ""They feel that the company owes them a little more than hearing the news in the media. It should have been the employer telling them yesterday. ""I left work yesterday to 57 missed calls and around 130 emails, and not one from Honda.  It surprises me and I'm angered by it."" Alan Tomala from Unite said the scale of job losses was ""enormous"" Local employment agencies have begun setting up meetings to prepare employees, who were all sent home from the factory on Tuesday morning and told to spend the day with their families. Kath Curr, managing director of C&D Recruitment in Swindon, said the closure was ""devastating for the town as a whole"", but Honda workers' skills were ""completely transferrable"" . ""Swindon is one of the fastest growing towns in Europe and let's hope Honda doesn't make the local economy suffer because of that,"" she added. Swindon Borough Council leader David Renard said: ""I don't think there's anything we could have done to keep [Honda] here. ""We wanted them to stay, but they made a different decision."" Honda said in a statement that it would be making a commitment to electrified cars in response to ""unprecedented changes in the automotive industry"". ""We deeply regret how unsettling today's announcement will be,"" it added. Are you an employee at the Honda car plant in Swindon?

"Jaguar Land Rover booked a loss for the last three months of 2018 as sales collapsed in China. The company booked a Â£3.1bn reduction in the value of its plants and other investments leading to a Â£3.4bn quarterly loss, its biggest to date. Carmakers are being hit by stronger regulations and demand for cleaner models. Sales for the quarter were Â£6.2bn, down from Â£6.3bn a year earlier. It sold 144,602 vehicles, down from 154,447. Jaguar chief executive Ralf Speth said: ""Jaguar Land Rover reported strong third-quarter sales in the UK and North America, but our overall performance continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in China."" Excluding the write-down, which affects its balance sheet but has no effect on cash, the company posted a loss of Â£273m. Much of the firm's model range is currently diesel-powered, while diesel sales in Europe have been falling. Jaguar Land Rover, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, has embarked on a major restructuring programme to prepare for the future and boost profitability. It has already announced plans to cut thousands of jobs. It has now accepted that the value of its existing investments - such as factories, equipment and model designs - is substantially lower than previously thought, said BBC business correspondent Theo Leggett. Jaguar makes loss as sales slide 13% Jaguar Land Rover confirms 4,500 job cuts Whatâs going wrong at Jaguar Land Rover?

"Mr Khan called on India to provide evidence to support its claims that Pakistan was involved Pakistan has warned it will retaliate if India takes military action against it after a militant attack on Indian forces in Indian-administered Kashmir. Prime Minister Imran Khan went on television to call on India to provide evidence to support its claims that Pakistan was involved. India responded that Mr Khan was again making excuses. More than 40 members of India's security forces died in Thursday's suicide bombing on their convoy. Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad said it was behind it. The attack has raised tensions between India and Pakistan, which have fought two wars and a limited conflict in the region and are both nuclear powers. In his first comments addressing the attack, he said India should ""stop blaming Pakistan without any proof or evidence"" and urged Indian authorities to share any ""actionable intelligence"". ""If you think that you will launch any kind of attack on Pakistan, Pakistan will not just think about retaliation, Pakistan will retaliate,"" he said, adding that only dialogue could help solve issues in Kashmir. Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Pulwama attack: What are Modi's options? India has long accused Pakistan of backing militant separatists in Indian-administered Kashmir. Mr Khan, who took office last year, said his government was ready to co-operate with India in investigating the attack. But he also said Delhi should reflect on why Kashmiri youth had reached a point where they no longer feared death. The prime minister said he had not addressed the attack earlier because ofSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's high-profile visit to Pakistanon Sunday and Monday. In a statement, the foreign ministry said that Mr Khan had failed to condemn the ""heinous act"" nor offer condolences to victims' families. ""It is a well-known fact that Jaish-e-Mohammad and its leader Masood Azhar are based in Pakistan. [This] should be sufficient proof for Pakistan to take action,"" the ministry said. It said that past attacks in India attributed to Pakistan-based militants had not been investigated properly by Islamabad. Mr Khan had also mentioned India's upcoming elections in the context of calls for retaliation against Pakistan - saying politicians believed strong action would boost votes. The Indian foreign ministry said the insinuation was ""regrettable"", adding: ""India's democracy is a model for the world which Pakistan would never understand."" Earlier, India's top military commander in Kashmir, Lt Gen KJS Dhillon, accused Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency of ""controlling"" the attack with Jaish-e-Mohammad commanders, but he provided no evidence. The funerals driving youth to militancy Viewpoint: How far might India go to 'punish' Pakistan? ""I'd request all the mothers in Kashmir to please request their sons who have joined terrorism to surrender and get back to the mainstream,"" he said. ""Otherwise anyone who has picked up the gun will be killed."" The suicide bomber has been identified as a young man from the region. Correspondents say a significant number of young Kashmiris have joined militant groups in recent years. By BBC Pakistan correspondent, Secunder Kermani, in Islamabad When Imran Khan took office last year he said he wanted to improve relations with India, and that for every one step India took, Pakistan would take two. The traditional wisdom in Pakistan is that the country's army hasn't wanted closer ties between the two. However, as the military seems supportive of Imran Khan's administration it had been hoped progress could now be made. In fact, over the past few months, Indian officials have been the ones more reluctant to pursue negotiations - probably because of the upcoming elections. In his speech, Imran Khan said there was ""a new mindset"" in Pakistan, and that any militant group using Pakistani soil was an ""enemy"" of the country. He asked the Indian government what gain they thought Pakistan could hope to achieve from an attack like this. But while his confident and measured speech will go down well domestically, uncomfortable questions remain about the state's relationship with Kashmir-focused militant groups like Jaish-e-Mohammad. While JeM is a banned organisation, many international observers believe Pakistani intelligence services allow it operate under the radar. Allow Twitter content?

Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir, but control only parts of it. Thursday's bombing was the deadliest attack on Indian forces in the region for decades. Indian mourners held a candlelit vigil in Siliguri, West Bengal So far India has focused on retaliation by economic and diplomatic means. It has revoked Pakistan's Most Favoured Nation trading status and raised customs duties to 200%. Both countries have recalled top diplomats. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is facing an election later this year, has vowed a strong response and says he will give the military free rein. The last time an attack on Indian forces close to this magnitude occurred in Kashmir was in 2016, when 19 soldiers were killed at a base. In response to that,India carried out ""surgical strikes""which involved Indian soldiers crossing the de facto border to hit Pakistani posts. This video can not be played In December Yogita Limaye examined why there had been a rise in violence in Kashmir This time heavy snow in the region could make that kind of limited ground response impossible, analysts say. But there are fears that going further - with air strikes, for example - could lead to Pakistani retaliation and a significant escalation.

"The number of people in work in the UK has continued to climb, with a record 32.6 million employed between October and December,the latest Office for National Statistics figures show.,external Unemployment was little-changed in the three-month period at 1.36 million. The jobless rate, remaining at 4%, is at its lowest since early 1975. Weekly average earnings went up by 3.4% to Â£494.50 in the year to December - after adjusting for inflation, that is the highest level since March 2011. The number of people in work between October and December was up 167,000 from the previous quarter and 444,000 higher than at the same time in 2017. The employment rate - defined as the proportion of people aged from 16 to 64 who are working - was estimated at 75.8%, higher than the 75.2% from a year earlier and the joint-highest figure since comparable estimates began in 1971. Employment Minister Alok Sharma said: ""While the global economy is facing many challenges, particularly in sectors like manufacturing, these figures show the underlying resilience of our jobs market - once again delivering record employment levels."" ONS deputy head of labour market Matt Hughes said: ""The labour market remains robust, with the employment rate remaining at a record high and vacancies reaching a new record level. ""The unemployment rate has also fallen, and for women has dropped below 4% for the first time ever."" However, Andrew Wishart, UK economist at Capital Economics, warned that next month's figures may not be so buoyant. ""The labour market data didn't reflect the slip in hiring surveys in December, with employment rising,"" he said. ""However, the surveys deteriorated more markedly in January, so a Brexit effect might start to weaken employment growth in the next batch of official data."" By Dharshini David, BBC economics correspondent The jobs market remains in a robust shape despite the loss of momentum in the economy towards the end of last year - although the Brexit fog effect may be yet to register. Continuing recent trends, the majority of those entering work were previously inactive (students, looking after home, long-term sick etc). The demand for labour continues to bolster wage growth. Real wages increased by more than 1% per year, better on the whole than in recent years although about half the rate of the pre-crisis era. So little sign of Brexit uncertainty hitting hiring so far - but demand in the labour market tends to lag significantly behind changes in output. More recent employment surveys show a marked deterioration in January, so a Brexit effect might start to weaken employment growth in the next batch of official data. And productivity - output per hour - was down by 0.2% in the fourth quarter of 2018 versus a year previously, as output rose more slowly than employment. The lack of progress in this area could weigh on wage growth in the longer term. Looking at the average earnings figures, Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said: ""With surplus labour extremely scarce and job vacancies rising to a new record high, workers are having more success in obtaining above-inflation pay increases. ""Looking ahead, we doubt that wage growth will slip below 3% this year."" Despite the wage increases and low unemployment figures, Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, did not think that struggling High Streets would benefit. He said: ""The uplift to consumer spending from the recent improvement in real pay growth is likely to be limited by weak consumer confidence and high household debt levels. ""The increase in the number of vacancies to a new record high confirms that labour and skills shortages are set to remain a significant a drag on business activity for some time to come, impeding UK growth and productivity.""

"This video can not be played Birmingham bin strike: Workers start industrial action More than 300 Birmingham bin workers have started the first of a series of strikes in a dispute with the council. It stems from claims some staff have been ""blacklisted"" for taking part in industrial action in 2017, when piles of rubbish were left on the streets. The Unite members have worked to rule since 29 December over what it calls ""secret payments"" given to GMB members who abstained from a previous strike. A ""reasonable"" offer had been made to unions, Birmingham City Council said. Bin workers on the picket line at the Redfern Road depot in Tyseley held placards with the words ""betrayed"" on them Collections in the city have moved to fortnightly, which the council said was to ensure ""reliability of service"" until the dispute is resolved. Picket lines were in place at four council refuse depots from 05:00 GMT until 14:00, Unite said. What's going to happen to Birmingham's rubbish? Unite's assistant general secretary Howard Beckett described the action as a ""last resort"" after six weeks of talks to resolve the row collapsed last week. ""This industrial action is entirely of Birmingham council's making,"" he said. Rubbish is already starting to pile up in Birmingham during the second industrial action The three-month long strike action that started in June 2017 was part of a dispute over job losses, but GMB members were not involved. Unite said it discovered the ""secret payments"" to GMB members late last year and is demanding its members receive equal payments. The council and GMB said the payments were not because members kept working, but because they had been left out of conciliatory talks which resolved the strike last year. GMB made a claim against the council as their members were affected by the agreement, which they were not consulted on. The council has offered to pay Unite members up to Â£3,000, however the union said this was still about Â£600 less than GMB members received. Unite members claim they have been ""blacklisted"" for striking in 2017 Mr Beckett said: ""On one hand, it [the council] has said the payments were justified, but also said that they would make offers up to Â£3,000 to our members. ""Where is the logic in that?"" The offer tabled by the council last week ""was worse than the one which Unite had already rejected"", he said and demanded that ""everyone will get the same"". But the council has urged the unions to put it to members ""so they can give it the serious consideration it deserves"". Birmingham Council announced fortnightly collections to deal with the industrial action Residents said there was already ""mess everywhere"" in Birmingham Up to 150 members were expected at the Redfern Road Depot in Tyseley during the day of action. Those gathered earlier had placards which read ""betrayed by a Labour council"" and ""bin your blacklisting Birmingham Council"". Among the crowd was councillor Majid Mahmood, former cabinet member for clean streets, waste and recycling, who resigned last month when industrial action was announced. Mr Mahmood told the BBC he was ""disappointed with the cabinet"" and had joined the picket ""to show support and solidarity with the workers who I firmly believe have been discriminated against"". Former cabinet member for clean streets councillor Majid Mahmood (far right) joined the picket in Tyseley ""I'm hoping they [the council] will see sense and end the discrimination against these workers,"" he said. During his time in the cabinet, from May last year until January, he said he ""did not know about any payment made to other workers"" and criticised the council's lack of transparency. Resident Luke Service said his street in the Stechford area of the city had been ""covered in rubbish"" with bins ""overflowing"" since before official strike action began. He said his recycling had not been taken since 18 December, meaning he still has waste from Christmas piling up. ""There's rubbish all over the street as people leave it next to the bins and then it gets blown by the weather,"" Mr Service said. ""This has even led to us having rats and foxes in our street at various points. ""It's a tough situation, but there needs to be some sort of compromise."" Workers will be striking for two days a week over the next five weeks, with Unison workers, who are also involved, due to stage their first walk-out on Friday. Bin workers 'getting grief over strikes' Workers 'offered Â£3k' to end strike 2017 Birmingham bin strike 'cost Â£6m' Usually, Birmingham residents receive a weekly general waste collection and a recycling service every two weeks, though some residents in the city have complained of missed collections over the past few months, even before industrial action began. Household rubbish on the streets of Alum Rock in August 2017 The council has said that from Monday,residents should put both bins out on what would be their normal recycling collection day,external, and that a reasonable amount of ""side waste"" could also be left. Collections were not being suspended during any strike action, the authority said.  402,337tonnes of household rubbish collected by Birmingham City Council in 2017-18 345 kgcollected per resident 21%of household waste sent for recycling Speaking last week, councillor Brett O'Reilly, cabinet member for clean streets, waste and recycling, said the authority was ""determined"" to resolve the dispute and apologised for any missed collections so far. ""But until we reach a resolution we must do everything we can to minimise the disruption to the people who live in Birmingham,"" he said. Both unions are also pursuing legal action against the council as part of the dispute, which will be holding an emergency cabinet meeting on Wednesday.

"This video can not be played The border barrier explained A coalition of 16 US states led by California is suing President Donald Trump's administration over his decision to declare an emergency to raise funds for a Mexican border wall. Mr Trump made the declaration on Friday to bypass Congress after it refused to approve $5.7bn (Â£4.4bn) for the wall. The states say they want to block his ""misuse of presidential power"". The Democrats oppose funding Mr Trump's barrier, a key campaign pledge, and have vowed to contest his plan. The president's announcement came after he signed a spending bill to avoid another government shutdown that granted him only $1.375bn for new border barriers. Mr Trump said he had not needed to declare the emergency but had done so in the hope of obtaining the funds for the wall more quickly. Analysts say these comments could undermine his legal arguments. The lawsuit filed on Monday,externalseeks to stop Mr Trump acting on his emergency declaration to build the wall, saying the president does not have the power to divert funds approved by Congress to pay for his project. It says Mr Trump's decision is ""unconstitutional and unlawful"" and that ""by the president's own admission"" an emergency declaration is not necessary. Viewpoint: Will Trump win his legal fight over the wall? Understanding the US border in seven charts Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? ""We're suing President Trump to stop him from unilaterally robbing taxpayer funds lawfully set aside by Congress for the people of our states. For most of us, the office of the presidency is not a place for theatre,"" California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said. This video can not be played Trump: 'I've signed the order - now we'll be sued' Joining California in the lawsuit were Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Virginia and Michigan. The states - all of them but Maryland governed by Democrats - say the lawsuit aims to protect their residents, natural resources and economic interests. They argue that Mr Trump's order to divert funds would cost them millions of dollars. California Governor Gavin Newsom dismissed the president's decision as ""political theatre"" while New York state's Democratic Attorney General Letitia James promised to ""fight back with every legal tool at our disposal"".

A major land grab by the president The president said the emergency would allow him to get almost $8bn for the wall, still considerably short of the estimated $23bn cost of the barrier along almost 2,000 miles (3,200km) of border. Mr Trump accepted that he would be sued for the move, and predicted that the case was likely to end up in the Supreme Court. ""We're going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border,"" said Mr Trump, who repeatedly declared during the 2016 presidential campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall. ""Everyone knows that walls work."" The National Emergencies Act explained Critics, however, have accused the government of manufacturing a crisis, saying the president's assertions about the situation are untrue. Experts say the largest number of illegal migrants settling in the US each year is those who stay in the country after their visas expire, and that most drugs are trafficked into the US through ports of entry. Following the declaration on Friday, a liberal advocacy group, Public Citizen, sued on behalf of a nature reserve and three Texas landowners who were told the wall could be constructed on their properties. The National Emergencies Act is intended for times of national crisis. Declaring it gives the president access to special powers that effectively allow him to bypass the usual political process. Mr Trump could be able to divert money from existing military or disaster relief budgets to pay for the wall. Emergency declarations by previous presidents have been overwhelmingly used for addressing foreign policy crises - including blocking terrorism-linked entities from accessing funds or prohibiting investment in nations associated with human rights abuses. This video can not be played Senator McConnell supports the president; Speaker Pelosi warns it sets a dangerous precedent The emergencies act contains a clause that allows Congress to terminate the emergency status if both houses vote for it - and the president does not veto. With a comfortable majority in the House, Democrats could pass such a resolution to the Senate. The Republicans control the Senate, but a number of Republican senators have been vocal in their unease about the president invoking a national emergency in this case. The resolution would however still require Mr Trump's signature to pass, allowing him to veto it. A supermajority in both houses of Congress - currently in a weeklong recess - is needed to overturn a presidential veto.

"HSBC has reported a lower-than-expected 15.9% rise in pre-tax profits for 2018, partly because of an economic slowdown in China and Hong Kong. Europe's largest bank made $19.9bn (Â£15.4bn) before tax last year, compared with $17.2bn in 2017. Reported revenue was $53.8bn, a rise of 5% from the previous year. HSBC makes three-quarters of its profits in Asia, and China's trade war with the US was one reason for problems with its economy near the end of 2018. Group chairman Mark E Tucker said that the bank was ""in a strong position"". He added: ""Despite a challenging external environment in the fourth quarter, all of our global businesses delivered increased profits."" New HSBC headquarters opens in Birmingham HSBC sparks controversy with ad campaign HSBC bank confirms US data breach Last June, new group chief executive John Flint set out eight targets for the bank to achieve, including accelerated growth from Asia and its international network, and growth in its UK customer base. He said the latest results were good and showed that progress had been made towards achieving these goals. Mr Flint added that the bank was ready for Britain's departure from the European Union next month, and said that its operations in France ""gives us a major advantage in this regard"". Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes fund managers, toldBBC Radio 4's Today Programmethat he expected a ""modestly negative"" reaction to HSBC's results. ""If you look at the bigger picture, HSBC is still an incredibly profitable institution. It is pivoting towards Asia... and that strategy appears to be successful"". Steve Clayton, manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select UK Income Shares Fund, said: ""HSBC has always been a bank built around facilitating international trade between Asia and the rest of the world. ""Today's tariff spats between the US and China are hardly helpful and could begin to hurt the group's customers in Asia and beyond."" However, he added that while the results were ""disappointing"", the bank ""can hardly be described as in crisis"". HSBC said it was planning to increase the salaries of its directors by 3.3% this year - which it said was in line with the average for its UK employees. It is the first salary rise for executive directors since 2011. The bank is also asking shareholders to approve a new pay policy for its directors at April's annual general meeting.

"There is rarely a single reason why a company takes a very significant decision. Many will be quick to pin the blame for Honda's decision to close its Swindon plant solely on Brexit, but there are other forces at work. A new trade deal between the EU and Japan will see tariffs on cars exported from Japan to Europe reduced to zero over time. That means a dwindling rationale to base manufacturing inside the EU, and indeed, Honda plans to move production back to Japan rather than relocate elsewhere in Europe. Production at Swindon has been in decline for some time and is currently running at about half its capacity - another strike against it. But having said all that, Japanese companies are very long-term investors. In the mid-1980s, Margaret Thatcher championed the UK as the perfect outpost for Japanese carmakers looking for access to European markets. It worked. Honda, along with Toyota and Nissan, poured tens of billions of pounds into reviving the UK car industry. Since the referendum, the Japanese government, its UK ambassador and company managements have repeatedly warned about the corrosive effect of Brexit uncertainty and the possibility of losing frictionless trade with the EU. Honda is not alone in pulling investment from the UK. Nissan reversed its decision to build the X-Trail SUV in Sunderland, while Sony and Panasonic moved their European HQs to the EU. In each case, the rationale was slightly different, but many in Japan feel that failure to provide Brexit certainty counts as a broken promise, permitting the loosening of ties that used to bind the two countries.

"This video can not be played MPs resign from Labour over Brexit and anti-Semitism More Labour MPs could quit the party unless it listens to their concerns, Jeremy Corbyn has been warned. Seven MPs have walked out in protest at the Labour leader's handling of anti-Semitism and Brexit. One of the seven, Chuka Umunna, said ""a lot of Labour MPs"" could follow suit, together with Tories ""demoralised by the UKIPisation of their party"". Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson has warned his party could see more defections if it did not change. He said Labour had to do more to tackle anti-Semitism and he also urged Mr Corbyn to reshuffle his shadow cabinet to reflect a wider range of MPs. Mr Corbyn has said in a statement he was ""disappointed"" by the defections, which represent the biggest split in the Labour Party since the Social Democratic Party was set up 40 years ago. Who were the Social Democratic Party? Derek Hatton rejoins Labour after 34 years Who are the Labour MPs resigning? 'Cowards and traitors' - how Twitter reacted Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the seven should now stand down as MPs and seek re-election against Labour Party candidates. The seven MPs - Mr Umunna, Luciana Berger, Chris Leslie, Angela Smith, Mike Gapes, Gavin Shuker and Ann Coffey - quit Labour in protest at what they said was a culture of ""bullying and bigotry"" in the party and frustration over the leadership's reluctance to back another EU referendum. Mr Umunna said another ""big issue for us"" was the belief that Mr Corbyn could not be trusted with national security, if he became prime minister. ""Many Labour MPs agree with us on that,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Umunna said the new Independent Group was not yet a new political party, but he believed it could become one in time. He urged members of all parties to join them in building an ""alternative"" to the current two party system, which he said was ""fundamentally broken"". The BBC has been told two Conservative MPs are thinking of joining the new Independent Group in Parliament. Mr Umunna refused to speculate on who they could be but he added: ""There are a lot of Labour MPs wrestling with their conscience on this issue but also Conservatives who have become demoralised by the UKIPisation, if you like, of the Conservative Party."" Labour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 months A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims A number of Conservative MPs are at the centre of rumours about joining the new group. Sarah Wollaston, a supporter of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum, along with the seven Labour defectors, has warned about former UKIP members joining local Tory parties and the pro-Brexit European Research Group (ERG) pushing the party to the right. On Monday evening, she tweeted: ""#BLUKIP has been busy taking over the Tory Party alongside the ERG. Soon there will be nothing left at all to appeal to moderate centre ground voters."" Other Conservative MPs unhappy with the party's direction include Anna Soubry, another People's Vote supporter, who has called in the past for a new centre party. This splintering might, just might - in time - turn into a much bigger redrawing of the landscape. For now though that is way off. And this is first and foremost about the Labour Party - the seeds of the splinter sown more than three years ago, bearing bitter fruit just when Parliament's biggest decisions over Brexit are about to be made. Read Laura's full blog Several Labour MPs have said they are considering their future in the party - but more have said they are sticking with it. Former shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh told Today: ""I have [been approached] and I've said no. I think what is important is we now take a long hard look at ourselves as a political party. ""It is clear that Brexit is pushing both parties to the brink, it is clear that anti-Semitism has taken root in our party."" This video can not be played John McDonnell: Resigning MPs have 'responsibility' to call by-elections Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray told the BBC he was sticking with Labour but ""may change his mind"" unless the party responded to concerns about its culture and direction.

However, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberrytold the Daily Mirror,externalthat the resignations were a ""distracting and divisive exercise"". Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Labour MPs had to ""listen to each other"".

"This video can not be played ""Terrible. Doom and gloom"" - one worker describes the mood Honda is set to announce the closure of its Swindon car plant in 2022, with the loss of about 3,500 jobs. The Japanese company made 160,000 Honda Civics in Swindon last year, of which some 90% were sold to the UK, Europe and US. Honda has yet to make a formal announcement, and the Prime Minister's spokesman said Theresa May would not comment until an official confirmation. But local MP Justin Tomlinson said he had spoken to Honda, which confirmed it was consulting with ""all staff"". ""There is not expected to be any job losses, or changes in production until 2021,"" Mr Tomlinson said.  3,500total employees in Swindon 160,000Honda Civic cars built annually at the plant 90%of production sold to the UK, Europe and US 1989start of industrial operations Simon Jack: Is Japan losing faith in UK? Nissan Â£60m in doubt after investment U-turn Jaguar Land Rover posts Â£3.4bn loss The Unite union said the reports, if confirmed, would be a ""shattering body blow"". National officer Des Quinn said: ""The car industry in the UK over the last two decades has been the jewel in the crown for the manufacturing sector - and now it has been brought low by the chaotic Brexit uncertainty created by the rigid approach adopted by prime minister Theresa May."" As well as having a ""grave"" impact on workers and their families, it ""will also affect thousands of jobs in the extensive supply chain across the country"", he said. A spokesman for Prime Minister Theresa May said it was ""only right that we wait until the company has spoken with the workforce"" before commenting. The International Trade Secretary, Liam Fox, also declined to comment directly until an official announcement. But he pointed out that car demand had fallen since new diesel emissions rules were introduced across Europe. ""That big drop in demand by consumers is bound to have a knock on effect with producers,"" he said. Martin Huggins, a Honda worker for 25 years said: ""We haven't heard anything at all- all we have seen is what is on our phones. ""The management have told us nothing at all. This will be a sad day for Swindon as a whole, not just the workers but all the subsidiary companies that go with it."" Honda's Swindon plant is based at a former airfield In a tweet, Mr Tomlinson said: ""Honda are clear this is based on global trends and not Brexit, as all European market production will consolidate in Japan in 2021."" The car industry has also been struggling with falling demand in China and a slowdown in diesel sales. Honda's Swindon plant produces both VTEC turbo petrol engines and diesel i-DTEC engines. But according to Sky, Brexit is understood to be one factor in the decision, with the carmaker concerned about the imposition of new tariffs after the UK leaves the EU. Rival Japanese carmakerNissan also cited Brexitas one reason for cancelling plans to build its X-Trail SUV in Sunderland earlier this month. And Toyota and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about the risk of a potential no-deal Brexit in recent months. Last week,Ford warned that a leaving the EU without a deal would be ""catastrophic"". The EU and Japan recently struck a trade deal which lowers tariffs on both parties' car exports to zero. James Atwood, deputy editor of Autocar magazine, said this could be a big factor behind Honda's decision. ""It allows Honda to produce their cars in Japan where most of their plants are and then ship them to the EU without having to pay the import tariffs they have been, which does reduce one of the reasons for needing a plant in the UK,"" he told BBC News. BBC business editor Simon Jack says the trade deal certainly ""means a dwindling rationale to base manufacturing inside the EU"". He said: ""Production at Swindon has been in decline for some time and is currently running at about half its capacity - another strike against it. But, having said that, Japanese companies are very long term investors. ""Sony and Panasonic moved their European headquarters to the EU. In each case, the rationale was slightly different. But many in Japan feel failure to provide Brexit certainty have loosened the ties that used to bind the two countries."" Read more from Simon here Only last autumn, Honda said it was committed to UK-based production regardless of the outcome of Brexit negotiations. But last month, it said it would shut the Swindon factory for six days in April as part of its preparations for any disruption caused post-Brexit. The company said the move was to ensure it could adjust to ""all possible outcomes caused by logistics and border issues"". The firm said it would help in recovering lost production if shipments of parts were held up at borders. Last year, the senior vice-president of Honda Europe warned that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would cost his company tens of millions of pounds. Ian Howells told the BBC that quitting the bloc without an agreement would affect the carmaker's competitiveness in Europe. Honda UK is situated on a former airfield spanning 370 acres to the north-east of Swindon. The carmaker bought the site in 1985 and established Honda of the UK Manufacturing to inspect vehicles pre-delivery. In 1989, the operations expanded to producing engines. Three years later, a car plant was added, which began producing the Honda Accord. Since then, the site has gone on to produce the Jazz, CR-V, Civic and Type R. A second Honda car plant opened in Swindon in 2001, raising production capacity to 250,000 a year.

"This video can not be played Children speak to the BBC about their experiences last year A prolonged drought in Australia is having a devastating impact on children and forcing them to ""grow up"" prematurely, a UN report warns. Large parts of eastern Australia have endured severe drought for months, crippling farming communities. Children in these areas are resilient but endure a growing psychological toll, said the UN's children's agency. Many children have ""long and stressful"" days that involve witnessing strain on their parents and animals, Unicef said. ""Workloads for children on and off farms have increased substantially, leaving little time for schoolwork and almost no time for play, sport or other recreational activities,"" the agency said in its report. One high school student told researchers: ""Before the start of this year I'd never shot a lamb in my life - and I've done probably about 50 or so this yearâ¦ it is just normal now."" Others described high levels of stress at home, with one girl saying: ""You're walking on eggshells."" Unicef released the report on Tuesday,externalafter interviewing children aged five-16 from rural communities in New South Wales, a state that is entirely drought-affected. Entire Australian state declared 'in drought' Living with the strain of a devastating drought A lack of quality time spent with parents and siblings Fears about their future education and job prospects Feelings of exhaustion The report said that children had a strong desire to help their families and communities, but often felt powerless. ""These young people care deeply about and are abundantly aware of the trauma their parents are going through,"" said Oliver White from Unicef Australia. The drought is being felt in numerous rural communities ""At the same time, [they] are operating with the over-arching attitude that they shouldn't talk about their own psychological reactions and concerns because 'it is always worse for someone else,'"" he said. What does it take to break a drought? Australia's drought seen from the air The agency has called for the Australian government to direct more of its drought-relief funding towards children's programmes.

"Public links can lead people to encrypted groups where illegal material is traded Images of child sexual abuse and stolen credit card numbers are being openly traded on encrypted apps, a BBC investigation has found. Security experts told Radio 4's File on 4 programmethat the encrypted apps were taking over from the dark web as a venue for crime. The secure messaging apps, including Telegram and Discord, have become popular following successful police operations against criminal markets operating on what is known as the dark web - a network that can only be accessed by special browsers. The secure apps have both a public and encrypted side. Often, the public side is listed online so users can search and join groups advertising drugs, stolen financial data and other illegal material. Once a group is joined, however, messages are protected by peer-to-peer encryption, generally putting them beyond law enforcement's reach, say experts. The investigators found evidence that paedophiles were using both Telegram and Discord to give people access to abuse material, and that links to Telegram groups were buried in the public comments section of YouTube videos. These contained code words that would be indexed by search engines and, once clicked on, took people to the closed group. Researchers confirmed that at least one of these groups contained hundreds of indecent images of children. The Telegram app uses strong encryption to protect messages There were good reasons that paedophiles hid links on YouTube, said cyber-crime expert Dr Victoria Baines, a former Europol officer and adviser to the UK's Serious and Organised Crime Agency, the National Crime Agency's predecessor. ""YouTube is indexed by Google, which means if you are an 'entry level', for want of a better phrase, viewer of child abuse material you may start Googling,"" she said. ""And while Google tries to put restrictions on that, [the links] are publicly accessible on the web, so it is a means of getting people who are curious or idly searching into a closed space, where they can access material."" YouTube said it has a zero tolerance approach to child sexual abuse material and has invested heavily in technology, teams and partnerships to tackle the issue. A spokesperson said if it identified links, imagery or content promoting child abuse, the material is removed and the authorities alerted. A spokesman for Telegram said it processed reports from users and engaged in ""proactive searches"" to keep the platform free of abuse, including child abuse and terrorist propaganda. It said reports about child abuse were usually processed within one hour. The BBC investigation also found that paedophiles are exploiting the Discord app, which is popular among young people, who use it to text and chat while gaming online. It discovered a series of chatrooms openly promoted as suitable for 13 to 17-year-olds, but with very sexual descriptions that aimed to persuade children to hand over explicit photos. Ariel Ainhoren, head of research at security firm IntSights, said the firm had recently identified a group on Discord in which one user had posted a price list for child abuse imagery. The group was no longer active, but the user had given out an email address for sales queries that was still viewable online. Small websites 'swamped by extremism' Iran restricts Telegram messaging app Russia's Telegram block hits web users ""The user was offering gigabytes of pornography or paedophile material: nine gigabytes for $50 (Â£39), 50 gigabytes for $500, and 2.2 terabytes, which is a huge amount, for around $2,500,"" said Mr Ainhoren. Nine gigabytes could contain many thousands of images, depending on the file sizes. The user also said he was selling access to child sexual abuse and rape forums. File on 4 has passed details of the illegal material revealed by its investigation to the National Crime Agency. Once told about the groups, Discord said: ""The number of these violations makes up a tiny percentage of usage on Discord and the team is committed to improving our policies and processes to make it even smaller. ""Discord's Trust and Safety policy exists to proactively protect the safety of our users - on and off platform - and we have a variety of security methods that help users avoid unwanted or unknown contact. ""As all conversations are opt-in, we urge users to only chat with or accept invitations from individuals they already know."" Dr Baines: Public links can lead the curious to closed abuse chatrooms It said it uses computer, human and community intelligence to spot violations of its rules. The radio investigation also unearthed widespread abuse of the apps to sell stolen payment card data. One British victim's full name, address, date of birth, password, bank account and credit card details, including the three-digit security code, were published by criminals. She said it was ""very alarming"" to see her details, which were being offered up for free as a ""taster"". ""Someone has a very sophisticated way of hacking into my information without me knowing it"", said the woman, who is not being named by the BBC to protect her from potential harm. Details of the illegal material revealed by the investigation have been passed to the National Crime Agency. Telegram was asked questions about the way it was being exploited by criminals, and also told it about the trading of the woman's personal information. The AlphaBay market is one of many shut down by police action Last year, Theresa May told the Davos meeting of world leaders that small technology platforms can quickly become ""â¦home to criminals and terrorists"". She said: ""We have seen that happen with Telegram and we need to see more co-operation from smaller platforms like this."" Security minister Ben Wallace said the government had set up a Â£1.9bn cyber-security programme to increase the police's capability to infiltrate criminal groups online. He said the government was set to publish a White Paper looking at whether tech platforms need to have a duty of care towards users, to oblige them to remove illegal material from their platform. ""We are exploring in the online harm White Paper the area of duty of care, and if they don't fulfil that, then one of the things we are exploring is that there will be a regulator involved,"" he said.

"Police on guard in Port-au-Prince amid protests against the president The US state department says it understands that a number of Americans are among a group arrested in Haiti. Local media reported semi-automatic weapons had been found but this has not been officially confirmed. The circumstances remain unclear but local authorities told CNN the Americans were being held on conspiracy charges, but are not yet indicted. The arrests come amid nearly two weeks of protests against President Jovenel MoÃ¯se. The reason for the group's presence in the country also remains unclear and no identities are yet confirmed. Haiti's police did not respond when called by the BBC. But Inspector Gary Desroisiers, a deputy spokesperson for the national police, told news agency Haiti Libre the group had ""refused to speak"". The group, said to have eight members, was detained in the country's capital, Port-au-Prince, on Sunday. In pictures: Haiti anti-government protests Local media reported that the members of the group were driving two vehicles without registration plates and were arrested at the Rue des Cesars. A police source told Le Nouvelliste newspaper that the men had said they were working for the Haitian government. Haiti Foreign Minister Bocchit Edmond told CNN that five American citizens and a Haitian national were among those arrested. The state department would not confirm any numbers. Local media report that a Serbian citizen and a Russian was also part of the group. Since 7 February, thousands of people have been protesting in Haiti over soaring inflation and allegations of government corruption. Opposition groups are demanding an investigation over claims that officials and former ministers misappropriated development funds from an oil deal signed between Caribbean countries and Venezuela. Demonstrators have demanded the resignation of President Moise, in power since 2017. Last week he rejected the calls, saying he would not leave the country in the ""hands of armed gangs and drug traffickers"". Haiti is the poorest country in the Americas and 60% of the population live on less than $2 (Â£1.56) a day, according to the World Bank.

President Maduro condemned Mr Trump's speech as ""almost Nazi-style"" and said the military would respond with unity. Venezuela's president is refusing to step down or call new elections, despite mounting international pressure.

"This video can not be played Archive: Man Utd beat Chelsea 2-0 in 2019 fifth round Chelsea manager Maurizio Sarri said his team played ""confused football"" as Manchester United won at Stamford Bridge to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals. The result throws Sarri's reign deeper into crisis, while United delivered the perfect response to their first defeat under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to set up a last-eight tie against Wolves. Ander Herrera converted Paul Pogba's perfect cross to give United a 31st-minute lead, and Pogba doubled the advantage right on half-time when he dived to head Marcus Rashford's delivery past Kepa Arrizabalaga, who should have done better. As Chelsea slumped tamely to another damaging defeat, their fans turned on Sarri. They jeered his substitutions, mocked his 'Sarri-ball' philosophy, demanded the return of Frank Lampard as manager, and joined United's fans in chants of ""you're getting sacked in the morning"". ""We played confused football in the second half but in the first half we played well,"" said Sarri. ""I'm worried about the result but not about the fans' reaction because I understand the situation. I can understand our fans because the result wasn't really good and we are out of the FA Cup. ""I was really worried when I was in League Two in Italy, not now."" Solskjaer had no such problems as he took the loud acclaim of United's supporters after adding another impressive victory to his collection, despite the absence of the injured Jesse Lingard and Anthony Martial. ""The performance was fantastic, our tactics worked,"" said United's interim manager. ""It's a massive result."" The club's fans, who loudly sang the Norwegian's name, may not have the casting vote when the decision on the next manager is made, but they made their feelings about Solskjaer clear on another important night for the man who hopes to succeed Jose Mourinho on a permanent basis. Analysis: Why end is near for Sarri at Chelsea Sarri is 'done' at Chelsea - pundits react FA Cup quarter-final draw details This video can not be played Herrera nods Man Utd in front with 'stooping header' Solskjaer has been presented with a series of key examinations since returning to Old Trafford after the sacking of Mourinho in mid-December. One of his most crucial was how he would respond to his first serious setback - and how he would get his players to respond. That setback duly arrived when United were well beaten by Paris St-Germain in the first leg of the Champions League last-16 tie at Old Trafford, a 2-0 scoreline flattering a team who had given Solskjaer 10 wins and a draw from his previous 11 games. The response, here at Stamford Bridge, was top class and represented another plus point for the Norwegian as he tries to build a body of evidence that will persuade executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and United's hierarchy to give him the job full-time. Solskjaer was stripped of Lingard and Martial but still produced a positive gameplan based around aggression, the drive of Pogba and the pace of Rashford. It enabled United to overcome their second tough test in the capital after winning at Arsenal in the fourth round, and kept Solskjaer right in the hunt for silverware. This video can not be played 'Pogba at his absolute best' - Man Utd double lead at Chelsea Chelsea v Man Utd: How you rated the players 'It is a massive result' - Man Utd boss Solskjaer Sarri's stock was high in the early weeks of the season as Chelsea kept pace with Manchester City and Liverpool, and optimism was in the air as the Italian made a good first impression in English football. But as time ticked away here, Sarri felt the full force of Stamford Bridge's anger and disdain, frustration growing at the continuing decline in Chelsea's performances. There was awkwardness in the air as his by now customary substitution of Mateo Kovacic with Ross Barkley was met with sarcastic applause before a four-letter verdict was delivered on the much-vaunted 'Sarri-ball' that was meant to bring entertainment and results to Chelsea. There were even calls for the return of Lampard, taking his first steps in management at Derby County, as Sarri cut a solitary figure. It was a night when patience snapped, the tide of opinion turned, and Sarri was given noisy confirmation he is losing the battle for hearts and minds at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea were limp and uninspired, and Sarri - who arrived with a stellar reputation after his work with Napoli - looked at a loss as to what to do. The Blues face Manchester City in the Carabao Cup final on Sunday, and while it would be a bold decision for the club to sack him just days before that, it is hard to see Sarri surviving much longer as this was another grim 90 minutes. Pogba has been involved in a goal every 68 minutes in all competitions for United under Solskjaer, compared to every 210 minutes under Mourinho since August 2016 Chelsea have lost exactly half of their past 10 games in all competitions (W5 L5), as many defeats as they suffered in their previous 41 (W28 D8). United are the first team to eliminate both Arsenal and Chelsea in the same FA Cup campaign since the Red Devils themselves in 1998-99. Chelsea failed to score for only the second time in their past 51 home games in cup competitions, also drawing a blank against Arsenal in the League Cup semi-final in January 2018 (0-0). Chelsea only attempted two shots on target, with both coming in the 11th minute. United had just 33.1% of the ball during the game, their lowest figure in a fixture any competition since March 2018 against Liverpool - a game they also won (32.1%). Solskjaer has won 11 of his 13 games in charge of United, one more than Mourinho won in 2018-19 (10/24). Since Solskjaer took charge of United on 19 December 2018, the only Premier League player to have had a hand in more goals for his club than Pogba (15) is Son Heung-Min (16). Pogba has been directly involved in 15 goals in 12 games in all competitions under Solskjaer (9 goals, 6 assists), six more than he managed in 20 games under Mourinho this season (5 goals, 4 assists). Since his debut in February 2016, Rashford has been directly involved in 63 goals in all competition for United (42 goals, 21 assists), more than any other player in that time. Herrera netted his 20th goal for United in all competitions, but only his second header (also scoring with his head v Everton in the league in October 2015).

"Ren Zhengfei is one of China's richest businessmen When Huawei's founder and president Ren Zhengfei started his firm back in 1987 with just 21,000 yuan - the equivalent of about $6,600 today - little did he know his creation would grow to become a telecoms giant and make him one of the richest people in the world. With his personal fortune estimated at about $1.7bn, his company currently employs 180,000 workers around the globe - and its annual revenue is forecast to be $125bn (Â£96bn) this year. Mr Ren is something of a recluse, but in the past few weeks he has been talking to journalists, defending his firm amid rising pressure from the US and other countries over security concerns about Huawei's role in building 5G networks across the world - and the nature of its links to China's government. ""We would rather shut Huawei down than do anything that would damage the interests of our customers,"" he countered. ""I support the Communist Party of China, but I will never do anything to harm any other nation. ""Some people in the West believe that Huawei's equipment is stamped with some sort of ideology. That is as silly as people smashing textile machines back during the industrial revolution. We only provided equipment to telecom operators and that equipment does not have an ideology."" Some argue that Huawei is being used by Beijing so it can spy on rivals Huawei UK cyber-security risk 'manageable' Should we worry about Huawei? Huawei and 5G: Decision time Why Huawei matters in five charts Born in 1944, he went to Chongqing University and then joined a People's Liberation Army research institute at the height of the disruption caused by the country's 1960s Cultural Revolution. ""There was chaos almost everywhere, including in agriculture and industry,"" he told reporters. ""Every Chinese person was allotted only one-third of a metre of cloth. That amount could be used only for patching, so I never wore clothes without patches when I was young."" As an engineer he was sent to help build a synthetic clothing factory in Liaoyang, northeast China. ""Conditions were harsh,"" he said. ""Our housing was very shabby so we constantly felt cold. The temperature could drop to -28C. The supply of meat and cooking oil was very limited - there was no supply of fresh vegetables at all."" Yet Mr Ren says he was happy there: ""If you read too many books in other parts of the country you could get criticised. The factory was probably one of the few places that people could read. ""We had to, to understand how the equipment worked."" Up to three million people are believed to have been killed during China's Cultural Revolution In 1978, two years after Chinese leader Mao Zedong's death, he finally joined the Communist Party having invented a key tool used for testing advanced equipment at the clothing factory. Mr Ren said that he had not been allowed to do so before, because of his father's links with the losing nationalist side in China's civil war. During the 1960s, his father had been labelled a ""capitalist roader"" - a pejorative term for those considered to be trying to restore capitalism - and imprisoned. Mr Ren had hoped to become the equivalent of a lieutenant colonel in the army, but instead was demobbed in 1983 when China cut back its engineering corps. After moving to Shenzhen in southern China and working in the country's infant electronics sector, he was eventually able to collect enough money to found Huawei. He has two children from his first marriage - both working for Huawei - Meng Wanzhou and Meng Ping, who both took their mother's name to avoid ""unnecessary attention"". Annabel Yao, his daughter from his second marriage, is a Harvard computer science student, ballerina and keen Instagrammer. Mr Ren's third wife is Su Wei, who was reportedly formerly his secretary. In December, his eldest daughter - and Huawei's chief financial officer - Meng Wanzhou - was arrested in Canada at the request of the US amid fraud allegations over the company's ties to a telecoms firm that did business in Iran. The life of Huawei's high-flying heiress Meng Wanzhou has been released on bail and is currently facing a US extradition request Mr Ren said he trusted the Canadian and US legal systems would ""reach a just conclusion"", but that ""as Meng Wanzhou's father, I miss her very much"". Perhaps surprisingly, given the war of words over trade between Washington and Beijing, Mr Ren is an admirer of US President Donald Trump: ""I still believe he was a great president in the sense that he was bold to slash taxes. I think that is conducive to the development of industries in the US."" The firm is privately owned by thousands of employees, which he said means it could work ""truly for our ideas and for the greater good of society"". Despite the pressure from the US on countries not to use Huawei kit, Mr Ren said he is upbeat about the future. The company has more than 30 commercial 5G contracts and has already shipped 25,000 5G base stations. ""As long as we develop very compelling products, there will be customers who will buy them.""

"For a man known as reclusive and secretive, Ren Zhengfei seemed confident in the conviction that the business he's built for the last 30 years can withstand the scrutiny of Western government. ""There's no way the US can crush us,"" the 74-year-old founder of Huawei told me in a room filled with ornate European chairs and dining tables. This is a man who seemed unfazed by the claims of spying and intellectual property theft. Remarkably jovial and humorous, he cracked jokes throughout the entire interview. The US cannot crush us, says Huawei When I asked him whether the US's pressure on its allies would succeed in keeping Huawei out of Western markets because it said Huawei was a tool of the Chinese government - he told me that Huawei has lots of options. ""If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine. And if the North goes dark, there is still the South. America doesn't represent the world. America only represents a portion of the world."" Mr Ren is right, the US makes up only a fraction of his overall business. But the US allegations against Huawei have started to influence his more important markets, like Europe and the UK where plenty of concerns have been voiced. This is a man who wants the world to believe that his company stands strong in the face of pressure from the US. But where I saw his mood change was when I asked him about his current links to the Chinese military and the government. While he answered all my questions, he refused to be drawn into a conversation on this, only to say that these were not facts, simply allegations - and insisted that political connections are not what has led Huawei to be successful today. When I put to him the reports that his former chairwoman, Sun Yafang, had once worked with China's Ministry of State Security, he told me that her profile was up on the company's corporate website and that he didn't think it was ""OK to suspect or guess where this person used to be"". Politics has played a part though, in the arrest of his daughter, and chief financial officer of the company Meng Wanzhou. Up until now, Mr Ren has chosen to stay clear of wading into the motivations behind his daughter's arrest - but today he pointed the finger at the US for her predicament. ""I object to what the US has done,"" he said, speaking of his daughter's arrest. ""This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable. The US likes to sanction others, whenever there's an issue, they'll use such methods."" ""But now that we have gone down this path, we'll let the courts settle it."" He also confirmed that there is a Communist Party committee in Huawei, although he said this is what all companies - foreign or domestic - operating in China must have in order to abide by the law. On whether his equipment was potentially vulnerable to Chinese interference, he was far more clear - and practical. He said that the Chinese government had officially stated they have never required companies to install backdoors, yet the reality is that there is no law in China that would protect him if he were asked to provide the government with access. And that in itself will prove to be the deciding factor for many governments as they weigh up whether to let Huawei in to their 5G networks. Chinese companies like Huawei have only started to threaten the dominance of Western businesses in the last decade. As they have come up, the world has had to grapple with the very different system they operate in. Central to that is the fear that they are obliged to serve the interests of the Communist Party.  Whether they do or not may be beside the point. The perception itself could determine Huawei's success in the future.
