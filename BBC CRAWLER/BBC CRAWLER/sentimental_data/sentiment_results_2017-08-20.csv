"Police say the wrecked house in Alcanar is a focal point of the investigation A 12-strong terror cell that carried out two deadly attacks in Spain had collected 120 gas canisters and was planning to use them in vehicle attacks, Spanish police say. Canisters were found at a house, said to be used by the cell, that blew up in the town of Alcanar on Wednesday night. Police are still hunting for the driver of the van that hit dozens of people on Barcelona's Las Ramblas, killing 13. On Sunday, a Mass was held in Barcelona to mourn the victims. In addition to the 13 killed on Thursday afternoon on Las Ramblas, a woman died in a second vehicle attack early on Friday in the town of Cambrils. Five suspected jihadists were shot dead by police in the second attack. The Catalan authorities have also confirmed that a British-Australian seven-year-old,Julian Cadman, was among those killed in Barcelona. He had been declared missing since becoming separated from his injured mother in the attack, and his family had made appeals for news of his whereabouts. What we know so far Barcelona tells world 'I'm not afraid' Barcelona rejects hate after attacks Catalan police chief Josep Lluis Trapero has given an update on the investigation. He said the cell was still believed to consist of 12 men and had been planning attacks for more than six months. One person remained at large, four were under arrest and there were two sets of human remains to be identified, he added. This video can not be played Inside the pretty town hiding terror suspects The person at large was the driver of the van, Mr Trapero said, adding that police knew his identity but would not reveal it. But police have confirmed they are hunting Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, who Spanish media say was the driver. The two sets of remains to be identified may refer to victims of the house explosion at Alcanar. Spanish media have speculated the two may be Youssef Aallaa, the brother of one of the suspected jihadists killed at Cambrils, and Abdelbaki Es Satty, an imam from the town of Ripoll, north of Barcelona, where a number of the suspects lived. The imam apparently left the mosque in June for an extended trip to Morocco, but a flatmate told the BBC he had been seen in Ripoll as recently as last Tuesday. This video can not be played ""Barcelona is going to rise up again with its spirit and its openness"" ""We're starting to see clearly that [the Alcanar house] was the place where they were preparing explosives for one or more attacks in the city of Barcelona,"" Mr Trapero said. He added: ""We are not in a position to say what caused the radicalisation of these people."" American honeymooner killed in Barcelona Spain attacks timeline Spain's long anti-terror experience Mr Trapero said police could not rule out that the suspect still at large had crossed the French border, although he had ""no specific information on this"". The father of two of those shot dead by police in Cambrils, Mohamed and Omar Hychami, told the BBC he was devastated. Hecham Igasi also accused the imam of radicalising his sons. This video can not be played There was a special Mass at the Sagrada Familia church for the victims It is now known that three vehicles were rented under the credit card of Younes Abouyaaqoub. One was used in the Las Ramblas attack, another was found after the attack in the town of Vic and a third in Ripoll. Mr Trapero said the cell had planned to fill all three with explosive material to carry out attacks. Barcelona FC, in their first match since the attacks, beat Real Betis 2-0 at the Camp Nou ground on Sunday night. Players observed a minute's silence before kick-off and wore black armbands. Barcelona's players lined up with shirts carrying the name of the city instead of their own names Earlier, King Felipe and Queen Letizia attended Barcelona's Sagrada Familia cathedral to mourn those killed in the attacks Some reports in Spanish media say the jihadist cell had intended to target the iconic, Gaudi-designed church with explosives. Cardinal Juan JosÃ© Omella, the Archbishop of Barcelona, called for peace and unity, saying: ""We will overcome fear."" He read a message from Pope Francis, which said the pontiff ""condemns once again the violence, which is a very grave offence against the creator, and he prays to God for help so we can continue working for peace and harmony in the world"". As the debate about possible Catalan independence continues, Cardinal Omella added: ""The union makes us strong, the division corrodes us and destroys us."" Where attacks leave Catalan independence So-called Islamic State (IS) said it had carried out the Las Ramblas attack, though it is not clear whether any of the attackers were directly connected to the group or simply inspired by it.

"Jerry Lewis was born into a showbusiness family and first appeared on stage at the age of five Entertainer Jerry Lewis, one of Hollywood's most successful comedians, has died aged 91. A family statement said he died of natural causes at his home in Las Vegas on Sunday morning. Lewis's 10-year partnership with Dean Martin saw them star in 16 films and achieve huge box office success. He became the highest-paid actor in Hollywood, chalking up hits such as The Bell Boy, Cinderfella and The Nutty Professor. Obituary: Jerry Lewis Other notable successes included The King of Comedy in 1983, in which he played a talk show host stalked by Robert de Niro. Jerry Lewis became known for his goofy, slapstick style of comedy Fellow celebrities paid tribute as news of his death broke. Whoopi Goldberg called it ""a gain for heaven, but big loss for comedy"". Star Trek actor William Shatner tweeted that the world was ""a lot less funnier today"". Actor Jim Carrey, whose comedy style was strongly influenced by Jerry Lewis, said: ""That fool was no dummy. Jerry Lewis was an undeniable genius an unfathomable blessing, comedy's absolute. I am because he was!"" There were also tributes from the daughters of Lewis's longtime associates Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. ""Dear Jerry, Dad will be as happy to see you as I'm sad to see you go. Give him one of your bear hugs for me. I'll always love you,"" tweeted Nancy Sinatra. Deana Martin also wrote on Twitter: ""I'm heartbroken at the loss of our life-long friend (Uncle) Jerry Lewis. I've loved him all my life and will miss him greatly."" Jerry Lewis formed a famous partnership with Dean Martin The White House later released a statement praising ""the extraordinary life of one of our greatest entertainers"", adding that Lewis ""touched the lives of millions"". ""Jerry lived the American Dream - he truly loved his country, and his country loved him back,"" Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statementposted on Twitter,external. Lewis was born Joseph Levitch in Newark, New Jersey, to Russian-Jewish parents who were both in showbusiness. He started performing on stage at the age of five alongside his parents. Lewis teamed up with Dean Martin in the late 1940s, acting the goofy sidekick to Martin's suave persona. Over the next 10 years they appeared in nightclubs, on television and in movies, but their partnership ended with a bitter split. In the early 1970s he made the infamous Holocaust drama, The Day the Clown Cried, about a clown thrown into prison and eventually used to entertain children and lead them into the concentration camp gas chambers. It remains unreleased. Lost images emerge from Lewis Holocaust film Lewis was also the host of a long-running telethon which raised many millions of dollars for muscular dystrophy. In 1995, he became the highest-paid star in Broadway history as Mr Applegate in the musical Damn Yankees. He also won acclaim as a writer. In his later years, however, he courted controversy with racist and misogynistic jokes, and in 2007 he was forced to apologise after making an anti-gay slur during a telethon. Allow Twitter content?

In an interview, Lewis once said the key to his success had been in maintaining a certain child-like quality, but added: ""I've had great success being a total idiot."" ""I look at the world through a child's eyes because I'm nine,"" he told Reuters in 2002. ""I stayed that way. I made a career out of it. It's a wonderful place to be."" Lewis also achieved great popularity in France where he was hailed as ""le Roi du Crazy"" (""the King of Crazy""). He was inducted into the Legion of Honour, France's highest award, in 1984.

"The USS Indianapolis - pictured here in Pearl Harbor, 1937 The World War Two heavy cruiser USS Indianapolis has been found in the Pacific Ocean, 72 years after its sinking by a Japanese submarine. The warship was discovered 18,000 feet (5.5km) beneath the surface. The Indianapolis was destroyed returning from its secret mission to deliver parts for the atomic bomb which was later used on Hiroshima. Of the 1,196 men on board, just 316 were rescued - the largest loss of life at sea in the history of the US Navy. Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who led the civilian search team, said the discovery was ""truly humbling"". The USS Indianapolis was destroyed on 30 July 1945 when, somewhere in the Philippine sea between Guam and Leyte, it was hit by a torpedo from a Japanese submarine. Between 800-900 escaped the sinking ship. But no distress call was ever received, and by the time the survivors were found by chance four days later, just 316 were left alive in the shark-infested waters. Indianapolis survivor: 'You could see the sharks circling' The ship's rapid sinking - in just 12 minutes - and the lack of a distress call meant the ship's location had long been a mystery. Researchers knew the ship was the Indianapolis (CA-35) because of its hull markings Mr Allen's crew discovered the vessel on 18 August, after new research from a naval historian pointed them to a specific region of the ocean where the warship had been sighted the night before its destruction. The ship is well-known for its final, secret mission, carrying parts for the atomic bomb nicknamed ""Little Boy"" as well as enriched uranium fuel for its nuclear reaction. Those supplies were delivered to Tinian island, an American base in the final year of the war which launched the world's first nuclear bombing. Four days later, the Indianapolis sank - less than a week before the nuclear bomb it helped to make destroyed Hiroshima in the final days of World War Two. Some fragments bore the name of the ship, making its identification relatively simple ""To be able to honour the brave men of the USS Indianapolis and their families through the discovery of a ship that played such a significant role during World War Two is truly humbling,"" Mr Allen said. ""As Americans, we all owe a debt of gratitude to the crew for their courage, persistence and sacrifice in the face of horrendous circumstances."" The USS Indianapolis remains the property of the US Navy, the search team's statement said. It will now be considered a protected war memorial. A spokesman for the survivors, 22 of whom are still alive, said each of them had ""longed for the day when their ship would be found"". Mr Allen's specially-outfitted research vessel, the Petrel, has been designed for exploration and research with a crew of 16. It previously discovered the wreckage of both a Japanese warship, the Musashi, and an Italian naval vessel, Artigliere - both from the World War Two era.

"The incident took place on Ferry Road near Drylaw Police Station in Edinburgh on Saturday The motorbike used in a hit-and-run in Edinburgh in which a 10-year-old boy was seriously injured had been stolen earlier in the city, police have said. Investigations are continuing into the incident on Ferry Road in the Drylaw area at 18:35 on Saturday. Police said it appeared two motorbikes went through a red light at a pedestrian crossing and the boy was ""mown down"" by one of them. He is in a stable condition in hospital and due to have surgery. Detectives said there had been a number of reports of motorbikes being driven dangerously and recklessly in the area on Saturday evening. The drivers of the two bikes involved had their faces covered with scarves. Police are reviewing CCTV and carrying out door-to-door inquiries. Det Ch Insp Paul Grainger, who is leading the investigation, said: ""The boy remains in hospital and his condition is now described as stable. ""He is currently undergoing surgery as a result of the injuries he sustained in this collision and it is too early to assess what impact these injuries may have on his life moving forward. ""At this stage we are keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the Ferry Road area last night around the time of the collision, or indeed before or after it."" The first motorbike involved was red and driven by someone wearing a red and black ski-type jacket and a full-face crash helmet which was white with a purple and orange design. The second motorcycle, which was the one that struck the boy, was a white Triumph Daytona 650cc. The rider was wearing a grey hooded top, dark tracksuit bottoms and a white full-face helmet with a coloured design. Det Ch Insp Grainger added: ""This was a terrifying incident which could easily have had fatal consequences and both the boy's mother and I would urge anybody that has any information to contact the police or Crimestoppers. ""We need the help of the community to catch those responsible for this. ""This young boy was going about his own business, making a routine crossing of a busy road at what should have been a safe pedestrian crossing when he was mown down by this motorcycle. ""Nobody should be attempting to assist, hide or cover up for the people responsible who have shown a reckless disregard for other people's safety with terrible consequence."" Earlier, local community group Trim and Friends of West Pilton posted an update on Facebook from the boy's mother which said he was undergoing surgery and described him as ""brave"" and a ""wee trooper"". Robert Pearson, chairman of the community group, told BBC Scotland there have been ongoing issues with people riding motorbikes dangerously in the area. He added: ""We as a community have said for years it is not a case of if somebody gets hit by one of these bikes, it's a case of when.

"A 12-year-old boy from north London has won Channel 4's Child Genius show. Rahul, who lives in Barnet, beat his nine-year-old opponent - Ronan - 10-4 in the programme's final. Rahul, who has an IQ high enough to be a member of Mensa, fought off competition from 19 children aged eight to 12 in the week-long show. He clinched the title by answering a question on 19th Century artists William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais. This series of Child Genius started on Monday and was screened every evening this week. It was Channel 4's most watched programme each day, with an average audience of 1.8 million tuning in for the final. In the final, Rahul's chosen subject was Edward Jenner's medical innovation and methodology in 18th Century England. He and Ronan both scored 15 in their specialist fields. He had been expecting to face 11-year-old Joshua in Saturday's final but Ronan's knowledge of 1666 London saw him get the place. 1. Selim I took control of which empire in 1512? 2.

"Removing all trade tariffs and barriers would help generate an annual Â£135bn uplift to the UK economy, according to a group of pro-Brexit economists. A ""hard"" Brexit is ""economically much superior to soft"", argues Prof Patrick Minford, lead author of a report from Economists for Free Trade. He says eliminating tariffs, either within free trade deals or unilaterally, would deliver huge gains. Other economists say cutting barriers sets off a ""race to the bottom"". Economist Dr Monique Ebell from the National Institute of Social and Economic Research (NIESR) says Prof Minford ""ignores decades of evidence on how trade actually works"". Dr Ebell's own research showed that if the UK left the single market but made unilateral trade deals with major developing economies and the Anglosphere, it would only claw back about one-third of the 20-30% reduction in lost total trade by leaving the EU. Dr Ebell says many of the trade barriers that Prof Minford argues to be removed are subtle, non-tariff barriers, such as agreed common standards. Campaigners against a hard Brexit said the plan amounts to ""economic suicide"". The UK is part of the EU customs union, and so imposes tariffs - taxes on imports - on some goods coming into the country. Countries in the customs union don't impose tariffs on each other's goods, and every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee. Other goods have no tariffs. The UK has said it is leaving the EU's customs union because as a member it is unable to strike trade deals with other countries. A quick guide to the Brexit negotiations Farmers back temporary customs union Prof Minford's full report, From Project Fear to Project Prosperity, is due to be published in the autumn. He argues that the UK could unilaterally - before a reciprocal deal is in place - eliminate trade barriers for both the EU and the rest of the world and reap trade gains worth Â£80bn a year. The report foresees a further Â£40bn a year boost from deregulating the economy, as well as other benefits resulting from Brexit-related policies. Mr Minford - a professor at Cardiff University - says that when it comes to trade the ""ideal solution"" would still be free trade deals with major economic blocks including the EU. But the threat that the UK could abolish all trade barriers unilaterally would act as ""the club in the closet"". The EU would then be under pressure to offer Britain a free trade deal, otherwise its producers would be competing in a UK market ""flooded with less expensive goods from elsewhere"", his introduction says. He argues UK businesses and consumers would benefit from lower priced imported goods and the effects of increased competition, which would force firms to raise their productivity. However, Dr Ebell says that ""competition needs to be fair"". ""Some foreign firms from outside the EU can produce more cheaply because they pollute, or treat workers in ways that we find unacceptable. So we impose tariffs to level the playing field. That is legitimate, and only fair."" This video can not be played Brexit: What's the difference between a hard or soft Brexit? However, Open Britain,a campaign group,externalarguing for the UK to remain within the single market and the customs union, said the proposed strategy would be damaging to the UK economy. ""Unilaterally scrapping our tariffs without achieving similar reductions in the tariff rates of other countries would see Britain swamped with imports, leaving our manufacturers and farmers unable to compete,"" said Labour MP Alison McGovern, a supporter of the cross-party group Open Britain, which is campaigning against a hard Brexit. ""The levels of bankruptcy and unemployment, especially in industry and agriculture, would sky-rocket. ""This is a project of economic suicide, not prosperity. No responsible government would touch this report with a barge pole as a source of ideas for our future trade policy."" Economists for Free Trade is a group of 16 economists, including former government advisers and academics. The group plans to release further chapters of the report in the run-up to its full publication. It is a counter-intuitive idea, but actually, the economics textbooks do provide some support for the idea of unilateral trade liberalisation. This analysis suggests that removing trade barriers produces benefits for consumers and businesses buying components or raw materials that exceed the losses suffered in industries that face stiffer competition. The downside is that it may take time, perhaps years, for the workers who lose their jobs to find new ones. Prof Minford has expressed the view that the British economy is flexible enough to cope. There is also the question of how the new jobs would compare with the old ones. The mainstream view among economists is that while countries overall may gain from trade liberalisation, there are usually some specific groups that lose. Prof Minford also directs criticism at Chancellor Philip Hammond's current approach to Brexit, which he says amounts to ""throwing away our hard-won freedom from EU rules"". The chancellor is viewed as favouring a softer approach to Brexit, but recentlyco-authored an article,externalin the Telegraph in which he proposed that the UK would leave both the single market and the customs union in March 2019, but that there would be a ""time-limited"" transition period to help businesses adjust. Prof Patrick Minford says dropping all tariffs after Brexit will boost the UK economy by billions A government spokesman said the UK would maintain a ""deep and special"" relationship with the bloc after departing the EU. ""The economy has grown continuously for four years and there are more people in work than ever before. ""As we leave the European Union, we will build on this success by maintaining a deep and special partnership with the EU while embracing the wider world as an independent, open, trading nation.'"" During the referendum campaign last year, Prof Minford stoked controversyby suggesting,externalthat the effect of leaving the EU would be to ""eliminate manufacturing, leaving mainly industries such as design, marketing and hi-tech"". However, in a recent article in the Financial Times, he suggested manufacturing would become more profitable post-Brexit. What are the UK's Brexit trade options?

"Jerry Lewis has died in Las Vegas aged 91 Jerry Lewis' goofy comedies made him the world's best-paid movie star. A master of the visual gag, his films - with their cartoon-like antics - became immensely popular. His partnership with Dean Martin lasted for 10 years, spawning a string of successful films and live performances. He also became well-known for hosting marathon telethons raising millions of dollars for charity. He was born Joseph Levitch in 1926 in Newark, New Jersey, into a family of Russian Jewish emigres. His father was a vaudeville entertainer while his mother played piano in a radio station. Following his stage debut at the age of five, he went on to play to great acclaim to audiences on the so-called Borscht Circuit, the collection of summer resorts in the Catskill Mountains that were popular with New York's Jewish families. By 15, he had refined an act that involved exaggerated miming to records under the name Joey Lewis, which he later changed to Jerry. He first found national success when he teamed up with an up-and-coming crooner called Dean Martin. The pair quickly became favourites on the nightclub circuit before branching out with their own radio show. Lewis and Martin at a boxing event in London in 1953 Their combination of sophistication and slapstick brought a decade of success, during which they starred together in 16 films and became the number one box office success in America. But their partnership, which Lewis likened to a love affair, ended in acrimony. The two men did not speak to one another for years after the split, though they were reconciled before Martin's death. Lewis went on to sign an exclusive contract with Paramount Pictures, which made him the best-paid star in Hollywood. He wrote, starred in, produced and even directed a series of comedy films including The Bell Boy, Cinderfella and The Nutty Professor, which broke box office records everywhere they played. Many of his roles were based on the idea of a split personality. Lewis' innate ability to play a wide range of admittedly grotesque characters, was always at the core of his films. To some, Lewis' performances were childish and simplistic. Others, including the French, who awarded him their highest decoration the Legion d'Honneur in 1984, considered him a genius. Lewis filming his Holocaust movie The Day The Clown Cried, in Paris in 1972 Lewis took his comedy extremely seriously. Indeed, he taught for a time at the University of Southern California, where his students included George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. His analysis was refreshingly simple, that ""there is a thin line between comedy and tragedy and real comedy comes through exploring that line"". Lewis endured a number of setbacks including open heart surgery, prostate cancer and a bitter separation from one of his five sons. In 1983, he thrilled as the talk show host stalked by Robert de Niro in The King of Comedy and, in 1995, played opposite the British actor and comedian, Lee Evans (whom many liken to Lewis) in the film Funny Bones. Lewis on stage during the Royal Variety Show in 1966 He returned in triumph to the stage in 1995 as the satanic Mr Applegate in the musical Damn Yankees. It was a role that, at the time, made him the highest-paid star in Broadway history. When the Weinstein Company made a CGI animated version of the Nutty Professor in 2008, Lewis lent his voice to the character of Professor Kelp, the part he had played in the original 1963 film. For more than 50 years, he worked for the American Muscular Dystrophy Association and fronted their annual coast to coast Telethon. It was a partnership that ended somewhat abruptly in 2010. Behind the clowning, Lewis was a complex character, some would say eccentric. He would, for instance, give suits away rather than have them cleaned and, like many perfectionists, could be egotistical and difficult to work with. It is a measure of Jerry Lewis' many abilities, not just that he made it to the top during one of the most competitive eras in Hollywood history, but that he stayed there for half a century, still packing them close to the end.

"They're the sights that mean the journey's end is near and the comforts of home await. From towers to trees and works of art, BBC News takes a trip around some of your favourite roadside landmarks that loom large above the landscape. This impressive clump of trees can be seen on the approach into Cornwall on the A30 The copse of 140 beech trees stands proudly atop a hillside to the south of the A30 at Lifton on the approach to Cornwall from Devon. Local historians believe the trees were planted in about 1900, either as a landscape feature to mark the northern edge of the Lifton Park Estate, or as cover for pheasants. Artist Katy Stoneman, who is from the area, said: ""They are known to my children as 'Mummy's trees' because of my paintings. ""As it is such an iconic view and means so much to visitors and locals alike, it is known by many different names: 'Cornwall beyond', 'Grandma's trees', 'nearly home',"" she said. Cookworthy Knapp has inspired many artists Diana Kempster, from Launceston, said: ""We used to think it was 'our copse' (small-minded arrogance!) and would chirp out 'nearly there'. ""There is something almost ethereal and otherworldly about the copse... counting everyone safely in then bidding them a safe goodbye."" The concrete tower is the tallest self-supporting structure in the UK The Arqiva Tower transmitter, which overlooks the Pennines and West Yorkshire, is known by locals as the Emley Moor Mast. The 1,083ft (330m) Grade II-listed structure is taller than The Shard in London. Its television coverage area is one of the largest in the UK, serving most of Yorkshire including Hull, Leeds, Sheffield and York. Emily Wells told the BBC: ""I've lived in Flockton all my life so see it every day from my window. Driving past, I never tire of slowing down and looking up. ""I went up a couple of years ago, which was amazing. I cried as we walked out on to the gallery as it took my breath away."" Teacher Lindsay Burrell said: ""I grew up in the shadow of the mast for nearly 20 years. As a child we used to play 'first to spot the mast wins' on journeys back home from visiting family or going on holiday."" Vikki Brown said: ""I suppose it is a bit of a constant in a mad world, and, crazy as it might sound, it feels as though there's an invisible string that tethers me to it."" Ed Midgley captured this drone footage of the mast shrouded by clouds Jill Kynaston, 60, said: ""My mum used to cry when she saw the mast after fab holidays because we were nearly home and the holiday was definitely over."" Kate Watto, 40, recalled that when she was a child her father made a video of their new house in Emley including footage of the mast, complete with a classical music soundtrack. ""As we turned down the hill from Wakefield and caught sight of the mast for the first time, we knew we were nearly home and we all started singing the main theme,"" she said. ""From then on this was our soundtrack whenever we spotted the mast after a trip away."" Francis Caton loves Didcot Power Station so much he had a painting commissioned The site's chimney is one of the tallest structures in the UK and its three remaining cooling towers - which are due to be demolished - can be seen from miles around. The coal-fired Didcot A power station was turned off in 2013, after 43 years in service. During demolition work on the site in February 2016,four men were killedwhen part of a boiler house collapsed. The three southern cooling towers have been knocked down, although the others are yet to be demolished Francis Caton, from Abingdon, said he had an emotional association with the site. ""I was sent away to boarding school in York, where I was bullied without respite,"" he said. ""On my long train journey home from York to Didcot at the end of each term, I used to view the lights of the power station in the night sky from the open train window from Oxford onwards, watching them get slowly closer with each clickety-clack of the train's wheels whilst the wind whistled through my hair, knowing that when I finally reached the lights I would be safe."" Emily Rees, 35, from Oxford, said: ""I am nostalgically attached to the cooling towers now. ""They are such a big part of the horizon and can be pretty striking when the morning sun hits them."" The terraces on Glastonbury Tor have been dated to about 10,000BC Glastonbury Tor has been a location of religious significance for more than 1,000 years and is known as ""one of the most spiritual sites in the country"", according to the National Trust. Pagan beliefs are still ""very much celebrated"" at the tor and legend has it King Arthur and his knights of the round table also visited it, the trust said. Bethany Dawes said: ""It has inspired a monument in a story I am writing, it is that special... we also recently released the ashes of our family dog around the tor."" Grade I-listed building St Michael's Tower sits atop the tor Kate Cook told the BBC: ""I lived in Glastonbury all my life until six years ago... coming down over Wells Hill, my heart skips a beat as I know I'm home. ""My memories are climbing the tor nearly every day in the school summer holidays with our jam sandwiches and a bottle of water. Then we would roly-poly down the hill,"" she said. Hazel Cutting said: ""My husband used to live in Glastonbury. The tor was visible whilst we were on the M5 when I was taking the kids down for the weekend. ""I get butterflies when I see it."" The graffiti is not thought to refer to the popular green legume ""Peas"" was reportedly the name of a London graffiti artist who daubed his name on the M25's only Edwardian bridge, between junctions 16 and 17, near Uxbridge. The words ""give"" and ""a chance"" were added later, with the amended graffiti thought to refer to his frequent arrests, according to a historic building report by Oxford Archaeology. The ""Peas"" tag can been seen in several places, particularly on other bridges. The bridge has a dedicated following The bridge has its ownFacebook page,externalwith about 6,500 followers. Anne Bradford said: ""This is a special bridge that marks some family memories of journeys along this part of the motorway."" The 20-metre tall Angel of the North stands atop a former coalmine The iconic 200-tonne steel angel has loomed over the A1 in Gateshead since 1998. The sculpture, which is 20 metres tall and has wings measuring 54 metres across, has become a much-loved piece of public art. Dan Homarus said: ""The Angel means so much to me... any time I drive back to the 'Toon' now, the sight of the Angel brings back a decade of memories. ""It's one of my favourite pieces of outdoor art in the UK: it epitomises the North East with its rusty elegance, flying out of the old coalmine of the past. I love it."" The famous sculpture is the work of Antony Gormley For Liam Heenan, from Newcastle, the first glimpse of the Angel is a welcome reminder he is nearly home. ""When you have driven all day up the M1 and A1, the sight of the Angel of the North to your right means you're only 10 minutes away from a deserved cuppa,"" he said. Rachel Wearmouth said: ""It is like a relative that you are forced to see at Christmas, and when you do you're glad they're weathering life so well. ""It keeps on keeping on, much like me Mam and the poor old commuters stuck in traffic on the A1 every morning."" This story was inspired by responses toHow do you know when you're nearly home?

But Logan left the band in 1989 and the twins called it a day in 1992 after a run of 12 Top 40 hits. And many of the original Brosettes were out in force at the O2, tweeting their appreciation for the comeback show, saying it was ""incredible"" and ""worth the wait"". Allow Twitter content?

"Police say the wrecked house in Alcanar is a focal point of the investigation A 12-strong terror cell that carried out two deadly attacks in Spain had collected 120 gas canisters and was planning to use them in vehicle attacks, Spanish police say. Canisters were found at a house, said to be used by the cell, that blew up in the town of Alcanar on Wednesday night. Police are still hunting for the driver of the van that hit dozens of people on Barcelona's Las Ramblas, killing 13. On Sunday, a Mass was held in Barcelona to mourn the victims. In addition to the 13 killed on Thursday afternoon on Las Ramblas, a woman died in a second vehicle attack early on Friday in the town of Cambrils. Five suspected jihadists were shot dead by police in the second attack. The Catalan authorities have also confirmed that a British-Australian seven-year-old,Julian Cadman, was among those killed in Barcelona. He had been declared missing since becoming separated from his injured mother in the attack, and his family had made appeals for news of his whereabouts. What we know so far Barcelona tells world 'I'm not afraid' Barcelona rejects hate after attacks Catalan police chief Josep Lluis Trapero has given an update on the investigation. He said the cell was still believed to consist of 12 men and had been planning attacks for more than six months. One person remained at large, four were under arrest and there were two sets of human remains to be identified, he added. This video can not be played Inside the pretty town hiding terror suspects The person at large was the driver of the van, Mr Trapero said, adding that police knew his identity but would not reveal it. But police have confirmed they are hunting Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, who Spanish media say was the driver. The two sets of remains to be identified may refer to victims of the house explosion at Alcanar. Spanish media have speculated the two may be Youssef Aallaa, the brother of one of the suspected jihadists killed at Cambrils, and Abdelbaki Es Satty, an imam from the town of Ripoll, north of Barcelona, where a number of the suspects lived. The imam apparently left the mosque in June for an extended trip to Morocco, but a flatmate told the BBC he had been seen in Ripoll as recently as last Tuesday. This video can not be played ""Barcelona is going to rise up again with its spirit and its openness"" ""We're starting to see clearly that [the Alcanar house] was the place where they were preparing explosives for one or more attacks in the city of Barcelona,"" Mr Trapero said. He added: ""We are not in a position to say what caused the radicalisation of these people."" American honeymooner killed in Barcelona Spain attacks timeline Spain's long anti-terror experience Mr Trapero said police could not rule out that the suspect still at large had crossed the French border, although he had ""no specific information on this"". The father of two of those shot dead by police in Cambrils, Mohamed and Omar Hychami, told the BBC he was devastated. Hecham Igasi also accused the imam of radicalising his sons. This video can not be played There was a special Mass at the Sagrada Familia church for the victims It is now known that three vehicles were rented under the credit card of Younes Abouyaaqoub. One was used in the Las Ramblas attack, another was found after the attack in the town of Vic and a third in Ripoll. Mr Trapero said the cell had planned to fill all three with explosive material to carry out attacks. Barcelona FC, in their first match since the attacks, beat Real Betis 2-0 at the Camp Nou ground on Sunday night. Players observed a minute's silence before kick-off and wore black armbands. Barcelona's players lined up with shirts carrying the name of the city instead of their own names Earlier, King Felipe and Queen Letizia attended Barcelona's Sagrada Familia cathedral to mourn those killed in the attacks Some reports in Spanish media say the jihadist cell had intended to target the iconic, Gaudi-designed church with explosives. Cardinal Juan JosÃ© Omella, the Archbishop of Barcelona, called for peace and unity, saying: ""We will overcome fear."" He read a message from Pope Francis, which said the pontiff ""condemns once again the violence, which is a very grave offence against the creator, and he prays to God for help so we can continue working for peace and harmony in the world"". As the debate about possible Catalan independence continues, Cardinal Omella added: ""The union makes us strong, the division corrodes us and destroys us."" Where attacks leave Catalan independence So-called Islamic State (IS) said it had carried out the Las Ramblas attack, though it is not clear whether any of the attackers were directly connected to the group or simply inspired by it.

"Removing all trade tariffs and barriers would help generate an annual Â£135bn uplift to the UK economy, according to a group of pro-Brexit economists. A ""hard"" Brexit is ""economically much superior to soft"", argues Prof Patrick Minford, lead author of a report from Economists for Free Trade. He says eliminating tariffs, either within free trade deals or unilaterally, would deliver huge gains. Other economists say cutting barriers sets off a ""race to the bottom"". Economist Dr Monique Ebell from the National Institute of Social and Economic Research (NIESR) says Prof Minford ""ignores decades of evidence on how trade actually works"". Dr Ebell's own research showed that if the UK left the single market but made unilateral trade deals with major developing economies and the Anglosphere, it would only claw back about one-third of the 20-30% reduction in lost total trade by leaving the EU. Dr Ebell says many of the trade barriers that Prof Minford argues to be removed are subtle, non-tariff barriers, such as agreed common standards. Campaigners against a hard Brexit said the plan amounts to ""economic suicide"". The UK is part of the EU customs union, and so imposes tariffs - taxes on imports - on some goods coming into the country. Countries in the customs union don't impose tariffs on each other's goods, and every country inside the union levies the same tariffs on imports from abroad. So, for example, a 10% tariff is imposed on some cars imported from outside the customs union, while 7.5% is imposed on roasted coffee. Other goods have no tariffs. The UK has said it is leaving the EU's customs union because as a member it is unable to strike trade deals with other countries. A quick guide to the Brexit negotiations Farmers back temporary customs union Prof Minford's full report, From Project Fear to Project Prosperity, is due to be published in the autumn. He argues that the UK could unilaterally - before a reciprocal deal is in place - eliminate trade barriers for both the EU and the rest of the world and reap trade gains worth Â£80bn a year. The report foresees a further Â£40bn a year boost from deregulating the economy, as well as other benefits resulting from Brexit-related policies. Mr Minford - a professor at Cardiff University - says that when it comes to trade the ""ideal solution"" would still be free trade deals with major economic blocks including the EU. But the threat that the UK could abolish all trade barriers unilaterally would act as ""the club in the closet"". The EU would then be under pressure to offer Britain a free trade deal, otherwise its producers would be competing in a UK market ""flooded with less expensive goods from elsewhere"", his introduction says. He argues UK businesses and consumers would benefit from lower priced imported goods and the effects of increased competition, which would force firms to raise their productivity. However, Dr Ebell says that ""competition needs to be fair"". ""Some foreign firms from outside the EU can produce more cheaply because they pollute, or treat workers in ways that we find unacceptable. So we impose tariffs to level the playing field. That is legitimate, and only fair."" This video can not be played Brexit: What's the difference between a hard or soft Brexit? However, Open Britain,a campaign group,externalarguing for the UK to remain within the single market and the customs union, said the proposed strategy would be damaging to the UK economy. ""Unilaterally scrapping our tariffs without achieving similar reductions in the tariff rates of other countries would see Britain swamped with imports, leaving our manufacturers and farmers unable to compete,"" said Labour MP Alison McGovern, a supporter of the cross-party group Open Britain, which is campaigning against a hard Brexit. ""The levels of bankruptcy and unemployment, especially in industry and agriculture, would sky-rocket. ""This is a project of economic suicide, not prosperity. No responsible government would touch this report with a barge pole as a source of ideas for our future trade policy."" Economists for Free Trade is a group of 16 economists, including former government advisers and academics. The group plans to release further chapters of the report in the run-up to its full publication. It is a counter-intuitive idea, but actually, the economics textbooks do provide some support for the idea of unilateral trade liberalisation. This analysis suggests that removing trade barriers produces benefits for consumers and businesses buying components or raw materials that exceed the losses suffered in industries that face stiffer competition. The downside is that it may take time, perhaps years, for the workers who lose their jobs to find new ones. Prof Minford has expressed the view that the British economy is flexible enough to cope. There is also the question of how the new jobs would compare with the old ones. The mainstream view among economists is that while countries overall may gain from trade liberalisation, there are usually some specific groups that lose. Prof Minford also directs criticism at Chancellor Philip Hammond's current approach to Brexit, which he says amounts to ""throwing away our hard-won freedom from EU rules"". The chancellor is viewed as favouring a softer approach to Brexit, but recentlyco-authored an article,externalin the Telegraph in which he proposed that the UK would leave both the single market and the customs union in March 2019, but that there would be a ""time-limited"" transition period to help businesses adjust. Prof Patrick Minford says dropping all tariffs after Brexit will boost the UK economy by billions A government spokesman said the UK would maintain a ""deep and special"" relationship with the bloc after departing the EU. ""The economy has grown continuously for four years and there are more people in work than ever before.

"Explosions could be seen as Iraqi forces advanced on the outskirts of the city Iraqi ground forces have begun an operation to retake Tal Afar, one of the last cities in the country held by the Islamic State group, officials say. Several areas around Tal Afar were retaken on the first day of the offensive, Iraqia News TV reported. In a televised speech, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the jihadists had the choice between ""surrender or die"". The army targeted Tal Afar after seizing Mosul, IS's main stronghold 55km (35 miles) to the east, in July. Tal Afar, which had a predominantly ethnic Turkmen population of 200,000 before it fell to IS in 2014, sits on a major road between Mosul and the Syrian border that was once a key supply route for the jihadist group. Anti-IS coalition forces estimate that between 50,000 and 100,000 civilians remain in and around the city. Mosul defeat a blow to IS, but not the end Where is IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi? The Iraqi towns still under IS control The US-led coalition said its aircraft carried out dozens of strikes on the outskirts of Tal Afar on Sunday in support of advancing troops. Officials said only a portion were planned in advance, and the rest were against IS fighters who emerged as the fighting intensified. Shia militia are fighting alongside Iraqi government troops in the operation IS, in a statement via its Amaq news agency, said it had destroyed several vehicles belonging to Shia militia groups to the east and west of Tal Afar. Warplanes have been bombarding IS positions in the city for several days in preparation for ground operations. On Sunday Mr Abadi, dressed in a black military uniform and standing in front of an Iraqi flag and a map of the country, announced the ""start of an operation to free Tal Afar"". ""I am saying to Daesh [Islamic State] that there is no choice other than to surrender or die,"" he said. He finished his speech with an address to Iraqi troops: ""The whole world is with you."" US Army Lt Gen Stephen Townsend, the commander of US and coalition forces in Iraq and Syria, hailed the new offensive. He said: ""The Iraqi Security Forces' operation to liberate Tal Afar is another important fight that must be won to ensure the country and its citizens are finally free of IS. ""The coalition is strong, and fully committed to supporting our Iraqi partners until IS is defeated and the Iraqi people are free."" Hours before Mr Abadi's statement, the Iraqi air force dropped leaflets over the city warning people to ""prepare"" for the latest assault. ""The battle is imminent and the victory is coming, God willing,"" the leaflets read. Tal Afar is surrounded by government troops and Shia militiamen in the south, and Kurdish Peshmerga fighters in the north. The Iraqi Shia militiamen did not play a big part in retaking Mosul, a mainly Sunni city, but are far more active in Tal Afar. Last month, a senior Iraqi commander who once served as mayor of Tal Afar said there were between 1,500 and 2,000 militants and their family members left in the city. Maj-Gen Najm al-Jabouritold,externalReuters news agency the jihadists were ""worn out and demoralised"" and that he did not expect a fierce battle for the town like the one for Mosul, which lasted almost nine months and took a heavy toll on Iraqi forces. He also noted that only one part of the town had narrow streets comparable to those in Mosul's Old City.
