"Anna Rowe had a whirlwind romance with Antony Ray after meeting him through the dating app Tinder. But their 14-month relationship came crashing down when she discovered his profile was a fake. His name was not Antony and he was not single. In fact, he was a married dad who had initially used photos of a Bollywood actor on his profile and had lured in other women too. ""He used me like a hotel with benefits under the disguise of a romantic, loving relationship that he knew I craved,"" says Anna. The practice of using a fake profile to start an online romance is known as ""catfishing"". Now Anna, 44, from Kent, haslaunched a petition,externalcalling for it to be made illegal. But how serious is catfishing and is it practical to make it a crime? Many dating apps and sites offer advice on how to spot fake profiles More than half of online dating users say they have come across a fake profile, according toconsumer group Which?,external While the number of people defrauded in the UK by online dating scamsreached a record high in 2016. There were 3,889 victims of so-called romance fraud last year, who handed over a record Â£39m. It has become so prevalent, that it led to the creation of reality TV show Catfish - which is dedicated to helping victims learn the true identity of their online romances. Currently catfishing is not illegal but elements of the activity could be covered by different parts of the law. If a victim hands over money, the ""catfish"" could be prosecuted for fraud. Someone using a fake profile to post offensive messages or doctored images designed to humiliate could also face criminal action. A review,externalof social media and the law by the House of Lords in 2014 concluded there was enough current legislation to cover crimes committed online. New guidance was also issuedby the CPS in October to help the police identify online crimes - including trolling and virtual mobbing. But Anna thinks the law needs to go further. Writing on her petition, she said: ""I did not or would not consent to have a sexual relationship with a married man, let alone a man who was actively having relations with multiple women simultaneously. ""His behaviour was definitely premeditated showing his intent to use women, yet the current law will not find his actions a criminal offence."" Tony Neate, chief executive of Get Safe Online, recognises the devastating impact catfishing can have on victims. ""It can ruin a life. I know there have been suicides because it's affected someone badly,"" he says. ""It can affect their mental stability and lead to depression and the victims feel they can't trust anyone again. ""I do think we need to look more wisely at this in relation to how it is tackled at the moment."" Mr Neate, a former police officer, says there should be a ""discussion"" about punishing the worst catfishing offenders. But he raises concerns about how practical a new law would be to implement. ""I really feel for that poor woman [Anna] but we have got to be realistic on how far we got and how the police would be able to enforce it,"" he says. ""Let's have the discussion because we can't have people being hurt and it's something we have got to look at."" Many dating websites offer users advice on how to spot a scammer and tips to avoid being taken in by a fake profile. (See ""Tips to avoid catfishes"", below) Popular dating site Match.com has a team which will remove unwanted accounts and check photos and personal ads. It also has a built-in screening system that can help identify suspicious accounts, remove them and prevent re-registration. Lovestruck has a verification service that can confirm members are single and professional by checking their profiles against their other social media sites. But the advice has not stopped many people being duped. Last month, university professor Judith Lathlean revealed how she wastricked out of Â£140,000by a gang using a fake profile. Ife Ojo, 31, and Olusegun Agbaje, 43,were jailed in 2016after conning a woman out of Â£1.6m using a fictional character. But Andrew McClelland, chief executive of the Online Dating Association - the trade body for the industry - believes legislating against catfishing would be ""difficult"". He said there could be genuine reasons why someone might not use their real details online - for example if they had been in an abusive relationship and did not want their ex-partner to find them. Data protection and freedom of expression would also be an issue when it came to enforcing such a law, he added. ""The biggest problem this faces is how do you legislate against someone lying?"" says Mr McClelland. Ask lots of questions. Do not simply rely on the information given in someone's online profile Search. Use the internet as a tool to search elsewhere for information and the social media accounts of the person you are chatting to Speak to friends and family. Be guided by others on whether the profile appears genuine Chat on the dating site. Avoid giving out your personal number or email before really getting to know someone Never give out money.

"The faces of some England's offenders who have fled lawful custody in the past three years Beating up love rivals and trying to find gainful employment are among the reasons prisoners have given for ""going on the run"", it has emerged. A BBC investigation has sought to find out where people fleeing lawful custody actually go and why. There were 13 prison escapes and 105 cases of absconding in 2015/2016. While a significant number of offenders simply go home, where they are usually caught quite quickly, some manage to leave the country. The BBC asked the Prison Service and every police force in the country where those on the run in the past three years had fled from; where they were caught; how long they were on the loose; and why they decided to flee in the first place. The results of the investigation come amid the ongoing police hunt forLiverpool killer Shaun Walmsleywho fled police in an armed escape outside Aintree University Hospital earlier this week. Escapes involve prisoners absenting from prison without lawful authority by overcoming a physical security restraint such as fences, locks, bolts and bars, a secure vehicle or handcuffs Absconds are where prisoners do not have to overcome physical restraints to leave. Absconds usually occur at open prisons, where it is physically easier to leave Source: Ministry of Justice The Ministry of Justice said it did not ""routinely gather"" or keep such information and refused the BBC's request for information. However, data supplied by police forces and media reports suggests that the average distance travelled by escapees or absconders is 36 miles (57km) before they are caught. Although most police forces do not record the reasons inmates go on the run, some do. Suffolk Police, for example, told how one prisoner who absconded from HMP Hollesley Bay spent nine weeks at large. He claimed he was the victim of repeated bullying and theft in the prison. A second inmate on the run for four weeks told police when caught he absconded as a result of drugs in prison and because he ""didn't get on with the Muslims"". Avon and Somerset Police, which provided the most comprehensive information of any force, told of an absconder who fled to try to ""visit his ill mother in Australia"", another who ""wanted to go back to Nottingham and get a job"" and a third who wanted ""to harm his ex-girlfriend's new partner and move to West Bromwich"". Another, who absconded from HMP Leyhill, claimed he did so because of ""continuous offers of drink and drugs"". Faith Spear, the former chairman of the Independent Monitoring Board at HMP Hollesley Bay, has spoken to a number of prisoners who have either absconded or thought about it. The usual reasons given, she said, were concerns about the distances from family or visits proving too costly. ""Or,"" she said, ""they are (prisoners on)Imprisonment for Public Protection,externaland have given up on the system and can not see another way out."" Ashley Fulcher fled from Selby 5,377 miles (8,653 km) to Costa Rica to evade justice Former prisoner Phil Aldis, who served sentences at both HMP Chelmsford in Essex and HMP Wayland in Norfolk, said personal problems - such as relationship breakdowns, sick family members or desperation at being in prison - were the key reasons why inmates fled. ""There is not a lot of support in prison,"" said Mr Aldis. ""Prisoners do not like speaking to anybody about emotional stuff because they are very worried about being seen as weak. ""Prison can be an extremely lonely place and you keep your emotions bottled up and that causes frustration and desperation."" One of the longest escape distances reported involved Ashley Fulcher, originally fromGreat Yarmouthand later of Selby, who fled in 2015, apparently for extradition reasons, 5,377 miles (8,653 km) to Costa Rica in Central America. He was caught by Det Con Chris Ryan, of North Yorkshire Police, after an exhaustive intelligence-based operation in which ""little bits of information"" and close liaison with the Costa Rican authorities revealed his whereabouts. Det Con Chris Ryan (right) won an award from North Yorkshire Police for his detective work in tracking Ashley Fulcher to Costa Rica Fulcher was trying to board a plane to Mexico when he was caught by the Costa Rican authorities on visa offences, Det Con Ryan said. Det Con Ryan put on his police uniform at Heathrow Airport to arrest Fulcher, who told officers he fled because he was scared of a long prison sentence. ""You've been staring at a photograph of this guy for a long time and you've been doing all this work,"" the officer said. ""You can't wait to get hold of him and put the cuffs on. ""On the drive back up to Yorkshire, Fulcher said he was actually quite pleased to be back in the UK. He had been a big fish in his home town. ""In Costa Rica, there are criminals with guns. He was genuinely quite glad to be back."" Robert Hennessey was detained aged 14 for the manslaughter of his aunt Although there are more than 100 prisons across the UK, the story of prison absconds can be encapsulated in just a single prison. TakeHMP Leyhill,externalin Wotton-under-Edge for example. Avon and Somerset Police have 14 records of absconders from the Category D prison over the period 2014-2016. Two of those who absconded were found in their parents' homes, while a further two simply handed themselves in to police after travelling up to 130 miles (210km). One was found in woods by police close to the prison and a second was spotted in a road just a few miles away. Just one prison: Data supplied by police revealed where absconders from HMP Leyhill were eventually arrested The most intriguing case is that of Robert Hennessey who walked out of HMP Leyhill in November 1998 while serving a life sentence for the manslaughter of his aunt in Plymouth in 1978. Using false documents, including a fake passport, he travelled extensively before ending up in the Queensland area of Australia. It was here that he was jailed for credit card scams before being deported back to the UK in 2015. He admitted evading lawful custody and was sentenced to 16 months.

"New advice suggests that for a longer life, we need to eat 10 portions of fruit and vegetables a day, but how realistic is this and is it only a diet for the wealthy? ""Healthy foods are three times more expensive calorie-for-calorie than unhealthy foods so there's a very strong price differential in a typical basket,"" says Anna Taylor,  executive director of the independent think tank Food Foundation. Vegetables are getting cheaper but, she says, there are people who ""haven't got enough money to put food on the table, so for them, trying to secure 10 portions of fruit and veg a day in their diets would be impossible."" The studyby Imperial College London, calculated that increasing our fruit and veg intake to 10-a-day could prevent 7.8 million premature deaths each year. But currently only around a quarter of adults in the UK achieve the five-a-day target. The British Heart Foundationdid a surveywhich found that a third of UK adults are struggling to afford to eat healthily. So is 10-a-day realistically affordable? ""For some people it is,"" says Victoria Taylor, senior dietitian at the BHF. ""But for others it would take some serious thought and commitment in terms of working out which fruit and vegetables will be affordable. But it's important to keep in mind that our target is five a day and this study found that the best effects were seen for people who are currently getting below this number. ""The focus on 10 is, in a sense, moving the goalposts and it would be a shame if this put people off aiming for five, or even just having one more portion a day."" The British Dietetic Association says: ""What it tells us is that the benefits of eating fruit and vegetables are incremental - in other words eating five portions a day is great, but 10 a day is even better."" So any improvement in your fruit and vegetable intake is a benefit. Victoria Taylor says cost is not the only reason we don't eat enough fruit and veg. ""There are numerous factors that influence our food choice. Cost is important but so is taste, cooking skills, storage facilities and ability to get to and from the shops.  It's hard to say how much is specifically due to the price of food as all of these issues are interrelated."" Buy seasonally and check prices online or with in-store flyers before you do your shop Most supermarkets do weekly fruit and veg deals, and the own brand or economy fruit and veg is cheaper Frozen fruit and veg can be an affordable choice - it's ready prepared and cuts down on wastage Buy fruits like berries and cherries frozen or when they are in season and freeze extra yourself Meat is usually more expensive so swapping in pulses as an alternative source of protein some of the time will save you money Buying loose can be half the price of buying pre-packaged Fruits and vegetables that are in season locally are normally better value as well. If something is about to go out of date, use it in a stew or soup rather than throwing it away - or freeze it Do not have too much fruit juice and dried fruits as they are higher in sugar The Food Foundation is hostinga conference in June,externalbringing together businesses, farmers, retailers and government departments which aims to make it easier for people to eat vegetables. Some of the ideas they will be looking at are current pilots in America where if food stamps are spent on fruit and veg, they can be doubled in value so ""you create a positive incentive for people to spend their vouchers on fruit and veg because you're giving them more value"". Another scheme sees people who have early stage type 2 diabetes or are pre-diabetic being prescribed fruit and veg and getting vouchers to spend in local markets ""to help them rethink their diets and get their diets on track"". We asked BBC readers to send us their questions about the 10-a-day diet and then our health team wrote this piece to try to answer as many as possible. A lot of people asked about the cost implications of trying to achieve a 10-a-day diet. Gary asked: ""Should fruit and vegetables be heavily subsidized by the government to encourage further consumption?"" Gary explained to us the thinking behind his question: ""Simple consumer habits dictate that people consume more of something when it is cheaper. I believe the same economic principle can be applied to fruit and vegetables. When people go shopping, they have to make the choice of what to buy, and usually, the best value items win."" With concern over the cost of healthy eating, some have asked whether the government should subsidise fruit and veg? At the moment, the government has ""measures in place to support low income families, pregnant women and children under four throughHealthy Start Vouchers,external. These can be spent on milk, fresh or frozen fruit and vegetables."" They also point out that all infant pupils can now get free school meals and they've announced Â£10m funding a year to expand breakfast clubs in up to 1,600 schools. Currently only 70% of those eligible get the healthy start vouchers and Anna Taylor says the Food Foundation will debate whether that programme should be expanded to include a broader income group or wider age range at its conference. As she points out, this ""would create a positive pull of demand - and thereby help to strengthen the British horticulture sector at the same time."" And she thinks in the post-Brexit world there is a big opportunity to help farmers. ""Doesn't it make sense to join up our farming policy with our health policy and think about - could we increase consumer subsidies to really drive up demand so our horticulturalists benefit as well - it's win-win."" ""There are lots of different ways we could make it easier to eat veg - which go beyond price and much more about our whole food environment and to what extent fruit and veg is a strong part of that and encouraging us to eat it."" She points out when you look at advertising only ""1% of food and soft drink advertising spend goes on fresh veg"". But she believes we need to change our whole way of thinking about fruit and veg and the messages we send - even down to children's TV where, she says, it is ""demonised"". ""It's set against delicious and junk food or cream cakes, and fruit and veg is the yucky thing that kids don't want to eat. There's a bit of that subliminal stuff that happens in kids' TV because it's funny but it's kind of normalising that this is stuff that you don't want to be eating - so there's a job of work there beyond advertising, in broadcasting to try and not normalise that this is worthy but not tasty.""

"The claim:The Conservatives' win in Copeland is the first time since 1878 that a governing party has made a comparable gain in a by-election Reality Check verdict:A governing party gaining a seat at a by-election is an extremely unusual event. It has happened since 1878, but you could argue that those occasions had unusual circumstances that meant they were not comparable. Governing parties rarely look forward to by-elections, which tend to have relatively low turnouts and are seen as having less at stake than general elections. It is very rare for the governing party to pick up votes from the opposition. It is even rarer for them to gain a seat, as the Conservatives did when Trudy Harrison won Copeland in Cumbria. The constituency and its predecessor, Whitehaven, had returned Labour MPs since 1935. The Conservatives say this is ""the first time since 1878 that a governing party has made a comparable gain in a by-election"". The party was referring to the Worcester by-election 139 years ago, when they won the seat from the Liberals. Copeland is certainly not the first instance of a ruling party winning a seat at a by-election since that year, when Benjamin Disraeli was prime minister and women could not vote. That has happened several times since, but in unusual circumstances which are perhaps not ""comparable"" to Copeland. For example, in 1982 at the height of the Falklands War, a Labour MP defected to the Social Democratic Party in the south London seat of Mitcham and Morden. This split the left-of-centre vote, meaning the Conservative candidate won despite getting a smaller share of the vote than at the previous general election. A Conservative/National Liberal candidate won the Yorkshire seat of Brighouse and Spenborough from Labour in 1960, but that seat was very marginal. Labour won by just 47 votes at the 1959 general election, and lost by 666 a year later. In 1953, the governing Conservatives took Sunderland South from Labour, but this was also very close and the Conservative vote share fell slightly because a Liberal picked up some votes. Copeland was not nearly as tight as these examples, and the Conservatives increased their vote share substantially. Labour's Jamie Reed won the seat by more than 2,000 votes in 2015, while the new Conservative MP took it by a similar margin. The swing was 6.7%, a stunning result for a governing party. There are various other examples of government by-election gains since 1878. However, as Matt Singh of NumbrCrunchr Politics points out, these are ""mostly the product of freakish circumstancesâ¦ none of which apply to Copeland"".

"Ministers in England have said they are looking for a solution to the problems in social care. That has raised hope that next month's Budget could include measures to tackle what many describe as the crisis facing the sector. But what exactly has gone wrong? And who's affected? Social care - organised by councils - is a broad term that covers everything from children's social workers and fostering through to services for disabled adults and the care provided to people in their old age. But some have been affected more than others. Over the years, more and more has been spent on services. The growth in the population, the fact people are living longer and those with disabilities are more likely to survive to an older age are all contributory factors. But this upward trend in funding has tailed off in England over the past decade. You do not have to look far to find the cause of this. Central government funding for councils was cut by a third during the last parliament. Councils have tried to protect social care. The proportion of their budget being spent on these services has increased over the years and now well over half of their spending goes on care services. But that, of course, has meant deeper cuts elsewhere - in libraries, leisure centres and refuse collection. What's more, if you delve further into the figures you can see even this level of spending has been maintained only with a little help from elsewhere. A third of last year's Â£24bn budget went on children. That left just over Â£16bn for adults. But nearly Â£2bn of that was thanks to a transfer of money from the NHS into care services, ordered by the government. This is a recognition that what happens in social care has a direct impact on the NHS. If people are not given the support they need in the community, they can end up in hospital. And if it's not available when they are then ready to be discharged, they can end up stranded on wards - doctors will release frail patients only if they know there are care packages in place in the community. The number of delays of this sort has nearly doubled in five years. Not all of these delays are down to a lack of social care, but it is the fastest growing reason for them. And when beds are occupied by patients who cannot leave, it gets more difficult to admit new patients. That's one of the reasons why we have heard so much about lengthening trolley waits and worsening waiting times in accident and emergency departments in recent months. This situation is understandable. To make savings, councils have started to ration care, particularly to the elderly, rather than younger adults with disabilities. The number of older people getting care from councils has fallen by over a quarter between 2008-09 and 2013-14. We don't know what has happened since 2014, as the way the data is collected has changed. Although, it's pretty clear there hasn't been a huge turnaround. Councils agreed to help less than half the older people who approached them for help last year. What about elsewhere in the UK? Whereas all adult council care in England is means-tested - those with assets of over Â£23,250 pay the full costs of their care - Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have slightly different systems. In Wales, the cost of help in the home for daily tasks such as washing and dressing is capped at Â£60 a week, in Northern Ireland it is provided free to the over-75s, and in Scotland personal care is free whether the individual is in their own home or a care home. Many argue these systems are more generous. That may be so. But all have had to ration services in recent years by restricting access to only the people with the most severe needs. How the care system works across the UK The alternative options The result of this is that people make their own arrangements. Four in 10 people in care homes pay for themselves. Others rely on family and friends to look after them. But growing numbers are being left to struggle on with no or little help. The charity Age UK has been charting this. It estimates the number of those falling into this group hasrisen by nearly 50% since 2010, to 1.2 million. These are people who have pretty substantial needs. They cannot wash or dress themselves. They may struggle to go to the toilet. The stories they tell are heart-breaking. But it's not just individuals who have tales of woe. The companies providing the services - councils tend not to run them in-house - have started voicing concerns. They report the prices councils are paying are being squeezed so much that they are now making a loss in some areas from local authority work. The UK Home Care Association has calculated the cost of helping people in their own home is Â£16.70 an hour, but councils across the UK pay over Â£2 less than this on average. Meanwhile, analysts LaingBuisson have calculated that the fees being paid by councils for a care home place are Â£100 a week less than the true cost. It means the fees for those who pay for themselves are rising to offset the losses from local authority funded residents. In effect, self-funders are subsidising the state sector. Is this fair? LaingBuisson thinks not. It has called the trend a ""hidden care tax"". And these bills can rack up. An estimated one in 10 people faces care costs in excess of Â£100,000 after the age of 65. You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating. average amount of care provided per week, by your council average paid per hour by your council, 2014-15 average paid per hour in your region if you pay for your own care, 2016 You live in a care home that provides round-the-clock support with everyday tasks.      TBCpay for their own care  You live in a care home which provides round-the-clock support for everyday tasks and nursing care. Depending on your medical needs, the NHS may contribute to your costs.      TBCpay for their own care    Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there.  There is concern this is destabilising the sector. The Care Quality Commissionraised the alarmabout this last autumn. The risk is care companies start to focus on areas where there are more of the high-paying self-funders. That could create a shortage of places in some areas of the country, as self-funders are more likely to be found in the south of England. The map of the UK shows self-funders are more likely to be found in care homes in the South East of England There has not been a big exodus yet, although the number of care and nursing homes operating in England has fallen by over 1,500 in the past six years to 16,500. So what does the future hold? The population is growing older. And their needs are getting ever more complex. At the age of 65, one in six people has trouble with daily living - washing, dressing or eating. By 85, half do. Ministers have already taken steps to relieve the pressure. The health service and councils are being encouraged to work together on joint projects. They have also given councils permission to increase council tax to pay for social care. But there is a limit to how much this will bring in. This year, councils have been allowed to increase household bills by 2%. Most have done so, but it is raising less than 3% of what councils plan to spend on adult social care from their own funds, once NHS money has been deducted. By 2020, the Local Government Association believes, there will be a shortfall of Â£2.6bn in funding. It wants more substantial reform - and many in academia, in the health service and in the charity sector agree. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said this is on the government's agenda. But many have tried to find a solution before and failed. The social care system was created in 1948 and has hardly changed since. When Tony Blair came to power, he set up a Royal Commission. But nothing came of it. Under Gordon Brown's premiership, the idea of a universal care system - where everybody would get a basic level of care - was floated, before it fell victim to the Tories' 2010 ""death tax"" election campaign warning. The coalition government proposed a cap on care costs. That was meant to be introduced last year, but has been pushed back until 2020. Many now doubt it will ever see the light of day.

"The claim:Many young male migrants arrived in Sweden over the past few years, when the country accepted unprecedented numbers of refugees, and there has been a huge rise in sexual crime in Sweden especially in the southern port city of Malmo. Reality Check verdict:Malmo, along with other urban centres in Sweden, has one of the highest levels of reported rapes in proportion to population in the EU, mainly due to the strictness of Swedish laws and how rape is recorded in the country. The rate of reported rapes in Malmo has not dramatically risen in recent years and has in fact declined from its peak in 2010,  before the recent large increases in refugees. It is not possible to connect crimes to the ethnicity of the perpetrators as such data is not published. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage made this claim on LBC radio on Monday 20 February, when he discussed the recent comments by US President Donald Trumpabout terrorism in Sweden. Mr Farage said there had been no specific terrorist attacks in Sweden since large numbers of refugees arrived there, but, instead, he claimed Sweden had seen a dramatic rise in sexual crime and its southern port city of Malmo - the third largest city in the country - had become Europe's and possibly the world's ""rape capital"". So, has there been a big rise in sexual crime in Sweden and have the numbers of rapes increased in Malmo since Sweden took in an unprecedented numbers of refugees? The first thing to say is that the part of the claim referring to the number of refugees is certainly true. Sweden has been one of the biggest recipients of refugees in the EU in recent years. According to Eurostat, the agency that collects statistical data from all EU countries, in 2015 Sweden had over 162,000 asylum applications or 1,667 asylum seekers for every 100,000 citizens. A large majority of the 2015 asylum seekers - 114,470 - were male, 45,790 of them between 18 and 34 years of age. ""Sexual offences"" is a very broad term, which refers to a range of all sex-related crimes in Sweden. Rape is one of the sexual offences, but other crimes such as paying for sex, sexual harassment, indecent exposure, sexual exploitation, molestation and trafficking are included in the numbers as well. The figures peaked in 2014. The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Bra) says this rise is due to the changes to the legislation in 2013, which made it tougher. Similar increases in the number of reported cases were seen in 2006, after new sex offence legislation came into force in April 2005. Since then, Sweden has recorded every reported case of sexual violence separately. That means, as Susanne Lekengard from Bra explains, that if a person comes to the police and reports being raped by a partner or husband every day for the past year, the police will record each of these events. In many other countries these incidents would be recorded just once: one victim, one type of crime and one record. Also, paying for sex became one of the crimes counted in the statistics. During 2015, the year in which Sweden took the largest number of asylum seekers, the number of reported sex crimes and rapes actually decreased by 11% and 12% respectively compared with 2014 - 18,100 sex offences were reported to the police, of which 5,920 were classified as rape. Preliminary figures for 2016 show a rise, bringing the latest figures close to 2014 values. Susanne Lekengard says the rise of the number of sexual molestation cases in 2016 is due to a higher number of reported cases of sexual harassment amongst teenagers at summer music festivals. Sweden does not publish the ethnicity or national background of perpetrators of any crime, including sexual offences. According to Bra, the number of reported rape cases in proportion to the population in the municipality of Malmo has not seen a sharp increase since the biggest group of refugees arrived. Reported rapes per 100,000 inhabitants peaked in 2008, 2010 and 2011, and the figures were higher for those pre-refugee influx years than in 2015 and 2016. In addition, the reported rape figures were not higher in the Malmo municipality, compared with two other major urban municipalities in Sweden: the capital Stockholm and Gothenburg in the west. It is very hard to compare sex-related offences and rape across the world. Police procedures and legal definitions vary widely around the world, making an international comparison meaningless. The 2012 UN international rape rate comparison showed Sweden to have thehighest rate of rape in Europeand the second highest in the world, but the report did not contain data for a total of 63 countries that did not submit any statistics, including, for example, South Africa, where other earlier surveys indicated a very high rape rate. The most recent Eurostat data for the 28 EU countries also puts Sweden in the top spot. Butthe agency warns,externalthat comparisons between different countries should be avoided because of differences between their legal and criminal justice systems, recording practices, reporting rates, efficiencies of criminal justice organisations and types of offences included in the categories. There has also been a public debate in Sweden over the past two decades to raise awareness and encourage women to go to the police if they have been attacked. This has resulted in a higher report rate than in other countries in Europe.

"When RBS lost Â£24bn in 2008, my daughter was half way through junior school. She's now doing her A-levels and RBS is still losing billions. Next year she'll apply for university - next year RBS will lose another few billion. Watching RBS develop has not been a very rewarding experience - for anyone. Taxpayers have seen the Â£45bn they sank into the bank more than offset by Â£58bn of losses and counting. The RBS headcount has shrunk by 100,000 in that time, with thousands more yet to lose jobs as the bank shrinks further and branches close. If there has been a scandal going, RBS has been involved. Fines for PPI, Libor rigging, foreign exchange fixing, squeezing small businesses for profit, and selling risky mortgages have laid waste to any earnings the core UK bank has been making. It's not over. In terms of fines for past misconduct the worst is yet to come in the form of a whopping fine from US authorities for RBS's role in the subprime mortgage crisis. That should be settled this year but if RBS gets much change out of Â£10bn it will be considered a pretty good result. And yet... beneath all this wreckage is a UK-focused bank that lent Â£24bn into the UK economy and has been churning out a profit of about Â£1bn every three months. Sadly, that bank will have to wait till 2018 to see the light of day. No silver lining - yet So why has it taken RBS so much longer than others to heal itself? Lloyds and Barclays are both making a profit, the US banks at the epicentre of the 2008 financial earthquake are flying high while RBS shares need to double in value for the UK taxpayer to break even. A former senior Treasury official told the BBC: ""You have to remember that wherever something bad or unwise was happening, RBS was at the forefront. ""It took the biggest risks, was involved in every scandal, was the most aggressive, made the most absurd acquisition (Â£50bn for ABN Amro in the teeth of the crisis) and had the biggest balance sheet in the world."" That put it in the worst possible position to recover from the crisis. Which begs another question. Why wasn't the fix imposed in 2009 more radical? Some Â£45bn was pumped in for an 81% stake. In hindsight, that was nowhere near enough and the coalition government of 2010 should have done more to fix it after it had survived the initial crisis. Today's chief executive Ross McEwan agrees. He told the BBC: ""We should have recapitalised the banks much quicker like in the United States and then allow the conduct issues to come back when the banks were making money. ""In the UK, the banks didn't have sufficient capital and got hit by the conduct issues at the same time, and this bank (RBS) had that in spades."" But remember, the economic and political picture looked very different in 2010. Austerity was the name of the game and George Osborne could ill afford to be seen to be throwing more money at RBS, possibly paying to fully nationalise it, when he was making swingeing cuts elsewhere. Not only that but there were real hopes that RBS would make a profit in 2011 and the share price was on the way up. It looked like the government could get away without putting in any extra money. So it didn't. That turned out to be a very false dawn as the eurozone crisis hit and the full magnitude of past misconduct began to emerge. There was also a battle over what kind of bank RBS should try to be. The man heading the bank at the time, Stephen Hester, wanted to hang on to the investment banking bits in the hope that when the world returned to normal, the high profits usually associated with trading - helping companies raise money and advising them - would help the bank return to health. The Treasury disagreed and since it owned 80% of the bank, Stephen Hester was shown the door in 2013. Former Treasury officials acknowledge that at least two of his five years in charge was wasted in strategic wrangling with the government. We still care about this humbled giant because we still own so much of it and the prospect of the taxpayer getting its money back is still a very distant one. Compare that to Lloyds which has paid back nearly all the Â£20bn put in. As discussed, RBS was a much sicker bank than Lloyds - and failing to recognise that earlier led to another mistake. The government overpaid for its stake. Under enormous pressure, working all night, with the prospect of cash machines not working on a Monday morning, the government agreed to pay roughly 500p a share in today's money. The financial crisis led to drastic action by the government That was what each share was worth on paper at the time - or the so called ""book value"". A couple of weeks later, the US government paid half that for the shares it bought in US banks. That enabled the US government to sell off its stakes much earlier. Now, the prospect of selling at a big loss is an unattractive one for the government and the prospect of a bank predominantly owned by the government is an unattractive one for investors. They know that one day there will be a big seller of the shares. It's a stand-off that keeps the price stubbornly low. So what now? There is a core bank churning out profits, a billion pounds a quarter and today's announcement included the first confident prediction of bottom line profit we have seen from Ross McEwan Just not till 2018. There is still pain ahead but there is also light. Who knows, by the time my daughter leaves home, RBS may be back in the black.

"Anna Rowe had a whirlwind romance with Antony Ray after meeting him through the dating app Tinder. But their 14-month relationship came crashing down when she discovered his profile was a fake. His name was not Antony and he was not single. In fact, he was a married dad who had initially used photos of a Bollywood actor on his profile and had lured in other women too. ""He used me like a hotel with benefits under the disguise of a romantic, loving relationship that he knew I craved,"" says Anna. The practice of using a fake profile to start an online romance is known as ""catfishing"". Now Anna, 44, from Kent, haslaunched a petition,externalcalling for it to be made illegal. But how serious is catfishing and is it practical to make it a crime? Many dating apps and sites offer advice on how to spot fake profiles More than half of online dating users say they have come across a fake profile, according toconsumer group Which?,external While the number of people defrauded in the UK by online dating scamsreached a record high in 2016. There were 3,889 victims of so-called romance fraud last year, who handed over a record Â£39m. It has become so prevalent, that it led to the creation of reality TV show Catfish - which is dedicated to helping victims learn the true identity of their online romances. Currently catfishing is not illegal but elements of the activity could be covered by different parts of the law. If a victim hands over money, the ""catfish"" could be prosecuted for fraud. Someone using a fake profile to post offensive messages or doctored images designed to humiliate could also face criminal action. A review,externalof social media and the law by the House of Lords in 2014 concluded there was enough current legislation to cover crimes committed online. New guidance was also issuedby the CPS in October to help the police identify online crimes - including trolling and virtual mobbing. But Anna thinks the law needs to go further. Writing on her petition, she said: ""I did not or would not consent to have a sexual relationship with a married man, let alone a man who was actively having relations with multiple women simultaneously. ""His behaviour was definitely premeditated showing his intent to use women, yet the current law will not find his actions a criminal offence."" Tony Neate, chief executive of Get Safe Online, recognises the devastating impact catfishing can have on victims. ""It can ruin a life. I know there have been suicides because it's affected someone badly,"" he says. ""It can affect their mental stability and lead to depression and the victims feel they can't trust anyone again. ""I do think we need to look more wisely at this in relation to how it is tackled at the moment."" Mr Neate, a former police officer, says there should be a ""discussion"" about punishing the worst catfishing offenders. But he raises concerns about how practical a new law would be to implement. ""I really feel for that poor woman [Anna] but we have got to be realistic on how far we got and how the police would be able to enforce it,"" he says. ""Let's have the discussion because we can't have people being hurt and it's something we have got to look at."" Many dating websites offer users advice on how to spot a scammer and tips to avoid being taken in by a fake profile. (See ""Tips to avoid catfishes"", below) Popular dating site Match.com has a team which will remove unwanted accounts and check photos and personal ads. It also has a built-in screening system that can help identify suspicious accounts, remove them and prevent re-registration. Lovestruck has a verification service that can confirm members are single and professional by checking their profiles against their other social media sites. But the advice has not stopped many people being duped. Last month, university professor Judith Lathlean revealed how she wastricked out of Â£140,000by a gang using a fake profile. Ife Ojo, 31, and Olusegun Agbaje, 43,were jailed in 2016after conning a woman out of Â£1.6m using a fictional character. But Andrew McClelland, chief executive of the Online Dating Association - the trade body for the industry - believes legislating against catfishing would be ""difficult"". He said there could be genuine reasons why someone might not use their real details online - for example if they had been in an abusive relationship and did not want their ex-partner to find them. Data protection and freedom of expression would also be an issue when it came to enforcing such a law, he added. ""The biggest problem this faces is how do you legislate against someone lying?"" says Mr McClelland. Ask lots of questions. Do not simply rely on the information given in someone's online profile Search. Use the internet as a tool to search elsewhere for information and the social media accounts of the person you are chatting to Speak to friends and family. Be guided by others on whether the profile appears genuine Chat on the dating site. Avoid giving out your personal number or email before really getting to know someone Never give out money.

"The claim:The Conservatives' win in Copeland is the first time since 1878 that a governing party has made a comparable gain in a by-election Reality Check verdict:A governing party gaining a seat at a by-election is an extremely unusual event. It has happened since 1878, but you could argue that those occasions had unusual circumstances that meant they were not comparable. Governing parties rarely look forward to by-elections, which tend to have relatively low turnouts and are seen as having less at stake than general elections. It is very rare for the governing party to pick up votes from the opposition. It is even rarer for them to gain a seat, as the Conservatives did when Trudy Harrison won Copeland in Cumbria. The constituency and its predecessor, Whitehaven, had returned Labour MPs since 1935. The Conservatives say this is ""the first time since 1878 that a governing party has made a comparable gain in a by-election"". The party was referring to the Worcester by-election 139 years ago, when they won the seat from the Liberals. Copeland is certainly not the first instance of a ruling party winning a seat at a by-election since that year, when Benjamin Disraeli was prime minister and women could not vote. That has happened several times since, but in unusual circumstances which are perhaps not ""comparable"" to Copeland. For example, in 1982 at the height of the Falklands War, a Labour MP defected to the Social Democratic Party in the south London seat of Mitcham and Morden. This split the left-of-centre vote, meaning the Conservative candidate won despite getting a smaller share of the vote than at the previous general election. A Conservative/National Liberal candidate won the Yorkshire seat of Brighouse and Spenborough from Labour in 1960, but that seat was very marginal. Labour won by just 47 votes at the 1959 general election, and lost by 666 a year later. In 1953, the governing Conservatives took Sunderland South from Labour, but this was also very close and the Conservative vote share fell slightly because a Liberal picked up some votes. Copeland was not nearly as tight as these examples, and the Conservatives increased their vote share substantially. Labour's Jamie Reed won the seat by more than 2,000 votes in 2015, while the new Conservative MP took it by a similar margin. The swing was 6.7%, a stunning result for a governing party. There are various other examples of government by-election gains since 1878. However, as Matt Singh of NumbrCrunchr Politics points out, these are ""mostly the product of freakish circumstancesâ¦ none of which apply to Copeland"".

"It may seem simple - we like chocolate because it tastes nice. But there's more to it than that - and it relates to a fat/carbohydrates balance that is set right from the very beginning of our lives. I love chocolate and once I start on a bar I can't stop until it's all gone. One square, or even a few, are never enough. My family know that if they bring chocolate into our house they will have to hide it. So what is it about the food that so many of us find irresistible? And what characteristics does chocolate share with other foods that we simply can't say, ""no"" to? As part of a new series on the science of food, botanist James Wong and I went looking for answers. Chocolate is made from cocoa beans, which have been grown and consumed in the Americas for thousands of years. The Maya and the Aztecs made a drink out of cocoa beans called xocolatl, which means ""bitter water."" Can people learn to curb their chocolate cravings? That's because in its raw form cocoa beans are intensely bitter. To get at the beans you first have to crack open the thick husk of the cocoa pod, releasing a pulp that has an intense tropical flavour that's halfway between lemonade and a custard apple. Known as baba de cacao, it's sweet, acidic and very sticky. The beans and pulp are then sweated and allowed to ferment for several days before being dried and roasted. Roasting releases a range of chemical compounds including 3-methylbutanoic acid, which on its own has a sweaty rancid odour, and dimethyl trisulfide, the smell of over-cooked cabbage. The combination of these and other aroma molecules creates a unique chemical signature that our brains love. But the rich, chocolaty smells and the happy memories of youth that those smells provoke, are just part of chocolate's attraction. Chocolate contains a number of interesting psychoactive chemicals. These include anandamide, a neurotransmitter whose name comes from the Sanskrit - ""ananda"", meaning ""joy, bliss, delight"". Anandamides stimulate the brain in much the same way that cannabis does. It also contains tyramine and phenylethylamine, both of which have similar effects to amphetamines. Finally, if you look hard enough, you will find small traces of theobromine and caffeine, both of which are well-known stimulants. For a while, some food scientists got very excited about the discovery but to be honest, although chocolate contains these substances, we now know they are only there in trace amounts. Your brain is not going to get much of a chemical rush from eating a few squares. None the less, they may play a small part in seducing our senses. So what else does chocolate have going for it? Well, it also has a creamy viscosity. When you take it out of its wrapper and put a bit in your mouth without biting, you will notice that it rapidly melts on your tongue, leaving a lingering sensation of smoothness. Special touch receptors on our tongues detect this textural change, which then stimulates feelings of pleasure. But the thing that really transformed the cocoa from a bitter and watery drink into the snack we adore today was the addition of sugar and fat. The addition of just the right amount of each is crucial to our enjoyment of chocolate. Look at the side of a packet of milk chocolate and you will see that it is normally contains around 20-25% fat and 40-50% sugar. In nature such high levels of sugar and fat are rarely found, or at least not together. You can get lots of natural sugars from fruits and roots, and there is plenty of fat to be found in nuts or a tasty chunk of salmon, but one of the few places where you will find both together is in milk. Human breast milk is particularly rich in natural sugars, mainly lactose. Roughly 4% of human breast milk is fat, while about 8% is made up of sugars. Formula milk, which is fed to babies, contains a similar ratio of fats to sugars. This ratio, 1g of fat to 2g of sugars, is the same ratio of fats to sugars that you find in milk chocolate. And in biscuits, doughnuts, ice cream. In fact this particular ratio is reflected in many of the foods that we find hard to resist. So why do I love chocolate? For a whole host of reasons. But it may also be that I, and chocoholics like me, are trying to recapture the taste and sense of closeness we got from the first food we ever sampled; human breast milk.

"Jasvinder (R) aged 15, with her sister Robina Jasvinder Sanghera was locked in a room by her parents when she was 16, when she refused to marry the man they had chosen for her. Here she describes how she escaped with the help of a secret boyfriend - but lost all contact with her family as a result. Growing up we had no freedom whatsoever. Everything was watched, monitored and controlled. We understood that we had to be careful how we behaved so as not to shame the family. I'm one of seven sisters and there's only one younger than me so I'd watched my sisters having to be married at very young ages - as young as 15. They would disappear to become a wife and go to India, come back, not go back to school and then go into these marriages and be physically and psychologically abused. And my impression of marriage was that this is what happens to you - you get married, you get beaten up, and then you're told to stay there. My parents were Sikh and Sikhism was born on the foundation of compassion and equality of men and women, and yet here we have women who were treated very differently. My brother was allowed total freedom of expression. He was also allowed to choose who he wanted to marry. But the women were treated differently and that was reinforced within the communities. It's gone unchallenged and it's deeply ingrained. I don't think I was smarter. I just don't know what it was within me. My mother used to say: ""You were born upside down, you were different from birth."" Maybe she helped me out by saying that, because it made me question a number of things, and then when I was shown the photograph of this man, as a 14-year-old, knowing that I'd been promised to him from the age of eight and being expected to contemplate marriage, I looked at this picture thinking: ""Well he's shorter than me and he's very much older than me and I don't want this."" And it was as simple as that. But within our family dynamic we were taught to be silent. Saying no to the marriage meant my family took me out of education and they held me a prisoner in my own home. I was 15 and I was locked in this room and literally I was not allowed to leave the room until I agreed to the marriage. It was padlocked on the outside and I had to knock on the door to go the toilet and they brought food to the door. My mother was the very person who enforced the rules. People don't think of women as the gatekeepers to an honour system. So in the end I said yes, purely to plan my escape. And it was as simple as that, because then I had freedom of movement. The only friends we were allowed had to be from an Indian community as well. And my best friend, who was Indian, it was her brother who helped me in the end. He became my secret boyfriend. He saved some money and said, ""I want to be with you and I'll help you to escape."" He would come to the house at night and stand in the garden and we would secretly mouth things to each other through the window. One day he dressed up as a woman and went into a shoe shop and pretended he was shopping. He handed me a note which said, ""I'll be at the back of the house at this time - look out of the window."" So I did, and he mouthed for me to pack my wardrobe and I lowered two cases down using sheets tied together, and flushed the toilets so my mother wouldn't hear. And then one day I was at home with my dad, who was at home because he worked nights, and the front door was open, and I just ran out. I ran all the way, a good three-and-a-half miles, to where my boyfriend worked and hid behind a wall and waited for him to come out. He went and got my cases and then picked me up in his Ford Escort and got me to close my eyes and put my finger on a map, and it landed on Newcastle. Jasvinder, now 51, helps others who are in the same situation as she was I sat in the footwell of the car all the way so no-one would see me and then when I saw the Tyne bridge I was absolutely amazed by it because I had never been anywhere outside Derby. My parents reported me missing to the police and it was the police officer who told me I had to ring home to let them know I was safe and well. My mother answered the phone and I said: ""Mom, it's me. You know, I want to come home but I don't want to marry that stranger."" Her response has stayed with me for the rest of my life. She said: ""You either come back and marry who we say, or from this day forward you are now dead in our eyes."" It was only later on when things settled down that I begin to think, ""I've done it but where's my family? I want my family."" I was missing them terribly. You feel like a dead person walking. My boyfriend used to drive me to my hometown at 3am just so I could see my dad walking home from the foundry. What changed how I felt was the death of my sister, Robina. She was taken out of school at 15 for nine months, married to a man in India, and then came back and put in the same year as me and nobody questioned this at all. But he treated her terribly and when her son was around six months old she severed the relationship. She then married for love and my parents agreed to it because he was Indian - Sikh and from the same caste as us. She again suffered domestic abuse but my parents made it clear that because she had chosen him she had a duty, doubly, to make it work. She went to see a local community leader - they have a lot of power, my parents would have seen his word as the word of God - and he told her: ""You need to think of your husband's temper like a pan of milk - when it boils it rises to the top and a woman's role is to blow it to cool it down."" When she was 25 she set herself on fire and she died.  When she was - I say - driven to commit suicide, that was the turning point for me.

I've learned to live my life with no expectations of family whatsoever. I've never had a birthday card in 35 years and neither have my children. For my children it's a total blank on their mother's side when it comes to family. I've got nephews and nieces that I'll never meet because all of my siblings sided with my parents. I have actually stipulated in my will that I do not want any of my estranged family to be at my funeral because I know the hypocrisy that exists within them. They will want to show their face, but if they couldn't show it when I was alive, I'm not going to give them that privilege when I'm gone. I have three children - Natasha who's 31, Anna who's 22 and Jordan who's 19. You almost live vicariously through your children because you want them to have everything you never had. My daughter married an Asian man and I was worried - I didn't want this family to take it out on her that her mother was disowned and had run away from home. But thankfully for me my fears were completely unfounded because here was an Indian family that did the exact opposite of what my family did. Starting a charity, Karma Nirvana, in 1993 from my kitchen table allowed me for the first time to start talking about my personal experiences and what had happened to my sister. My family wanted us to never speak about Robina again. Jasvinder with her grandson Sometimes at Christmas my children would meet these different women at the dinner table - survivors disowned by their family - and they had no idea who would be the next person at our table, but they understood why. The charity will be 25 years old next year. We have helped make forced marriage a criminal offence, we have a helpline funded by the government which takes 750 calls a month - 58% of callers are victims and the others are professionals calling about a victim. We do risk assessments, offer refuge and help plan escapes. We still don't have enough responses from professionals and we've got to try to increase the reporting, but we're getting there. This is abuse, not part of culture where we make excuses - cultural acceptance does not mean accepting the unacceptable. Abuse is abuse. I'm a grandmother now - my daughter's expecting her second child in March. And you know when I look at them I think to myself, 'they're never going to inherit that legacy of abuse because of that decision I made when I was 16.' And that really makes me feel a lot stronger.

"Labour's failure to retain Copeland for the first time since the seat was created highlights three interlinked problems for the party. Themost seriousis trust - or lack of it. Labour insiders tell me they ""got Jeremy to the right place on nuclear"" - by not just committing to retaining the industry but also no longer opposing new capacity. Yet very few voters here in Whitehaven that I spoke to this morning believed him - and some were still unaware of his position. Thesecond problem, though, is with Jeremy Corbyn himself. Even some left-wing MPs tell me his leadership came up completely unprompted on the doorsteps. So messenger and message aren't fully trusted. Thethird problem, though, is that while Labour is in opposition nationally - and Jeremy Corbyn says he will take on the political establishment - in areas which the party has controlled for decades it is seen as part of that establishment. Voter after voter said to me ""look at the town centre here"" [pictured above] with pound shops, charity shops and bookies. ""Labour has done nothing for this area, we need new blood,"" said one. ""I am 80 and Labour has been in charge all that time - we need a change,"" said another.

"These men are the turnover kings at the ruck. Rugby commentators call them jackals, but what they really mean is hyenas - aggressive beasts with huge upper bodies who spend half their lives buried up to their waists in the bloody carcass of the ruck, never happier than when ripping the ball from the grasp of a downed opponent. Historically the hyenas have been open-side flankers - think outstanding Australian David Pocock, who played most of his career in the seven shirt before moving to number eight for the Wallabies. But as the game has developed apace, winning turnovers is a skill that is increasingly being distributed throughout the team. The former Wales captain has been a man revitalised after shedding the responsibility of leading the team. Packing down on the blind-side in this Six Nations he has won three turnovers in the two games so far and is a constant menace at every ruck. Warburton learned from former Wales flanker Martyn Williams, who was a master of the art, and has significantly bulked up over the years to be able to take the inevitable pounding players face when attempting to force turnovers. This video can not be played Six Nations 2017: Sam Warburton - hyena The Ireland blind-side is having a superb Six Nations both with ball in hand and in defence. A squat 6ft 1in - he packs getting on for 18 stone into that comparatively compact frame - getting over the ball at the ruck is just another of the skills he executes very well. Stander is averaging a turnover a game over the past two Six Nations and is always looking to give his team an advantage - he views this as another area for him to exploit in order to wrest back momentum for the men in green. Back in the day turnover specialists were rarely towering next-level athletes with the height and heft to play second row - but this is 2017 after all and Saracens forward Itoje is enjoying redefining the possibilities, having shifted from lock to blind-side for England this season. At 6ft 5in and with a correspondingly higher centre of gravity, he should be - comparatively - easy to shift off the ball, but not only is he outstandingly quick to get in position at a ruck, once he is there he is impossible to blast out of the way. Last season he was borderline for me at the breakdown as, rather than support his own weight legally, he flirted with illegality by putting his elbows on the ground to support himself, and although he has improved a little bit this season he still pushes his luck and can improve.

The 30-year-old flanker epitomises the 'farm strength' that those raised on a farm accrue as they grow up, and the years spent chucking bales around are all too evident when he get his mitts on the ball and refuses to budge. Remember what I said about the game changing? Towards the end of his career former Ireland centre Brian O'Driscoll had become so adept at the breakdown he was like another open-side playing in midfield when it came to winning turnovers and penalties at the ruck. England winger Nowell is a similar size and build, and that stocky power means he was equal top of the turnover charts with seven in last year's Six Nations.

"Ministers in England have said they are looking for a solution to the problems in social care. That has raised hope that next month's Budget could include measures to tackle what many describe as the crisis facing the sector. But what exactly has gone wrong? And who's affected? Social care - organised by councils - is a broad term that covers everything from children's social workers and fostering through to services for disabled adults and the care provided to people in their old age. But some have been affected more than others. Over the years, more and more has been spent on services. The growth in the population, the fact people are living longer and those with disabilities are more likely to survive to an older age are all contributory factors. But this upward trend in funding has tailed off in England over the past decade. You do not have to look far to find the cause of this. Central government funding for councils was cut by a third during the last parliament. Councils have tried to protect social care. The proportion of their budget being spent on these services has increased over the years and now well over half of their spending goes on care services. But that, of course, has meant deeper cuts elsewhere - in libraries, leisure centres and refuse collection. What's more, if you delve further into the figures you can see even this level of spending has been maintained only with a little help from elsewhere. A third of last year's Â£24bn budget went on children. That left just over Â£16bn for adults. But nearly Â£2bn of that was thanks to a transfer of money from the NHS into care services, ordered by the government. This is a recognition that what happens in social care has a direct impact on the NHS. If people are not given the support they need in the community, they can end up in hospital. And if it's not available when they are then ready to be discharged, they can end up stranded on wards - doctors will release frail patients only if they know there are care packages in place in the community. The number of delays of this sort has nearly doubled in five years. Not all of these delays are down to a lack of social care, but it is the fastest growing reason for them. And when beds are occupied by patients who cannot leave, it gets more difficult to admit new patients. That's one of the reasons why we have heard so much about lengthening trolley waits and worsening waiting times in accident and emergency departments in recent months. This situation is understandable. To make savings, councils have started to ration care, particularly to the elderly, rather than younger adults with disabilities. The number of older people getting care from councils has fallen by over a quarter between 2008-09 and 2013-14. We don't know what has happened since 2014, as the way the data is collected has changed. Although, it's pretty clear there hasn't been a huge turnaround. Councils agreed to help less than half the older people who approached them for help last year. What about elsewhere in the UK? Whereas all adult council care in England is means-tested - those with assets of over Â£23,250 pay the full costs of their care - Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have slightly different systems. In Wales, the cost of help in the home for daily tasks such as washing and dressing is capped at Â£60 a week, in Northern Ireland it is provided free to the over-75s, and in Scotland personal care is free whether the individual is in their own home or a care home. Many argue these systems are more generous. That may be so. But all have had to ration services in recent years by restricting access to only the people with the most severe needs. How the care system works across the UK The alternative options The result of this is that people make their own arrangements. Four in 10 people in care homes pay for themselves. Others rely on family and friends to look after them. But growing numbers are being left to struggle on with no or little help. The charity Age UK has been charting this. It estimates the number of those falling into this group hasrisen by nearly 50% since 2010, to 1.2 million. These are people who have pretty substantial needs. They cannot wash or dress themselves. They may struggle to go to the toilet. The stories they tell are heart-breaking. But it's not just individuals who have tales of woe. The companies providing the services - councils tend not to run them in-house - have started voicing concerns. They report the prices councils are paying are being squeezed so much that they are now making a loss in some areas from local authority work. The UK Home Care Association has calculated the cost of helping people in their own home is Â£16.70 an hour, but councils across the UK pay over Â£2 less than this on average. Meanwhile, analysts LaingBuisson have calculated that the fees being paid by councils for a care home place are Â£100 a week less than the true cost. It means the fees for those who pay for themselves are rising to offset the losses from local authority funded residents. In effect, self-funders are subsidising the state sector. Is this fair? LaingBuisson thinks not. It has called the trend a ""hidden care tax"". And these bills can rack up. An estimated one in 10 people faces care costs in excess of Â£100,000 after the age of 65. You stay in your own home while getting help with everyday tasks such as washing, dressing and eating. average amount of care provided per week, by your council average paid per hour by your council, 2014-15 average paid per hour in your region if you pay for your own care, 2016 You live in a care home that provides round-the-clock support with everyday tasks.      TBCpay for their own care  You live in a care home which provides round-the-clock support for everyday tasks and nursing care. Depending on your medical needs, the NHS may contribute to your costs.      TBCpay for their own care    Savings, investments and income are assessed, along with the value of your home - unless you or a close relative live there.  There is concern this is destabilising the sector. The Care Quality Commissionraised the alarmabout this last autumn. The risk is care companies start to focus on areas where there are more of the high-paying self-funders. That could create a shortage of places in some areas of the country, as self-funders are more likely to be found in the south of England. The map of the UK shows self-funders are more likely to be found in care homes in the South East of England There has not been a big exodus yet, although the number of care and nursing homes operating in England has fallen by over 1,500 in the past six years to 16,500. So what does the future hold? The population is growing older. And their needs are getting ever more complex. At the age of 65, one in six people has trouble with daily living - washing, dressing or eating. By 85, half do. Ministers have already taken steps to relieve the pressure. The health service and councils are being encouraged to work together on joint projects. They have also given councils permission to increase council tax to pay for social care. But there is a limit to how much this will bring in. This year, councils have been allowed to increase household bills by 2%. Most have done so, but it is raising less than 3% of what councils plan to spend on adult social care from their own funds, once NHS money has been deducted. By 2020, the Local Government Association believes, there will be a shortfall of Â£2.6bn in funding. It wants more substantial reform - and many in academia, in the health service and in the charity sector agree. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said this is on the government's agenda. But many have tried to find a solution before and failed. The social care system was created in 1948 and has hardly changed since. When Tony Blair came to power, he set up a Royal Commission. But nothing came of it. Under Gordon Brown's premiership, the idea of a universal care system - where everybody would get a basic level of care - was floated, before it fell victim to the Tories' 2010 ""death tax"" election campaign warning. The coalition government proposed a cap on care costs. That was meant to be introduced last year, but has been pushed back until 2020. Many now doubt it will ever see the light of day.

"Beijing realised the importance of cultivating relations with Mr Trump's family It's been a month and adjusting to Donald Trump as US president has been an enormous challenge for China, as for many around the world. He arrived in office full of provocative and unpredictable messaging on China, but Beijing needs American goodwill, markets and technology to build what it calls its ""comprehensive strength"". That a functioning relationship with the United States is a core strategic interest for China may seem obvious, but it bears repeating. For the time being at least Mr Trump seems to have stopped insulting and threatening China - despite repeating on Friday that he thought they were ""grand champions at manipulation of currency"".  Key players in Mr Trump's administration are now making nice on the telephone. So what were China's tactics and how did it make them work? Beijing quickly understood that President Trump would not run an administration like that of his predecessors. Mr Trump is an elephant in a China shop for the makers of this float in Germany It noted the importance of family. Before Mr Trump himself or senior members of his administration talked to key players in China, and while China's internet was full of mutterings about why Mr Trump had delivered no goodwill message over Chinese New Year, Beijing's man in Washington, Ambassador Cui Tiankai, deftly reached out to President Trump's daughter Ivanka. She bridged the official divide with a well-publicised appearance at a Chinese New Year function at Beijing's embassy in Washington. Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner also has lines of communication to Beijing through his Chinese business partners. And President Trump's other daughter Tiffany made a point of sitting in the front row of theNew York Fashion Week show of Chinese designer Taoray Wang. Ms Wang and Tiffany Trump have praised each another To bolster this network of unofficial connections, China's best known private entrepreneur Jack Ma, met Mr Trump and promised to create a million American jobs through selling US products on his Alibaba e-commerce platforms. Even private companies in China have Communist Party cells and are required to do Beijing's bidding when it comes to matters of strategic national interest. Jack Ma was on mission and on message. As were the 100 firms which sponsored a Chinese New Year greeting message to Mr Trump on a Times Square billboard in New York. Mr Trump's controversial business empire has multiple trademark cases languishing in Chinese courts. Beijing makes no bones about the fact that its courts are answerable to the Communist Party. It was an easy act of goodwill to speed through a trademark registration for construction services that Mr Trump had sought for a decade, especially as the move was consistent with a wider move against businesses which jump on the names of public figures as trademarks. After years of wrangling, Chinese courts awarded Mr Trump valuable commercial rights to his name In the Trump case, the necessary moves were made quickly and without fanfare last autumn, and the case closed with a victory for Mr Trump last week. China is often quick to thunder against hostile foreign forces and accuse foreign governments of hurting the feelings of the Chinese people. Donald Trump offered provocations which would bring down retribution on a lesser foe. Throughout his presidential campaign he insulted and threatened China, calling it a thief and a rapist on trade and challenging its dearest held positions on Taiwan. Officials also warned of a tougher approach in the South China Sea. But throughout, Beijing has shown iron self-discipline and restraint. China claims almost all the South China Sea, a position the US rejects China's official news agency Xinhua noted of Mr Trump: ""He will soon realise that leaders of the two countries must use more mature and effective ways to communicate than trading barbs via Twitter."" Since Mr Trump's election in November, China's media has been on a tight leash, ordered to use Xinhua's bland wording in its coverage of the US. Unlike other world leaders, President Xi was conspicuously slow to pick up the phone. Observing the fallout of President Trump's calls with Mexican and Australian leaders, Beijing was determined to avoid the risk of an undiplomatic incident. By hanging back till the administration's ""grown ups"" like Defence Secretary James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson were in the room (figuratively and in some cases literally) China ensured it got the script it wanted. The two leaders did not speak until long after many other leaders had called Mr Trump When the phone call between President Trump and President Xi finally took place, Beijing won a newUS commitment to the cherished One China policyand a dignified encounter. President Xi emerged with his reputation as a firm and patient actor enhanced. President Trump had talked of staking out a new position on Taiwan - but stepped back. Since that call, the lines between Beijing and Washington DC have been humming. Newly confirmed US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has talked to several key Chinese players on economic policy. Mr Tillerson has met his opposite number, Wang Yi, and senior diplomat Yang Jiechi. Beijing has begun to talk of implementing ""the consensus reached between President Xi and President Trump"" - a relationship featuring ""no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win co-operation"". In practical terms, China knows that win-win will mean delivering concessions and co-operation wherever it can. And it has already shown willing in one  area of US concern, with the suspension of coal imports from North Korea. By suspending coal imports, China has put pressure on Pyongyang Of course, Beijing said this decision was a technicality based on quotas. But given the provocation of Pyongyang's latest missile test and growing American concern over the advances of North Korea's nuclear programme, this is much more likely to have resulted from a careful Chinese calculation of what carrots it could flourish in the direction of Donald Trump and what sticks it could brandish at Kim Jong-un. On the global stage, President Xi has usefully presented himself as not Donald Trump. At the World Economic Forum in Davos, he famously championed globalisation and free trade. Of course, China is not a paragon of free trade, with a highly protected domestic market. But in a world of ""alternative facts"", the rhetoric is powerful. On the regional stage, China is promoting itself as a leader on multilateral trade, assiduously taking advantage of the US withdrawal from theTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal, which was intended to underpin American economic leadership in Asia Pacific. Although the TPP excluded China, it had opponents across the political spectrum in the US And on the Chinese political stage, Mr Trump is indirectly doing Mr Xi's work for him. The Communist Party sometimes struggles to defend one-party authoritarian rule against the glamour and appeal of a free, open and democratic America. But the scenes of American street protest and visa chaos from President Trump's first month in office are a propaganda gift. An American president joining China's state-controlled media in railing against what he calls fake, failing, dishonest US journalists is a second propaganda gift. Beijing has made extensive use of both for its political purposes at home. Beijing will be well satisfied with its performance so far. But this is a multi-player multi-dimensional game with many dangers and traps over the long term. It has done a good job of neutralising the risks and exploiting the opportunities of President Trump's first month in office. Round One to China. There are innumerable rounds still to come.

"Jasvinder (R) aged 15, with her sister Robina Jasvinder Sanghera was locked in a room by her parents when she was 16, when she refused to marry the man they had chosen for her. Here she describes how she escaped with the help of a secret boyfriend - but lost all contact with her family as a result. Growing up we had no freedom whatsoever. Everything was watched, monitored and controlled. We understood that we had to be careful how we behaved so as not to shame the family. I'm one of seven sisters and there's only one younger than me so I'd watched my sisters having to be married at very young ages - as young as 15. They would disappear to become a wife and go to India, come back, not go back to school and then go into these marriages and be physically and psychologically abused. And my impression of marriage was that this is what happens to you - you get married, you get beaten up, and then you're told to stay there. My parents were Sikh and Sikhism was born on the foundation of compassion and equality of men and women, and yet here we have women who were treated very differently. My brother was allowed total freedom of expression. He was also allowed to choose who he wanted to marry. But the women were treated differently and that was reinforced within the communities. It's gone unchallenged and it's deeply ingrained. I don't think I was smarter. I just don't know what it was within me. My mother used to say: ""You were born upside down, you were different from birth."" Maybe she helped me out by saying that, because it made me question a number of things, and then when I was shown the photograph of this man, as a 14-year-old, knowing that I'd been promised to him from the age of eight and being expected to contemplate marriage, I looked at this picture thinking: ""Well he's shorter than me and he's very much older than me and I don't want this."" And it was as simple as that. But within our family dynamic we were taught to be silent. Saying no to the marriage meant my family took me out of education and they held me a prisoner in my own home. I was 15 and I was locked in this room and literally I was not allowed to leave the room until I agreed to the marriage. It was padlocked on the outside and I had to knock on the door to go the toilet and they brought food to the door. My mother was the very person who enforced the rules. People don't think of women as the gatekeepers to an honour system. So in the end I said yes, purely to plan my escape. And it was as simple as that, because then I had freedom of movement. The only friends we were allowed had to be from an Indian community as well. And my best friend, who was Indian, it was her brother who helped me in the end. He became my secret boyfriend. He saved some money and said, ""I want to be with you and I'll help you to escape."" He would come to the house at night and stand in the garden and we would secretly mouth things to each other through the window. One day he dressed up as a woman and went into a shoe shop and pretended he was shopping. He handed me a note which said, ""I'll be at the back of the house at this time - look out of the window."" So I did, and he mouthed for me to pack my wardrobe and I lowered two cases down using sheets tied together, and flushed the toilets so my mother wouldn't hear. And then one day I was at home with my dad, who was at home because he worked nights, and the front door was open, and I just ran out. I ran all the way, a good three-and-a-half miles, to where my boyfriend worked and hid behind a wall and waited for him to come out. He went and got my cases and then picked me up in his Ford Escort and got me to close my eyes and put my finger on a map, and it landed on Newcastle. Jasvinder, now 51, helps others who are in the same situation as she was I sat in the footwell of the car all the way so no-one would see me and then when I saw the Tyne bridge I was absolutely amazed by it because I had never been anywhere outside Derby. My parents reported me missing to the police and it was the police officer who told me I had to ring home to let them know I was safe and well. My mother answered the phone and I said: ""Mom, it's me. You know, I want to come home but I don't want to marry that stranger."" Her response has stayed with me for the rest of my life. She said: ""You either come back and marry who we say, or from this day forward you are now dead in our eyes."" It was only later on when things settled down that I begin to think, ""I've done it but where's my family? I want my family."" I was missing them terribly. You feel like a dead person walking. My boyfriend used to drive me to my hometown at 3am just so I could see my dad walking home from the foundry. What changed how I felt was the death of my sister, Robina. She was taken out of school at 15 for nine months, married to a man in India, and then came back and put in the same year as me and nobody questioned this at all. But he treated her terribly and when her son was around six months old she severed the relationship. She then married for love and my parents agreed to it because he was Indian - Sikh and from the same caste as us. She again suffered domestic abuse but my parents made it clear that because she had chosen him she had a duty, doubly, to make it work. She went to see a local community leader - they have a lot of power, my parents would have seen his word as the word of God - and he told her: ""You need to think of your husband's temper like a pan of milk - when it boils it rises to the top and a woman's role is to blow it to cool it down."" When she was 25 she set herself on fire and she died.  When she was - I say - driven to commit suicide, that was the turning point for me.

I've learned to live my life with no expectations of family whatsoever. I've never had a birthday card in 35 years and neither have my children. For my children it's a total blank on their mother's side when it comes to family. I've got nephews and nieces that I'll never meet because all of my siblings sided with my parents. I have actually stipulated in my will that I do not want any of my estranged family to be at my funeral because I know the hypocrisy that exists within them. They will want to show their face, but if they couldn't show it when I was alive, I'm not going to give them that privilege when I'm gone. I have three children - Natasha who's 31, Anna who's 22 and Jordan who's 19. You almost live vicariously through your children because you want them to have everything you never had. My daughter married an Asian man and I was worried - I didn't want this family to take it out on her that her mother was disowned and had run away from home. But thankfully for me my fears were completely unfounded because here was an Indian family that did the exact opposite of what my family did. Starting a charity, Karma Nirvana, in 1993 from my kitchen table allowed me for the first time to start talking about my personal experiences and what had happened to my sister. My family wanted us to never speak about Robina again. Jasvinder with her grandson Sometimes at Christmas my children would meet these different women at the dinner table - survivors disowned by their family - and they had no idea who would be the next person at our table, but they understood why. The charity will be 25 years old next year. We have helped make forced marriage a criminal offence, we have a helpline funded by the government which takes 750 calls a month - 58% of callers are victims and the others are professionals calling about a victim. We do risk assessments, offer refuge and help plan escapes. We still don't have enough responses from professionals and we've got to try to increase the reporting, but we're getting there. This is abuse, not part of culture where we make excuses - cultural acceptance does not mean accepting the unacceptable. Abuse is abuse. I'm a grandmother now - my daughter's expecting her second child in March. And you know when I look at them I think to myself, 'they're never going to inherit that legacy of abuse because of that decision I made when I was 16.' And that really makes me feel a lot stronger.

"This video can not be played CCTV footage appears to show the moment Kim Jong-nam is attacked Malaysian authorities have identified the substance that killed Kim Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpur airport as VX, which is classified as a weapon of mass destruction. Bruce Bennett, a defence expert with the Rand Corporation, dissects how this could have happened. VX is an extraordinarily potent chemical weapon.  About 0.01g - less than a drop - on the skin can kill. The chemical goes through the skin and disrupts the nerve system. It is an oil-like substance; it would normally not mix well with water, which raises questions about how it was applied on Mr Kim without killing those who carried out the mission. This is the first time VX has been used in such a way, so there are plenty of imponderables. The CCTV footage and police statements do not lay out the full sequence of events. Two women appear to assault him, at least one with a cloth  wiping his face. Molecular model of VX nerve agent shows atoms represented as spheres: Carbon (grey), hydrogen (white), nitrogen (blue) oxygen (red), phosphorous (orange) and sulphur (yellow) Malaysian investigators said the two women coated their hands with the liquid toxin and wiped Kim's face afterwards. But if that were the case, they would have died immediately. So if a liquid was sprayed or wiped on Kim Jong-nam it is likely that it did not contain VX and that would help to explain why the women seen accosting him did not die despite apparently getting the liquid on their hands. In that case it appears likely that a very small quantity of VX - possibly just a drop - was actually on the cloths used by the women to wipe his face. We do know now that one of the women involved has been vomiting since the attack. The perpetrators would have really wanted to practise with this to make sure the drop touched Kim, and that they did not touch the drop.  And that is what we are told happened. Police say that they are believed to have repeated this move in shopping malls ahead of the actual event on 13 February. Kim Jong-nam 'killed by VX nerve agent' Main players in mystery death Who was Kim Jong-nam? As the drop absorbed into Kim Jong-nam's skin, it would have started affecting his nerve system, causing symptoms that take effect within minutes. The subject will experience coughing, chest tightness, blurry vision, fatigue and eventually seizures  as the nervous system is shut down. He is likely to have died within minutes. Kim, seen here in a file photo, reportedly died before he could be taken to hospital It appears that the North Korean government may have felt that they could claim the body and avoid an autopsy, thus denying the outside world knowledge of what had happened. Malaysia has proven diligent in insisting on an autopsy and clearly North Korea failed in its efforts to prevent this. This has led to a row between the two nations, Malaysia being one of few that had diplomatic relations with the North. So how could the VX have actually got into Malaysia? A woman wearing a white top was thought to have attacked Mr Kim Because the quantity required to kill is extraordinarily small, it could have been smuggled into Malaysia in a cartridge in a pen or some such thing.  The security forces would have had no idea it was being smuggled in unless someone had tipped them off, which clearly did not happen. It is unlikely that VX was made in Malaysia - it is not something that can be made safely in a kitchen sink. Of course, we don't know for sure that North Korea made it and it is also possible they may have purchased it from a third country. There is both a US and a Soviet/Russian version of VX and it will be interesting to see which version was eventually used. What led to Kim's demise? North Korea's history of foreign assassinations It would take sophisticated laboratory analysis to tell them apart, which may already have been done. VX is extremely stable - like oil, it does not evaporate quickly. That made the VX safe on a cloth or some other surface until it touched human skin. VX, seen here in a container held by a US Army chemical school instructor, is a clear amber-coloured and oily liquid But this use of VX, unheard of previously, is a serious violation of international standards. The fact that it was used in a foreign country means that Malaysia and other countries will be both appalled and furious. Of key importance will be how China responds.  After all, China was reportedly providing protection for Kim Jong-nam. If North Korea seriously violated international law, China should presumably do more than just cut off imports of North Korean coal. China has the opportunity to punish North Korea and thereby hopefully deter it from carrying out this kind of attack again. A broader Chinese trade embargo would hurt North Korea seriously.

But thankfully for me my fears were completely unfounded because here was an Indian family that did the exact opposite of what my family did. Starting a charity, Karma Nirvana, in 1993 from my kitchen table allowed me for the first time to start talking about my personal experiences and what had happened to my sister. My family wanted us to never speak about Robina again. Jasvinder with her grandson Sometimes at Christmas my children would meet these different women at the dinner table - survivors disowned by their family - and they had no idea who would be the next person at our table, but they understood why. The charity will be 25 years old next year. We have helped make forced marriage a criminal offence, we have a helpline funded by the government which takes 750 calls a month - 58% of callers are victims and the others are professionals calling about a victim. We do risk assessments, offer refuge and help plan escapes. We still don't have enough responses from professionals and we've got to try to increase the reporting, but we're getting there. This is abuse, not part of culture where we make excuses - cultural acceptance does not mean accepting the unacceptable. Abuse is abuse. I'm a grandmother now - my daughter's expecting her second child in March. And you know when I look at them I think to myself, 'they're never going to inherit that legacy of abuse because of that decision I made when I was 16.' And that really makes me feel a lot stronger. Jasvinder appeared on The Conversation, on the BBC World Service -listen to the programme here -and also spoke to Sarah Buckley for100 Women.

"Andrew Frankish was filmed stamping on a bulldog and throwing her down stairs When two brothers who filmed themselves torturing a dog were spared jail it provoked an outcry. Yet England and Wales has the lightest maximum sentence in Europe for animal cruelty offences. Now an MP is hoping to make the law tougher on perpetrators. There was outrage when the abuse to which Andrew and Daniel Frankish subjected a bulldog became public knowledge. The brothers, from Redcar in Teesside, hadrepeatedly stamped on the dogand thrown it down stairs. As a result the dog became paralysed in the back legs and was eventually put down. Yet they were given only a suspended sentence at Hartlepool Magistrates Court. Even if they had been jailed, the maximum prison sentence they could have faced was six months - meaning they would be released in just three. The sentence attracted widespread criticism. Nearly500,000 people signed an online petition,externalcalling for a tougher penalty. Others held a vigil for the abused dog while a plane was flown over Middlesbrough FC's stadium during a match, calling for the brothers to be locked up. Redcar's Labour MP Anna Turley, who was among those outraged by the sentence, has secured a parliamentary debate about the issue later on Friday. Between 2013 and 2015 more than 3,000 people in England and Wales were convicted of animal cruelty but just 7% received jail terms. Currently sentences in England and Wales are the lowest in Europe. In France the maximum is two years and in Germany it is three. Ms Turley's Animal Cruelty (Sentencing) Bill - which will have its second reading on Friday - would increase the maximum to five years, matching the current situation in Northern Ireland. This dog was nailed in the head and buried alive. It had to be put down ""The current sentences available to courts to punish animal abuse are not working,"" she says. ""They often mean the perpetrators of cruel acts towards animals just receive a slap on the wrist. ""If we do not properly punish these people then as a society we are essentially legitimising abuse against animals"". She reiterated her stance when another pair of her constituents admittedhammering a nail into a dog's headand burying it alive in what a court heard was ""the worst case"" a vet had ever seen. Claire Horton, chief executive of Battersea Dogs' and Cats' Home, said the sentences for animal cruelty were too gentle. ""Six months in prison for the gravest act of animal cruelty, such as torturing an animal to death, is a fraction of the maximum sentence for fly tipping [five years] or theft [seven years],"" she said. ""So let's get this into proportion and let the punishment for abusing animals truly fit the crime."" The current sentencing guidelines have not changed since the Protection of Animals Act 1911. The Act was introduced essentially to make it an offence to override or overload animals pulling loads on the street. The Animal Welfare Act 2006 actually made provision to increase sentencing to 51 weeks, but the provision was never enacted. Puppies were rescued from a farm in Solihull Puppy farmer Sean Kerr, from Solihull, was jailed for six months after being found guilty of causing unnecessary suffering to more than 30 dogs in the West Midlands. Puppies lived on floors coated with faeces and their bedding was soaked with urine In DecemberChristopher and Adam Hoar were jailedfor six weeks for kicking a hedgehog to death at Dalton Park retail centre in Murton, County Durham. The offence, recorded on CCTV, was described as ""horrible"" by the judge Kieran Milledge was jailedfor 21 weeks in November after he swung his Staffordshire bull terrier, Ronnie, against a train's wall and pushed his foot in the dog's face John Wilcock and Bernadette Nunneywere given suspended sentences and banned from keeping animals for life in November for leaving dozens of dogs in squalid conditions at a farm in Bradford, West Yorkshire Jennifer Lampe receiveda four-month suspended sentence in August after she drunkenly decapitated her two snakes with scissors before swallowing their heads at her home in Market Drayton, Shropshire Gary Samuel from Enfieldwas given a suspended 12-week prison sentence in March 2016 after police found dogs locked in cages in a filthy ""pitch-black dungeon"" at Armley Vets in Leeds, West Yorkshire The RSPCA is firmly behind the idea that sentences should be tougher. Its chief veterinary officer James Yeates says people are not only being deliberately cruel, but ""in disturbingly inventive ways."" There have been five prosecutions relating to the ""Neknomination"" online craze in which people took part in ""dares"" involving swallowing live fish, frogs and even a lizard. In Gloucestershire a man was jailed for 16 weeks for microwaving a rabbit to death because he ""was angry"". Paul Rogers said he had ""no remorse whatsoever. Not even a grain of sand on a beach. I would be lying if I said I did."" Dozens of dogs were found in squalid conditions at a farm in Bradford, including dead puppies in a wheelbarrow The RSPCA has highlighted several ""shocking"" cases, including that of a man who stabbed his dog and then hid her behind the washing machine. He was jailed for 12 weeks. There are wider issues too. There is a substantial body of evidence that animal cruelty offenders also commit other serious crimes. A study carried out on behalf of the NSPCC found the children of pet abusers were more at risk ofneglect or abuse themselves,external. The charity says professionals ""can no longer afford to ignore the potential links between child abuse and animal cruelty. The two forms of abuse should not be seen as mutually exclusive; it needs to be recognised that they can co-exist, or there may be associations between the two"". League Against Cruel Sports chief executive Eduardo Goncalves added: ""If we don't offer a serious punishment to animal abusers then they will continue abusing animals. ""I spend a lot of my time looking at horrific dog fighting footage as the League is working hard to stamp this out in the UK, but I know in the back of my mind that if we catch a dog fighter, the most they will get is six months in prison - and probably much less. ""That's utterly inadequate and would be laughable if it wasn't so shocking."" When discussing the five-year proposal in November, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice, Sam Gyimah, pointed out that the average custodial sentence for animal cruelty was about three and a half months. ""If judges are not going up to the maximum six months, there is a question whether the issue is with the maximum sentence length or the courts are finding the current sentencing powers inadequate or restrictive in dealing with those cases. We have to look at that. ""The maximum penalty for animal cruelty offences is under review.""

"The claim:Many young male migrants arrived in Sweden over the past few years, when the country accepted unprecedented numbers of refugees, and there has been a huge rise in sexual crime in Sweden especially in the southern port city of Malmo. Reality Check verdict:Malmo, along with other urban centres in Sweden, has one of the highest levels of reported rapes in proportion to population in the EU, mainly due to the strictness of Swedish laws and how rape is recorded in the country. The rate of reported rapes in Malmo has not dramatically risen in recent years and has in fact declined from its peak in 2010,  before the recent large increases in refugees. It is not possible to connect crimes to the ethnicity of the perpetrators as such data is not published. Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage made this claim on LBC radio on Monday 20 February, when he discussed the recent comments by US President Donald Trumpabout terrorism in Sweden. Mr Farage said there had been no specific terrorist attacks in Sweden since large numbers of refugees arrived there, but, instead, he claimed Sweden had seen a dramatic rise in sexual crime and its southern port city of Malmo - the third largest city in the country - had become Europe's and possibly the world's ""rape capital"". So, has there been a big rise in sexual crime in Sweden and have the numbers of rapes increased in Malmo since Sweden took in an unprecedented numbers of refugees? The first thing to say is that the part of the claim referring to the number of refugees is certainly true. Sweden has been one of the biggest recipients of refugees in the EU in recent years. According to Eurostat, the agency that collects statistical data from all EU countries, in 2015 Sweden had over 162,000 asylum applications or 1,667 asylum seekers for every 100,000 citizens. A large majority of the 2015 asylum seekers - 114,470 - were male, 45,790 of them between 18 and 34 years of age. ""Sexual offences"" is a very broad term, which refers to a range of all sex-related crimes in Sweden. Rape is one of the sexual offences, but other crimes such as paying for sex, sexual harassment, indecent exposure, sexual exploitation, molestation and trafficking are included in the numbers as well. The figures peaked in 2014. The Swedish National Council for Crime Prevention (Bra) says this rise is due to the changes to the legislation in 2013, which made it tougher. Similar increases in the number of reported cases were seen in 2006, after new sex offence legislation came into force in April 2005. Since then, Sweden has recorded every reported case of sexual violence separately. That means, as Susanne Lekengard from Bra explains, that if a person comes to the police and reports being raped by a partner or husband every day for the past year, the police will record each of these events. In many other countries these incidents would be recorded just once: one victim, one type of crime and one record. Also, paying for sex became one of the crimes counted in the statistics. During 2015, the year in which Sweden took the largest number of asylum seekers, the number of reported sex crimes and rapes actually decreased by 11% and 12% respectively compared with 2014 - 18,100 sex offences were reported to the police, of which 5,920 were classified as rape. Preliminary figures for 2016 show a rise, bringing the latest figures close to 2014 values. Susanne Lekengard says the rise of the number of sexual molestation cases in 2016 is due to a higher number of reported cases of sexual harassment amongst teenagers at summer music festivals. Sweden does not publish the ethnicity or national background of perpetrators of any crime, including sexual offences. According to Bra, the number of reported rape cases in proportion to the population in the municipality of Malmo has not seen a sharp increase since the biggest group of refugees arrived. Reported rapes per 100,000 inhabitants peaked in 2008, 2010 and 2011, and the figures were higher for those pre-refugee influx years than in 2015 and 2016. In addition, the reported rape figures were not higher in the Malmo municipality, compared with two other major urban municipalities in Sweden: the capital Stockholm and Gothenburg in the west. It is very hard to compare sex-related offences and rape across the world. Police procedures and legal definitions vary widely around the world, making an international comparison meaningless. The 2012 UN international rape rate comparison showed Sweden to have thehighest rate of rape in Europeand the second highest in the world, but the report did not contain data for a total of 63 countries that did not submit any statistics, including, for example, South Africa, where other earlier surveys indicated a very high rape rate. The most recent Eurostat data for the 28 EU countries also puts Sweden in the top spot. Butthe agency warns,externalthat comparisons between different countries should be avoided because of differences between their legal and criminal justice systems, recording practices, reporting rates, efficiencies of criminal justice organisations and types of offences included in the categories. There has also been a public debate in Sweden over the past two decades to raise awareness and encourage women to go to the police if they have been attacked. This has resulted in a higher report rate than in other countries in Europe.

"It may seem simple - we like chocolate because it tastes nice. But there's more to it than that - and it relates to a fat/carbohydrates balance that is set right from the very beginning of our lives. I love chocolate and once I start on a bar I can't stop until it's all gone. One square, or even a few, are never enough. My family know that if they bring chocolate into our house they will have to hide it. So what is it about the food that so many of us find irresistible? And what characteristics does chocolate share with other foods that we simply can't say, ""no"" to? As part of a new series on the science of food, botanist James Wong and I went looking for answers. Chocolate is made from cocoa beans, which have been grown and consumed in the Americas for thousands of years. The Maya and the Aztecs made a drink out of cocoa beans called xocolatl, which means ""bitter water."" Can people learn to curb their chocolate cravings? That's because in its raw form cocoa beans are intensely bitter. To get at the beans you first have to crack open the thick husk of the cocoa pod, releasing a pulp that has an intense tropical flavour that's halfway between lemonade and a custard apple. Known as baba de cacao, it's sweet, acidic and very sticky. The beans and pulp are then sweated and allowed to ferment for several days before being dried and roasted. Roasting releases a range of chemical compounds including 3-methylbutanoic acid, which on its own has a sweaty rancid odour, and dimethyl trisulfide, the smell of over-cooked cabbage. The combination of these and other aroma molecules creates a unique chemical signature that our brains love. But the rich, chocolaty smells and the happy memories of youth that those smells provoke, are just part of chocolate's attraction. Chocolate contains a number of interesting psychoactive chemicals. These include anandamide, a neurotransmitter whose name comes from the Sanskrit - ""ananda"", meaning ""joy, bliss, delight"". Anandamides stimulate the brain in much the same way that cannabis does. It also contains tyramine and phenylethylamine, both of which have similar effects to amphetamines. Finally, if you look hard enough, you will find small traces of theobromine and caffeine, both of which are well-known stimulants. For a while, some food scientists got very excited about the discovery but to be honest, although chocolate contains these substances, we now know they are only there in trace amounts. Your brain is not going to get much of a chemical rush from eating a few squares. None the less, they may play a small part in seducing our senses. So what else does chocolate have going for it? Well, it also has a creamy viscosity. When you take it out of its wrapper and put a bit in your mouth without biting, you will notice that it rapidly melts on your tongue, leaving a lingering sensation of smoothness. Special touch receptors on our tongues detect this textural change, which then stimulates feelings of pleasure. But the thing that really transformed the cocoa from a bitter and watery drink into the snack we adore today was the addition of sugar and fat. The addition of just the right amount of each is crucial to our enjoyment of chocolate. Look at the side of a packet of milk chocolate and you will see that it is normally contains around 20-25% fat and 40-50% sugar. In nature such high levels of sugar and fat are rarely found, or at least not together. You can get lots of natural sugars from fruits and roots, and there is plenty of fat to be found in nuts or a tasty chunk of salmon, but one of the few places where you will find both together is in milk. Human breast milk is particularly rich in natural sugars, mainly lactose. Roughly 4% of human breast milk is fat, while about 8% is made up of sugars. Formula milk, which is fed to babies, contains a similar ratio of fats to sugars. This ratio, 1g of fat to 2g of sugars, is the same ratio of fats to sugars that you find in milk chocolate. And in biscuits, doughnuts, ice cream. In fact this particular ratio is reflected in many of the foods that we find hard to resist. So why do I love chocolate? For a whole host of reasons. But it may also be that I, and chocoholics like me, are trying to recapture the taste and sense of closeness we got from the first food we ever sampled; human breast milk.

"Jasvinder (R) aged 15, with her sister Robina Jasvinder Sanghera was locked in a room by her parents when she was 16, when she refused to marry the man they had chosen for her. Here she describes how she escaped with the help of a secret boyfriend - but lost all contact with her family as a result. Growing up we had no freedom whatsoever. Everything was watched, monitored and controlled. We understood that we had to be careful how we behaved so as not to shame the family. I'm one of seven sisters and there's only one younger than me so I'd watched my sisters having to be married at very young ages - as young as 15. They would disappear to become a wife and go to India, come back, not go back to school and then go into these marriages and be physically and psychologically abused. And my impression of marriage was that this is what happens to you - you get married, you get beaten up, and then you're told to stay there. My parents were Sikh and Sikhism was born on the foundation of compassion and equality of men and women, and yet here we have women who were treated very differently. My brother was allowed total freedom of expression. He was also allowed to choose who he wanted to marry. But the women were treated differently and that was reinforced within the communities. It's gone unchallenged and it's deeply ingrained. I don't think I was smarter. I just don't know what it was within me. My mother used to say: ""You were born upside down, you were different from birth."" Maybe she helped me out by saying that, because it made me question a number of things, and then when I was shown the photograph of this man, as a 14-year-old, knowing that I'd been promised to him from the age of eight and being expected to contemplate marriage, I looked at this picture thinking: ""Well he's shorter than me and he's very much older than me and I don't want this."" And it was as simple as that. But within our family dynamic we were taught to be silent. Saying no to the marriage meant my family took me out of education and they held me a prisoner in my own home. I was 15 and I was locked in this room and literally I was not allowed to leave the room until I agreed to the marriage. It was padlocked on the outside and I had to knock on the door to go the toilet and they brought food to the door. My mother was the very person who enforced the rules. People don't think of women as the gatekeepers to an honour system. So in the end I said yes, purely to plan my escape. And it was as simple as that, because then I had freedom of movement. The only friends we were allowed had to be from an Indian community as well. And my best friend, who was Indian, it was her brother who helped me in the end. He became my secret boyfriend. He saved some money and said, ""I want to be with you and I'll help you to escape."" He would come to the house at night and stand in the garden and we would secretly mouth things to each other through the window. One day he dressed up as a woman and went into a shoe shop and pretended he was shopping. He handed me a note which said, ""I'll be at the back of the house at this time - look out of the window."" So I did, and he mouthed for me to pack my wardrobe and I lowered two cases down using sheets tied together, and flushed the toilets so my mother wouldn't hear. And then one day I was at home with my dad, who was at home because he worked nights, and the front door was open, and I just ran out. I ran all the way, a good three-and-a-half miles, to where my boyfriend worked and hid behind a wall and waited for him to come out. He went and got my cases and then picked me up in his Ford Escort and got me to close my eyes and put my finger on a map, and it landed on Newcastle. Jasvinder, now 51, helps others who are in the same situation as she was I sat in the footwell of the car all the way so no-one would see me and then when I saw the Tyne bridge I was absolutely amazed by it because I had never been anywhere outside Derby. My parents reported me missing to the police and it was the police officer who told me I had to ring home to let them know I was safe and well. My mother answered the phone and I said: ""Mom, it's me. You know, I want to come home but I don't want to marry that stranger."" Her response has stayed with me for the rest of my life. She said: ""You either come back and marry who we say, or from this day forward you are now dead in our eyes."" It was only later on when things settled down that I begin to think, ""I've done it but where's my family? I want my family."" I was missing them terribly. You feel like a dead person walking. My boyfriend used to drive me to my hometown at 3am just so I could see my dad walking home from the foundry. What changed how I felt was the death of my sister, Robina. She was taken out of school at 15 for nine months, married to a man in India, and then came back and put in the same year as me and nobody questioned this at all. But he treated her terribly and when her son was around six months old she severed the relationship. She then married for love and my parents agreed to it because he was Indian - Sikh and from the same caste as us. She again suffered domestic abuse but my parents made it clear that because she had chosen him she had a duty, doubly, to make it work. She went to see a local community leader - they have a lot of power, my parents would have seen his word as the word of God - and he told her: ""You need to think of your husband's temper like a pan of milk - when it boils it rises to the top and a woman's role is to blow it to cool it down."" When she was 25 she set herself on fire and she died.  When she was - I say - driven to commit suicide, that was the turning point for me.

I've learned to live my life with no expectations of family whatsoever. I've never had a birthday card in 35 years and neither have my children. For my children it's a total blank on their mother's side when it comes to family. I've got nephews and nieces that I'll never meet because all of my siblings sided with my parents. I have actually stipulated in my will that I do not want any of my estranged family to be at my funeral because I know the hypocrisy that exists within them. They will want to show their face, but if they couldn't show it when I was alive, I'm not going to give them that privilege when I'm gone. I have three children - Natasha who's 31, Anna who's 22 and Jordan who's 19. You almost live vicariously through your children because you want them to have everything you never had. My daughter married an Asian man and I was worried - I didn't want this family to take it out on her that her mother was disowned and had run away from home. But thankfully for me my fears were completely unfounded because here was an Indian family that did the exact opposite of what my family did. Starting a charity, Karma Nirvana, in 1993 from my kitchen table allowed me for the first time to start talking about my personal experiences and what had happened to my sister. My family wanted us to never speak about Robina again. Jasvinder with her grandson Sometimes at Christmas my children would meet these different women at the dinner table - survivors disowned by their family - and they had no idea who would be the next person at our table, but they understood why. The charity will be 25 years old next year. We have helped make forced marriage a criminal offence, we have a helpline funded by the government which takes 750 calls a month - 58% of callers are victims and the others are professionals calling about a victim. We do risk assessments, offer refuge and help plan escapes. We still don't have enough responses from professionals and we've got to try to increase the reporting, but we're getting there. This is abuse, not part of culture where we make excuses - cultural acceptance does not mean accepting the unacceptable. Abuse is abuse. I'm a grandmother now - my daughter's expecting her second child in March. And you know when I look at them I think to myself, 'they're never going to inherit that legacy of abuse because of that decision I made when I was 16.' And that really makes me feel a lot stronger.

"This video can not be played CCTV footage appears to show the moment Kim Jong-nam is attacked Malaysian authorities have identified the substance that killed Kim Jong-nam at Kuala Lumpur airport as VX, which is classified as a weapon of mass destruction. Bruce Bennett, a defence expert with the Rand Corporation, dissects how this could have happened. VX is an extraordinarily potent chemical weapon.  About 0.01g - less than a drop - on the skin can kill. The chemical goes through the skin and disrupts the nerve system. It is an oil-like substance; it would normally not mix well with water, which raises questions about how it was applied on Mr Kim without killing those who carried out the mission. This is the first time VX has been used in such a way, so there are plenty of imponderables. The CCTV footage and police statements do not lay out the full sequence of events. Two women appear to assault him, at least one with a cloth  wiping his face. Molecular model of VX nerve agent shows atoms represented as spheres: Carbon (grey), hydrogen (white), nitrogen (blue) oxygen (red), phosphorous (orange) and sulphur (yellow) Malaysian investigators said the two women coated their hands with the liquid toxin and wiped Kim's face afterwards. But if that were the case, they would have died immediately. So if a liquid was sprayed or wiped on Kim Jong-nam it is likely that it did not contain VX and that would help to explain why the women seen accosting him did not die despite apparently getting the liquid on their hands. In that case it appears likely that a very small quantity of VX - possibly just a drop - was actually on the cloths used by the women to wipe his face. We do know now that one of the women involved has been vomiting since the attack. The perpetrators would have really wanted to practise with this to make sure the drop touched Kim, and that they did not touch the drop.  And that is what we are told happened. Police say that they are believed to have repeated this move in shopping malls ahead of the actual event on 13 February. Kim Jong-nam 'killed by VX nerve agent' Main players in mystery death Who was Kim Jong-nam? As the drop absorbed into Kim Jong-nam's skin, it would have started affecting his nerve system, causing symptoms that take effect within minutes. The subject will experience coughing, chest tightness, blurry vision, fatigue and eventually seizures  as the nervous system is shut down. He is likely to have died within minutes. Kim, seen here in a file photo, reportedly died before he could be taken to hospital It appears that the North Korean government may have felt that they could claim the body and avoid an autopsy, thus denying the outside world knowledge of what had happened. Malaysia has proven diligent in insisting on an autopsy and clearly North Korea failed in its efforts to prevent this. This has led to a row between the two nations, Malaysia being one of few that had diplomatic relations with the North. So how could the VX have actually got into Malaysia? A woman wearing a white top was thought to have attacked Mr Kim Because the quantity required to kill is extraordinarily small, it could have been smuggled into Malaysia in a cartridge in a pen or some such thing.  The security forces would have had no idea it was being smuggled in unless someone had tipped them off, which clearly did not happen. It is unlikely that VX was made in Malaysia - it is not something that can be made safely in a kitchen sink. Of course, we don't know for sure that North Korea made it and it is also possible they may have purchased it from a third country. There is both a US and a Soviet/Russian version of VX and it will be interesting to see which version was eventually used. What led to Kim's demise? North Korea's history of foreign assassinations It would take sophisticated laboratory analysis to tell them apart, which may already have been done. VX is extremely stable - like oil, it does not evaporate quickly. That made the VX safe on a cloth or some other surface until it touched human skin. VX, seen here in a container held by a US Army chemical school instructor, is a clear amber-coloured and oily liquid But this use of VX, unheard of previously, is a serious violation of international standards. The fact that it was used in a foreign country means that Malaysia and other countries will be both appalled and furious. Of key importance will be how China responds.  After all, China was reportedly providing protection for Kim Jong-nam. If North Korea seriously violated international law, China should presumably do more than just cut off imports of North Korean coal. China has the opportunity to punish North Korea and thereby hopefully deter it from carrying out this kind of attack again. A broader Chinese trade embargo would hurt North Korea seriously.
