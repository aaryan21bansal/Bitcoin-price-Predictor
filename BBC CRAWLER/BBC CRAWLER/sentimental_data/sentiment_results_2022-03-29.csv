"Elin's been attending school via online learning from her bedroom for two years now, in Trinidad and Tobago Schools in 23 countries, with 405 million pupils, are still partially or fully closed because of Covid, the United Nations Children's Fund says. The charity, Unicef, estimates 147 million children have missed at least half of their in-person schooling. Some vulnerable children, especially girls, have not returned to those schools that have reopened. Unicef executive director Catherine Russell says children are ""the hidden casualties of the pandemic"". While children have been less vulnerable to the most serious health effects of coronavirus, their lives have been turned upside down by the school closures of the pandemic. In March 2020, 150 countries around the world completely shut their schools, with partial closures in a further 10. Two years later, 19 still have some of their schools closed. In a further four - the Philippines, Honduras, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu in the South Pacific - at least 70% remain shut, the proportion Unicef categorises as full closure. Why this man's children may never return to school Covid fuels deepening education inequalities - MPs Telling children to catch up 'adds huge pressure' ""We're seeing children go back who were reading before, who now can't read, who were doing numbers before, who now can't do that,"" Ms Russell told BBC News. She fears most for those who have dropped out of school and risk becoming vulnerable to exploitation. ""Some children, because their families were so impoverished, were moved into the workforce,"" she said. ""Girls also get moved into early marriage - and that's a terrible fate."" In the Philippines, where children have also faced restrictions on playing outside, a few schools started to reopen during the autumn but most pupils remain at home. Chloe Almojuela Dikit, 13, has tried to keep up with her lessons online. ""I miss the teaching and the classmates and also the activities and schoolwork - just the things that we do in school,"" she said. Chloe, who lives in the Philippines, says she misses her classmates Her father, Dioecro Albior Dikit, supports his family by scavenging - collecting rubbish and finding things to sell from it. He wants his daughter back in school and is worried about what she has missed in terms of social skills, as well as lessons. ""Many things - first is how they interact with people, because they haven't been face-to-face,"" Mr Dikit said. ""When people interact with others often, they will learn ideas about things like, 'Oh, this is OK?' ""You really need stuff like that."" It is across sub-Saharan Africa that reading, writing and maths skills were lowest even before the pandemic, according to Unicef. And when schools reopened in Uganda, in January this year, about one in 10 pupils failed to return. Extreme flooding had also damaged many school buildings, so Unicef has provided 457 high-performance tents. Teacher Lillian Nikaru teaches classes in an outdoor tent Some have gone to the western mining town of Kasese. Lillian Nikaru, who is is teaching in one at the district's Bulembia Primary School, told BBC News: ""The gap of almost two years affected them much, so when they resumed they had lost or forgotten many things and we were beginning to teach them afresh."" Teachers have also gone to family homes to persuade them to let girls return, including those who have become teenage mothers. Sharon's aunt babysits while she attends lessons Sharon (not her real name), now 17, became pregnant in 2020, when schools were closed. The school has arranged a place nearby where an aunt can care for her baby during the day and Sharon takes three breaks a day to breastfeed. ""I wanted to show the other girls that even though you make a mistake, you can still return to school,"" she said. ""When I am in class, I really concentrate on my lessons. ""Sometimes, I forget that I have a child and it's only when my aunt comes for me that I remember."" Sharon is repeating a year and hopes continuing in education will allow her to train as a chef. But as well as setting back their learning, the pandemic has deprived children of social contact and experiences of life beyond the family home. This video can not be played When all Uganda's schools closed because of the pandemic, Teddy, nine, joined her mother mining for gold Trinidad and Tobago has had one of the longest partial school closures in the world, with its primary schools only due to reopen in April. Some parents have been frustrated by delays they have found hard to understand, when other countries have managed a return to learning. While schools for the youngest children remained closed, beaches and bars reopened. For Elin, nine, it has meant two years of her school experience being reduced to four or five hours a day on a laptop on a small desk in her bedroom. ""Sometimes I miss things and I'm afraid to ask,"" she said. Her mother, Kate Nothnagel, told BBC News Elin had met her class teacher only once this school year and last year she had had no contact in real life with her teacher at all. ""They don't have a rapport and it's left her not feeling very confident,"" she said. ""She is a naturally very outgoing child and I've seen her become very subdued."" Elin added she was missing subjects such as music, art and physical education (PE), which just were not the same online. But she is among the lucky children who have a quiet place to study, a device and broadband, while, as in many countries, others are less fortunate. Summit raises $4bn for schools despite aid row Syrian children who know war planes but not shops UK pledges Â£430m on girls' education amid aid row Other parents in Trinidad and Tobago told BBC News they were worried about the impact on their children's mental wellbeing because of the social isolation. And they were not aware of any national plan to help their children make up for lost learning. Unicef gathered data from 122 countries and said only 60% had published plans for education to recover, suggesting it was not yet being taken seriously enough. It is warning Covid has exposed and widened deep inequalities in children's access to education. The charity is calling for greater investment to avoid a devastating chain reaction in which life chances are blighted. The share of overseas development aid given to education globally fell from 8.8% in 2019 to 5.5% in 2020. Ms Russell said education ministries around the world had to have plans - but a global commitment to help education recover was also needed. ""We just need to really make a commitment to take care of these children so that they're able to thrive,"" she said. Are you or your child being affected by school closures?

"The Bank of England has urged people to spend or deposit their paper Â£20 and Â£50 notes before the notes stop being legal tender in six months. The Bank is replacing the paper notes with more durable plastic ones featuring artist JMW Turner and mathematician Alan Turing. More than Â£17bn worth of paper notes remain in circulation, the Bank said. But after 30 September, people will not be able to use the paper notes for payments in shops and other businesses. From October, people with a UK bank account will still be able to deposit the paper notes into their account. Some Post Offices may also accept the old notes as payment for goods and services, or as a deposit to an account accessed via the postal service, the Bank said. The paper notes can also beexchanged by the Bank of England.,external Sarah John, the Bank of England's chief cashier, said bank notes were being changed from paper to polymer ""because these designs are more difficult to counterfeit, whilst also being more durable"". The new plastic Â£50 note has a series of security features The Bank withdrew paper Â£5 and Â£10 banknotes as legal tender in May 2017 and March 2018 respectively. It put the polymer Â£50 note into circulation on 23 June 2021, meaning the Bank's entire collection of currently-printed banknotes is made of plastic. The new note features a portrait of Mr Turing, who conceived modern computing and played a crucial part in the Allied victory over Nazi Germany in World War Two. The use of cash fell sharply during the coronavirus pandemic, as lockdowns reduced options for spending and online transactions increased. However, cash still accounted for 17% of all payments in 2020, according to the latest available figures by banking trade body UK Finance, making it the second most-popular way to pay after debit cards. Figures for 2021 will be published this summer.

"The coroner said she was ""satisfied"" Max Mosley had intended to kill himself due to his terminal cancer diagnosis Former F1 boss Max Mosley shot himself after learning his cancer was terminal, a coroner has concluded. Mr Mosleydied in his London home in May 2021. The 81-year-old had been in debilitating pain. Westminster Coroner's Court heard that he shared his plans, had a final meal with his wife and wrote a suicide note. Senior Coroner Dr Fiona Wilcox recorded a conclusion of suicide, saying she was ""satisfied"" Mr Mosley intended to kill himself. Mr Mosley developed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a cancer affecting immune cells, in 2019, the court heard on Tuesday. Having exhausted all the treatment options, doctors had told him he likely had a ""very limited life expectancy"" and he had been moved to palliative care. Max Mosley at his wedding to Jean Taylor in London in 1960 Mr Mosley contacted his personal assistant the night before he was found dead to tell him about his decision to kill himself. He could not be persuaded and had formed a ""settled intent"", the court heard, and a suicide note was found the following day. Dr Wilcox recorded a cause of death as a gunshot wound, adding that the cancer was a contributing factor to the death of ""a remarkable man"". She said: ""I am also entirely satisfied Mr Mosley would not have undertaken this action but for the distressing and debilitating terminal lymphoma."" The inquest also heard from Mr Mosley's relatives that he felt his biggest achievement as president of the Federation Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) - the governing body for F1 racing and non-profit representing motoring interests worldwide - was ""the promotion of road safety"" and ""green technology in F1"". Max Mosley became a prominent privacy campaigner Mr Mosley led motorsport's governing body the FIA from 1993 to 2009 and, in his role as FIA president, initiated widespread reforms of safety procedures in Formula 1 following the death of Ayrton Senna in 1994. On learning of his death, ex-Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone said it was ""like losing a brother"". At the time, Mr Ecclestone said: ""He did, a lot of good things not just for motorsport, also the [car] industry. He was very good in making sure people built cars that were safe."" Mr Mosley - the son of 1930s British fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - also campaigned for tighter press regulation after winning Â£60,000 damages from the News of the World when it wrongly published a story alleging he had attended a Nazi-themed orgy.

"Free Covid tests will still be available for some groups, including NHS staff caring directly for patients, the government has confirmed as it winds down the service for the public. From 1 April, most people will have to pay for a lateral flow test in England. It is part of the government's 'living with Covid,external' plan, although levels of the virus are high, with an estimated one in 16 people infected in the UK. Some free testing will continue during April in Scotland and Northern Ireland. In Wales the cut-off is July. Where can I buy a lateral flow test? UK Covid infections climb by a million in a week The general public has been discouraged from stockpiling test packs ahead of the change, but since ministers announced the end of the free testing programme for most of the population it has been difficult for many to access them. The government says the end of universal free testing is possible because vaccines, along withantiviral drugs, are doing a good job of protecting people against severe Covid. Although infections and hospitalisations with the virus have been rising in recent weeks, more than half of the patients in hospital who test positive are there for something else, rather than Covid. Testing can be ramped up again should it be needed, such as if a new variant of concern emerges, the government says. Thenew rules say,externalthat from 1 April in England, free testing will be provided for: Patients in hospital, where a PCR test is required for their care People who are eligible for community Covid drug treatments because they are at higher risk of getting seriously ill if they become infected. People in this group will be contacted directly and sent lateral flow tests to keep at home for use if they have symptoms, as well as being told how to reorder tests Care home residents People working in some high-risk settings, including care homes and prisons. These staff will be able to test regularly, without symptoms People will also be tested before being discharged from hospital into care homes, hospices and refuges. But most visitors to adult social care settings, and visitors to the NHS, prisons or places of detention will not be required to take a test. Anyone who tests positive - whether they paid for a test or it was free - will be advised to try to stay at home and avoid contact with other people for five days, which is when they are most infectious. Children and young people who are unwell and have a high temperature should stay at home. They can go back to nursery, school or college when they feel well enough and the fever has gone. Dame Jenny Harries, Chief Executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said:  ""As we learn to live with Covid, we are focusing our testing provision on those at higher risk of serious outcomes from the virus, while encouraging people to keep following simple steps to help keep themselves and others safe. ""The pandemic is not over and how the virus will develop over time remains uncertain. ""Covid still poses a real risk to many of us, particularly with case rates and hospitalisations on the rise. ""That is why it is sensible to wear a mask in enclosed spaces, keep indoor spaces ventilated and stay away from others if you have any symptoms of a respiratory illness, including Covid."" The government also confirmed some other changes from 1 April: free parking for NHS staff introduced during the pandemic will end visiting restrictions in care homes with outbreaks will be reduced from 14 to 10 days Who can still get free Covid tests?

"Children as young as five use social media, despite most platforms having rules users must be over the age of 13. An annual study into media habits,from Ofcom,external, highlighted the mini social-media mavens, with a third of parents of five- to seven-year-olds revealing their child had a social-media profile. Among the eight- to 11-year-olds who used social media, the most popular platform was TikTok, with one in every three having an account. TikTok is a ""strictly a 13+ platform"". A spokesman for the viral video-sharing platform said: ""We have processes in place to enforce our minimum-age requirements, both at the point of sign-up and through the continuous proactive removal of suspected under-age accounts from the platform. ""Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our community, especially young people."" The report noted even younger children - TikTots as Ofcom dubbed them - were watching videos on TikTok, including 16% of the three- to four-year-olds. But this could be children being shown videos by a parent or other older person and does not imply they have own accounts. Ofcom strategy and research director Yih-Choung Teh said the findings were ""really striking"". ""I have an 11-year-old and an eight-year-old,"" he said, ""60% of their peers have a social-media profile, which I find a bit surprising. ""Big-tech platforms set minimum ages in their terms and conditions - but it does seem that they aren't really being enforced."" But Mr Teh also said parents had to be aware of what their children were doing online. ""It's not always very easy to tell what they're watching and I think, as a parent, we have responsibilities to have a good dialogue with our kids about what they are doing,"" he said. But the survey also found 22% of parents of three- to four year-olds and 38% of parents of eight- to 11-year-olds said they would allow their child to have a profile on social media before they reached the minimum age. ""Many children could be tactically using other accounts or 'finstas' - fake Instagrams - to conceal aspects of their online lives from parents,"" Ofcom suggested. Instagram is an over-13's platform and offers a number ofparental controls.,external But across social media many children choose to have multiple profiles on the same social media app or site the survey suggested. Two out of every three of eight- to 11-year-olds surveyed used multiple accounts or profiles on social media, the regulator said. ""Among these, almost half (46%) have an account just for their family to see,"" it noted. The survey also found one out of every five of children aged 12-17, surfed in incognito mode or deleted their browsing history. The just published Online Safety Bill makes it a legal requirement for sites and platforms that show pornography to  prevent children accessing inappropriate or harmful material. But a significant minority may already be adept at working around technologies designed to prevent access to inappropriate material, the survey suggests. One in 20 children ""circumvented parental controls put in place to stop them visiting certain apps and sites (6%)"" Ofcom said. Mr Teh said those who were digital natives would often have skills beyond many of their parents. The key was ""ensuring that we have a good awareness of the online environment, what tools that we can use in terms of parental controls, but also that we have conversations with our kids about what they're doing"". But the study also found the children had many positive experiences online. Despite significant concerns, 53% of the 13- to 17-year-olds told Ofcom being online was good for their mental health, while 17% disagreed. The survey also found 70% of the adults were confident they could spot misinformation - but only 20% could correctly identify the tell-tale signs of a genuine post. Among the 12- to 17-year-olds, these proportions were nearly 75% and just over 10%. Perhaps the really surprising statistic in the Ofcom research is so many people - more than two out of every three - are pretty sceptical about what they see online. But there is one problem - they are vastly overconfident in their abilities to pick out truth from fiction. Only about one in four of those surveyed could spot a fake social-media profile in practice. And while a common trope stereotypes misinformation spreaders as clueless boomers spouting off on Facebook, digital natives are not much better at fake spotting. Only about one in 10 of the 12- to 17-year-olds could identify the tell-tale signs of a genuine post. And remember, the UK is among the most wired and technology-savvy countries in the world. When it comes to media literacy, there is big work to be done. The Online Safety Bill requires the technology giants to remove the most harmful misinformation and boost Ofcom's powers. Europe is also proposing new rules.,external But with a problem this complex - and misinformation polluting the online conversation about everything from Covid to the war in Ukraine - nobody is under the illusion it can be magically legislated away.

"Former tennis champion Boris Becker does not know where his Wimbledon trophies are, he has told a jury. The six-time Grand Slam winner told Southwark Crown Court he would hand them over ""tomorrow"" if he had access to them, as a trial into his alleged failure to declare assets continues. Mr Becker, 54, was declared bankrupt in 2017, with nine trophies and medals among assets he is accused of failing to declare. He denies 24 charges against him. The German former world number one told the court he has sold his properties to help fix his financial situation and he owned ""lots"" of trophies and memorabilia from his career, but some are now missing. He said: ""For the player, it's about winning the title. The trophy is not so much when you are playing. ""Nowadays I wish I have them to show to my children."" Mr Becker's bankruptcy was in part a consequence of borrowing Â£1.2 million - with a 25% interest rate - from the billionaire founder of Phones 4u John Cauldwell in 2014, as well as a â¬4.6m (Â£3.85m) loan from private bank Arbuthnot Latham the previous year, the court also heard. He said he had been seeking to pay off some of his debts through selling his estate in Mallorca, Spain - known as the Finca - adding he was ""shocked"" by his financial situation. Previously, Mr Beckertold the court of his shock and embarrassmentat being declared bankrupt, adding the bad publicity had damaged ""brand Becker"" and reduced his earnings. He won 49 singles titles in 77 finals over his 15 year career. The awards Mr Becker allegedly failed to hand over after being declared bankrupt include: two of the three Wimbledon men's singles titles the 1992 Olympic gold medal his Australian Open trophies from 1991 and 1996 the President's Cup from 1985 and 1989 his 1989 Davis Cup Trophy a Davis Cup Gold Coin won in 1988 The trophies displayed on court after a final are larger than the versions competitors take home, the court heard. Mr Becker said the Wimbledon trophy was ""very large"" and added ""you have a hard time holding it"". The All England Lawn Tennis Cup is around 60cm (24in) by 30cm, but the winner takes home a ""replica that is much smaller, perhaps half the size or even smaller than that"", he explained. Mr Becker burst on to the scene as a 17-year-old in 1985, when we won the first of his three Wimbledon titles Becker said the Australian Open ""is a big tournament to win it, but is the smallest of the trophies, adding that star players ""in effect... made fun of them"". He also told the court fellow champion Roger Federer had ""made a complaint many times"" about one trophy, which led to them enlarging the version winners take home. Mr Becker said: ""Obviously what you receive on the court is not what you keep. What you keep is usually given to your agent or manager, they take it and you usually are travelling to another tournament."" He added he knows he gave a President's Cup trophy to his mother. Some of his trophies have been auctioned off for Â£700,000 to pay off his debts and he has put out several appeals in an attempt locate those that are missing. Among the places that have been contacted are major tennis associations, halls of fame and museums, but Mr Becker said he is ""not in a better position today"" to say where they are. The 24 charges he has been accused of include: Nine counts of failing to deliver up trophies and other awards Seven counts of concealing property totalling more than â¬1.5m Five counts of failing to disclose estate, including properties in Germany and London, shares, and a bank account Two of removal of property amounting to almost â¬500,000 One of concealing â¬825,000 of debt The trial, which is expected to last up to three weeks, continues.

"Average petrol prices are not fully reflecting a recent cut in fuel tax, according to motoring group the RAC. While fuel duty was cut by 5p per litre last week, petrol has fallen less than 4p, and diesel by less than 3p, it said. Big retailers such as supermarkets and oil giants Shell and BP have already passed on the tax cut. But smaller retailers said last week that it would take time for the fuel duty cut to be passed on. The price of fuel was rising rapidly in the UK even before Russia invaded Ukraine, as economies started to recover from the Covid pandemic. But the war has pushed up crude oil prices, which has fed through to pump prices. The 5p cut in fuel duty announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak last week is intended to help people struggling with the cost of living crisis - but because prices have risen so quickly, its impact is likely to be minimal, the RAC said at the time. Now, the motoring group says that the cut is not being fully passed on to consumers. How much is fuel duty and what will the cut on petrol save you? Fuel duty cut by 5p a litre to help motorists Since last Wednesday, the average price for a litre of petrol has fallen by 3.71p to 163.30p per litre, while diesel has fallen 2.79p to 177.11p. RAC spokesman Rod Dennis said: ""Unfortunately, wholesale fuel prices were already rising before the chancellor made his announcement on fuel duty last week. ""This meant retailers were buying fuel in at a higher cost than they were a week earlier, which meant drivers may not have immediately and fully benefitted from the duty cut. ""Wholesale prices are currently falling, but it's likely to be next week before we see what impact this has at the pumps."" Mr Dennis added that drivers ""remain entirely dependent on what is happening on the wholesale market and the extent to which retailers are able or willing to pass on savings they make"". On Monday, rival motoring group the AA said: ""Why are drivers not surprised that on average a third of the petrol saving has yet to be passed on at the pumps? ""The fuel trade always disputes the accusation that pump prices shoot up like a rocket and fall like a feather. Now we know the truth,"" said Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman. The big four supermarkets - Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons - have brought in the duty cut in full. Oil giants Shell and BP have also implemented the cut in petrol stations that they own - but many of their branded forecourts are franchised, with prices set by franchisees. Shell owns and operates about half of its 1,000 branded UK stations, while BP owns about 300 of its 1,200 stations. Independent retailers warned last week that it would take time for the fuel duty cut to be reflected in pump prices. Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association, said at the time that petrol stations had bought the fuel they were selling at the higher fuel duty rate. ""As a result, they must first deplete their stocks and resupply with fuel bought at a reduced rate before motorists will see a change in pump prices,"" he said. Why are petrol prices going back up?

"French sportswear retailer Decathlon has backtracked and suspended its activities in Russia following criticism of its decision to stay. It said supply chain disruption meant it could no longer operate in the country but it would continue to support its 2,500 Russian staff. Posts on social media had called for a boycott of the French company, which has 60 stores in Russia. Ukraine's foreign minister had also criticised the firm. ""In the dramatic context of Ukraine, we are following the evolution of events and particularly the situation of those directly affected,"" Decathlon said in a statement. ""In strict compliance with international sanctions, Decathlon notes that the supply conditions are no longer met to continue its activity in Russia. Decathlon has to suspend the operation of its stores."" McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Ikea are among the companies which have halted business in Russia as pressure mounts on firms to pull out following the invasion of Ukraine. Decathlon is owned by French retail giant Association Familiale Mulliez, which has been criticised for continuing its other businesses in Russia. They include supermarket chain Auchan, which has 41,000 employees and 311 stores in Russia, according to its website. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia The Western brands unable to leave Russia Some people had expressed outrage at the company's decision to keep trading in Russia on social media, alongside the hashtag #BoycottDecathlon. ""For two decades myself and my family have been a regular customer of @decathlonuk and I've freely recommended their products to others. No more,""one wrote,external. Others shared pictures of protesters,external, holding photos of victims of the war in Ukraine, outside Decathlon, Auchan and Leroy Merlin stores in Poland. On Sunday, Auchan defended its position on Russia. ""Our job is to do everything we can to ensure that the inhabitants of our countries of operation have access to good quality food at an affordable price and thus meet the essential food needs of the civilian population,""it said in a statement,external. ""Abandoning our employees, their families and our customers is not the choice we have made,"" the company added. It said it had stopped its investments in Auchan Russia and it was not currently making any profit in the country. It came after Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet: ""By refusing to end business activities in Russia, Auchan Holding makes a conscious choice to further sponsor Russian atrocities in Ukraine and make blood profits."" He called on customers to boycott the company, along with Decathlon and home improvement chain Leroy Merlin, which is also owned by Association Familiale Mulliez. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky used an address to France's Parliament to call on French companies, including Auchan and car manufacturer Renault, to pull out of Russia. Renault later announced that it was suspending its work at its Moscow factory.

"Waitrose has sent a legal letter to Asda after its rival unveiled a similarly-named discount product range. Asda announced its Just Essentials range on Monday, promising an expanded line of low-cost products in all its stores from May to help shoppers with the cost of living. But Waitrose said the branding is too similar to its own Essential Waitrose range launched in 2009. Asda said ""essentials"" is a ""commonly-used term"" for discount product ranges. Asda's new value range will replace its current Smart Price range, which was criticised by food poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe for not being available in all Asda stores. Waitrose, which is owned by the John Lewis Partnership, said it had written to Asda raising trademark concerns and was awaiting a response. ""We were surprised to hear that Asda is launching an essentials range as the Essential Waitrose brand has been in use since 2009 and has built up a strong reputation for value, quality and higher welfare standards in that time,"" said a Waitrose spokesman. ""As we've also protected the name as a trademark, we have raised this with Asda and are awaiting a response."" Asda in food promise after Jack Monroe complaints Inflation hits new 30-year high in February What is the UK's inflation rate and why is the cost of living going up? An Asda spokesperson said: ""The word 'essentials' is a generic and commonly used term by retailers to describe their value product ranges."" Asda, which was bought by the billionaire Issa brothers and their backers TDR Capital in 2020, says the Just Essentials by Asda range will include 300 low-cost products. At the moment its value Smart Price and Farm Stores ranges have 200 products. Ms Monroe criticised the supermarket last month for taking value ranges off its shelves and raising prices at time when many household budgets are being squeezed. Following her comments the supermarket chainpromised to stock its budget ranges in all 581 supermarkets and online. Mohsin Issa, co-owner of Asda, said: ""We understand that customers are increasingly worried about the cost of living and want help to keep their grocery bills in check, whilst still being able to buy healthy and nutritious food for their families. Jack Monroe has said value products have to be universally available ""Our new Just Essentials range has been specifically designed with this in mind, combining our lowest prices with a much larger and more diverse range of great value products to meet all household needs."" The cost of living was rising before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but the war there has pushed food, fuel and energy bills higher. Catherine Shuttleworth, founder of Savvy Marketing, said Waitrose's actions were likely to have been driven by concern it could lose shoppers to Asda with people shopping around more due to rising prices. ""It's very easy to segregate shoppers on where you think they are likely to shop but there are many more factors - for example it depends where you live and which big stores you have access to. ""Brand matters less and it's more about getting the best price possible,"" she said. Ms Shuttleworth said the difference between supermarket brands was ""very slim"" and Waitrose's move showed how competitive the battle for shoppers had become. However Steve Dresser, chief executive of Grocery Insight, said Waitrose had reduced its presence in the north of England by gradually closing more stores whereas Asda had expanded there. Mr Dresser said that this geographical division meant there would be less crossover in the shoppers that Asda's new range is targeting as there are fewer areas where the two supermarkets are in direct competition. UKinflation hit a new 30-year-high of 6.2%in the 12 months to February, with food prices up 5.1%. And according to research firm Kantar, supermarkets have been passing on their rising costs to consumers. It said the price of a 500g packet of Asda fusilli pasta rose from 45p in September 2021 to 70p in March, up 56%. Two pints of Asda semi-skimmed milk rose from 80p to 95p, a 19% increase. Shoppers are increasingly turning to discounters Aldi and Lidl, Kantar added, with both retailers seeing their share of the grocery market grow in February. On Monday, budget supermarket chain Iceland warned the Ukraine war was pushing up the price of commodities like wheat and could cause shortages of ingredients. Together, Russia and Ukraine make up 30% of global wheat exports. ""Boycotts and disruption resulting from the war are already driving huge increases in global energy and commodity prices, affecting milling wheat, edible oils, animal feed, fertilisers, food processing, packaging and transport,"" managing director Richard Walker wrotein a blog post.,external ""Our suppliers of meat, poultry, eggs, dairy products and a range of other foods are not just warning us of massive inflationary pressures hurtling towards them: they are seriously worrying about whether they will be able to secure key ingredients at all, or have the diesel to transport them to depots and stores if they do."" The retailer said it will reverse a decision to stop using palm oil in its own-brand products due to a shortage of sunflower oil caused by the war. Ukraine and Russia account for 70% of the global supply of sunflower oil, but Mr Walker said the ingredient had ""suddenly become totally unobtainable"".

"Wally Adeyemo visited Europe to coordinate the next phase of sanctions against Russia The world's biggest companies ""have a choice to make"" whether to do business in Russia or in Western allied nations, a top US official has told the BBC. Wally Adeyemo, the US Deputy Treasury Secretary, said firms could ""choose to help Russia"" in its invasion of Ukraine or ""continue to do business with the 30 countries"" that have imposed sanctions. He said Ukraine's allies were committed to issuing more sanctions. He also warned Russian oligarchs ""we're going to come for your resources"". Since Vladimir Putin ordered Russian troops to invade Ukraine, many Western companies have responded by closing down their operations or withdrawing their services from Russia. Sanctions imposed by Western countries have made trading difficult or impossible for some firms, while many others have decided to leave Russian markets for moral reasons. However, some well-known brands, such as Marks & Spencer and Burger King, continue to do business in Russia and have no power to leave due to their brands being run by franchisees in the country. The Western brands unable to leave Russia Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia BP to offload stake in Russian oil firm Rosneft Mr Adeyemo, who is leading the Biden administration's sanction efforts, spoke to the BBC on a visit to Europe to coordinate the next phase of sanctions against Russia. Asked about Chinese and Indian firms filling gaps left by western companies in Russia, Mr Adeyemo said the US would ""take action against"" anyone helping Moscow evade sanctions. ""For these countries, for these companies, for these individuals, they have a choice to make. They can choose to help Russia support their illegal illegitimate invasion of Ukraine, or they can continue to do business with the 30 countries that have joined in taking actions against Russia,"" he said. The US politician said it was clear that the US dollar, euro and pound were the backbone of the global financial system and anyone wanting to work in those currencies had to ""participate in our sanctions"". After an initial slump to record lows, the Russian currency has recovered most of its losses in the aftermath of the invasion. Key to the original drop was the unprecedented sanctioning of Russia's central bank, which limited the ability of President Putin to use its war chest of foreign exchange reserves to defend the currency. However, flows of euros and sterling to fund purchases of Russian oil and gas have continued during the war, helping stabilise the currency. Russia is the European Union's biggest oil trading partner and one of the world's largest oil exporters. Though the US and Canada have banned Russian oil imports, countries in the EU have not, due to being heavily reliant on it. The UK has said it plans to phase out Russian oil by the end of the year. But Mr Adeyemo said the money Russia is ""taking in today is no longer filling in the war chest"". ""They're using that money to buy roubles to prop up their economy,"" he added. The Russian government has ordered exporters to convert any foreign currency they receive into roubles to support the economy, he said. ""That's money they can't use to go and support the war effort,"" he added. ""So ultimately, our goal here is to make sure that we're forcing the Kremlin to make choices between supporting their domestic economy and their domestic needs, rather than being able to support the war."" Mr Adeyemo reiterated that stopping the war was the aim of Western sanctions, and that ""regime change"" was not a US policy in Russia or anywhere else.

"This video can not be played Watch Anoosheh Ashoori describe returning home after spending five years in Iranian jail Anoosheh Ashoori still has to pinch himself to be sure that he really is safe at home with his wife in south London and no longer in the ""hell"" of Evin jail in Tehran. ""I still can't believe sometimes that I am back,"" he told me from his living room in Lewisham. ""When I was in my cell I used to pinch myself when I was dreaming that I was with Sherry. Then I would wake up to the reality of being in my cell. Here, it's the other way around. "" It's a big - but happy - adjustment to a new life of freedom, which began with his favourite beer and a full English breakfast. ""Even when I'm awake, for example sitting in the garden, I sometimes say this cannot be true, this cannot be happening. I must be in my cell and I'm expecting any moment to wake up. So I'm preparing myself not to be too upset when I wake up. It's still quite a challenge for me to be easy with being here. ""Still at night sometimes I touch Sherry's hand to see if this is real, if this is happening."" Iranian-Briton's family delighted at his release 'Is that mummy?' - Nazanin home after Iran ordeal How is a UK-Iran debt linked to the prisoners' release? In August 2017, the 68-year old was visiting his elderly mother, who had just had a knee operation, when he was bundled into a van, blindfolded and later accused of spying for Israel. At first he and his family assumed it was a mistake. The retired engineer had never been involved in politics. Among his inventions: a product to protect Iranian homes after a devastating earthquake in 2003, and self-heating boots for his daughter's cake stall in Greenwich Market. ""You always ask - 'why me?'"" he says. ""It's like when there is an aircraft accident and somebody's child is in that aircraft. The mother may ask 'why me?' Why my child?"" It was only later that he realised that he was being held as a bargaining chip. Iran wanted something from Britain - the repayment of a decades-old military debt. ""It wasn't me who was important,"" he said. ""It was the passport that was being arrested - but the holder of that passport was me."" Anoosheh Ashoori and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe arrived back in the UK earlier this month On 17 March,two British-Iranian nationals - Mr Ashoori and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe- walked down the steps of a plane at RAF Brize Norton. Their release came after the UK finally paid back the money it owed Tehran for a tank deal which, after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, was not fulfilled. Although both the British and Iranian government have said the two issues should not be linked. But British-born wildlife conservationist, Morad Tahbaz, was left behind and Mr Ashoori says he can't celebrate while such a ""good"" man is still behind bars. ""He's ill and needs medical attention,"" he said. ""Sometimes I think it should have been him instead of me on that plane, and the guilty feeling you have that you have left all these good people behind is really painful. That is something I cannot come to terms with. I urge Mr Johnson to complete this good work and to make sure that they are back - Morad and the other British nationals."" He knows painfully well the conditions which they are enduring in Evin jail.  He shared a cell with cockroaches, bedbugs and 14 or 15 people - making his own headphones out of wire and foam to block out the sound of other inmates' snoring. Mr Ashoori made his own headphones to block out the sound of other inmates' snoring ""Although many of them are highly educated it is very difficult for all of you to always live in peace together. So sometimes fights happen. But then we learn to live with each other because we don't have any other choice."" The hardest part of his ordeal was at the start - when he was held in solitary confinement and interrogated for hours at time. ""I've put that behind me. I try not to think about it much,"" he says. Threats were made against his family and he tried several times to take his own life, thwarted only by prison guards. But he says the most painful part of the experience was seeing the suffering of other inmates driven mad by their incarceration. ""There are people there who are like zombies,"" he told me. ""They just go back and forth in the yard. Sometimes you see them talking to themselves and gesticulating. They're in their own world."" His family consistently protested for his release Then there's ""the shrapnel"" that hits the family members of those wrongfully imprisoned.  Mr Ashoori is well aware of the price his wife and children have paid, as they campaigned to get him free, often struggling for media and government attention. It was memories of his family, and the camaraderie of fellow-inmates, that kept him sane. ""When you are in your cell, you're always looking behind you. You're always trying to remember all the good memories that you had with your family. You're living in your memories."" To pass the days, he exercised religiously, wrote copious diary entries and formed a poetry society. ""It ended up with eight of us who would regularly meet in one of the rooms. Among us was a satirist. He said he could teach us how to write short stories. So then we had another class - short story writing. This initiated the thought that to fill up our time we could form other societies."" Mr Ashoori added: ""There was this friend who had a PhD in physics. So he started teaching us quantum mechanics. We had this very close friend who was a professor at university, teaching economics. So he started teaching us macroeconomics, microeconomics, managerial economics. We had another inmate who had served as a diplomat in Venezuela. He had learned how to speak Spanish so we started having Spanish classes. We started having a philosophy class just before I left."" He calls it ""the University of Evin"". ""You really learn how to be resilient because you have so many challenges from the time you get up,"" he says. Mr Ashoori is looking forward to getting back to family life His task now is to learn how to live a normal life again. ""He keeps asking permission for stuff - to take mugs, to do very normal things that you don't ask permission for,"" says his wife, Sherry.  ""He's very sensitive to sounds, I've noticed. For example, if we close the fridge door he'll jump."" But the couple are looking forward to ""just getting back to our ordinary life"", she said. ""Obviously we'd really like to have a nice holiday but for the moment even the daily routine of life is nice. Just having a cup of tea is nice. Sitting together watching a film or series is nice. He's missed so much over the past four and a half years. I look forward to reintroducing him to them."" The question in her mind, and in that of Mr Ashoori, is why it has taken so long to get him back home. ""They could have done this much earlier. Nazanin could have seen her beautiful daughter much earlier. I could have been back with my family,"" he says. ""This was a debt that had to be paid. Why didn't you do it earlier? Why did we have to go through all these years? Could they stand even one day of it in Evin prison? If they had actually experienced that they would have done it much earlier."" A government spokesman told the BBC: ""From the Prime Minister down, this government has been committed to securing the release of Anoosheh Ashoori. It was always entirely in Iran's gift to do this, but UK ministers and diplomats were tireless in working to secure his freedom and are delighted that he is now home. ""Our consular team were in close regular contact with Anoosheh's family, with officials available to them at any time throughout his ordeal."" My dad, the Iran hostage.

"This video can not be played ""How do you sleep at night?"" - MSP Monica Lennon questions P&O Ferries boss The boss of P&O Ferries has hit back at government calls to reinstate the 800 workers it has sacked, insisting a U-turn would cause the firm's collapse. Peter Hebblethwaite said reversing the cuts, which the firm did not consult unions on, would lead to the loss of an additional 2,200 jobs. It comes afterthe transport secretary gave P&O ""one final opportunity""to re-employ staff on their previous wages. He said the company had ""painstakingly explored all possible alternatives"". Mr Hebblethwaite said that more than 500 of the sacked crew had accepted and signed settlement agreements, and that he could not change the 31 March deadline for seafarers accepting their redundancy offers. In a letter in response to Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, Mr Hebblethwaite wrote: ""Complying with your requests would deliberately cause the company's collapse, resulting in the irretrievable loss of an additional 2,200 jobs. ""I cannot imagine that you would wish to compel an employer to bring about its downfall, affecting not hundreds but thousands of families."" P&O Ferries' decision to replace the 800 staff it sacked with agency workers earning an average of Â£5.50 per hour, which is less than the UK minimum wage, has provoked fury from the public, trade unions and politicians.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mr Shapps, as well as unions, called for Mr Hebblethwaite's resignation last week, afterhe admitted his decision to sack 800 workers without consulting unionsfirst broke the law. Mr Shapps branded the executive a ""pirate of the sea"" on Tuesday, accusing him of ""disgracefully shredding the reputation"" of the company. However, Mr Hebblethwaite said he would not step down. He said he felt compelled ""to discharge my duties for this historical company"" and provide ""the effective operation of the trade routes upon which this country depends"". ""I will there continue to do my utmost to ensure that this company has a sustainable business for the future."" This video can not be played âP&O Ferries werenât just jobs they were our homesâ The P&O Ferries boss also defended the company's new crewing model, saying it was common in the industry. He gave more detail about the model, explaining that it would use one crew instead of two. This meant staff would be paid for the actual time they worked plus holidays, instead of ""granted full pay for working 24 weeks a year"". When it sacked staff, P&O said the move was essential for the firm's survival and that it had made a Â£100m loss year-on-year, which had been covered by its parent company DP World. The multi-national ports and logistics company is based in Dubai and run by Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem. It paid a Â£270m dividend to shareholders in 2020 and runs some of the UK's biggest shipping terminals. But speaking in front of Holyrood's Net Zero, Energy and Transport Committee on Tuesday, Mr Hebblethwaite said that the company has lost an ""unsustainable amount"" of money over the last few years, and that it hadn't been competitive for the same amount of time. He also said that it was not ""appropriate"" for him or the P&O Ferries board to expect ""unconditional support"" from parent DP World for the business without a plan to become viable. Mr Hebblethwaite insisted in the letter published earlier on Tuesday most savings would ""arise from the removal of job duplication and the benefits of increased flexibility"" - not reducing wages. The government has urged the company to reconsider and has said it will force ferry operators docking in UK ports to pay the minimum wage. The need to shift to the new crewing model would not change even if the national minimum wage was applicable, Mr Hebblethwaite said. ""I can further assure you that I am fully cognisant of the reputational cost to the P&O Ferries brand and me personally,"" he added. He also reiterated his apology in front of Scottish members of parliament, saying: ""On many occasions, I have reiterated how sorry I am for the impact this has had on 800 seafarersâ¦ their families, the 2,200 people who remain in the organisation that have had to answer a number of difficult questions.

"Rhiannon Davis (pictured with her daughter Kate) was one of those who campaigned for an independent review The number of babies who could have survived with better maternity care at Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust is far worse than imagined, says Jeremy Hunt. About 201 babies might have survived had better treatment been given by the trust, the BBC has learned. Mr Hunt, who as health secretary ordered the inquiry, said he hoped the report would be ""a wake-up call"". The NHS trust has previously said it takes ""full responsibility"" for the failures. Mr Hunt said the NHS had to get rid of a blame culture and ""make it easy for people to speak openly"". ""Even in this inquiry, doctors, midwives nurses at Shrewsbury and Telford said they were silenced, they were told that there would be professional consequences if they co-operated with the inquiry,"" he said. The report would be ""very, very shocking and sobering reading"" Mr Hunt added and the number of deaths were ""far worse"" than he could have imagined at the start of the process. Live coverage: Top midwife to publish report into baby deaths He said the families who had campaigned had played ""a really extraordinary role"", but questioned why it had taken their efforts ""rather than the NHS itself being really hungry to learn from mistakes"". ""We have to get rid of that blame culture and make it easy for people to speak openly and transparently when something goes wrong,"" Mr Hunt said. A report from senior midwife Donna Ockenden, who has been leading a five-year inquiry into maternity care at the trust, will be published at 10:00 BST on Wednesday. The scale of failures uncovered is unprecedented in the history of NHS maternity care. Mothers who helped uncover the biggest NHS maternity scandal Report to be 'a blueprint for care' Ockenden report delayed for second time Significant or major concerns over the maternity care provided by the trust were found in 201 deaths - 131 stillbirths and 70 neonatal deaths. Dozens of other children sustained life changing injuries as a result of the failure to provide adequate treatment. The vast majority of cases date from 2000 to 2019. Publication of the full reporthas twice been delayed. The NHS has been working to get indemnity cover to deal with any potential legal action following the publication. Ms Ockenden's team has been examining 1,862 cases - thought to be the largest ever review of maternity care in the NHS. Families in Shropshire, who campaigned for years to get an independent review into maternity failures across the county, long suspected this would be the conclusion - but the scale of the numbers involved is likely to come as a shock to many. Rhiannon Davies said the number of deaths ""do not tell the whole story"" of the impact on families. ""I think you really must dig into the family details to understand the long-term, deep-seated pain and harm that has been meted out by such appallingly poor care at this trust,"" she said. The trust has previously apologised and also pointed out the investment and improvements made in maternity care across the NHS in England. A criminal investigation is being conducted by West Mercia Police into what happened at the trust. That the Ockenden inquiry was ordered is largely down to the work of two mothers who lost their babies due to failures of care by the trust. Ms Davies fought for years to uncover the truth about the death of her daughter Kate in 2009. It took the board of the trust until April 2016 to apologise, and accept that Kate's death was avoidable. Kayleigh Griffiths' baby Pippa died at 31 hours old in April 2016, and a few weeks later Ms Griffiths emailed Ms Davies hoping for advice on how to hold the trust to account. A year later a coroner ruled that Pippa's death had also been avoidable. The two women began to scour the internet, coroners' records and death notices to see if any other families had received poor maternity care at the Shropshire trust, and they collated 23 cases going back to 2000. They wrote to the then health secretary Jeremy Hunt in December 2016 asking for an investigation. He agreed and in May 2017, Donna Ockenden was appointed to lead the review. Shropshire is not the only area where maternity care has been called into question - in recent years independent investigations have been ordered into maternity services in Cumbria, East Kent, Nottingham and South Wales. The latest Care Quality Commission (CQC) figures show 41% of units need to improve their safety, and just 1% are rated outstanding. The CQC says the rate of improvement is not good enough.

"French sportswear retailer Decathlon has backtracked and suspended its activities in Russia following criticism of its decision to stay. It said supply chain disruption meant it could no longer operate in the country but it would continue to support its 2,500 Russian staff. Posts on social media had called for a boycott of the French company, which has 60 stores in Russia. Ukraine's foreign minister had also criticised the firm. ""In the dramatic context of Ukraine, we are following the evolution of events and particularly the situation of those directly affected,"" Decathlon said in a statement. ""In strict compliance with international sanctions, Decathlon notes that the supply conditions are no longer met to continue its activity in Russia. Decathlon has to suspend the operation of its stores."" McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Ikea are among the companies which have halted business in Russia as pressure mounts on firms to pull out following the invasion of Ukraine. Decathlon is owned by French retail giant Association Familiale Mulliez, which has been criticised for continuing its other businesses in Russia. They include supermarket chain Auchan, which has 41,000 employees and 311 stores in Russia, according to its website. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia The Western brands unable to leave Russia Some people had expressed outrage at the company's decision to keep trading in Russia on social media, alongside the hashtag #BoycottDecathlon. ""For two decades myself and my family have been a regular customer of @decathlonuk and I've freely recommended their products to others. No more,""one wrote,external. Others shared pictures of protesters,external, holding photos of victims of the war in Ukraine, outside Decathlon, Auchan and Leroy Merlin stores in Poland. On Sunday, Auchan defended its position on Russia. ""Our job is to do everything we can to ensure that the inhabitants of our countries of operation have access to good quality food at an affordable price and thus meet the essential food needs of the civilian population,""it said in a statement,external. ""Abandoning our employees, their families and our customers is not the choice we have made,"" the company added. It said it had stopped its investments in Auchan Russia and it was not currently making any profit in the country. It came after Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet: ""By refusing to end business activities in Russia, Auchan Holding makes a conscious choice to further sponsor Russian atrocities in Ukraine and make blood profits."" He called on customers to boycott the company, along with Decathlon and home improvement chain Leroy Merlin, which is also owned by Association Familiale Mulliez. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky used an address to France's Parliament to call on French companies, including Auchan and car manufacturer Renault, to pull out of Russia. Renault later announced that it was suspending its work at its Moscow factory.

"Almost 100 years after he entered the world on a dining room table in Corfu, Prince Philip's final journey began at 14.38 BST on a chilly spring afternoon in the English town of Windsor. The duke's coffin was carried by Grenadier Guardsmen from the inner hall of Windsor Castle onto a green Land Rover, waiting outside. The vehicle - built in 2003 in the West Midlands town of Solihull - was designed by the duke himself. The coffin was draped with the duke's personal standard, with flowers chosen by the Queen and the duke's Admiral of the Fleet Naval Cap and sword, pointing forwards. As the military band in the castle grounds played the national anthem, the Queen - wearing a face mask - made her way from the Sovereign's Entrance of the castle to the State Bentley. Under bright blue skies, the eight-minute procession then began, led by Prince Charles and Princess Anne, the duke's two eldest children. Princes William and Harry were either side of their cousin, Peter Phillips. The State Bentley followed behind - the Queen, for once, behind her husband, rather than two steps in front. Before the coffin entered St George's Chapel, a minute's silence was held - both in the castle and around the country. And then, step by step, Royal Marines took the coffin into the chapel, followed by the duke's family - all of them, by now, wearing black masks. As the coffin was carried into the chapel, illuminated by shafts of light from the stained glass windows, the choir sang, and the Dean of Windsor began the service. The BBC's Eleanor Oldroyd was the only reporter or broadcaster inside the chapel - she was in a small, specially-built studio above the high altar. ""Doing something inside the chapel is very special, it's a very unique position, and it's a very responsible position as well,"" she says. ""It's a moving time for a lot of people."" ""There was one moment when I just saw the Duke of York, sitting two seats along from the Queen, just turn to her and check - just as if he was checking that she was OK,"" says Ms Oldroyd. ""I don't know whether that's what he was doing, but it felt to me a little moment of concern to mother from son."" At 15.42, the coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault. ""A real moment of drama and theatre, but also a very moving moment,"" says Ms Oldroyd. The duke's final journey had ended. And then, as the Queen stood alone, the choir sang the national anthem. Two minutes later, the funeral finished and the guests left the chapel. The duke was in his resting place and his epic, international adventure - which began on a Greek island in 1921 - was over.

"This video can not be played Watch the Queen deliver her Christmas message for 2021 The Queen has paid tribute to her husband in her first annual Christmas message since his death. ""Christmas can be hard for those who have lost loved ones. This year especially I understand why,"" she said in a personal message. She described Prince Philip as her ""beloved"", and said she felt his presence over the festive period. The Queen's comments about loss come against the background of another year of the pandemic. Speaking beside a photograph of them together, the Queen paid tribute to the late Duke of Edinburgh, her ""irrepressible"" husband of 73 years. The Queen and Prince Philip on honeymoon, with the same sapphire brooch in view ""That mischievous, inquiring twinkle was as bright at the end as when I first set eyes on him,"" she said. ""But life of course consists of final partings as well as first meetings. ""And as much as I and my family miss him, I know he would want us to enjoy Christmas,"" said the Queen, remembering his ""capacity to squeeze fun out of any situation"". Queen cancels spending Christmas at Sandringham A look back at the Royal Family's 2021 'Seeing the Queen is part of our Christmas magic' The framed photograph in view during the broadcast was taken during their diamond wedding anniversary in 2007 - and the Queen was wearing the same sapphire brooch that appears in the photograph. She also wore the same brooch, in the form of a chrysanthemum, on her honeymoon in 1947. This week Buckingham Palace announced plans for a service of thanksgiving for the life of Prince Philip, to be held at Westminster Abbey in the spring. The Queen's Christmas message felt more personal than expected. It was really quite touching and a departure from the normal Christmas broadcast, which is typically a reflection on the year. This broadcast was very personal and one got an impression of the keen sense of loss that she clearly feels for the man who was her husband for 73 years. There's very little mention of Covid, just a passing reference that it has once again disrupted Christmas plans - including the Queen's. She had planned to go to Sandringham, her Norfolk estate, but she has stayed at Windsor and been joined by six members of her family today, including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. This Christmas broadcast is the first time we've had a chance to see the Queen face to face - nine weeks after she cancelled her trip to Northern Ireland for health reasons. Next year will be significant for the Queen and for the monarchy, because it will be her Platinum Jubilee, marking 70 years since she acceded to the throne in February 1952. After another year of uncertainty with the pandemic, the Queen spoke of the reassuring comfort of family traditions, such as ""watching a favourite film where we already know the ending"". Royal aides declined to say what such a favourite film might be - although her grandson Prince William recently pointed to Elf as one of his seasonal favourites. The speech highlighted the importance of ""passing the baton"" to the next generation, in a year when the 95-year-old monarch has had her own health problems. The Christmas broadcast, recorded in Windsor Castle, was the Queen's most extensive appearance since having to withdraw from a series of events during the autumn. The Queen at the funeral of her husband Prince Philip, observing pandemic restrictions at the time The Queen praised the work of Prince Charles and Prince William at the COP26 climate change summit and their commitment to the ""stewardship of the environment"". She looked ahead to the Platinum Jubilee next year, marking 70 years of her reign, which she hoped would bring a ""sense of togetherness"" and a chance to take stock of the ""enormous changes"" over those decades. The broadcast included a community choir, called Singology, that helped to bring people together during the pandemic. There were glimpses of the royal family at events during the year, but there were no mentions of Prince Andrew, Prince Harry or Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. Channel migrants deserve compassion - archbishop Armed intruder arrested in Windsor Castle grounds As a precaution against rising levels of the Omicron variant, the Queen is staying in Windsor Castle, rather than spending Christmas as usual on her Sandringham estate. Members of her family have been with her on Christmas day, including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. Earlier,a 19-year-old man armed with an ""offensive weapon"" was arrested in the grounds of Windsor Castle, police said. Thames Valley Police said the man, who is from Southampton, was found within ""moments"" of entering the grounds at 08:30 GMT. He was arrested on suspicion of breach or trespass of a protected site and possession of an offensive weapon. The force said he did not enter any buildings and members of the Royal Family had been informed. At Sandringham, the Queen would usually have attended a Christmas morning local church service - and in her message the Queen spoke of the ""bedrock of my faith"". For a year of such personal and public upheavals, she quoted the Christmas carol, O Little Town of Bethlehem, with the lines: ""The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight."" The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall went to a church service in Windsor before joining the Queen for Christmas Day Many members of the Royal Family attended a morning church service at St George's Chapel in Windsor. Charles and Camilla went to the Christmas Matins service ahead of spending the day with the Queen. The couple were joined at the chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle by the Earl and Countess of Wessex and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. It is understood the Queen's absence from the service is a personal choice and follows a precautionary approach seen over the last six months amid rising coronavirus cases. Meanwhile, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge tweeted that this Christmas would be different to what so many people had planned. Prince William and Kate wrote:,external""From those who are alone or having to isolate away from loved ones, to the incredible people supporting our NHS and caring for those most in need - we are thinking of you."" The duchess also surprised an audience at a community carol concert as she took to the piano alongside musician Tom Walker. The service, which was held at Westminster Abbey, was broadcast last night on ITV. Catherine was joined at the service by Prince William and other members of the Royal Family including Zara and Mike Tindall, Sophie Wessex, and Princess Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.

"In public, Prince Philip always took second place He outlived nearly everyone who knew him and might explain him. And so we have been left with a two-dimensional portrait of the duke; salt-tongued and short-tempered, a man who told off-colour jokes and made politically incorrect remarks, an eccentric great-uncle who'd been around forever and towards whom most people felt affection - but who rather too often embarrassed himself and others in company. With his death will come reassessment. Because Prince Philip was an extraordinary man who lived an extraordinary life; a life intimately connected with the sweeping changes of our turbulent 20th Century, a life of fascinating contrast and contradiction, of service and some degree of solitude. A complex, clever, eternally restless man. His mother and father met at the funeral of Queen Victoria in 1901. At a time when all but four of Europe's nations were monarchies, his relatives were scattered through European royalty. Some royal houses were swept away by World War One; but the world into which Philip was born was still one where monarchies were the norm. His grandfather was the King of Greece; his great-aunt Ella was murdered along with the Russian tsar, by the Bolsheviks, at Ekaterinberg; his mother was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria. His four older sisters would all marry Germans. While Philip fought for Britain in the Royal Navy, three of his sisters actively supported the Nazi cause; none would be invited to his wedding. When peace came, and with it eventual economic recovery, Philip would throw himself into the construction of a better Britain, urging the country to adopt scientific methods, embracing the ideas of industrial design, planning, education and training. A decade before Harold Wilson talked of the ""white heat of the technological revolution"", Philip was urging modernity on the nation in speeches and interviews.  And as the country and the world became richer and consumed ever more, Philip warned of the impact on the environment, well before it was even vaguely fashionable. Eighteen months after his birth, his family was in exile His childhood quickly taught him the values of self-reliance He was forged by the turmoil of his first decade and then moulded by his schooling. His early years were spent wandering, as his place of birth ejected him, his family disintegrated and he moved from country to country, none of them ever his own. When he was just a year old, he and his family were scooped up by a British destroyer from his home on the Greek island of Corfu after his father had been condemned to death. They were deposited in Italy.  One of Philip's first international journeys was spent crawling around on the floor of the train from an Italian port city, ""the grubby child on the desolate train pulling out of the Brindisi night,"" as his sister Sophia later described it. In Paris, he lived in a house borrowed from a relative; but it was not destined to become a home. In just one year, while he was at boarding school in Britain, the mental health of his mother, Princess Alice, deteriorated and she went into an asylum; his father, Prince Andrew, went off to Monte Carlo to live with his mistress; and his four sisters married and went to live in Germany.  In the space of 10 years he had gone from a prince of Greece to a wandering, homeless, and virtually penniless boy with no-one to care for him. ""I don't think anybody thinks I had a father,"" he once said. Andrew would die during the war. Philip went to Monte Carlo to pick up his father's possessions after the Germans had been driven from France; there was almost nothing left, just a couple of clothes brushes and some cuff-links. By the time he went to Gordonstoun, a private school on the north coast of Scotland, Philip was tough, independent and able to fend for himself; he'd had to be. Gordonstoun would channel those traits into the school's distinct philosophy of community service, teamwork, responsibility and respect for the individual.  And it sparked one of the great passions of Philip's life - his love of the sea. Philip adored the school as much as his son Charles would despise it.  Not just because the stress it put on physical as well as mental excellence - he was a great sportsman.  But because of its ethos, laid down by its founder Kurt Hahn, an exile from Nazi Germany. Prince Philip became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy But he had to give up his career to support the Queen The Duke of Edinburgh's children would not bear his name, Mountbatten That ethos became a significant, perhapsthesignificant, part of the way that Philip believed life should be lived. It shines through the speeches he gave later in his life. ""The essence of freedom,"" he would say in Ghana in 1958, ""is discipline and self-control."" The comforts of the post-war era, he told the British Schools Exploring Society a year earlier, may be important ""but it is much more important that the human spirit should not be stifled by easy living"". And two years before that, he spoke to the boys of Ipswich School of the moral as well as material imperatives of life, with the ""importance of the individual"" as the ""guiding principle of our society"". And at Gordonstoun was born one of the great contradictions of Philip's fascinating life. The importance of the individual was what in Kurt Hahn's eyes differentiated Britain and liberal democracies from the kind of totalitarian dictatorship that he had fled. Philip put that centrality of the individual, and individual agency - the ability we have as humans to make our own moral and ethical decisions - at the heart of his philosophy. And yet he was throughout his life, first in the navy and then in the many decades of life in the Palace, tightly bound by rules of tradition, of precedent, of command and hierarchy. He had little, if anything, in the way of agency. Did he say one thing and do another, as members of the Royal Family are often accused of? Or was his first choice - to serve - by necessity his last? The navy ran deep in the Duke of Edinburgh's family. He is pictured sitting at the wheel of the nuclear-powered submarine HMS Churchill Prince Philip gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests At Dartmouth Naval College in 1939, the two great passions of his life would collide. He had learned to sail at Gordonstoun; he would learn to lead at Dartmouth. And his driving desire to achieve, and to win, would shine through. Despite entering the college far later than most other cadets, he would graduate top of his class in 1940. In further training at Portsmouth, he gained the top grade in four out of five sections of the exam. He became one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy. The navy ran deep in his family. His maternal grandfather had been the First Sea Lord, the commander of the Royal Navy; his uncle, ""Dickie"" Mountbatten, had command of a destroyer while Philip was in training. In war, he showed not only bravery but guile. It was his natural milieu. ""Prince Philip"", wrote Gordonstoun headmaster Kurt Hahn admiringly, ""will make his mark in any profession where he will have to prove himself in a trial of strength"". Others had their reservations about the brilliant and ambitious young officer. In peace, once he had his own command, he drove his men hard, much too hard for some.  ""If he had a fault, it was a tendency to intolerance,"" wrote one biographer.  That kind of comment would recur. Contemporaries were more blunt. ""One of his crew,"" writes another biographer, ""said he would rather die than serve under him again."" In Dartmouth in 1939, as war became ever more certain, the navy was his destiny.  He had fallen in love with the sea itself. ""It is an extraordinary master or mistress,"" he would say later, ""it has such extraordinary moods.""  But a rival to the sea would come. When King George VI toured the Naval College, accompanied by Philip's uncle, he brought with him his daughter, Princess Elizabeth. Philip was asked to look after her. He showed off to her, vaulting the nets of the tennis court in the grounds of the college. He was confident, outgoing, strikingly handsome, of royal blood if without a throne.  She was beautiful, a little sheltered, a little serious, and very smitten by Philip. Prince Philip with his uncle, Earl Mountbatten, at the Royal Marines Barracks in 1965 The Queen, with one of the Royal corgis, chats with polo-playing Prince Philip at Windsor Great Park Their engagement was announced in July 1947 Did he know then that this was a collision of two great passions? That he could not have the sea and the beautiful young woman? For a time after their wedding in 1948, he did have both. As young newlyweds in Malta, he had what he so prized - command of a ship -  and they had two idyllic years together. But the illness and then early death of King George VI brought it all to an end. He knew what it meant, the moment he was told.  Up in a lodge in Kenya, touring Africa, with Princess Elizabeth in place of the King, Philip was told first of the monarch's death. He looked, said his equerry Mike Parker, ""as if a tonne of bricks had fallen on him"". For some time he sat, slumped in a chair, a newspaper covering his head and chest. His princess had become the Queen.  His world had changed irrevocably. For someone who almost never displayed anything close to self-pity, and rarely spoke of his own emotions, he was by his own standards candid about the loss of his naval calling. ""There's never been 'if only',"" he said once, ""except perhaps that I regret not having been able to continue a career in the navy"". Those who knew the man and his passions are blunter.  The former First Sea Lord, Admiral Lord West, says Philip did his duty; but of the end of his time in the navy he says, ""I know it was a huge loss to him.  I know it."" That moment, when princess became Queen, revealed another great contradiction of Philip's life. He was born and brought up in a world almost entirely run by men.  He was a rugged, physical man who was brought up and then worked in an entirely male environment. He celebrated masculinity, telling Mike Parker on the birth of his first son Charles, ""It takes a man to have a boy."" But literally overnight, and for 65 years to follow, it became his life to support his wife, the Queen. He would walk behind her. He would give up his job for her. He would apologise if he came into a room after her. At her coronation he knelt before her, his hands enclosed by hers, and swore to be her ""liege man of life and limb"". His children would not bear his name, Mountbatten. ""I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba,"" he exclaimed at that. But there was nothing to be done. She was the Queen. He was her husband. Prince Philip talked of the upending of circumstance little. ""Within the house,"" he said of the time before the Queen's accession, ""I suppose I naturally filled the principal position. People used to come and ask me what to do.  In 1952 the whole thing changed very, very considerably."" Prince Philip had hundreds of patronages and projects with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport Prince Philip helped sustain the monarchy The transition to life in the Palace was brutal. ""Philip,"" said his equerry, ""was constantly being squashed, snubbed, ticked off, rapped over the knuckles... I felt Philip did not have any friends or helpers."" Philip may not have helped himself; one biographer writes that in the early years Palace staff felt he was ""difficult to deal with... prickly... arrogant... defensive"". He was looked upon with suspicion by some in the court, as something of an adventurer, as perhaps a fortune hunter.  He had German blood, and this was just after the herculean effort of defeating Nazi Germany. In response, Philip began what would become a lifetime of near-ceaseless activity; abroad he was at the side of the Queen on the long tours they undertook, sometimes breaking off to pursue interests particular to him - sporting, industrial or research. She nearly always travelled with him as her companion; but he also travelled alone.  It was he, not she, that made the farewells to colonial possessions in the 1950s and 1960s. At home there were patronages and projects, hundreds upon hundreds of them, with a focus on youth, science, the outdoors and sport. He played cricket, squash, polo; he swam, sailed, rowed and rode horses and carriage drove. He learnt to fly, and developed his own photographs. Within the Palace he was a moderniser, striding the corridors, rootling around the cellars, trying to find out what everyone did. He took over the management of the estate at Sandringham and over the years significantly redeveloped it. ""He believes he has a creative mission,"" wrote an early biographer, ""to present the monarchy as a dynamic, involved and responsive institution that will address itself to some of the problems of contemporary British society."" He was young and very good looking; he smiled and joked and was at ease in front of the cameras. When he visited a boys' club in London in the late 1950s, a photo shows him with a broad smile on his face, looking crisp in a double-breasted pinstripe suit, his hair slicked back with brilliantine, surrounded by the upturned faces of boys and their mothers all shoving and trying to get close to him. There is more than a whiff of Beatlemania to the moment. In his study on the first floor of Buckingham Palace, overlooking the gardens and Green Park, surrounded by thousands of books, with a model of his first command HMS Magpie to one side, he would research and write and type out his speeches. (In 1986 he would buy, always the moderniser, what he called a ""splendid gadget"" that he called ""a miniature word processor"".) He gave between 60 and 80 speeches every year, decade after decade, on topics that reflected his vast range of interests. Out of the speeches comes a picture of the man.  For someone who sat through so much of it, he was clearly impatient with ceremony. ""A lot of time and energy,"" he told students and staff at the Chesterfield College of Technology, ""has been spent on arranging for you to listen to me to take a long time to declare open a building which everyone knows is open already."" Reflecting his dizzying range of interests, there was sometimes a touch of the gentleman-farmer to his thoughts - well-organised arguments that don't really go anywhere, a lot of anecdotal evidence (""it seems to me..."") garnered from his extensive travels. Despite modernising instincts, he was a conservative, somewhat suspicious of the machinations of the big city. He spoke of ""urban dwellers"" and of the ""average citizen"" dumping rubbish from their car. He preferred practical solutions to highfalutin theory - ""The enterprise is doomed,"" he told the Commonwealth Conference on Industrial Relations, ""if it is allowed to enter the rarefied atmosphere of theory."" He was an environmentalist before anyone really knew what that was. He warned of the ""greedy and senseless exploitation of nature."" And in 1982 he brought up a topic that now grips us, but back then was almost never spoken of, ""a hotly-debated issue directly attributable to the development of industry... the build-up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere,"" which he referred to as the ""greenhouse effect"". His relationship with his eldest son improved in later years And he constantly did himself down, shrugging as to why anyone should want to hear him speak: ""I have very little experience of self-government,"" he told one audience, ""I am one of the most governed people you could meet...."" His example of irrational behaviour? - ""making and listening to speeches on important occasions"". Or speaking before the Brussels Expo in 1958 - ""I feel I can claim to be an expert at going round exhibitions."" He knew most speeches were a dull formality that had to be got through - and he was happy to let his audience have a laugh at his expense. It is another contradiction in a life of them; that someone who cared so much about how we live our lives, about how to pursue a good and moral life, about how government and society might try to channel our instincts, should end up being popularly portrayed as a saloon-bar bore, his retirement from public life in 2017 accompanied by lists of his ""gaffes"", off-colour comments and salty jokes. That he could be rude, startlingly so at times, there is no doubt. Part of it was impatience, that dynamo whirring away, the desire to get things done double-quick. Part of it may have been deafness, inherited from his almost wholly deaf mother. But part of it was just plain bad manners, a disregard for what others felt and a thoughtlessness that came from position and temperament. There was for a long time a fair amount of barking and shouting at those who failed to please him, and not a lot of thanking those that did. Looking back down the decades, two great contrasts stand out. The first, that between a life led in the public eye, and a really quite private man. The boy shuttling between guardians and schools and countries quickly learnt to seal off his private side from public view. Inside the Palace it became his world view. Most of his biographers' personal queries were met with a shrug, as if to say ""I don't know why you are bothering"". He once said of his son Charles: ""He is a romantic, I am a pragmatist. And because I don't see things as a romantic would, I'm [perceived as] unfeeling."" There can be little doubt that he was stung by the accusation. But his inner thoughts were not for public consumption. And the second great, related, contrast is that between the near unceasing whirl of his public life, and a degree of solitude in his private. Of course there was family, though all his sisters pre-deceased him. But few, if any, great friendships are recorded, a corollary of his private nature and the pattern of his many decades. ""Life,"" wrote one biographer, ""hasn't enabled him to build up friendships. He is going round the world at such a lick."" And royalty is its own curious cage, repelling outsiders. ""What the royal family offers you is friendliness,"" said the late James Callaghan, prime minister in the 1970s, ""not friendship."" Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures Duke of Edinburgh: A life in London Major General Charles Stickland of the Royal Marines, of which for 64 years Philip was Captain General, tells of when the duke flew into an exercise in Norway. He was supposed to say a quick hello to the enlisted men and then have lunch with the commanding officer. Instead he ""asked two of the corporals to spoon food into his mess tin, sat on a Bergan [rucksack], told stories and chatted away with my troops when he was supposed to be having a posh lunch and then got back on the helicopter, having inspired a group of young men as to why it was great to be a Royal Marine"". It was vintage Philip; no ceremony, hierarchy pushed to one side, the big group over the more intimate gathering. Because of his desire for privacy, because of his position, and because nearly all who knew him best have gone, our understanding of him will always be incomplete. But that's also because of what kind of person he was, because of the contradictions and contrasts that emerged over the decades. ""A mercurial man like His Royal Highness,"" said the artist and architect Sir Hugh Casson, ""needs a loose fit portrait."" He was asked once what his life had been about (the sort of question that normally received an incredulous snort). Had it been about supporting the Queen? ""Absolutely, absolutely,"" he replied. He didn't see himself as a leader, though lead he could. And his own achievements he consistently played down. Accepting the Freedom of the City of London in 1948, he spoke for himself and for what he called other ""followers"", with trademark modesty. ""Our only distinction,"" he said, ""was that we did what we were told to do, to the very best of our ability, and kept on doing it."" The Royal family Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ukraine's president has said his government is prepared to discuss adopting a neutral status as part of a peace deal with Russia. In an interview with independent Russian journalists, Volodymyr Zelensky said any such deal would have to be put to a referendum in Ukraine. He has made similar comments before, but rarely so forcefully. The news comes as the negotiations between the two countries are set to resume this week in Turkey. ""Security guarantees and neutrality, non-nuclear status of our state. We are ready to go for it. This is the most important point,"" Mr Zelensky said in the 90-minute video call. Neutrality means a country does not ally itself militarily with others. Mr Zelensky said that any potential agreement would require a face-to-face meeting with President Putin and that effective security guarantees that Ukraine would not come under attack were essential. The Ukrainian leader - speaking in Russian throughout - added that Russia's invasion has caused the destruction of Russian-speaking cities in Ukraine. Later, in an overnight video address to his nation, Mr Zelensky said Ukraine sought peace ""without delay"". Russia's President Vladimir Putin has long demanded a neutral Ukraine, and guarantees that it would not join the Nato military alliance. After the country achieved independence in 1991, as the Soviet Union collapsed, it has gradually veered towards the West -to both the EU and Nato. But Russia's leader aims to reverse that, seeing the fall of the Soviet Union as the ""disintegration of historical Russia"". He has claimed Russians and Ukrainians are one people and denied Ukraine its long history. On Sunday, the Russian state media regulator Roskomnadzor instructed the press not to publish the interview with Ukraine's leader, and said ""an investigation has been started in order to identify the level of responsibility and what response will be taken"" in relation to those who carried out the interview. Roskomnadzor notes some of the media outlets that conducted the interview are designated ""foreign agents"" in Russia. The country recently passed new laws restricting the way in which Russian media can report on the war in Ukraine. The interview was published by outlets now based outside Russia. Ukraine's military intelligence chief hasaccused Moscow of seeking to split Ukraine in two, mirroring North and South Korea, after Russia failed to take control of the whole country. But a senior adviser to President Zelensky, Alexander Rodnyansky, told the BBC that Ukraine would make no concessions on handing over territory to Russia. ""We're certainly not willing to give up any territory or talk about our territorial integrity,"" Mr Rodnyansky told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. ""If you ask the people who live in these areas, they wouldn't want to live in Russia. How can we leave them? Let alone the whole idea of slicing up our country."" The possibility of Ukrainian neutrality is not new. It's been discussed by Russian and Ukrainian officials for at least two weeks. But President Zelensky's reference is perhaps the most explicit so far. Clearly, there's no room for Nato membership in such a vision of Ukraine's future. Removing that aspiration from Ukraine's constitution (it was added in 2019) will need to be put to a referendum. With support for membership at an all-time high, it will be a bitter pill for many Ukrainians to swallow. The key will be what sort of security guarantees can possibly take the place of being a member of the Western alliance. Ukrainian officials insist that guarantees will need to be much more specific than the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, which gave Ukraine security assurances in return for giving up its stock of nuclear weapons. Ukraine will want to know the precise terms under which countries are prepared to come to its defence in the event of further Russian aggression. There are many versions of neutrality. Finding one that meets the competing needs of Kyiv and Moscow will not be simple. And what will Ukraine's borders actually be? President Zelensky says Russian troops must retreat to positions held before Moscow's full-scale invasion began on 24 February. He says Ukraine will not try and retake the Donbas or Crimea by force, but Ukrainian officials are not yet ready simply to give up on territories that have been under Russian control (direct or indirect) since 2014.

"He became an orphan aged three but went on to become one of the world's richest men. Now Roman Abramovich's links to Vladimir Putin have stripped him of his businesses and reputation. ""I'm sure people will focus on me for three or four days but it will pass,"" said the Russian billionaire when he bought Chelsea Football Club in 2003. ""They'll forget who I am, and I like that."" There's little chance of anonymity now, given the events of the last few weeks. Following years of demands for greater scrutiny of Mr Abramovich's dealings, the UK government has frozen his UK-held assets - including his homes, artworks and Chelsea FC - and imposed a travel ban. It has accused him of being complicit with Mr Putin in the invasion of Ukraine. This fall from grace for a man who has dominated British football but sharply divided sports fans in the process will be cheered by some. But he has overcome huge challenges before, notably in his early life. Roman Arkadyevich Abramovich was born in Saratov in south-western Russia, a few hundred miles from the border with Ukraine, in 1966. His mother, Irina, died of blood poisoning when he was one year old and his father died two years later after an accident with a construction crane. After that Mr Abramovich was raised by relatives, spending time in Komi, in north-west Russia, where money was tight and winter temperatures low. ""To tell the truth I cannot call my childhood bad,"" he once told the Guardian in a rare interview. ""In your childhood you can't compare things: one eats carrots, one eats candy, both taste good. As a child you cannot tell the difference."" As a young conscript He left school at 16, worked as a mechanic and served in the Red Army before selling plastic toys in Moscow. He moved on to perfumes and deodorants, building up his wealth as greater openness under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev allowed more scope for entrepreneurs. The disintegration of the Soviet Union, and with it state command of mineral assets, provided more opportunities, and in his mid-20s, Mr Abramovich had a further stroke of good fortune. He seized the oil company Sibneft from the Russian government in a rigged auction in 1995 for around $250m (Â£190m). He sold it back to the government for $13bn (Â£9.9bn ) in 2005. His lawyers say there is no basis for alleging he amassed very substantial wealth through criminality. However, in 2012, he admitted in a UK court that he had made corrupt payments to help get the Sibneft deal going. Abramovich, far left, with friends in Moscow in his younger days He became involved in the ""aluminium wars"" of the 1990s, in which oligarchs - those who had accrued vast fortunes and political power after the Soviet collapse - fought for control of this vast industry. ""Every three days, someone was being murdered,"" Mr Abramovich said in 2011, adding that this threat to his safety had made him a reluctant participant. But Mr Abramovich further proved his own toughness, accruing hundreds of millions of pounds amid the chaos. Secret paper highlights corrupt Abramovich deals He became an ally of President Boris Yeltsin and a player in Moscow's post-Soviet political scene, even having an apartment in the Kremlin for a while. When Mr Yeltsin resigned in 1999, Mr Abramovich was reportedly among those to back the prime minister and former KGB spy, Vladimir Putin, as his successor. As Mr Putin established himself, he sought to assert his dominance over the oligarchs. Some went to prison, and others were exiled if they failed to show allegiance. He served as governor of Chukotka in Putin's early days as president Mr Abramovich suffered neither fate. In 2000, he was elected as governor of the deprived region of Chukotka, at the north-eastern tip of Russia. He gained popularity after investing his own money in social services but stepped down in 2008. All the while, he kept his business interests going, taking on the trappings of wealth - buying up paintings, houses, cars. In an unusual move for a man widely described as quiet, even shy, in 2003 Mr Abramovich made himself famous around the footballing world when he purchased Chelsea, west London's largest club, in a deal worth Â£140m. ""My whole philosophy in life is to bring in professional teams,"" hetold the Financial Times.,external""In Chukotka I have professional teams on the ground and I will do this here too."" Under the management of Jose Mourinho and others, Mr Abramovich's wealth helped Chelsea towards five Premier Leagues, two Champions Leagues and five FA Cups. The Abramovich years have brought unprecedented success to Chelsea FC Oligarchs' money has flooded into London in recent years. Mr Abramovich's own property portfolio is believed to include a15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens in west London, reportedly worth more than Â£150m; a flat in Chelsea; a ranch in Colorado; and a holiday home on the French Riviera. His yachts - the Solaris and the Eclipse - are among the world's largest. Mr Abramovich, who has been divorced three times, also owns a personal jet. Asked by the Guardian in 2006 about what money can do for a person, he replied: ""It cannot buy you happiness. Some independence, yes."" He certainly has plenty of money. Financial media giantBloomberg estimates Mr Abramovich's fortune,externalat $13.7bn (Â£10.6bn), ranking him as the world's 128th richest person. Its rivalForbes sets it at $12.3bn (Â£9.4bn),,externalplacing him 142nd. What is under severe question, though, is the extent of his independence from Mr Putin. Last year, Mr Abramovich sued publishing House HarperCollins for libel over a book, Putin's People by Catherine Belton, that claimed the Russian president had ordered him to buy Chelsea. Roman Abramovich owns two superyachts, including Solaris (pictured here in Barcelona) The two sides settled out of court, with the publisher agreeing to make some clarifications. But Mr Abramovich's associations with Mr Putin have continued to dog him, particularly when Russian forces built up on the border with Ukraine and then invaded. When the freezing of the UK assets of Mr Abramovich and six other oligarchs was announced, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""With their close links to Putin, they are complicit in his aggression. The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands."" Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Mr Abramovich announced the sale of Chelsea eight days before the sanctions were imposed. Some fans have continued to chant Mr Abramovich's name, but many politicians are calling for his assets to be seized, not just frozen. ""I hope that I will be able to visit Stamford Bridge one last time to say goodbye to all of you in person,"" Mr Abramovich has told Chelsea supporters. But a return to west London is unlikely for some time. In a bizarre twist, it has now emerged thatMr Abramovich suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning - along with senior Ukrainian negotiators -at peace talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border in early March.

"Dyfed-Powys Police boss Richard Lewis wants a unified service by 2030 Wales' four police forces should be scrapped and replaced with a single nationwide service, according to Dyfed-Powys Police's new chief constable. Former Cleveland Police boss Dr Richard Lewis has said this should be in place by 2030. ""(If) the Americans can put a man on the moon in eight years, I think we can unify four police services,"" he said. The Home Office said the existing structure meant everyone had a direct say on policing in their area. And South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast, the idea of having one single Welsh force was ""stupid"". But Dr Lewis said merging forces into Heddlu Cymru - Welsh for Police Wales - would be more effective. It would be the third largest force in England and Wales, behind the Metropolitan Police and West Midlands Police. Ravers leave after police given extra powers South Wales Police response criticised in independent review Former PC guilty of gross misconduct Carmarthenshire-born Dr Lewis said: ""Doing away with those borders means we can provide a more effective service. ""One chief constable rather than four. One deputy chief constable. Dare I say one commissioner instead of four."" A merger would create a service with more than 7,400 police officers, according to Home Office figures. He denied combining the police would be cuts driven. The force covers an area greater than half the land mass of Wales ""What policing needs across the country is further investment,"" he said. ""We've seen the government uplift figure of 20,000 officers. I'd like to see something similar for police staff members as well."" Dr Lewis said he recognised concerns that resources could be concentrated on towns and cities under one force. He believed that could be dealt with by creating ""shadow structures"" to ensure officers working in rural areas remained there. In Scotland eight forces merged to form Police Scotland in 2013, and has faced problems. Dr Lewis said: ""Police Scotland had a difficult start but I think they're now seeing the benefits of having one national service in Scotland. ""We can learn the lessons, of course, from those early days in Scotland... creating national structures in the IT world et cetera."" Devolution of the police, he said, was a political matter. Richard Lewis denied combining the police would be cuts driven He said: ""My concern is around the way we structure our policing services in Wales. ""I understand not everybody will be of the same opinion, but Lord Thomas' report on Justice in Wales,suggested a number of changes that have now been seen, such as a national policing board for Wales. ""National structures do exist. What I'm proposing is a development of those things."" He admitted if there was a unified force, devolution of policing ""may be easier to achieve"". He's called for a national debate about whether a ""single police force is what the public want to see"". ""President Kennedy, in 1962, said that he would put a man on the moon by the end of decade,"" he said. ""If, starting from scratch, the Americans can put a man on the moon in eight years, I think we can unify four police services in Wales."" But Alun Michael said: ""It would be an idea to discuss this within the police first before coming out with a stupid idea such as this. ""I have a lot of respect for Richard Lewis, he will be successful in his own patch but... the roots of policing must be kept local. ""The reactive element of policing can be run in larger areas such as Wales-wide and in the English regions, but it would lose the Chief Constable's accountability to communities. That is what has happened in Scotland."" South Wales Police and Gwent Police declined to comment on Dr Lewis' views. North Wales Police has been asked to comment. A merger would create a service with more 7,400 than police officers, according to Home Office figures A Home Office spokesman said: ""The existing police force structure in Wales ensures everyone has a direct say on policing in their area through their locally elected and accountable police and crime commissioner. ""Chief constables and police and crime commissioners collaborate with other forces on a wide range of functions to improve the service they provide to the public.""

"This video can not be played Watch Anoosheh Ashoori describe returning home after spending five years in Iranian jail Anoosheh Ashoori still has to pinch himself to be sure that he really is safe at home with his wife in south London and no longer in the ""hell"" of Evin jail in Tehran. ""I still can't believe sometimes that I am back,"" he told me from his living room in Lewisham. ""When I was in my cell I used to pinch myself when I was dreaming that I was with Sherry. Then I would wake up to the reality of being in my cell. Here, it's the other way around. "" It's a big - but happy - adjustment to a new life of freedom, which began with his favourite beer and a full English breakfast. ""Even when I'm awake, for example sitting in the garden, I sometimes say this cannot be true, this cannot be happening. I must be in my cell and I'm expecting any moment to wake up. So I'm preparing myself not to be too upset when I wake up. It's still quite a challenge for me to be easy with being here. ""Still at night sometimes I touch Sherry's hand to see if this is real, if this is happening."" Iranian-Briton's family delighted at his release 'Is that mummy?' - Nazanin home after Iran ordeal How is a UK-Iran debt linked to the prisoners' release? In August 2017, the 68-year old was visiting his elderly mother, who had just had a knee operation, when he was bundled into a van, blindfolded and later accused of spying for Israel. At first he and his family assumed it was a mistake. The retired engineer had never been involved in politics. Among his inventions: a product to protect Iranian homes after a devastating earthquake in 2003, and self-heating boots for his daughter's cake stall in Greenwich Market. ""You always ask - 'why me?'"" he says. ""It's like when there is an aircraft accident and somebody's child is in that aircraft. The mother may ask 'why me?' Why my child?"" It was only later that he realised that he was being held as a bargaining chip. Iran wanted something from Britain - the repayment of a decades-old military debt. ""It wasn't me who was important,"" he said. ""It was the passport that was being arrested - but the holder of that passport was me."" Anoosheh Ashoori and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe arrived back in the UK earlier this month On 17 March,two British-Iranian nationals - Mr Ashoori and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe- walked down the steps of a plane at RAF Brize Norton. Their release came after the UK finally paid back the money it owed Tehran for a tank deal which, after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, was not fulfilled. Although both the British and Iranian government have said the two issues should not be linked. But British-born wildlife conservationist, Morad Tahbaz, was left behind and Mr Ashoori says he can't celebrate while such a ""good"" man is still behind bars. ""He's ill and needs medical attention,"" he said. ""Sometimes I think it should have been him instead of me on that plane, and the guilty feeling you have that you have left all these good people behind is really painful. That is something I cannot come to terms with. I urge Mr Johnson to complete this good work and to make sure that they are back - Morad and the other British nationals."" He knows painfully well the conditions which they are enduring in Evin jail.  He shared a cell with cockroaches, bedbugs and 14 or 15 people - making his own headphones out of wire and foam to block out the sound of other inmates' snoring. Mr Ashoori made his own headphones to block out the sound of other inmates' snoring ""Although many of them are highly educated it is very difficult for all of you to always live in peace together. So sometimes fights happen. But then we learn to live with each other because we don't have any other choice."" The hardest part of his ordeal was at the start - when he was held in solitary confinement and interrogated for hours at time. ""I've put that behind me. I try not to think about it much,"" he says. Threats were made against his family and he tried several times to take his own life, thwarted only by prison guards. But he says the most painful part of the experience was seeing the suffering of other inmates driven mad by their incarceration. ""There are people there who are like zombies,"" he told me. ""They just go back and forth in the yard. Sometimes you see them talking to themselves and gesticulating. They're in their own world."" His family consistently protested for his release Then there's ""the shrapnel"" that hits the family members of those wrongfully imprisoned.  Mr Ashoori is well aware of the price his wife and children have paid, as they campaigned to get him free, often struggling for media and government attention. It was memories of his family, and the camaraderie of fellow-inmates, that kept him sane. ""When you are in your cell, you're always looking behind you. You're always trying to remember all the good memories that you had with your family. You're living in your memories."" To pass the days, he exercised religiously, wrote copious diary entries and formed a poetry society. ""It ended up with eight of us who would regularly meet in one of the rooms. Among us was a satirist. He said he could teach us how to write short stories. So then we had another class - short story writing. This initiated the thought that to fill up our time we could form other societies."" Mr Ashoori added: ""There was this friend who had a PhD in physics. So he started teaching us quantum mechanics. We had this very close friend who was a professor at university, teaching economics. So he started teaching us macroeconomics, microeconomics, managerial economics. We had another inmate who had served as a diplomat in Venezuela. He had learned how to speak Spanish so we started having Spanish classes. We started having a philosophy class just before I left."" He calls it ""the University of Evin"". ""You really learn how to be resilient because you have so many challenges from the time you get up,"" he says. Mr Ashoori is looking forward to getting back to family life His task now is to learn how to live a normal life again. ""He keeps asking permission for stuff - to take mugs, to do very normal things that you don't ask permission for,"" says his wife, Sherry.  ""He's very sensitive to sounds, I've noticed. For example, if we close the fridge door he'll jump."" But the couple are looking forward to ""just getting back to our ordinary life"", she said. ""Obviously we'd really like to have a nice holiday but for the moment even the daily routine of life is nice. Just having a cup of tea is nice. Sitting together watching a film or series is nice. He's missed so much over the past four and a half years. I look forward to reintroducing him to them."" The question in her mind, and in that of Mr Ashoori, is why it has taken so long to get him back home. ""They could have done this much earlier. Nazanin could have seen her beautiful daughter much earlier. I could have been back with my family,"" he says. ""This was a debt that had to be paid. Why didn't you do it earlier? Why did we have to go through all these years? Could they stand even one day of it in Evin prison? If they had actually experienced that they would have done it much earlier."" A government spokesman told the BBC: ""From the Prime Minister down, this government has been committed to securing the release of Anoosheh Ashoori. It was always entirely in Iran's gift to do this, but UK ministers and diplomats were tireless in working to secure his freedom and are delighted that he is now home.

"French sportswear retailer Decathlon has backtracked and suspended its activities in Russia following criticism of its decision to stay. It said supply chain disruption meant it could no longer operate in the country but it would continue to support its 2,500 Russian staff. Posts on social media had called for a boycott of the French company, which has 60 stores in Russia. Ukraine's foreign minister had also criticised the firm. ""In the dramatic context of Ukraine, we are following the evolution of events and particularly the situation of those directly affected,"" Decathlon said in a statement. ""In strict compliance with international sanctions, Decathlon notes that the supply conditions are no longer met to continue its activity in Russia. Decathlon has to suspend the operation of its stores."" McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Ikea are among the companies which have halted business in Russia as pressure mounts on firms to pull out following the invasion of Ukraine. Decathlon is owned by French retail giant Association Familiale Mulliez, which has been criticised for continuing its other businesses in Russia. They include supermarket chain Auchan, which has 41,000 employees and 311 stores in Russia, according to its website. Growing numbers of firms pull back from Russia The Western brands unable to leave Russia Some people had expressed outrage at the company's decision to keep trading in Russia on social media, alongside the hashtag #BoycottDecathlon. ""For two decades myself and my family have been a regular customer of @decathlonuk and I've freely recommended their products to others. No more,""one wrote,external. Others shared pictures of protesters,external, holding photos of victims of the war in Ukraine, outside Decathlon, Auchan and Leroy Merlin stores in Poland. On Sunday, Auchan defended its position on Russia. ""Our job is to do everything we can to ensure that the inhabitants of our countries of operation have access to good quality food at an affordable price and thus meet the essential food needs of the civilian population,""it said in a statement,external. ""Abandoning our employees, their families and our customers is not the choice we have made,"" the company added. It said it had stopped its investments in Auchan Russia and it was not currently making any profit in the country. It came after Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said in a tweet: ""By refusing to end business activities in Russia, Auchan Holding makes a conscious choice to further sponsor Russian atrocities in Ukraine and make blood profits."" He called on customers to boycott the company, along with Decathlon and home improvement chain Leroy Merlin, which is also owned by Association Familiale Mulliez. Last week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky used an address to France's Parliament to call on French companies, including Auchan and car manufacturer Renault, to pull out of Russia. Renault later announced that it was suspending its work at its Moscow factory.

"This video can not be played Watch Anoosheh Ashoori describe returning home after spending five years in Iranian jail Anoosheh Ashoori still has to pinch himself to be sure that he really is safe at home with his wife in south London and no longer in the ""hell"" of Evin jail in Tehran. ""I still can't believe sometimes that I am back,"" he told me from his living room in Lewisham. ""When I was in my cell I used to pinch myself when I was dreaming that I was with Sherry. Then I would wake up to the reality of being in my cell. Here, it's the other way around. "" It's a big - but happy - adjustment to a new life of freedom, which began with his favourite beer and a full English breakfast. ""Even when I'm awake, for example sitting in the garden, I sometimes say this cannot be true, this cannot be happening. I must be in my cell and I'm expecting any moment to wake up. So I'm preparing myself not to be too upset when I wake up. It's still quite a challenge for me to be easy with being here. ""Still at night sometimes I touch Sherry's hand to see if this is real, if this is happening."" Iranian-Briton's family delighted at his release 'Is that mummy?' - Nazanin home after Iran ordeal How is a UK-Iran debt linked to the prisoners' release? In August 2017, the 68-year old was visiting his elderly mother, who had just had a knee operation, when he was bundled into a van, blindfolded and later accused of spying for Israel. At first he and his family assumed it was a mistake. The retired engineer had never been involved in politics. Among his inventions: a product to protect Iranian homes after a devastating earthquake in 2003, and self-heating boots for his daughter's cake stall in Greenwich Market. ""You always ask - 'why me?'"" he says. ""It's like when there is an aircraft accident and somebody's child is in that aircraft. The mother may ask 'why me?' Why my child?"" It was only later that he realised that he was being held as a bargaining chip. Iran wanted something from Britain - the repayment of a decades-old military debt. ""It wasn't me who was important,"" he said. ""It was the passport that was being arrested - but the holder of that passport was me."" Anoosheh Ashoori and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe arrived back in the UK earlier this month On 17 March,two British-Iranian nationals - Mr Ashoori and Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe- walked down the steps of a plane at RAF Brize Norton. Their release came after the UK finally paid back the money it owed Tehran for a tank deal which, after the Islamic Revolution of 1979, was not fulfilled. Although both the British and Iranian government have said the two issues should not be linked. But British-born wildlife conservationist, Morad Tahbaz, was left behind and Mr Ashoori says he can't celebrate while such a ""good"" man is still behind bars. ""He's ill and needs medical attention,"" he said. ""Sometimes I think it should have been him instead of me on that plane, and the guilty feeling you have that you have left all these good people behind is really painful. That is something I cannot come to terms with. I urge Mr Johnson to complete this good work and to make sure that they are back - Morad and the other British nationals."" He knows painfully well the conditions which they are enduring in Evin jail.  He shared a cell with cockroaches, bedbugs and 14 or 15 people - making his own headphones out of wire and foam to block out the sound of other inmates' snoring. Mr Ashoori made his own headphones to block out the sound of other inmates' snoring ""Although many of them are highly educated it is very difficult for all of you to always live in peace together. So sometimes fights happen. But then we learn to live with each other because we don't have any other choice."" The hardest part of his ordeal was at the start - when he was held in solitary confinement and interrogated for hours at time. ""I've put that behind me. I try not to think about it much,"" he says. Threats were made against his family and he tried several times to take his own life, thwarted only by prison guards. But he says the most painful part of the experience was seeing the suffering of other inmates driven mad by their incarceration. ""There are people there who are like zombies,"" he told me. ""They just go back and forth in the yard. Sometimes you see them talking to themselves and gesticulating. They're in their own world."" His family consistently protested for his release Then there's ""the shrapnel"" that hits the family members of those wrongfully imprisoned.  Mr Ashoori is well aware of the price his wife and children have paid, as they campaigned to get him free, often struggling for media and government attention. It was memories of his family, and the camaraderie of fellow-inmates, that kept him sane. ""When you are in your cell, you're always looking behind you. You're always trying to remember all the good memories that you had with your family. You're living in your memories."" To pass the days, he exercised religiously, wrote copious diary entries and formed a poetry society. ""It ended up with eight of us who would regularly meet in one of the rooms. Among us was a satirist. He said he could teach us how to write short stories. So then we had another class - short story writing. This initiated the thought that to fill up our time we could form other societies."" Mr Ashoori added: ""There was this friend who had a PhD in physics. So he started teaching us quantum mechanics. We had this very close friend who was a professor at university, teaching economics. So he started teaching us macroeconomics, microeconomics, managerial economics. We had another inmate who had served as a diplomat in Venezuela. He had learned how to speak Spanish so we started having Spanish classes. We started having a philosophy class just before I left."" He calls it ""the University of Evin"". ""You really learn how to be resilient because you have so many challenges from the time you get up,"" he says. Mr Ashoori is looking forward to getting back to family life His task now is to learn how to live a normal life again. ""He keeps asking permission for stuff - to take mugs, to do very normal things that you don't ask permission for,"" says his wife, Sherry.  ""He's very sensitive to sounds, I've noticed. For example, if we close the fridge door he'll jump."" But the couple are looking forward to ""just getting back to our ordinary life"", she said. ""Obviously we'd really like to have a nice holiday but for the moment even the daily routine of life is nice. Just having a cup of tea is nice. Sitting together watching a film or series is nice. He's missed so much over the past four and a half years. I look forward to reintroducing him to them."" The question in her mind, and in that of Mr Ashoori, is why it has taken so long to get him back home. ""They could have done this much earlier.

"The vision is to live in harmony with nature by 2050 A global agreement to reverse the loss of nature and halt extinctions is inching closer, as talks in Geneva enter their final day. International negotiators are working on the text of a UN framework to safeguard nature ahead of a high-level summit in China later this year. Observers have slammed the ""snail's pace"" of negotiations and are pressing for a strengthening of ambitions. Divisions remain, including over financing the plans. ""The science is very clear, we do not have any more time to waste; we need to take action now,"" Bernadette Fischler Hooper, head of international advocacy at WWF-UK, told BBC News. ""Not only on biodiversity loss, but also on climate change which is a very inter-linked issue. So that is what's at stake here; it's actually the future of the planet and its people."" Biodiversity loss risks 'ecological meltdown' Biodiversity: Why the nature crisis matters, in five graphics Five key things about the extinction crisis The plans call for a fifth of degraded marine ecosystems to be restored The final version of the draft UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) will be negotiated in Kunming, China, at the Cop15 summit, which is expected to take place at the end of August. What's needed to save animals and plants from extinction? The outcome will decide for the coming decades how the world will address the challenges of reducing the extinction risk threatening more than one million species, protecting 30% of land and sea, eliminating billions of dollars of environmentally-damaging government subsidies and restoring degraded ecosystems. Talks aimed at progressing the nascent agreement have been taking place in Geneva over the past two weeks. After the first week, observers hit out at what they saw as a ""glacial"" rate of progress, but momentum has gathered during the final days, although ""thorny issues"" remain, including the financing of the plans. The draft text contains the aim to increase finance to at least US $200bn a year by 2030, with funding from developed to developing countries to increase by at least US $10bn a year. ""Resource mobilisation at this meeting has become a thorny issue,"" Ghanaian academic Alfred Oteng-Yeboah, who has played a key role in international efforts to protect biodiversity, told the news agency, AFP. The vast majority of lemur species, unique primates found only in Madagascar, are on the brink of extinction On subsidies, the aim is to ""redirect, reallocate, reform or eliminate incentives harmful for biodiversity"" on the scale of at least US $500bn per year. The new Global Biodiversity Framework (GBD) is seen as the biodiversity equivalent of the Paris climate agreement. Biodiversity refers to all the different living things on Earth and how they fit together in a delicate web of life that we rely on for food, clean air and water. One of the key ambitions is to turn 30% of Earth's lands and seas into protected areas by 2030. A recent UN climate report underlined the importance of conserving at least 30% of the planet to achieve biodiversity and climate goals. Five things new IPCC climate change study tells us Almost all lemurs face extinction 'Nature's emergency is our emergency too' Another goal is to ensure that, by 2050, a ""shared vision of living in harmony with nature is fulfilled"". ""We have this one goal, which is to bend the curve on biodiversity loss and really to build that shared future to live in harmony with nature in the long term,"" the convention's executive secretary, Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, told reporters at the start of the talks. Scientists have issued repeated warnings about threats to nature driven by human actions, including chopping down forests and turning natural land over to farming. A landmark 2019 assessment warned that nature was declining globally at rates unprecedented in human history, with up to one million species facing extinction. The Cop15 conference in Kunming is expected to take place almost two years later than originally planned due to repeated delays caused by the Covid pandemic. This has left the world without targets over the course of this decade for halting extinctions and reversing the worldwide loss of nature.

"He became an orphan aged three but went on to become one of the world's richest men. Now Roman Abramovich's links to Vladimir Putin have stripped him of his businesses and reputation. ""I'm sure people will focus on me for three or four days but it will pass,"" said the Russian billionaire when he bought Chelsea Football Club in 2003. ""They'll forget who I am, and I like that."" There's little chance of anonymity now, given the events of the last few weeks. Following years of demands for greater scrutiny of Mr Abramovich's dealings, the UK government has frozen his UK-held assets - including his homes, artworks and Chelsea FC - and imposed a travel ban. It has accused him of being complicit with Mr Putin in the invasion of Ukraine. This fall from grace for a man who has dominated British football but sharply divided sports fans in the process will be cheered by some. But he has overcome huge challenges before, notably in his early life. Roman Arkadyevich Abramovich was born in Saratov in south-western Russia, a few hundred miles from the border with Ukraine, in 1966. His mother, Irina, died of blood poisoning when he was one year old and his father died two years later after an accident with a construction crane. After that Mr Abramovich was raised by relatives, spending time in Komi, in north-west Russia, where money was tight and winter temperatures low. ""To tell the truth I cannot call my childhood bad,"" he once told the Guardian in a rare interview. ""In your childhood you can't compare things: one eats carrots, one eats candy, both taste good. As a child you cannot tell the difference."" As a young conscript He left school at 16, worked as a mechanic and served in the Red Army before selling plastic toys in Moscow. He moved on to perfumes and deodorants, building up his wealth as greater openness under Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev allowed more scope for entrepreneurs. The disintegration of the Soviet Union, and with it state command of mineral assets, provided more opportunities, and in his mid-20s, Mr Abramovich had a further stroke of good fortune. He seized the oil company Sibneft from the Russian government in a rigged auction in 1995 for around $250m (Â£190m). He sold it back to the government for $13bn (Â£9.9bn ) in 2005. His lawyers say there is no basis for alleging he amassed very substantial wealth through criminality. However, in 2012, he admitted in a UK court that he had made corrupt payments to help get the Sibneft deal going. Abramovich, far left, with friends in Moscow in his younger days He became involved in the ""aluminium wars"" of the 1990s, in which oligarchs - those who had accrued vast fortunes and political power after the Soviet collapse - fought for control of this vast industry. ""Every three days, someone was being murdered,"" Mr Abramovich said in 2011, adding that this threat to his safety had made him a reluctant participant. But Mr Abramovich further proved his own toughness, accruing hundreds of millions of pounds amid the chaos. Secret paper highlights corrupt Abramovich deals He became an ally of President Boris Yeltsin and a player in Moscow's post-Soviet political scene, even having an apartment in the Kremlin for a while. When Mr Yeltsin resigned in 1999, Mr Abramovich was reportedly among those to back the prime minister and former KGB spy, Vladimir Putin, as his successor. As Mr Putin established himself, he sought to assert his dominance over the oligarchs. Some went to prison, and others were exiled if they failed to show allegiance. He served as governor of Chukotka in Putin's early days as president Mr Abramovich suffered neither fate. In 2000, he was elected as governor of the deprived region of Chukotka, at the north-eastern tip of Russia. He gained popularity after investing his own money in social services but stepped down in 2008. All the while, he kept his business interests going, taking on the trappings of wealth - buying up paintings, houses, cars. In an unusual move for a man widely described as quiet, even shy, in 2003 Mr Abramovich made himself famous around the footballing world when he purchased Chelsea, west London's largest club, in a deal worth Â£140m. ""My whole philosophy in life is to bring in professional teams,"" hetold the Financial Times.,external""In Chukotka I have professional teams on the ground and I will do this here too."" Under the management of Jose Mourinho and others, Mr Abramovich's wealth helped Chelsea towards five Premier Leagues, two Champions Leagues and five FA Cups. The Abramovich years have brought unprecedented success to Chelsea FC Oligarchs' money has flooded into London in recent years. Mr Abramovich's own property portfolio is believed to include a15-bedroom mansion at Kensington Palace Gardens in west London, reportedly worth more than Â£150m; a flat in Chelsea; a ranch in Colorado; and a holiday home on the French Riviera. His yachts - the Solaris and the Eclipse - are among the world's largest. Mr Abramovich, who has been divorced three times, also owns a personal jet. Asked by the Guardian in 2006 about what money can do for a person, he replied: ""It cannot buy you happiness. Some independence, yes."" He certainly has plenty of money. Financial media giantBloomberg estimates Mr Abramovich's fortune,externalat $13.7bn (Â£10.6bn), ranking him as the world's 128th richest person. Its rivalForbes sets it at $12.3bn (Â£9.4bn),,externalplacing him 142nd. What is under severe question, though, is the extent of his independence from Mr Putin. Last year, Mr Abramovich sued publishing House HarperCollins for libel over a book, Putin's People by Catherine Belton, that claimed the Russian president had ordered him to buy Chelsea. Roman Abramovich owns two superyachts, including Solaris (pictured here in Barcelona) The two sides settled out of court, with the publisher agreeing to make some clarifications. But Mr Abramovich's associations with Mr Putin have continued to dog him, particularly when Russian forces built up on the border with Ukraine and then invaded. When the freezing of the UK assets of Mr Abramovich and six other oligarchs was announced, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: ""With their close links to Putin, they are complicit in his aggression. The blood of the Ukrainian people is on their hands."" Who are the mega-rich Russians facing sanctions? Mr Abramovich announced the sale of Chelsea eight days before the sanctions were imposed. Some fans have continued to chant Mr Abramovich's name, but many politicians are calling for his assets to be seized, not just frozen. ""I hope that I will be able to visit Stamford Bridge one last time to say goodbye to all of you in person,"" Mr Abramovich has told Chelsea supporters. But a return to west London is unlikely for some time. In a bizarre twist, it has now emerged thatMr Abramovich suffered symptoms of suspected poisoning - along with senior Ukrainian negotiators -at peace talks on the Ukraine-Belarus border in early March.

"Former owner Jean-Pierre Robinet spent 10 years as Britain's remotest mainland publican A community in Lochaber has succeeded in its bid to buy Britain's remotest mainland pub in a landmark deal. Residents of the Knoydart Peninsula in Lochaber are now the owners of The Old Forge in Inverie. The only way of reaching the village - and its pub - is by walking 18 miles (29km) or making a seven-mile (11km) sea crossing. The pub's Belgian owner Jean-Pierre Robinet put the pub on the market last year, asking for offers over Â£425,000. He had run the pub - which has the Guinness World Record for the remotest mainland pub in Britain - for 10 years. Community wins fund to buy remotest mainland pub Community in race to buy remotest mainland pub Locals bid for Britain's remote mainland bar The small community of just over 100 people held a consultation on a community buyout, with 70 taking part. Almost all of them backed the idea, and The Old Forge Community Benefit Society (CBS) was set up. Locals raised more than Â£320,000 through a community share offer and crowdfunder, and received financial support from Scottish Land Fund and Community Ownership Fund to secure enough capital to purchase the building and undertake essential renovations. Under the community ownership model, profits will be reinvested back into business, not shareholders, and to projects that deliver wider community benefit. Stephanie Harris, secretary of the CBS, said: ""We are ecstatic that after so many months of hard work we have been successful in securing the pub for the community. ""The Old Forge plays such an important role in Knoydart's social culture and economic sustainability, and with the business now in the community's hands we can steer it forward in a way that will work for the needs of the locals and the thousands of visitors who come every year."" The only way of reaching Inverie - and its pub - is by walking 18 miles or making a seven-mile sea crossing The Knoydart community has a track record of successful community ownership, having secured 17,500 acres of the Knoydart Estate in 1999 as one of the first community buyouts in Scotland. Knoydart's coast and mountains have been described as mainland Britain's last wilderness. The committee is now preparing to relaunch the pub in a few weeks' time. Ms Harris said: ""We haven't been able to access the building up to this point except for when our building inspectors were permitted entry for valuation purposes. ""The inspection identified a number of essential works to make the building safe and fit-for-purpose, so we plan to open on a drinks-only basis for the first few months until we can renovate the kitchen.""

"Cadbury has shrunk the size of its Dairy Milk sharing bars by 10%, but will not reduce the price for customers. Parent company Mondelez blamed costs associated with the production of its chocolate spiking, as it reduced the bars' size from 200g to 180g. They are still typically being sold at Â£2 despite the downsize. US firm Mondelez said the move was the first for that size of Dairy Milk bar in a decade. In 2020, the company was accused of ""shrinkflation"" - reducing the size of a product while keeping the price the same to boost profits. At the time, Cadbury chocolate bars sold in multipacks, including popular treats like Crunchies, Twirls and Wispas,were reduced in size to reduce their calorie count, Mondelez said. The latest move comes as the cost of food is increasing, placing further pressure on UK households during the cost of living crisis. Last week, the rate of inflation (which tracks how the cost of living changes over time)hit a fresh 30-year-high of 6.2% for the year to February. A Mondelez spokesperson said: ""We're facing the same challenges that so many other food companies have already reported when it comes to significantly increased production costs - whether it's ingredients, energy or packaging - and rising inflation. ""This means that our products are much more expensive to make. ""We understand that consumers are faced with rising costs too, which is why we look to absorb costs wherever we can, but, in this difficult environment, we've had to make the decision to slightly reduce the weight of our medium Cadbury Dairy Milk bars for the first time since 2012, so that we can keep them competitive and ensure the great taste and quality our fans enjoy."" Cadbury accused of 'shrinkflation' as pack size cut Nestle to sell US confectionery business Wonka bar and Golden Ticket fetch Â£15k Separately, the UK's food standards watchdog warned of the sale of counterfeit ""Wonka"" chocolate bars on Monday. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said the fake products were being sold online and in shops across the UK and might not be safe to eat. It said any Wonka-branded chocolate which does not feature the ""Ferrero"" or ""Ferrara Candy Company"" trademarks on the label was likely to be fake. Some had been found to contain allergens not listed on the label. The warning comes after a sharp increase in reports of counterfeit chocolate bars on sale over the past year. The agency said there was a possibility the fake bars were being produced or repackaged by unregistered businesses and individuals who could be breaking food hygiene, labelling and traceability laws. Tina Potter, Head of Incidents at the FSA, said: ""With Easter less than a month away, it is more important than ever that parents and grandparents are aware of the risks that these bogus chocolate bars could pose to their children, particularly those living with a food allergy or intolerance. ""If you have bought these knock-off bars, do not eat them or give them to friends and family."" The FSA said it was continuing to investigate further reports with support from local authorities. The Wonka brand was sold by Swiss food giant Nestle to Ferrero Group in 2018,alongside the rest of its US sweets and chocolate business. It is not the first time the brand has been targeted by fraudsters. In 2013 fake Wonka chocolate bars containing bogus ""golden tickets""were seized by trading standards officers in Suffolk. The product is based on Road Dahl's book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which has also inspired two film adaptations. In the book, children who found golden tickets in the bars won a trip to Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.

"Former owner Jean-Pierre Robinet spent 10 years as Britain's remotest mainland publican A community in Lochaber has succeeded in its bid to buy Britain's remotest mainland pub in a landmark deal. Residents of the Knoydart Peninsula in Lochaber are now the owners of The Old Forge in Inverie. The only way of reaching the village - and its pub - is by walking 18 miles (29km) or making a seven-mile (11km) sea crossing. The pub's Belgian owner Jean-Pierre Robinet put the pub on the market last year, asking for offers over Â£425,000. He had run the pub - which has the Guinness World Record for the remotest mainland pub in Britain - for 10 years. Community wins fund to buy remotest mainland pub Community in race to buy remotest mainland pub Locals bid for Britain's remote mainland bar The small community of just over 100 people held a consultation on a community buyout, with 70 taking part. Almost all of them backed the idea, and The Old Forge Community Benefit Society (CBS) was set up. Locals raised more than Â£320,000 through a community share offer and crowdfunder, and received financial support from Scottish Land Fund and Community Ownership Fund to secure enough capital to purchase the building and undertake essential renovations. Under the community ownership model, profits will be reinvested back into business, not shareholders, and to projects that deliver wider community benefit. Stephanie Harris, secretary of the CBS, said: ""We are ecstatic that after so many months of hard work we have been successful in securing the pub for the community. ""The Old Forge plays such an important role in Knoydart's social culture and economic sustainability, and with the business now in the community's hands we can steer it forward in a way that will work for the needs of the locals and the thousands of visitors who come every year."" The only way of reaching Inverie - and its pub - is by walking 18 miles or making a seven-mile sea crossing The Knoydart community has a track record of successful community ownership, having secured 17,500 acres of the Knoydart Estate in 1999 as one of the first community buyouts in Scotland. Knoydart's coast and mountains have been described as mainland Britain's last wilderness. The committee is now preparing to relaunch the pub in a few weeks' time. Ms Harris said: ""We haven't been able to access the building up to this point except for when our building inspectors were permitted entry for valuation purposes. ""The inspection identified a number of essential works to make the building safe and fit-for-purpose, so we plan to open on a drinks-only basis for the first few months until we can renovate the kitchen."" She said it was hoped the pub could reopen on Easter weekend ""all going well"". ""We're in the process of hiring staff and already have a number of local residents lined up which is great, and means we are achieving one of our goals to provide new local employment,"" she added.
