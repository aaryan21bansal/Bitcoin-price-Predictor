"This video can not be played French and British fishing fleets have come to blows over when and where they can catch scallops The UK government has said it is talking to French authorities to ensure there will be ""no repeat"" of clashes between fishermen over scallops off France's north coast. On Monday, nearly 40 French boats confronted British rivals they say are depleting scallop stocks in the area. The UK's environment secretary says the British boats were fishing legally. France says it is ready to send more police vessels to the area to prevent further clashes. Boats collided and stones were thrown during the confrontation off the coast of Normandy in the early hours of Tuesday. Local official Ingrid Parrot said the situation had been ""extremely tense"" and both sides had thrown objects at each other. She defended sending just one boat to police the incident overnight, saying: ""The aim was to stop the tensions from increasing. We sent only one ship that day, but we will send more if it's necessary."" Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops? Could Brexit calm troubled waters? Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Producers Association, said the incident was ""high seas piracy"" but said the French had agreed to a request for talks. ""We need to decrease tensions in the whole area,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. The European Commission urged France and Britain to find an ""amicable"" solution. This video can not be played Scallop row: What's the EU's fishing feud about? The French boats gathered overnight on Monday in protest against so-called ""pillaging"" by five larger British vessels. The British were chased away with two boats, Golden Promise and Joanna C, returning to Brixham harbour with damaged windows. The crews alleged they had been surrounded and had rocks and metal shackles thrown at them, but French police said UK boats responded in kind. A video published by French media shows a Scottish scallop dredger, the Honeybourne 3, colliding with French vessels. Tension has rumbled for 15 years, but in the past five a deal has prevailed - larger British boats stayed out of the area in exchange for more fishing rights. British boats can gather scallops year-round, but French law restricts the scallop fishing season to between 1 October and 15 May. Marc Delahaye from the Normandy fishing committee said they also objected to the British using ""great dredgers"" in the area, while the French used smaller boats. The Honeybourne III, a Scottish scallop dredger, docked in West Sussex after the clash The UK scallop industry is worth Â£120m and supports 1,350 jobs. About 60% of the catch is exported - with much of it being bought by the French. But a 2016 report by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) warned that the fishing effort by France, the UK, Belgium and Ireland in the Bay of Seine was ""too high"". International environmental group ClientEarth said it was ""disappointing"" to see boats catching scallops during the spawning season, when it said depleted stocks could reproduce and grow. France was demonstrating ""high environmental standards"" by banning its fleet from fishing during the summer, the group said. Analysis: James Landale, Diplomatic Correspondent Inevitably Brexit looms large. Some French fishermen hope that when the UK leaves the Common Fisheries Policy, British trawlers will not be allowed into these waters. But it may not be as simple as that. It is still not clear what agreement an independent UK may make with the EU on fishing quotas. And the French desire to negotiate some continuing access to British waters may be more important than protecting their scallops off Normandy. So Brexit may change the rules of the game but it is unlikely to bring an end disputes to like this. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the government was talking to French authorities to ensure there was ""no repeat"" of the clashes. He told the BBC his heart went out to the British fishermen involved, who had ""absolutely every right to be fishing in those waters"". The French had a ""legal responsibility"" to ensure their territorial waters were ""appropriately policed"" to allow legal fishing to continue, he added. Prime Minister Theresa May called for an ""amicable solution"" to the row. ""It's what we want and it's what France wants and we will be working on that,"" she said. Mr Park rejected suggestions that British boats were overfishing the area. They catch just 6% of the scallops in the area, he said, so ""if there's any accusation of over fishing it's not on the UK fishermen, it's on the French fishermen."" ""Scallops are plentiful and they're expensive,"" he said. ""We're doing nothing wrong and what we can't do is be bullied."" Sheryll Murray, MP for South East Cornwall, said environment secretary Michael Gove has assured her ""appropriate measures"" are in place to enable UK fishermen to keep working. But she questioned whether French authorities were ""turning a blind eye"" while their fishermen ""took the law into their own hands"". Local French officials said they could not intervene directly because the conflict took place in international waters. By BBC Monitoring French media have framed the scallop showdown as a ""battle"" between two nations, with some outlets highlighting the future impact of Brexit. Under the headline ""The battle for Saint-Jacques scallops off Normandy"", left-wing daily Le Monde cited fishing chief Dimitri Rogoff who said that the UK would normally ""be considered a third country and will not have access to these [fishing] zones"" after it leaves the European Union. French fishermen are nevertheless worried by Brexit ""as Britain plans to pursue its own fishing policy starting from the end of March 2019, particularly regarding access to its territorial waters of boats from EU countries"" noted weekly magazine L'Usine Nouvelle. Popular regional newspaper Ouest-France said that sailors from Normandy ""insist that they respect the [fish] resources"" and had gone to sea ""to explain this to the English"". ""We have won a battle, but we haven't won the war,"" concluded one French fisherman in a report by public TV channel France 3.

"The sale of energy drinks could be banned in England to anybody under 18, amid fears they are damaging children's health, the prime minister has said. The government has launched a public consultation on its plans to make it illegal to sell the drinks to children. Energy drinks contain high levels of sugar and caffeine and have been linked to obesity and other health issues. The government is asking for views on what age the ban should apply to, but gave under 16 and under 18 as options. Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have the power to implement their own bans. Supermarkets ban energy drinks for under-16s Call for under-16s high energy drinks ban Energy drinks sold to under-16s despite ban Why our school bans energy drinks UK youngsters are among the highest consumers of energy drinks in Europe,research has previously suggested.,external The drinks contain high levels of caffeine and sugar, often much more than those of standard soft drinks. Excessive consumption has been linked to a range of health issues in children, from obesity, tooth decay, headaches and sleep problems to stomach aches and hyperactivity. Surveys from teachers unions have also suggested that they contribute to poor behaviour in classrooms, although claims they can alter behaviour have been contested. The ban would apply to drinks containing 150mg of caffeine or more per litre. Many shops already have their own voluntary bans in place for under-16s, but it is still possible for children to buy the drinks from some retailers and vending machines. Public Health Minister Steve Brine said: ""We all have a responsibility to protect children from products that are damaging to their health and education, and we know that drinks packed to the brim with caffeine, and often sugar, are becoming a common fixture of their diet. ""Our children already consume 50% more of these drinks than our European counterparts, and teachers have made worrying links between energy drinks and poor behaviour in the classroom."" The two main ingredients of concern in energy drinks are sugar and caffeine. We know having a diet too high in sugar risks weight-gain, which is in turn is linked to heart disease, some cancers and type 2 diabetes. But how much do we know about what caffeine does to young people's bodies in the short and longer-term? In the short-term it can cause headaches on withdrawal, irritability, raised blood pressure and heart-rate. But there isn't much good evidence that caffeine directly harms health, including that of children, in the longer term. Although it raises blood pressure in the short-term, there is no association with hypertension (chronic high blood pressure). However, the shorter-term symptoms caffeine causes may indirectly lead to other health issues. For example, there's plenty of evidence linking disturbed sleep to a range of negative health consequences, including weight gain. One study linked energy drinks to ""poor quality or reduced sleep, headaches, risk-seeking behaviour and depressive symptoms"". The maximum recommended intake of caffeine for children is lower than for adults - no more than a daily serving of 2.5mg for every kg a child weighs - meaning it's easy for a young person to over-consume caffeine if they drink energy drinks. Food labelling laws already state that any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre must carry a warning about its high caffeine content and are not recommended for children or pregnant or breastfeeding women. Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""Childhood obesity is one of the greatest health challenges this country faces, and that's why we are taking significant action to reduce the amounts of sugar consumed by young people and to help families make healthier choices. ""With thousands of young people regularly consuming energy drinks, often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks, we will consult on banning the sale of energy drinks to children. ""It is vital that we do all we can to make sure children have the best start in life and I encourage everyone to put forward their views."" Retailers will ban the sale of energy drinks containing more than 150mg of caffeine per litre Energy drinks contain high levels of caffeine, usually about 80mg in a 250ml can. In comparison, a 330ml can of classic Coca-Cola contains 32mg and a can of Diet Coke 42mg. Energy drinks also contain lots of sugar as well as other ingredients including vitamins and minerals or herbal substances. Some smaller ""energy shot"" products can contain as much as 160mg of caffeine in a 60ml bottle. High levels of caffeine can lead to anxiety, panic attacks and increased blood pressure Pregnant and breast-feeding women are advised not to have more than 200mg of caffeine over the course of a day European advice says that most other adults are safe to drink up to 400mg a day Source:NHS Choices,external Too much sugar in our diets is linked to a range of health problems including: Obesity Tooth decay Type 2 diabetes Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said: ""Children do not need energy drinks to get through the day - they offer nothing more than unnecessary sugar. ""Restricting the sale of these drinks is another bold step needed to turn the tide on childhood obesity."" Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""There is no evidence that energy drinks have any nutritional value or place in the diet of children and young people. ""It's therefore worrying that so many young people are buying these drinks at low prices and consuming them on a regular basis."" Energy Drinks Europe, which represents drinks manufacturers, said a 250ml can of energy drink typically contained about the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee and as much sugar as that in juices and soft drinks. A spokesman added: ""For all ages, there are much greater contributors of caffeine and sugar in the diet than energy drinks. ""A sales ban on energy drinks is therefore arbitrary, discriminatory and not effective. ""A better approach is to work with governments to ensure a fact-based discussion rather than proposals based on conjecture. Effective measures would include portion control and serving size reductions."" The public consultation follows the June 2018 publication of the latest chapter of the government's Childhood Obesity Plan, which commits to halve childhood obesity by 2030. It will last for 12 weeks. Follow Alex on Twitter,external.

Janbaz Tarin, 21, is wanted after Raneem Oudeh, 22, and Khaola Saleem, 49, were stabbed in Solihull on Monday as Ms Oudeh was on the phone to police. Ms Oudeh was Mr Tarin's ex-partner andhad made a number of calls to police on the day of her death. Independent charity Crimestoppers has now put up a Â£5,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. Midlands Live: Bystanders film police officer knocked off bike; Fire burning for 13 years set to be put out Raneem Oudeh (left) and her mother, Khaola Saleem, were pronounced dead at the scene Detectives believe Mr Tarin is still in the West Midlands area and that people are protecting him.

"Sam Allardyce won his only match as England manager, a 1-0 victory in Slovakia on 4 September 2016 An undercover investigation that led to Sam Allardyce's exit as England manager after 67 days was justified in the public interest, a report has found. Allardyceleft the England jobin 2016 after the Daily Telegraph said he told reporters posing as businessmen how to ""get around"" player transfer rules. The 63-year-old lodged 25 complaints about the story with the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso). Ipso found in the paper's favour on 22 of those points. Allardyce said that the level of subterfuge employed by the newspaper in its 'Football for Sale' investigation had been unjustified and that it had published its findings in an inaccurate and misleading way. The former West Ham, Blackburn and Everton manager also claimed that the Football Associationwas too hasty in deciding he had breached his contractand that ""entrapment won"". In a statement on Wednesday night, Allardyce said: ""Had the FA stuck to their word and waited to see the Telegraph's evidence (as they originally told me they would) they would have seen the allegations made against me were false. ""It was of course the allegations about third-party ownership (TPO) that the FA stated were the reasons for my leaving."" In response to the Ipso findings, the FA said it was not involved with the report, but added the ""position on Sam Allardyce has not changed. He apologised for his behaviour at the time and we reached a mutual agreement which both parties were happy with."" Ipso's complaints committee found that the Telegraph's coverage was ""generally accurate"" but that the paper had breached the Editors' Code on three specific points. Allardyce was being filmed as part ofa 10-month Telegraph investigation,externalthat separately unearthed evidence of bribery and corruption in British football. Of the three complaints upheld by Ipso, one related to a suggestion Allardyce had implied third parties could benefit from transfer fees, which was not true, and two wrongly implied Allardyce had offered to tell the Telegraph's reporters how to break ownership rules. The Telegraph published a correction on Thursday. However, Ipso ruled that the Telegraph's use of subterfuge was justified. Dan Roan, BBC sports editor Both sides in this dispute will hail this as a victory. The Daily Telegraph will see this ruling as a qualified vindication of its journalism, with its use of subterfuge and secret filming crucially backed by Ipso. Its complaints committee found the coverage was generally accurate, and the investigation was justified in the public interest. Ipso rejected the vast majority of the complaints against the newspaper. However, the fact that key inaccuracies in the paper's reporting have been identified, with Ipso concluding that the proposal set out by Sam Allardyce ""would not have resulted in the rules being broken"", means the former England manager can also claim to have won. Significantly, this could also have an impact on his threat of possible legal action for damages against the Football Association. In 2017, it was revealed that Allardyce was considering suing the governing body for the way it handled the fallout from his sacking as England manager in 2016. He has always maintained the FA was too hasty in deciding he had breached his Â£3m per year contract, and panicked in case subsequent articles by the newspaper further implicated him. That fear was unfounded however, and this ruling could strengthen Allardyce's resolve, and improve his chances of success if he decides to press ahead with legal action. In September 2016, Allardyce was filmed telling undercover reporters it was ""not a problem"" to bypass rules on third-party player ownership and claimed he knew of agents who were ""doing it all the time"". Third-party ownership - when someone other than the buying and selling club owns a stake in a player, typically an investor - has been banned by the Football Association and world football's governing body Fifa. It is a practice that has been described as a form of ""slavery"" by Michel Platini, the former president of European football's governing body Uefa. The Telegraph investigation claimed that a Â£400,000 deal was struck for Allardyce to represent the Far East organisation for which the reporters claimed to work, and to be a keynote speaker at events. Allardyce, though, stressed to the reporters he would first have to ""run that by"" his employers, the FA. Allardyce also made fun of predecessor Roy Hodgson's speech by referring to him as ""Woy"", as well as criticising Gary Neville, one of Hodgson's assistants, and making comments about FA president Prince William. He described another member of the Royal Family, Prince Harry, as a ""naughty boy"". The complaint made by Allardyce - along with Shane Moloney, described by the Telegraph as Allardyce's financial adviser, and his agent Mark Curtis - related to 15 articles published over six days, including news reports and comment pieces, which formed part of the newspaper's 10-month 'Football for Sale' campaign, which it described as an investigation into ""corruption in English football"". The complainants denied any prior wrongdoing which could have justified the subterfuge and said the publication of ""serious and false claims"" had grave consequences. However, the Daily Telegraph said the level of subterfuge - which included hidden cameras and microphones, and its reporters posing as businessmen from a fictitious company - had been essential to its investigation and that its actions were warranted and proportionate. The paper said that, in spring 2015, an individual, who the newspaper had considered to be a credible and reliable source, had made a number of serious allegations against football managers, including Allardyce, and these allegations were later repeated by other sources, justifying further investigation. In a statement, Allardyce said: ""I will consider my position in this regard with my lawyers but I hope Martin Glenn [FA chief executive] and Greg Clarke [FA chairman] reflect on the lack of leadership they showed - not for the first time or I expect the last."" ""Following a complaint made in November 2016 Ipso has now found (and stated that the Telegraph should make clear) that I did not suggest a model by which a third party could benefit from sharing in a player's transfer fees; did not brief reporters on breaking the rules; and did not enter negotiations to provide guidance on how to get around rules on TPO. ""Ipso also found that the articles made no accusation of corruption against me, and the Telegraph confirmed it made no such allegation."" This video can not be played Sam Allardyce: 67 days in 67 seconds ""On the major issues raised by Mr Allardyce, Ipso found for the Telegraph. It upheld our right to use subterfuge and secret filming, since there was a strong public interest in investigating and it was reasonable for the Telegraph to have believed that it could only obtain material evidence through subterfuge. ""Additionally, Ipso found that while it could not be demonstrated that Mr Allardyce had broken any Football Association rules, he appeared to show disregard for them and had spoken disrespectfully about them to people he had only just met. Further, although any intention of achieving any improper benefit was denied, he had explained a model that could reasonably be understood to result in a third party benefiting from a player's transfer from one team to another. ""Save for three inaccuracies, two of which were contained in two comment articles, Ipso found that the coverage of the investigation was not in breach of clause one of the code. The correction it has required the Telegraph to publish appears in our usual 'Corrections and Clarifications' spot today [Thursday].""

"A woman who says she was racially assaulted on a London bus has called for transport companies to keep CCTV material for longer, after footage of her attack was deleted in just 10 days. Makedah Simpson reported the incident to police immediately but the case was dropped due to a lack of CCTV evidence. Ms Simpson, 23, has launched a petition calling for firms to keep footage for 30 days, attracting 140,000 signatures. Transport for London said CCTV material was kept for as long as possible. Currently companies can set their own timeframes for holding footage. Crime victims 'ignored and confused' Violent crime: Is it getting worse? Ms Simpson was boarding a bus near Victoria Station in central London in March when a man shouted racial abuse and shoved her, injuring her shoulder. She said she reported the assault to police through an online form, providing her Oyster card number, and was contacted by officers the following day. But because of an error recording some details, the recovery of CCTV footage from the bus company was delayed. She was then told that the company only kept footage for 10 days and it had been overwritten. The case was subsequently dropped due to a lack of evidence. The Met Police said they were not able to obtain the CCTV footage because Transport for London (TfL) records showed the Oyster card had not been used at the relevant times. However TfL confirmed Ms Simpson had used her Oyster card correctly and said they had been provided with the incorrect bus route and date by police. Ms Simpson, from south-east London, said the attack had left her hesitant to go out and she had changed her bus route to work because the incident had taken place nearby. She also said the experience of reporting the crime had initially made her ""lose faith in the criminal justice system"". ""At first I was angry at putting myself through that and nothing happening,"" she told BBC News. ""And then I thought how many other people must have gone through this, and how many people might not know about the time limits."" She decided to start a petition to help others in a similar situation. ""As a victim you feel rushed and under pressure to relay the information correctly. This change would allow people the opportunity to report crimes and also have the space to deal with whatever has happened to them,"" she said. ""In my case, there was a delay because of human error, but in other cases it might take longer to recover CCTV or people might not report something straight away."" She said the response to her petition had been ""overwhelming"". ""As a victim you can feel so alone, but to know there's 140,000 people behind me saying this is something that has to change is so powerful,"" she said. A spokesman for the bus operator, Metroline, said CCTV was kept for 10 days, as required by their contract with TfL. And Tom Cunnington, head of bus business development at TfL, said the attack on Ms Simpson was ""completely unacceptable"". He said that while it was not currently possible to keep footage for 30 days, the company ensured all buses stored CCTV material. And as technology improved, they would make sure it was kept for as long as possible. The Department for Transport refers operators to guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office'scode of practice,external. It advises that the Data Protection Act does not specify a minimum or maximum time CCTV footage should be kept and only says it should not be kept for longer than necessary.

"Andy Murray was playing on Arthur Ashe Stadium for the first time since his 2016 quarter-final defeat by Kei Nishikori 2018 US Open Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:27 August-9 SeptemberCoverage:Live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text commentaries on the BBC Sport website Andy Murray's return to Grand Slam tennis ended in a four-set defeat by Spanish 31st seed Fernando Verdasco in the US Open second round. The former British number one, playing his first Slam in 14 months, lost 7-5 2-6 6-4 6-4 in New York. In sweltering conditions, Murray, 31, battled hard but did not have enough to overcome the 34-year-old Verdasco. Compatriot Cameron Norrie lost 6-2 2-6 6-4 6-4 to Serbia's Dusan Lajovic as British singles representation ended. It's normal to have doubts over my tennis future - Murray 'Liar, liar, pants on fire' - Murray responds after Verdasco denies coaching claim It was only Murray's fifth tournament back since having hip surgery in January. The Scot looked exhausted at times during a physical encounter on a humid Arthur Ashe Stadium - a combination of the conditions as temperatures rose close to 100F (38C) and his lack of five-set matches since being sidelined through injury. Murray's limp between points - a regular sight in recent years - seemed to become heavier as the match wore on. ""It wasn't the most comfortable I felt on a tennis court. I got through it and fought right to the end,"" he said. Murray continued to show the dogged determination that helped him win three Grand Slam titles at the peak of his powers, pushing Verdasco to the limit before succumbing to a third match point in three hours and 23 minutes. Despite defeat, Murray felt he played some of his best tennis since returning to the ATP Tour in June. ""There were periods in the match where I played some really good stuff,"" he said. ""But there were some where I didn't - especially in the first set - and that was costly for me."" Del Potro powers into third round Day four preview: former champions in action Murray, now ranked 382nd in the world and unseeded, had the fortune of avoiding a high-ranked opponent in the first round, battling back to beat 448th-ranked James Duckworth - the Australian also on the road to recovery after long-term injury - in three sets on Monday. That pitted him against two-time US Open quarter-finalist Verdasco, who Murray said he expected to test his movement - and the Spaniard did exactly that. The pair traded four break points in the opening seven games, Murray missing a set point at 5-4 when Verdasco rescued it with an ace out wide. That proved pivotal as Verdasco grabbed the momentum to break in the next game and hold out for the early advantage. ""I hit a lot of mistakes when I was up in that set. I feel like I should have won the first set and didn't,"" said Murray. Murray was undeterred, however, breaking for 3-1 in the second set as Verdasco's service game began to unravel. The pair exchanged breaks again as Murray moved 4-2 ahead before the Spaniard produced a double fault on set point to allow the former world number one to level. Verdasco upped his service game in the third set, landing 71% of his first serves to break twice and ensure the match would go to four sets at least. Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Both players disappeared off Ashe at the end of the third set after Verdasco took the 10-minute extreme heat break which was again implemented by US Open officials. When Murray returned to court, he complained Verdasco was talking to his team in the locker room - which is against the rules. ""When I came out of the shower, his coach and one of the Spanish doubles players was in there chatting to him, and you're not allowed to speak to your coach. I went and told the supervisor,"" Murray said. ""I'm not blaming Fernando and his team. They probably weren't aware that that was the rules. They certainly weren't trying to break any rules. ""It shouldn't be for the player that's competing against him to have to go to the supervisor."" However, Verdasco denied he was talking to his coach, saying he was only there to go to the toilet. ""I was in the ice bath with Marcos Baghdatis and his coach,"" Verdasco said. ""I don't want to say that Andy lied, but I didn't talk one word with my coach or any one member of my team. ""I know exactly the rule and I don't want to be the one breaking it."" Murray posted his reaction to Verdasco's comments on social media After the heat break, a composed Verdasco controlled the fourth set and headed towards victory after breaking for 4-3. That was until an 11-minute final game when the Spaniard combusted with a third-round match against Argentine third seedJuan Martin del Potroin sight. His previously reliable serve disappeared as he coughed up five break points, produced two double faults and hit some wild shots in a dramatic final game. Verdasco also furiously complained after being given a time violation before eventually ending Murray's resistance with a 104mph second serve - his fastest of the match - which forced Murray long on the third match point. ""At the end when my back was against the wall, I came up with some good tennis to make it close and interesting and almost got myself back into it,"" Murray said. ""But there were too many ups and downs for my liking."" BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller These three hours and 23 minutes reminded us exactly what we have been missing. Murray offered flair, heart and resilience, mixed in with a familiar dose of confrontation and a long-running one way 'conversation' with his coach Jamie Delgado. Even when seemingly running out of gas in the fourth set, he still managed to create five break back points in a final game which lasted over 12 minutes. Unsurprisingly, so soon in his comeback, Murray's unforced error count was higher than he would wish for. But in the early stages especially, he played as close to the baseline as possible, and significantly inside it when Verdasco lined up a second serve. It has been an encouraging US Open, but Murray knows there is still a long road ahead. Cameron Norrie beat Jordan Thompson in his opening match on Monday British number two Cameron Norrie's bid to reach the third round of a Grand Slam for the first time came to an end only moments after Murray's defeat. The 23-year-old world number 67, who has enjoyed a rapid rise up the rankings since turning professional in spring 2017, was not helped by his 58 unforced errors against Lajovic. His match mirrored Murray's as he fought back from a set down to take the second before failing to take his chances in the next two sets - managing to convert just three of his 14 break points in a match lasting almost three hours. Norrie was also penalised a first serve for returning late from the 10-minute heat break after the third set. The unhappy Briton told the umpire he had been assured by officials he had enough time. Defeat for Norrie and Murray means there are no Britons left in the men's or women's singles after Kyle Edmund, Johanna Konta and Heather Watson were knocked out in the first round. Meanwhile, in the men's doubles British brothers Ken and Neal Skupski were beaten 7-6 (7-4) 7-6 (7-5) by Radu Albot and Malek Jaziri.

"This video can not be played 'The economic crisis killed my father' Argentina's government has unexpectedly asked for the early release of a $50bn (Â£37.2bn) loan from the IMF amid a growing economic crisis. President Mauricio Macri said the move was designed to restore confidence in the Argentine economy. The Argentine peso has lost more than 40% of its value against the US dollar this year and inflation is rampant. The IMF confirmed on Wednesday it was looking to strengthen the arrangement and changing its phasing. ""I stressed my support for Argentina's policy efforts and our readiness to assist the government in developing its revised policy plans,"" Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said in a statement. Argentina economy: From comeback kid to turbulence IMF issues warning on global debt Investors are concerned Argentina may not be able repay its heavy government borrowing and could default. Correspondents say the decision to speed up the IMF bailout smacks of growing desperation. When the terms of the loan were agreed in May, President Macri said he expected the economy to recover and did not plan to use the money. By Daniel Gallas in Buenos Aires The world's highest interest rates and backing from the IMF have failed to reassure investors. The Argentine peso is still losing value despite all attempts to meet investor concerns. Other emerging markets such as Turkey and Brazil are also suffering from the devaluation of their currencies this year, but Argentina's situation is particularly troublesome. The country has not been able to lower inflation, which is the highest amongst G20 nations. And the government is failing to enact the economic reforms it promised the IMF, most of them aimed at curbing public spending and borrowing. President Macri was elected on the promise of reviving the economy, but so far it seems little progress has been made. Everyday life is getting more expensive for Argentines, as the prices of many goods and services still bear a close relation to the US dollar. And the combination of spiralling inflation and public spending cuts means wages are not keeping pace with prices, making most people poorer. ""Over the last week we have seen new expressions of lack of confidence in the markets, specifically over our financing capacity in 2019,"" Mr Macri said in a televised address. ""We have agreed with the International Monetary Fund to advance all the necessary funds to guarantee compliance with the financial programme next year. ""This decision aims to eliminate any uncertainty."" He added that further measures to rein in government borrowing would accompany the move. Mr Macri's decision to ask the IMF for help in May was criticised by many within his country. The IMF is widely loathed in Argentina and blamed for the country's 2001 economic collapse after it pulled the plug and denied financial support. The country's opposition blames Mr Macri's centre-right policies, including the end of capital controls and cuts to social programmes, for the economic crisis. ""IMF, never again,"" reads a banner held by protesters in Buenos Aires last month Argentina, which has been plagued by economic problems for years, asked for assistance from the IMF in May after its currency hit an all-time low. The country committed to tackle its double-digit inflation and cut public spending as part of the deal. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said at the time that the plan had been designed by the Argentine government and was ""aimed at strengthening the economy for the benefit of all Argentines"". At the beginning of the year, a dollar bought 20 pesos - now it buys more than 30 After speaking to President Macri on Wednesday evening, she said that she had instructed her staff to work with the Argentine authorities to strengthen the agreed arrangement and re-examine the planned phasing. She also said she was confident the ""strong commitment and determination"" of the authorities would be instrumental on steering the country through the difficult financial climate. In 2001, Argentina's government defaulted on its debt and left the banking system largely paralysed. The effect on Argentines was devastating, with many seeing their prosperity quickly disappear. Those who experienced it fear a return of government restrictions imposed back then to prevent a run on the banks. Under the constraints, which lasted for a year, people could not freely withdraw money from their accounts, making life very difficult for ordinary Argentines.

"Mr Bobbitt (bottom left) lived with the couple, but is now back on the streets A homeless man is suing a US couple who raised more than $400,000 (Â£307,000) to help him, alleging they used the funds as their own ""piggy bank"". Johnny Bobbitt went viral last year when he gave his last $20 to Kate McClure when her car ran out of petrol. Ms McClure and her boyfriend Mark D'Amico started an online fundraiser for him, which drew contributions from over 14,000 donors. The legal action - alleging fraud and conspiracy - was filed on Tuesday. Life in Philadelphia's open-air drug camp Lawyers for the 35-year-old wrote in documents filed in Mount Holly - a New Jersey suburb of Philadelphia - that the couple had used the GoFundMe account they set up for Mr Bobbitt ""to fund a lifestyle that they could not otherwise afford"". In recent interviews, Mr Bobbitt said Ms McClure, 28, and Mr D'Amico, 39, had recently paid for trips to Las Vegas and Florida, and a new BMW. Mr D'Amico works as a carpenter and Ms McClure is a receptionist for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, according to local media. A judge is set to hear the case on Thursday. A representative for the civil court told the BBC the couple do not have an attorney listed on record. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Last week, Ms McCluretold the Philadelphia Inquirer,externalshe felt frustrated and betrayed, and that she still wished to help Mr Bobbitt. ""I don't want to lose my job over this,"" she tearfully told the newspaper. After wildly surpassing their original fundraising goal of $10,000, the couple had told their online supporters the money would go to two financial trusts for Mr Bobbitt, as well as a lawyer and a financial adviser to help him manage all the money. They gave him clothing, allowed him to park his new camper outside their home, but reportedly later asked him to leave. Mr Bobbitt says the couple sold his camper, gambled away some of his money, and have declined to provide him with any financial records. Mr Bobbitt, pictured earlier in August, has continued using drugs The couple claims he once blew $25,000 on drugs in just 13 days. ""Every dollar he ever touched was used for drugs,"" Mr D'Amico told NBC in a nationally televised interview on Monday. He added that he would be ""absolutely"" willing to allow an accountant to review financial statements to determine how the money was used, and what remains. Mr Bobbitt, a US Marine veteran, is now back living on the streets with his younger brother. In an interview with the Inquirer, he said begging for change to buy drugs was better than trying to get money from Mr D'Amico and Ms McClure. Jacqueline Promislo, a lawyer for Mr Bobbitt, told the BBC she took the case pro bono to make sure he would be able to benefit from the charity of thousands of people ""so he could not be homeless again"". Ms Promislo said her client estimates the couple did spend about $75,000 on his care. During the NBC interview Mr D'Amico said about $150,000 remains. Ms Promislo said her office hoped to avoid going to court. ""It's not the couple's money to decide where it goes,"" she said. ""Every single person I have heard from, that has emailed or called, is extremely upset and very much want Johnny Bobbitt to receive the money they gave to him."" A spokesman for GoFundMe says it ""is looking into the claims of misuse"". ""We will work to ensure that Johnny receives the help he deserves and that the donors' intentions are honoured,"" the spokesman added.

"Mr Salmond said he intended to apply to rejoin the SNP once he had an opportunity to clear his name Alex Salmond, Scotland's former first minister and ex-SNP leader,has resignedfrom the party following sexual misconduct claims, which he denies. He announced he was quitting in a video posted on social media on Wednesday evening. Here is his statement in full: ""I have been a member of the Scottish National Party for 45 years, 20 of them as party leader and seven as First Minister of Scotland. ""I hope I have done the party and the broader cause of independence some service. ""Apart from a political spat back in the 1980s, that has been a period of continuous membership. I truly love the SNP and the wider independence movement in Scotland. ""They have been the defining commitment of my life. But today I have written to the National Secretary of the party resigning my membership. ""I read carefully Nicola Sturgeon's statement on Sunday and watched her television interview of a couple of days ago. She made it clear that the SNP have never received a single complaint about my personal conduct in my many decades of membership. ""And the Scottish Government have confirmed that they did not have any such complaint before this January, more than three years after I left office as first minister. ""That is the record of 30 years of public service. ""So let me be clear again. I refute these two complaints of harassment and I absolutely reject any suggestion of criminality. ""I believe that all such issues must be treated seriously, confidentially and through a fair process. In this case confidentiality has been broken greatly to my detriment and in a way which puts at serious risk the anonymity of both complainants. ""It urgently needs to be established who breached that duty of confidence and why. ""It seems obvious that Nicola feels under pressure from other political parties to suspend me from SNP membership, given recent party precedents. ""For my part I have always thought it a very poor idea to suspend any party member on the basis of complaints and allegations. Innocent until proven guilty is central to our concept of justice.

"Sion Williams, a lobster and crab fisherman, said the shellfish business was vulnerable Many of Wales' fishermen will ""not survive"" a Brexit no deal, it has been claimed. The vast majority catch shellfish, exporting them live to the continent or further afield via EU trade deals. The Welsh Fishermen's Association (WFA) warned ""people would start going out of business"" after just four weeks if custom checks and restrictions caused delays. The UK government said it was ""focused on getting the best possible deal"". Sion Williams, a lobster and crab fisherman, who works near Nefyn, Gwynedd said the sector was becoming increasingly concerned the UK would leave the EU without a trade deal. While many fishermen still harboured hopes of increased quotas after Brexit, he said maintaining access to European markets and current income levels was essential. ""So much has been promised and people's hopes have been raised.  I don't think anyone voted for things to get worse,"" Mr Williams said. ""Of all the food producers exporting to Europe, the shellfish sector would be the most vulnerable if we have no deal."" This map shows the value of landings around the coast of Wales and the type of fishing Of the 451 vessels registered in Wales, 92% are small-scale, defined as under 10m in length, specialising in shellfish like lobster, crab, whelks and mussels. In 2017, they landed Â£38.8m worth of produce, with 90% sold directly to EU markets. ""Any delay in the transit of these commodities will cause a lot of problems as they are live shellfish and they need to be supplied as soon as possible,"" Mr Williams said. ""If they're held up in ports, they can deteriorate, lose value and even die."" ""It's been calculated that the industry would not be able to hold on more than four weeks of not being able to sell products into Europe. Because of the high cost of fishing enterprises, people expect to get a quick turnaround of money to support their businesses."" Shell fishing fleet wants help with Brexit Some foreign access to UK waters after Brexit All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Financial assistance for fishermen would need to be considered by the UK and Welsh governments if the politicians failed to negotiate a trade deal, he argued. As well as potential customs delays, Mr Williams said he understood tariffs of around 6% for crabs and 8% for lobster could be imposed. One leading seafood restaurant chain in North Wales said it was preparing for the price of shellfish to rise after Brexit. This video can not be played Shellfish on the menu at Dylan's Criccieth restaurant - the business appreciates the links to the local fishing industry Gemma Webb, events manager at Dylan's - which has three sites in Criccieth, Menai Bridge and Llandudno - said it was vital to maintain a strong fishing industry because of the knock-on effect it has on other sectors such as tourism. ""In some ways it could be good for the local fishing industry because surely if it is more difficult to get produce from abroad lots of restaurants here will be buying from local producers,"" she said. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said it had ""repeatedly warned"" against the impacts of a 'no deal' Brexit scenario to all industries in Wales, with the fishing industry particularly vulnerable. ""We are working hard with fishing communities to explore and, where possible, mitigate the impacts of a 'no deal' scenario but the threat is still very real,"" she said. ""We have always been clear that full and unfettered access to the EU market must be maintained and are making the case for this with the UK government as the trade negotiations develop."" A Defra spokeswoman said leaving the EU presented a ""bright future"" for the Welsh fishing industry and coastal communities and it was working with closely with the Welsh Government and other bodies to make the most of the ""historic opportunity"". ""We are focused on getting the best possible deal when we leave the EU, which includes safeguarding the interests of our iconic fishing industry and maintaining consumer choice,"" she said.

"Some trawlers were damaged in the overnight fracas British and French fishermen have clashed in the Channel, over alleged ""looting"" of the scallop fishing grounds there by British boats. Tense exchanges were filmed on Tuesday, off the coast of Normandy, after years of carefully managed truce between the two sides.  What lies behind the fresh tensions, and what impact will Brexit have on relations between them? In times of cross-Channel tension, it's been a handy and well-worn reflex in some quarters to blame the meddlesome bureaucracy of the EU - its agricultural subsidies; its detailed trading standards; its fishing quotas. For more than a decade, the friction between British and French fishermen around the Bay of Seine, off the coast of Normandy, has been over scallops. The French fishing industry is bound by an agreement with its government in Paris not to fish for scallops in the area between May and October, in order to conserve fish stocks. The British - who are also allowed to fish the area under EU access rights - are under no such restrictions from their own government. Et voilÃ : an ongoing battle that's been wearily termed ""the scallop wars"". Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops? Brexit: Shell fishermen 'will not survive' no deal Fish flung into Thames in Brexit deal protest For the past few years, a carefully constructed truce has kept the peace over this watery battlefield. The British agreed to ban their larger fishing vessels from the area until October, in keeping with French restrictions, on the understanding that smaller British boats could fish there all year round. But with the big boats out of the way during the summer months, the Regional Committee for Maritime Fishing in Normandy says that the number of smaller boats coming across the Channel is growing. This year, they asked that all British boats stay away from the scallop fishing grounds until they could share the catch, from October onwards. But smaller British fishermen are already feeling hard done by, because the vast majority of their EU fishing quotas go to larger British industrial fishing fleets, and many struggle to make a profit. Scallops, on the other hand, are not restricted by standard EU quotas.  Larger vessels have limits on the number of days they can fish for them, but boats under 10m (32ft) have an open invitation - a small but important symbolic advantage. So, their answer to the new terms of the truce?  Non. With no gentlemen's agreement in place, British vessels have had free rein to stir up the stormy waters of Normandy's scallop grounds. And in the early hours of Tuesday morning, the French took things into their own hands. British fishermen said they had been surrounded and had rocks and metal shackles thrown at them So far, no-one has been hurt, but the dispute remains unresolved. Both sides have agreed to meet, to try to find a solution. One local fisherman told Le Monde newspaper that a hard Brexit would solve it once and for all - by denying the British automatic access to fish in EU waters. But the rules restricting French scallop fishermen in the Bay of Seine have nothing to do with the EU. And even if their British rivals leave the bloc, France's fisheries ministry points out, that area is open to other EU members who have the freedom to fish there all year round. Even for British fishermen - who are reported to have voted overwhelmingly for Brexit, with the aim of regaining control over their own national fishing grounds - Brexit may not be the cure-all. EU vessels will no longer have automatic access to British fishing waters after Brexit, but the war over quotas between big industrial vessels and local fishermen is an internal British one. It's the authorities in London, not Brussels, who set the rules under which industrial fishing companies dominate the market, and allow the ""leasing"" of fishing quotas by big companies, while some other EU governments, like France, do not. Brexit may look like a handy solution for fishermen on both sides of the Channel, but - as one journalist put it recently - it could well be a red herring.

"The EU must back Theresa May's Brexit plan or risk the UK leaving without a deal, the most senior member of the UK PM's cabinet has said. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the European Commission's proposals remained unacceptable. And he appealed for compromise from the EU side in Brexit talks. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU was ready to offer the UK an unprecedented deal but it must not weaken the single market. Brexit: Dominic Raab says EU deal close May sticking by 'sensible' Brexit plans Brexit: Key dates and potential hurdles Speaking to a French business conference, Mr Lidington, who is Mrs May's de facto second-in-command, suggested there were only two choices on the table as Brexit talks entered a critical phase. ""With exactly seven months until the end of Article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European Council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European Commission, or the risk of there being no deal. ""The alternative models do not meet the level of ambition or the outcome we all want to see delivered. ""So, we need the EU to engage with us on our positive vision of the future relationship."" His message was softened from a version of the speech released to journalists beforehand, which had simply warned of ""no deal"". Mr Lidington was branded ""arrogant"" by the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum, which added: ""Good deal, bad deal or no deal, Brexit is a big deal and it must be for the people to decide."" Dominic Raab: 'Good rapport' with Barnier It came as Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab denied reports Michel Barnier has turned down UK requests for extended meetings in Brussels. Mr Raab was said byThe Guardian,externalto have been frustrated by the EU chief negotiator's alleged failure to make himself available for talks. But Mr Raab told a Lords Committee he had a ""good professional and personal rapport"" with Mr Barnier. And he would be holding a ""long"" meeting with him on Friday. Mr Raab vowed to increase the pace and frequency of talks with Mr Barnier when he took over in July from David Davis, who quit as Brexit Secretary in protest at Theresa May's white paper on trade with the EU when Britain leaves. ""I'm confident that a deal is within our sights,"" Mr Raab told the Lords EU Committee. ""We're bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal."" Michel Barnier: 'Single market means single market' He added: ""Firstly, in relation to whatever tittle tattle may appear in whatever newspaper, I shall be over in Brussels tomorrow (Thursday) evening for a long, substantive meeting on Friday, I hope that gives you the facts directly with Michel Barnier."" Britain is on course to leave the EU on 29 March. Both sides are hoping to agree a divorce deal and a statement on future trading relations by the next EU summit on 17 October - but Mr Raab suggested that deadline could slip, saying there was a ""possibility that it may creep beyond"" that date. On the Â£39bn Brexit ""divorce bill"", Mr Raab said a no-deal scenario could affect arrangements over payments to the EU. ""I don't think it could be safely assumed on anyone's side that the financial settlement as has been agreed by the withdrawal agreement would then just be paid in precisely the same shape or speed or rate if there was no deal."" And he rejected claims by pro-EU Labour peer Lord Liddle that any deal document was likely to be ""vacuous"" and ""opaque"", saying he expected it to contain a ""degree of detail"" and some ""clear choices"". Theresa May's chief Brexit advisor Olly Robbins will no longer have to face questions from MPs or peers, Mr Raab told the committee, which was holding a special meeting during Parliament's summer recess. Thetwo men were grilled by MPsin a joint appearance before the Commons Brexit committee in July. But Mr Raab told the Lords EU committee that in future it would be ministers only - and not civil servants - that ""come and be accountable"" to Parliamentary committees over Brexit. Meanwhile Mr Barnier, speaking Berlin, said the EU was ""prepared to offer Britain a partnership such as there never has been with any other third country"". But, he added, it would not permit anything that weakened the single market. ""We respect Britain's red lines scrupulously. In return, they must respect what we are. Single market means single market ... There is no single market a la carte,"" he told reporters. The pound rose 0.6%, to around $1.2950, after the EU chief negotiator's comments.

"Henry Miller's body was found by the side of a road in Colombia A coroner is urging guidance over the use of hallucinogenic drugs in tribal rituals following the death of a teenager in Colombia. Henry Miller, 19, from Bristol,died in the rainforest after reacting to ayahuasca, or yage, which he drank during a shamanic ceremony. His body was found by the side of the road in the remote Putumayo region in April 2014. The Avon Coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death by intoxification. Ayahuasca, also known as yage,is a blend of two plants and contains the hallucinogenic drug dimethyltryptamine(DMT). Coroner Maria Voisin said she will be making a report to the Foreign Office to encourage extra guidance to those travelling to areas where the drug is prevalent. The inquest heard Mr Miller, described previously as ""an adventurous person who travelled extensively"", had ventured into a remote part of the rainforest to take part in a shamanic ritual. In a statement read during the hearing Mr Miller's family said: ""Young travellers should be made aware of the small but real dangers of this practice."" Taking ayahuasca is illegal in the UK A statement from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said Mr Miller had attended a tribal ritual 48 hours prior to his death and had drunk the substance but felt no effects. He returned two days later, on 22 April, to try it again, but soon after drinking one cup his breathing slowed and he became unwell. Two men tried to take Mr Miller to hospital via motorcycle when he fell ill, but he died on the way and they ""panicked"" and left him at the roadside, the inquest heard. The coroner read a statement from Christopher Dearden who was also at the ceremony with his partner Elaine. Mr Dearden said he had paid 50,000 Colombian pesos to Mama Concha's Place for the ceremony. He said: ""A harmonica was playing and there was chanting with about a dozen people there, four of whom were Colombian students who were given permission to film. ""I started to feel the effects straight away."" The inquest heard from a medical report that Mr Miller had no pre-existing medical conditions. It said the hallucinogenic drug DMT leads to hallucinations and elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Medical reports compiled in Colombia and the UK agreed he died of intoxification from the substance. Could psychedelic drug ayahuasca have health benefits? Why do people take ayahuasca?

"This video can not be played 'The economic crisis killed my father' Argentina's government has unexpectedly asked for the early release of a $50bn (Â£37.2bn) loan from the IMF amid a growing economic crisis. President Mauricio Macri said the move was designed to restore confidence in the Argentine economy. The Argentine peso has lost more than 40% of its value against the US dollar this year and inflation is rampant. The IMF confirmed on Wednesday it was looking to strengthen the arrangement and changing its phasing. ""I stressed my support for Argentina's policy efforts and our readiness to assist the government in developing its revised policy plans,"" Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said in a statement. Argentina economy: From comeback kid to turbulence IMF issues warning on global debt Investors are concerned Argentina may not be able repay its heavy government borrowing and could default. Correspondents say the decision to speed up the IMF bailout smacks of growing desperation. When the terms of the loan were agreed in May, President Macri said he expected the economy to recover and did not plan to use the money. By Daniel Gallas in Buenos Aires The world's highest interest rates and backing from the IMF have failed to reassure investors. The Argentine peso is still losing value despite all attempts to meet investor concerns. Other emerging markets such as Turkey and Brazil are also suffering from the devaluation of their currencies this year, but Argentina's situation is particularly troublesome. The country has not been able to lower inflation, which is the highest amongst G20 nations. And the government is failing to enact the economic reforms it promised the IMF, most of them aimed at curbing public spending and borrowing. President Macri was elected on the promise of reviving the economy, but so far it seems little progress has been made. Everyday life is getting more expensive for Argentines, as the prices of many goods and services still bear a close relation to the US dollar. And the combination of spiralling inflation and public spending cuts means wages are not keeping pace with prices, making most people poorer. ""Over the last week we have seen new expressions of lack of confidence in the markets, specifically over our financing capacity in 2019,"" Mr Macri said in a televised address. ""We have agreed with the International Monetary Fund to advance all the necessary funds to guarantee compliance with the financial programme next year. ""This decision aims to eliminate any uncertainty."" He added that further measures to rein in government borrowing would accompany the move. Mr Macri's decision to ask the IMF for help in May was criticised by many within his country. The IMF is widely loathed in Argentina and blamed for the country's 2001 economic collapse after it pulled the plug and denied financial support. The country's opposition blames Mr Macri's centre-right policies, including the end of capital controls and cuts to social programmes, for the economic crisis. ""IMF, never again,"" reads a banner held by protesters in Buenos Aires last month Argentina, which has been plagued by economic problems for years, asked for assistance from the IMF in May after its currency hit an all-time low. The country committed to tackle its double-digit inflation and cut public spending as part of the deal. IMF managing director Christine Lagarde said at the time that the plan had been designed by the Argentine government and was ""aimed at strengthening the economy for the benefit of all Argentines"". At the beginning of the year, a dollar bought 20 pesos - now it buys more than 30 After speaking to President Macri on Wednesday evening, she said that she had instructed her staff to work with the Argentine authorities to strengthen the agreed arrangement and re-examine the planned phasing. She also said she was confident the ""strong commitment and determination"" of the authorities would be instrumental on steering the country through the difficult financial climate. In 2001, Argentina's government defaulted on its debt and left the banking system largely paralysed. The effect on Argentines was devastating, with many seeing their prosperity quickly disappear. Those who experienced it fear a return of government restrictions imposed back then to prevent a run on the banks. Under the constraints, which lasted for a year, people could not freely withdraw money from their accounts, making life very difficult for ordinary Argentines.

"Elon Musk frequently replies to others' comments on Twitter Elon Musk has tweeted again about a man he had previously accused of being a child abuser. ""You don't think it's strange he hasn't sued me? He was offered free legal services,""Tesla's chief posted,external. The tweet comes more than a month after Mr Musk apologised to the British diving expert Vern Unsworth for calling him a ""pedo"". Critics suggest the latest message is further evidence of the tech leader's erratic behaviour on social media. Mr Unsworth has told the BBC that he does not want to say anything at this stage. Tesla's shares fell about 1.5% in early trade despite the Nasdaq, on which it trades, opening higher. Mr Musk has been embroiled in another Twitter-related controversy over recent weeks after tweeting that he was considering taking his car firm private, adding that he had secured the funds required. That caused major swings in the company's share price and subsequent claims that his message had been misleading. Mr Musk later said the firm would stay public. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is now reported to be investigating the matter, and some Tesla investors are suing the firm over the tweets. Mr Musk's latest tweet was written in response to a former journalist, who had accused him of hypocrisy. ""Your dedication to facts and truth would have been wonderful if applied to that time when you called someone a pedo,"" posted Drew Olanoff. In response, the tech entrepreneur not only questioned why Mr Unsworth had not taken him to court but also attacked Mr Olanoff for not carrying out his own investigation into the matter. ""So you actually did nothing and yet imply you are a truth-seeker,"" wrote Mr Musk. The US business leader had originally tweeted about Mr Unsworth in July. The two had been involved in a dispute over Mr Musk's offer of a mini-submarine to help rescue schoolchildren trapped in a flooded cave network in Thailand. Mr Unsworth declined to comment on Mr Musk's latest tweet When questioned about this, the Briton had told CNN that the submarine was ""just a PR stunt [that] had absolutely no chance of working"". Mr Musk responded with a series of tweets, casting doubt on Mr Unsworth's character without providing supportive evidence. They culminated in a post that described Mr Unsworth as a ""pedo guy"" and a follow-up saying ""bet ya a signed dollar it's true"". Mr Unsworth subsequently said he might take legal action. The clash appeared to have been resolved after Mr Musk deleted his offending tweets. ""His actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologise to Mr Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader,""Mr Musk tweeted on 18 July,external. Mr Musk has more than 22 million Twitter followers and frequently interacts with users who refer to him on the platform. Many of his messages have led to positive coverage about Tesla and his other companies in the press. But some observers have suggested Mr Musk should curtail his use of social media bearing in mind he has said he is working 120-hour weeks, is under great stress and is making use of the sedative Ambien. Mr Musk, however, has denied his use of the app was a distraction. ""I think sometimes people think I spend a lot of time in Twitter,"" he told theYouTuber Marques Brownlee earlier this month,external. ""Actually, it's like almost nothing. Most of my time is spent... going round the [Tesla] factory... and if I'm not here I'm at the Giga [battery] factory in Nevada."" Mr Musk says he spends most of his time doing work rather than using social media Mr Musk's younger brother - who is a board member of Tesla - defended his sibling's behaviour in a recent interview with the New York Times. ""The reason Elon seems to attract drama is that he is so transparent, so open, in a way that can come back to bite him,"" said Kimbal Musk. ""He doesn't know how to do it differently."" But one leadership expert suggested some of Mr Musk's behaviour was unacceptable. ""Conventional business leaders are far more careful in their behaviour - you don't find FTSE 100 chief executives shooting from the hip like this because they are advised it would be detrimental to the interests of their companies,"" Matthew Gwyther, ex-editor of Management Today, told the BBC. ""But there can be a lack of humility that comes with being involved with big tech. ""If [the latest tweet] adversely affects the share price then Tesla's board members may feel duty bound to do something about it. ""But one way or the other, it's not the way you'd expect a person with that degree of power and responsibility to behave.""

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison A British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran has been taken to a prison clinic after passing out, her husband has said. Richard Ratcliffe said his wife had suffered several panic attacks and low blood pressure, adding the family were ""very, very worried"". Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had just returned to prison after being granted a three-day release over the weekend. She wasjailed for five years in 2016after being convicted of spying, which she denies. Last week Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her family, including her four-year-old daughter Gabriella, during the temporary release. But she voluntarily returned to prison on Sunday night ""with her head held high"", after being told her application for an extension had been denied. What is Iran jail case about? Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle Iran's jailed dual nationals and their uncertain fate Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had suffered several panic attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, speaking of headaches, a rash and numbness in her legs and right arm. ""I think it feels like the physical symptoms of crushing disappointment since she went back into prison,"" he said. Mr Ratcliffe said the head of the prison had been ""worried enough to come down and see her"", and was ""very surprised"" that she had not been allowed to extend her furlough. He added she was still in the clinic as far as he knew, despite reports that she had been taken to an external hospital. A picture of Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe saying goodbye to her daughter was posted on the Free Nazanin campaign's Twitter account on Sunday. Allow Twitter content?

He said the past few days had been a ""whirlwind"" and he was ""very worried"" about his wife. He added he was waiting by the phone and the family had been in touch with the British Embassy. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe has experienced a number of panic attacks during her imprisonment, but her husband said they were becoming more frequent. Her psychiatrist has said she needs to see a neurologist, but this has not yet happened. Richard Ratcliffe has been campaigning for his wife's release Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from Hampstead, north London, was detained at Tehran airport in 2016 after visiting her family on holiday. The British-Iranian mother, who works for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has always insisted the visit was to introduce her daughter Gabriella to relatives. Following the news of her ill health on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said ""all our thoughts and prayers"" were with Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family. He tweeted: ""Unbearable suffering to be apart from [her] daughter with her hopes raised then dashed. We must redouble efforts to find a way to get her home.""

"Mr Bobbitt (bottom left) lived with the couple, but is now back on the streets A homeless man is suing a US couple who raised more than $400,000 (Â£307,000) to help him, alleging they used the funds as their own ""piggy bank"". Johnny Bobbitt went viral last year when he gave his last $20 to Kate McClure when her car ran out of petrol. Ms McClure and her boyfriend Mark D'Amico started an online fundraiser for him, which drew contributions from over 14,000 donors. The legal action - alleging fraud and conspiracy - was filed on Tuesday. Life in Philadelphia's open-air drug camp Lawyers for the 35-year-old wrote in documents filed in Mount Holly - a New Jersey suburb of Philadelphia - that the couple had used the GoFundMe account they set up for Mr Bobbitt ""to fund a lifestyle that they could not otherwise afford"". In recent interviews, Mr Bobbitt said Ms McClure, 28, and Mr D'Amico, 39, had recently paid for trips to Las Vegas and Florida, and a new BMW. Mr D'Amico works as a carpenter and Ms McClure is a receptionist for the New Jersey Department of Transportation, according to local media. A judge is set to hear the case on Thursday. A representative for the civil court told the BBC the couple do not have an attorney listed on record. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Last week, Ms McCluretold the Philadelphia Inquirer,externalshe felt frustrated and betrayed, and that she still wished to help Mr Bobbitt. ""I don't want to lose my job over this,"" she tearfully told the newspaper. After wildly surpassing their original fundraising goal of $10,000, the couple had told their online supporters the money would go to two financial trusts for Mr Bobbitt, as well as a lawyer and a financial adviser to help him manage all the money. They gave him clothing, allowed him to park his new camper outside their home, but reportedly later asked him to leave. Mr Bobbitt says the couple sold his camper, gambled away some of his money, and have declined to provide him with any financial records. Mr Bobbitt, pictured earlier in August, has continued using drugs The couple claims he once blew $25,000 on drugs in just 13 days. ""Every dollar he ever touched was used for drugs,"" Mr D'Amico told NBC in a nationally televised interview on Monday. He added that he would be ""absolutely"" willing to allow an accountant to review financial statements to determine how the money was used, and what remains. Mr Bobbitt, a US Marine veteran, is now back living on the streets with his younger brother. In an interview with the Inquirer, he said begging for change to buy drugs was better than trying to get money from Mr D'Amico and Ms McClure. Jacqueline Promislo, a lawyer for Mr Bobbitt, told the BBC she took the case pro bono to make sure he would be able to benefit from the charity of thousands of people ""so he could not be homeless again"". Ms Promislo said her client estimates the couple did spend about $75,000 on his care. During the NBC interview Mr D'Amico said about $150,000 remains. Ms Promislo said her office hoped to avoid going to court. ""It's not the couple's money to decide where it goes,"" she said. ""Every single person I have heard from, that has emailed or called, is extremely upset and very much want Johnny Bobbitt to receive the money they gave to him."" A spokesman for GoFundMe says it ""is looking into the claims of misuse"". ""We will work to ensure that Johnny receives the help he deserves and that the donors' intentions are honoured,"" the spokesman added.

"This video can not be played Stacey Solomon says women's magazines give the message that 'nobody is good enough'. Stacey Solomon has hit out at gossip magazines for making women feel as though ""they're not good enough"". The TV presenter was featured on this week's cover of Now magazine with the headline ""Stacey 'boring', 'desperate', 'cheap' - why fans are sick of her"". The 28-year old Loose Women panellistshared the cover,externalwith her 1.44 million Twitter followers, writing: ""That's the meanest thing I've ever seen."" Now magazine has released a statement apologising to Solomon. In afollow-up tweet,external, Solomon accused the magazine of ""constantly tearing people down in a bullying manner,"" and asked Now to explain itself in light of the large number of tweets in support of the former X Factor singer. Speaking toBBC Radio 5 Live, Solomon said: ""I think a lot of people think it is part and parcel of the job and it's water off a duck's back, don't worry. Loose Women: Ruth Langsford, Coleen Nolan, Jane Moore and Stacey Solomon ""And the majority of the time I do try and adopt that mentality, because I don't want anybody to have the power to make me feel a certain way. I want to be in control of how  I feel and, you know, no matter how much somebody tries to drag me down I want to be able to go 'NOâ¦ I am not allowing you to do that.' ""But sometimes it does get in, I am a human being and sometimes it does really hurt."" In response, a Now magazine statement said: ""The story featured in this week's issue of Now magazine regarding Stacey Solomon was written on the basis of social media comments about Stacey and is not the opinion of Now magazine. It added: ""We do not encourage or condone bullying in any form. We apologise to Stacey for any distress our story may have caused."" Solomon, who has worked with Childline and the NSPCC as a body image campaigner, cited a Children's Society survey which suggestedmore than a fifth of 14-year-old girls in the UK said they had self-harmed. She said she believes negative comments in the media help fuel a feeling of self-doubt amongst young people. ""It's not so much the comments towards me that really upset me, I think it's the insinuation that nobody is good enough and the message that sends out to people and the effect that it has on people that actually really brings me down more than anything. ""It is just the messages we are giving out to people who might not have been able to spend the last 10 years building up a thick enough skin to bat these comments away - and subliminally telling people they are not good enough, that they need to change and that's why they're getting dumped or their relationship has broken down or they're losing friends, it's because they're not good enough. ""I just think that's an awful, awful message and it really does get to you sometimes, you just think 'I cannot believe this circus' and 'why we are doing this to young people?'"" A number of Solomon's celebrity friends rallied around her with supportive messages, including Strictly contestant Ashley Roberts and singer Olly Murs, who tweeted: ""Can't believe they have used this as a headline.

"Experts say the loss of password details could be ""severe"" Air Canada's app has suffered a data breach resulting in the suspected loss of thousands of its customers' personal details. The airline has warned that users who had entered their passport details into the product may have had that data stolen. Experts warn that the theft of such information would pose a serious ID fraud risk. The firm has also been criticised for its relatively weak password system. Although it is not clear how the breach occurred, one cyber-security specialist highlighted that Air Canada's website still says account passwords should contain between six and 10 characters and that it only accepts letters and numbers, but no other symbols. ""Many users will choose short and easily guessable passwords,"" commented Amit Sethi, a security consultant at Synopsys. ""Moreover, users that want to use strong passwords cannot do so."" Air Canada's website still says no special characters are allowed when creating an account password According to theCanadian government's own cyber-security advice,,externalall passwords should ""include at least one character that isn't a letter or number"" and be a minimum length of eight characters. The firm said it has adopted ""improved password guidelines"". Its app now says that passwords should be at least 10 characters long and contain one symbol. Air Canada said that it detected unusual login activity between 22 and 24 August and decided to lock down all 1.7 million of its accounts as a consequence. It believes data has been stolen from about 20,000 of these, and has informed members of this group via email. However, all customers will need to reset their logins to use the app again.

It said banks, insurance firms and mobile phone providers were among businesses that request the data to set up accounts, but do not always require sight of the physical document. Victims can face wrecked credit scores and bills, from which it can take months to extricate themselves. In some cases, Action Fraud added, it is even possible to use the information to obtain genuine documents such as driving licences and new passports. ""The loss of passport data in this breach makes it unusual,"" commented Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. ""Like driving licences, passports are considered government-issued ID and it is assumed that only the holder will know the contents. ""But we're at the point where so much sensitive data is being released via such breaches that we can no longer assume that mere knowledge of what is written in a passport is sufficient to verify ID online.""

"Kylie (left) is interacting with one of the porpoises in the Firth of Clyde after becoming separated from his group. A dolphin in Scotland's Firth of Clyde may be exchanging messages with porpoises. The dolphin, named Kylie, usually makes clicking sounds with a frequency of around 100KHz. But after interacting with a group of local porpoises he changed his tune. Research from the University of Strathclyde found that Kylie's clicking became higher than normal, and closer to that of his new found friends, who generally make sounds at 130KHz. He has made his home around a navigational buoy between Fairlie and the Isle of Cumbrae, in western Scotland. University of Strathclyde PhD student Mel Cosentino has been analysing the sounds. ""We have some more recording to do with Kylie when he is on his own and when he is with the group of porpoises,"" she said. ""We want to see whether he is imitating the porpoises, like when we bark back at a dog or there is something else going on."" Ms Cosentino should know soon whether Kylie really is communicating or merely imitating. She said that if further analysis showed the latter to be the case, it would be the first time a common dolphin has demonstrated an ability for ""production learning"" - where it has learned to imitate another species.

""But we're at the point where so much sensitive data is being released via such breaches that we can no longer assume that mere knowledge of what is written in a passport is sufficient to verify ID online."" Air Canada has recommended that its customers ""regularly review their financial transactions, be aware of any changes to their credit rating, and contact their financial services provider"" if they become aware of unusual activity.

"The Queen Elizabeth II Bridge in south-east England is one of 20,000 bridges and other structures managed by Highways England Road bridge inspections in England are being reviewedfollowing the collapse of a bridge in Genoa,the head of Highways England has said. Forty-three people died when a 200 metre section of the Morandi motorway bridge collapsed in the Italian city. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live,Jim O'Sullivan said the review was only ""a precautionary measure"". ""We have nothing that tells us that we might have a bridge that's in anyway in trouble like that,"" he added. What we know about Italy bridge collapse What could have caused the bridge collapse? In pictures: Deadly Italy bridge collapse Highways England chief executive Mr O'Sullivan said the biggest structures, which include bridges, viaducts and tunnels, would be looked at ""one by one"". There are over 20,000 structures on the road network, he said, many of which share similar designs to each other. Therefore the designs will be reviewed, rather than individually inspecting each and every structure. The review is expected to take three months, while implementing any changes needed could take up to 18 months. When asked if a bridge could collapse as happened in Genoa Mr O'Sullivan said: ""No - straightforward answer."" ""The first thing is we don't have any bridges of a similar design [to the Genoa bridge]... the second is our maintenance regime here in the UK is very, very good."" ""Many of the people who work in Highways England, in our supply chain, are seen as world leaders in the maintenance of bridges so we're very confident of what we do,"" he added. This video can not be played Parts of the bridge in Genoa can be seen collapsing However, he said, if there were lessons from the Genoan bridge collapse, Highways England would learn them. It is not yet clear what caused the disaster but some have suggested ongoing maintenance work, a design flaw, heavy traffic or degradation could be to blame.

"Henry Miller's body was found by the side of a road in Colombia A coroner is urging guidance over the use of hallucinogenic drugs in tribal rituals following the death of a teenager in Colombia. Henry Miller, 19, from Bristol,died in the rainforest after reacting to ayahuasca, or yage, which he drank during a shamanic ceremony. His body was found by the side of the road in the remote Putumayo region in April 2014. The Avon Coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death by intoxification. Ayahuasca, also known as yage,is a blend of two plants and contains the hallucinogenic drug dimethyltryptamine(DMT). Coroner Maria Voisin said she will be making a report to the Foreign Office to encourage extra guidance to those travelling to areas where the drug is prevalent. The inquest heard Mr Miller, described previously as ""an adventurous person who travelled extensively"", had ventured into a remote part of the rainforest to take part in a shamanic ritual. In a statement read during the hearing Mr Miller's family said: ""Young travellers should be made aware of the small but real dangers of this practice."" Taking ayahuasca is illegal in the UK A statement from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said Mr Miller had attended a tribal ritual 48 hours prior to his death and had drunk the substance but felt no effects. He returned two days later, on 22 April, to try it again, but soon after drinking one cup his breathing slowed and he became unwell. Two men tried to take Mr Miller to hospital via motorcycle when he fell ill, but he died on the way and they ""panicked"" and left him at the roadside, the inquest heard. The coroner read a statement from Christopher Dearden who was also at the ceremony with his partner Elaine. Mr Dearden said he had paid 50,000 Colombian pesos to Mama Concha's Place for the ceremony. He said: ""A harmonica was playing and there was chanting with about a dozen people there, four of whom were Colombian students who were given permission to film. ""I started to feel the effects straight away."" The inquest heard from a medical report that Mr Miller had no pre-existing medical conditions. It said the hallucinogenic drug DMT leads to hallucinations and elevated blood pressure and heart rate. Medical reports compiled in Colombia and the UK agreed he died of intoxification from the substance. Could psychedelic drug ayahuasca have health benefits? Why do people take ayahuasca?

"Leia Pierce says her son Jamel was ""magic"" The mother of a US nine-year-old,who she says killed himself after enduring homophobic bullying,says she ""should have seen the pain in his eyes"". Leia Rochelle Pierce from Denver, Colorado, said her son, Jamel Myles, had been proud to tell people he was gay when he returned to school. She told Victoria Derbyshire some fellow pupils told him to kill himself. Denver Public Schools said it was committed to ensuring all pupils were treated with dignity and respect. Ms Pierce said she blamed herself for his death, adding that her ""heart was breaking every second"". ""I feel responsible because I didn't see the pain in my baby's eyes. I should have just known. It's my fault, I didn't know."" Ms Pierce said Jamel had told her that he was gay over the summer. He had not planned to formally come out at school, but said he was ""proud of who he was and he didn't mind telling people"". This video can not be played Jamel Myles had told his mother that he was gay She said Jamel had seemed normal after his return to school, playing on her laptop and watching television as usual. But last Thursday, after only four days of term, she found him dead. ""I'm pretty sure he told someone who got that whole persona of 'that's not OK' and decided to pick on him,"" she said. ""I've sat here and seen kids pick on kids for less. I'm pretty sure he told one person and it spread and it became a worse situation."" Ms Pierce said after he died, her eldest daughter said Jamel had told her he was being bullied because he was gay. 'My brothers tried to pray the gay away' How I save children from bullies ""My son came home and told her the kids at school were telling him to kill himself,"" she said. ""He didn't come to me and that hurts as I would have understood and I would have defended him. They were so close, he would just tell her everything. ""I don't think it's fair to go through it. That image, seeing him like that, is burnt into my brain and it hurts. I never wanted to see my baby like that or for anyone to see their baby like that, it's not right,"" she added. Ms Pierce says all young people, regardless of their sexuality, should feel special, welcomed and warm. ""I would tell them they're beautiful and they're special and there's nothing different about them that should be pointed out and make them feel anything other than loved,"" she said. ""We are all different and it's our differences that make us equal, because it's the one thing we all have in common."" Jamel's mum said he could walk into any room and make people feel loved Ms Pierce said Jamel's school had told her in a phone call it was going to work on suicide prevention. She said it needed to stop bullying, which was what was leading to suicide. ""Teach your kids love, teach them it's OK to have differences, we're all different,"" she said. ""Teach them compassion, teach them respect, teach them to be more accepting of each other. ""It doesn't matter if you're the bully or you're not the bully, there's pain in everybody. Until we correct the pain and the hurt that's in everybody and turn it into love, nothing will change. We have to change ourselves for our children."" In pictures: Expelled for being gay 'Bullied for the way I looked' Ms Pierce said Jamel ""was magic"". ""This little boy could walk into any room and make any person feel so loved and so special. He had this pizzazz about him. ""He wanted to make a change in this world and he wanted to show people love. And he can't speak right now so I am speaking words he said for everyone to hear, because a gentle kind soul just left this world because of something so cruel. And I want my son to know he made a change for the better."" Denver Public Schools said it was ""deeply committed to ensuring that all members of our school community are treated with dignity and respect, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or transgender status"". In a statement, it added: ""Our policies and practices reflect this commitment to ensuring that our  LGBT students can pursue their education with dignity and joy. We also know, however, that we as a society have a long way to go to ensure that no child ever is bullied or treated with disrespect because of their self-identification.""

"A woman who says she was racially assaulted on a London bus has called for transport companies to keep CCTV material for longer, after footage of her attack was deleted in just 10 days. Makedah Simpson reported the incident to police immediately but the case was dropped due to a lack of CCTV evidence. Ms Simpson, 23, has launched a petition calling for firms to keep footage for 30 days, attracting 140,000 signatures. Transport for London said CCTV material was kept for as long as possible. Currently companies can set their own timeframes for holding footage. Crime victims 'ignored and confused' Violent crime: Is it getting worse? Ms Simpson was boarding a bus near Victoria Station in central London in March when a man shouted racial abuse and shoved her, injuring her shoulder. She said she reported the assault to police through an online form, providing her Oyster card number, and was contacted by officers the following day. But because of an error recording some details, the recovery of CCTV footage from the bus company was delayed. She was then told that the company only kept footage for 10 days and it had been overwritten. The case was subsequently dropped due to a lack of evidence. The Met Police said they were not able to obtain the CCTV footage because Transport for London (TfL) records showed the Oyster card had not been used at the relevant times. However TfL confirmed Ms Simpson had used her Oyster card correctly and said they had been provided with the incorrect bus route and date by police. Ms Simpson, from south-east London, said the attack had left her hesitant to go out and she had changed her bus route to work because the incident had taken place nearby. She also said the experience of reporting the crime had initially made her ""lose faith in the criminal justice system"". ""At first I was angry at putting myself through that and nothing happening,"" she told BBC News. ""And then I thought how many other people must have gone through this, and how many people might not know about the time limits."" She decided to start a petition to help others in a similar situation. ""As a victim you feel rushed and under pressure to relay the information correctly. This change would allow people the opportunity to report crimes and also have the space to deal with whatever has happened to them,"" she said. ""In my case, there was a delay because of human error, but in other cases it might take longer to recover CCTV or people might not report something straight away."" She said the response to her petition had been ""overwhelming"". ""As a victim you can feel so alone, but to know there's 140,000 people behind me saying this is something that has to change is so powerful,"" she said. A spokesman for the bus operator, Metroline, said CCTV was kept for 10 days, as required by their contract with TfL. And Tom Cunnington, head of bus business development at TfL, said the attack on Ms Simpson was ""completely unacceptable"". He said that while it was not currently possible to keep footage for 30 days, the company ensured all buses stored CCTV material. And as technology improved, they would make sure it was kept for as long as possible. The Department for Transport refers operators to guidance from the Information Commissioner's Office'scode of practice,external. It advises that the Data Protection Act does not specify a minimum or maximum time CCTV footage should be kept and only says it should not be kept for longer than necessary.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a temporary release from prison A British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran has been taken to a prison clinic after passing out, her husband has said. Richard Ratcliffe said his wife had suffered several panic attacks and low blood pressure, adding the family were ""very, very worried"". Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe had just returned to prison after being granted a three-day release over the weekend. She wasjailed for five years in 2016after being convicted of spying, which she denies. Last week Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was reunited with her family, including her four-year-old daughter Gabriella, during the temporary release. But she voluntarily returned to prison on Sunday night ""with her head held high"", after being told her application for an extension had been denied. What is Iran jail case about? Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle Iran's jailed dual nationals and their uncertain fate Mr Ratcliffe said his wife had suffered several panic attacks on Tuesday and Wednesday, speaking of headaches, a rash and numbness in her legs and right arm. ""I think it feels like the physical symptoms of crushing disappointment since she went back into prison,"" he said. Mr Ratcliffe said the head of the prison had been ""worried enough to come down and see her"", and was ""very surprised"" that she had not been allowed to extend her furlough. He added she was still in the clinic as far as he knew, despite reports that she had been taken to an external hospital. A picture of Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe saying goodbye to her daughter was posted on the Free Nazanin campaign's Twitter account on Sunday. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Ratcliffe said he had later spoken to his wife on the phone and she was ""devastated"". ""It was amongst the hardest phone calls I've had with her,"" he added. He said the past few days had been a ""whirlwind"" and he was ""very worried"" about his wife. He added he was waiting by the phone and the family had been in touch with the British Embassy. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe has experienced a number of panic attacks during her imprisonment, but her husband said they were becoming more frequent. Her psychiatrist has said she needs to see a neurologist, but this has not yet happened. Richard Ratcliffe has been campaigning for his wife's release Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, from Hampstead, north London, was detained at Tehran airport in 2016 after visiting her family on holiday. The British-Iranian mother, who works for the Thomson Reuters Foundation, has always insisted the visit was to introduce her daughter Gabriella to relatives. Following the news of her ill health on Wednesday, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said ""all our thoughts and prayers"" were with Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe and her family. He tweeted: ""Unbearable suffering to be apart from [her] daughter with her hopes raised then dashed. We must redouble efforts to find a way to get her home.""

"Elon Musk frequently replies to others' comments on Twitter Elon Musk has tweeted again about a man he had previously accused of being a child abuser. ""You don't think it's strange he hasn't sued me? He was offered free legal services,""Tesla's chief posted,external. The tweet comes more than a month after Mr Musk apologised to the British diving expert Vern Unsworth for calling him a ""pedo"". Critics suggest the latest message is further evidence of the tech leader's erratic behaviour on social media. Mr Unsworth has told the BBC that he does not want to say anything at this stage. Tesla's shares fell about 1.5% in early trade despite the Nasdaq, on which it trades, opening higher. Mr Musk has been embroiled in another Twitter-related controversy over recent weeks after tweeting that he was considering taking his car firm private, adding that he had secured the funds required. That caused major swings in the company's share price and subsequent claims that his message had been misleading. Mr Musk later said the firm would stay public. The US Securities and Exchange Commission is now reported to be investigating the matter, and some Tesla investors are suing the firm over the tweets. Mr Musk's latest tweet was written in response to a former journalist, who had accused him of hypocrisy. ""Your dedication to facts and truth would have been wonderful if applied to that time when you called someone a pedo,"" posted Drew Olanoff. In response, the tech entrepreneur not only questioned why Mr Unsworth had not taken him to court but also attacked Mr Olanoff for not carrying out his own investigation into the matter. ""So you actually did nothing and yet imply you are a truth-seeker,"" wrote Mr Musk. The US business leader had originally tweeted about Mr Unsworth in July. The two had been involved in a dispute over Mr Musk's offer of a mini-submarine to help rescue schoolchildren trapped in a flooded cave network in Thailand. Mr Unsworth declined to comment on Mr Musk's latest tweet When questioned about this, the Briton had told CNN that the submarine was ""just a PR stunt [that] had absolutely no chance of working"". Mr Musk responded with a series of tweets, casting doubt on Mr Unsworth's character without providing supportive evidence. They culminated in a post that described Mr Unsworth as a ""pedo guy"" and a follow-up saying ""bet ya a signed dollar it's true"". Mr Unsworth subsequently said he might take legal action. The clash appeared to have been resolved after Mr Musk deleted his offending tweets. ""His actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologise to Mr Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader,""Mr Musk tweeted on 18 July,external. Mr Musk has more than 22 million Twitter followers and frequently interacts with users who refer to him on the platform. Many of his messages have led to positive coverage about Tesla and his other companies in the press. But some observers have suggested Mr Musk should curtail his use of social media bearing in mind he has said he is working 120-hour weeks, is under great stress and is making use of the sedative Ambien. Mr Musk, however, has denied his use of the app was a distraction. ""I think sometimes people think I spend a lot of time in Twitter,"" he told theYouTuber Marques Brownlee earlier this month,external. ""Actually, it's like almost nothing. Most of my time is spent... going round the [Tesla] factory... and if I'm not here I'm at the Giga [battery] factory in Nevada."" Mr Musk says he spends most of his time doing work rather than using social media Mr Musk's younger brother - who is a board member of Tesla - defended his sibling's behaviour in a recent interview with the New York Times. ""The reason Elon seems to attract drama is that he is so transparent, so open, in a way that can come back to bite him,"" said Kimbal Musk. ""He doesn't know how to do it differently."" But one leadership expert suggested some of Mr Musk's behaviour was unacceptable. ""Conventional business leaders are far more careful in their behaviour - you don't find FTSE 100 chief executives shooting from the hip like this because they are advised it would be detrimental to the interests of their companies,"" Matthew Gwyther, ex-editor of Management Today, told the BBC. ""But there can be a lack of humility that comes with being involved with big tech. ""If [the latest tweet] adversely affects the share price then Tesla's board members may feel duty bound to do something about it. ""But one way or the other, it's not the way you'd expect a person with that degree of power and responsibility to behave.""

"Protests have taken place across Russia Russian leader Vladimir Putin has softened planned pension changes following angry protests and a slump in his approval rating. He said the retirement age for women would be increased from 55 to 60 instead of to 63. But a five-year increase for men, to 65, would stay. In a rare TV address, Mr Putin said the country's working-age population was shrinking, making change essential. Unions have warned that many will not live long enough to claim a pension. Russian men have a life expectancy of 66 while for women it is 77, the World Health Organization says. The issue has seen support for Mr Putin fall to 64% from 80%, according to VTsIOM state pollster. Defiant Putin embraces higher pension age for Russia '43% of Russian men won't live to retirement' World Cup fails to quell rage at Russian reforms Life in Putin's Russia explained in 10 charts Mr Putin said the move to raise the retirement age for men and women had been delayed for years and risked causing inflation and increasing poverty. Postponing it further would threaten the stability and security of Russian society, he said. ""Any further delay would be irresponsible,"" he said. ""Our decisions should be just and well-balanced,"" he added. The outcry forced Mr Putin to make a rare address to the nation Until his TV address he had attempted to distance himself from the row, and had in the past promised that the pension age would never be raised on his watch. Under the new plan, to be implemented from 2019, the retirement age for men will be increased gradually from 60 to 65. Before Mr Putin's intervention women were to have to work another eight years from 55 to 63 - their planned retirement age has now been reduced to 60. Allow Twitter content?

""Women not only work but they also take care of the house and children and grandchildren. Their retirement age should not increase by more than that of men,"" he said. These women protested in the Ivanovo region near Moscow Women with three or more children could retire earlier, he added. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has previously said the decision was motivated by the fact that Russians are living longer and leading more active lives. He said there were 12 million working pensioners in Russia, equal to nearly a quarter of all pensioners. Tens of thousands have rallied across Russia in recent weeks. ""Help the state, die before your pension,"" read one home-made placard in the Siberian city of Omsk in early July, where about 3,000 people turned out. ""The government must go,"" read another.

Unusually for Russia, protesters have been from all sides of the political debate. Communist Party red flags and nationalist banners flew side by side, and opposition supporters joined in too. The initial announcement was made at the same time as the World Cup in Russia began, prompting criticism that the Russian government was trying to bury bad news. Most economists and many Russians agree there is a problem. The population is getting older and the state is spending more and more on pensions. After the economic chaos of the early 1990s, Russia's population plummeted. The birth rate has since shown some signs of improvement, but it is not happening fast enough. Based on current trends, 20% of Russians will be over 65 by 2050, says the UN. President Putin has just signed a new bill on pension spending, envisaging a deficit of more than 265bn roubles (Â£3.1bn; $4.2bn) in 2018. That's 1.6% of the entire state budget expenditure. It is clearly not a sustainable situation, especially in tough economic times.

"This video can not be played A cordon remains in place around the charred exterior of the Bank Buildings Staff at the Primark store in Belfast city centre which was destroyed by a major fire will be paid this week but have not received certainty beyond that, a trade union has said. Much of the interior of the historic Bank Buildings on Castle Street has fallen in after Tuesday's huge blaze. The fire service said there is ""still a risk"" the building could collapse ""in all or in part"". Crews are expected to remain at the scene tonight and into Thursday. However, the operation is due to be scaled back. The Fire Service has said that there ""continue to be small pockets of fire within the building and a 45m (148ft) exclusion zone remains in place"" but added that the exterior of the building ""remains structurally intact"". Area commander Aidan Jennings said Belfast City Council and Primark's owners have installed a new structure to help support what's left of of Bank Buildings and there had been been further collapse within it. He added that on Thursday morning they'll be trying to get businesses back open and reduce the cordon. A spokesperson said: ""We are continuing to work closely with engineers from Belfast City Council to determine the structural integrity and safety of the building. ""Once this has been completed a fire investigation will commence into the cause of the fire. ""In conjunction with our partners in Belfast City Council and the PSNI we have been facilitating escorted access for business owners in the local area who are affected by the incident to enable them to access and secure their properties."" Primark said it is ""fully committed to supporting staff during this difficult time"". After a meeting between bosses and staff on Wednesday, the company said it is ""continuing to work with the relevant authorities to determine the cause of the fire"". A spokesperson for the retailer said: ""The welfare of our colleagues remains our most important concern and we are fully committed to supporting them during this difficult time. ""Our management team in Belfast are meeting their colleagues over the next few days to provide them with the necessary support and information. ""We would like to thank everyone for their amazing support during this very challenging time for all concerned."" The clock at the top of Bank Buildings was one of the features destroyed by the flames Primark store 'at risk of collapse' History of Belfast's Bank Buildings In pictures: Primark building destroyed It is believed that more than 350 people worked at the store, which was undergoing a major refurbishment and extension that was estimated to cost Â£30m. The Usdaw trade union said it had a ""very positive meeting"" with Primark's management on Wednesday and was told firm answers about workers' futures would be given next week. This video can not be played The landmark building was destroyed by the fire within a matter of hours ""All options are being explored by management to retain their staff, to retain that loyalty and their service,"" said Usdaw's Michaela Lafferty. ""We don't have long-term answers - the company has a short-term solution and that is this week nobody has lost their job and everybody will receive their pay."" This video can not be played Much of the interior of the historic Bank Buildings on Castle Street has collapsed after a fire A 45m (148ft) police cordon is in place around the building. Castle Street is closed from Queen Street to Royal Avenue. Land and Property Services (LPS) is encouraging businesses who have been impacted by the fire to contact them to discuss support available for rates. A spokesperson said: ""During this period, LPS is willing to discuss extended payment arrangements with affected businesses. Ratepayers may also be eligible for the hardship relief scheme."" A trade union representing workers has said that Primark will pay employees their wages this week before reviewing matters next week. It remains unclear what the long-term future holds for staff and whether it will be possible for them all to be redeployed. Guidelines from the Labour Relations Agency (LRA) state that ""an employee who has been put onto a period of lay-off or short-time working for four consecutive weeks or six weeks in a 13-week period may be eligible for a redundancy payment"". Citing legislation from 1996, the LRA notes employees ""must be paid a guarantee payment"" if laid off because of ""a shortage of work of the kind they are employed to do, or any other occurrence affecting the normal working of the business e.g. floods, power failures"". ""The payment is limited to a maximum of five days in any period of three months,"" it adds. To qualify for payment, the worker must not ""refuse suitable alternative employment"" and have at least one month's continuous service. The fire spread rapidly through the buildings during Tuesday afternoon The fire started near the top of the listed five-storey buildingat about 11:00 BST on Tuesday. Firefighters battled the flames throughout the day and overnight into Wednesday after the roof and floors collapsed. No-one was injured in the blaze and it is not yet clear how it started. Staff acted quickly to get evacuate the store when the fire broke out, said Aidan Jennings Structural engineers have been inspecting the building amid fears it could collapse. They are expected to make a decision on whether its famous sandstone facade can be preserved. Mr Jennings added: ""We've had significant collapse within that front part of the structure - steelwork and floors have come down - but at this stage the building still remains standing. ""There is a significant amount of twisted steelwork and collapsed floors so the building does still remain at risk."" Firefighters are still working at the site and could be there for several days The extension to the rear of the building, which was nearing completion, has been saved. Primark's staff deserved praise for getting people out of the store soon after the fire started, added Mr Jennings. ""They quickly evacuated the building - they allowed our crews to focus on the fire and were able to quickly confirm that everyone had left the building."" Belfast City Council held an emergency meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss how it could help staff and other businesses affected by the fire. Allow Twitter content?

Shops and offices that fall within the cordon remain closed. Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey said the city needed to ""rally round those who need support now"". ""Not only has this impacted on the Primark employees and the business itself but it will have a knock-on effect for neighbouring businesses and city centre retailers,"" she said. She added that the council was willing to help Primark ""in any way we can should they wish to seek alternative accommodation"" in the city centre. The Belfast Chamber of Trade said the set-up of a business recovery group would ""provide information, support and assistance to traders and affected by the Primark fire"". President Rajesh Rana added: ""Belfast Chamber is working to collate a list of alternative vacant premises in the city that traders can relocate to on a temporary basis."" Parts of the roof collapsed after the fire started near the top of the building Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said: ""The key message following this meeting is that despite this tragedy, Belfast city centre is still open for business and that it will bounce back from this."" At the scene on Wednesday: BBC News NI's Karen Patterson Belfast woke up to an image as dramatic as those broadcast across the world last night of one of Belfast's most iconic buildings. It is a very sorry sight - Bank Buildings is a shell and all of the floors have collapsed. As I stand at a cordon that stretches around the building there are real concerns about trading opportunities for businesses around the Castle Junction. All buses operating in and out of the city centre on Wednesday are subject to delays and diversions. Some staff have spoken of their shock and concern about their futures. Mary Flynn, from Glengormley in County Antrim, has worked for Primark since it opened in Belfast city centre in 1975 at Queen's Arcade before moving to Bank Buildings. Shops and other buildings that sit within the cordon around the building have been closed She was ""devastated"" to learn about the fire through a phone call from her niece. ""When I heard I was so sad, so upset... but we're just so glad that all the staff and customers got out safely,"" she told BBC News NI. She described her workplace as ""a fabulous store with fabulous people - it was like my second home"". Some workers were left without their house keys after they had to leave their belongings in the building as the fire spread. The original Bank Buildings was erected by Waddell Cunninghamin 1785. It was intended it as a bridge to the 20th Century, with a compromise between the classical style of the upper part of the building and the great expanse of plate glass below. Three bombs exploded in the Bank Buildings in 1975 - a huge fire broke out shortly afterwards and damaged parts of the building. In 1979, the Bank Buildings was taken over by the Dublin-based group Primark and the store was totally refurbished and the exterior restored to its 1903 glory. A trade union representing workers has said that Primark will pay employees their wages this week before reviewing matters next week. It remains unclear what the long-term future holds for staff and whether it will be possible for them all to be re-deployed.

"Lewis Pugh finally arrived in Dover on Wednesday lunchtime after swimming for 49 days Endurance swimmer Lewis Pugh has completed his challenge toswim the length of the English Channel,externalin support of cleaning up the oceans. The 48-year-old finished the 560km (348 mile) gruelling swim from Land's End in Cornwall to Dover in Kent in 49 days. He was greeted at Shakespeare Beach by Environment Secretary Michael Gove. The environmental campaigner and UN Patron of the Oceans began the challenge on 12 July, swimming 10 to 20km (six to 12 miles) every day. Mr Pugh, from Plymouth, Devon, said he felt ""relieved and exhilarated"". ""It's been very, very long, we've been going for 49 days and I'm exhausted, physically exhausted, mentally exhausted, so delighted to be here."" He is estimated to have made 500,000 to 750,000 strokes along the journey. Mr Pugh completed the challenge despite being told he had tendonitis just 10 days before the end and being advised to rest by his physiotherapist. He said he was looking forward to ""a really good sleep"" after only getting three to four hours each day on the support boat. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Gove described him as a ""modern day hero"" and a ""brilliant champion for marine conservation zones"". Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Mr Pugh described the challenge - the equivalent of swimming 16 English Channels back to back - as the ""Everest of swims"", and said it had been one of two halves. ""The first half from Land's End all the way to the Isle of Wight was wonderful. Warm seas, flat seas. Mr Pugh described the challenge as the ""Everest of swims"" ""The second half we've had storm after storm after storm,"" he said. His campaign, called The Long Swim, aims to raise awareness of the threat to the UK's coastal waters from climate change, over-fishing and plastic pollution. Dodging the jellyfish added extra pressure on Mr Pugh ""What has really shocked me is just what I haven't seen - so I've seen a few fish,"" he said. ""I've seen a few dolphins, a few birds, lots of jellyfish, but virtually nothing else - the oceans around the United Kingdom are so badly over-fished. ""We have this one opportunity now to protect the waters around the UK. ""If we don't do that there simply won't be any fish left for our generation.

"Facebook hopes Watch will encourage users to spend longer within its app Facebook's Watch video-streaming service is rolling out worldwide, just over a year after its US launch. Users will be able to choose from a range of shows - from both established brands and new players - and have the ability to view clips saved from their News Feeds. The firm plans to allow all content creators to feature advertising breaks, so long as they hit certain metrics. Until now, only select publishers had been given the opportunity. To begin with, only videos shown to audiences in the UK, US, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand will have this facility. The revenue split will be 55% to the creators and 45% to Facebook. Next month the service will premiere one of its biggest budget dramas: Sorry For Your Loss Facebook had intended to reveal the roll-out on Wednesday, but brought forward the announcement after details leaked. As a consequence, some users may not be able to access its pages yet. Watch is often portrayed as a rival to Google's YouTube, but it also competes for attention against traditional TV channels as well as online outlets including Netflix, Amazon Video, BBC iPlayer and Facebook's own Instagram TV. A study published last week suggests that it only had niche appeal in its first year in the US. Of 1,632 adult Facebook users questioned, 50% had never heard of Watch, while 24% said they were aware of the on-demand service but had never used it,according to the Diffusion Group.,external Only 14% told the market research firm that they used it at least once a week. Another report noted that although some Watch shows had attracted audiences numbering in their millions, they often struggled to retain them. ""This seems to be a pattern with most Facebook Watch shows: lots of people sample, few return,""wrote Verne Gay for Newsday.,external Even so, some big name stars have been involved in original programming made for the platform. Red Table Talk has been one of Watch's most popular shows in the US They include: Jada Pinkett Smith, who headlines the talk show Red Table Talk Elizabeth Olsen, who stars in the forthcoming drama Sorry For Your Loss about a woman grieving for her husband Bear Grylls, the British adventurer, who hosts a reality show Face the Wild ABC, Fox News, Vice and Buzzfeed are among others who have made content for the service. Facebook claims that its advantage against other platforms is the ways Watch helps viewers interact with others. ""It is built on the notion that watching video doesn't have to be a passive experience,"" explained Fidji Simo, Facebook's vice-president of video. ""You can have a two-way conversation about the content with friends, other fans or even the creators themselves."" She added that a Watch Party feature lets users co-ordinate themselves to watch a show together, while an Interactivity Platform allows creators to run polls, challenges and quizzes to boost engagement. India-based Watch viewers will be able to see La Liga football matches from Spain Facebook says the most common feedback it had from creators over the past year was a call for it to allow more of them to include ad breaks. To qualify publishers must: have created videos lasting longer than three minutes have attracted more than 30,000 viewers who stayed for more than one minute when watching the content over the past two months have more than 10,000 followers be located in one of the countries where the ad break facility is available One industry watcher predicted the terms would appeal to established independent video-makers,some of whom have been concernedat the way Google's YouTube has run its own advertising programme. This video can not be played WATCH: YouTube faced criticism for an ad crackdown in 2017 ""For a very long time YouTube had the monopoly on online video when it came to offering creators a way to make money from adverts,"" commented Alex Brinnand, editor of TenEighty magazine. ""And for a while now, many creators have been looking for other potential revenue streams - some have started using [Amazon's] Twitch for example. ""So, this will be welcomed as it provides further options."" Facebook said that a second wave of countries - including France, Germany, Norway, Mexico and Thailand would receive ad breaks in September. The BBC is not providing original content to Facebook Watch, but has not ruled out doing so in the future. ""We've got a strong track record collaborating and experimenting with social media platforms to engage with BBC audiences,"" said a spokesman. ""We continue to watch the market closely and explore options for the future.""

"It's another demonstration of the power of Big Data - of mining a huge batch of statistics to see patterns of behaviour that were simply not apparent before. Computers have crunched 22 billion identification messages transmitted by sea-going vessels to map fishing activity around the globe. The analysis reveals that more than 55% of the world's oceans are subject to industrial exploitation. By area, fishing's footprint is now over four times that of agriculture. That's an astonishing observation given that fisheries provide only 1.2% of global caloric production for human food consumption. The investigation shows clearly that the biggest influences on this activity are not environmental - whether it is summer or winter, or whether there is an El NiÃ±o or fish are migrating, for example. Rather, the major controlling factors are very largely political and cultural. ""You'd think that fishing activity would follow some natural pulse of the seasons, but in fact that's secondary to whether it's a weekend or not, or whether there's a moratorium, or a public holiday,"" says David Kroodsma from Global Fishing Watch, which led the studypublished in Science Magazine,external. ""Because fishing is an industrial activity tied to politics and culture, this is actually a positive message because it shows we have a lot of human agency in the way we fish the oceans, and it's entirely within our power to change things,"" he told BBC News. 'Fishing continued' at China oil spill site Satellite system targets 'dark fish' Will Big Data lead to Big Brother? Kroodsma and colleagues have been playing with the data coming from the transponders that all large vessels are now mandated to carry. This Automatic Identification System (AIS) means each boat will push out information every few seconds about its position, course, and speed. These messages can be detected from space by satellites, and recent years have seen increasing numbers of spacecraft launched just to track what's happening on the high seas. Kroodsma's team looked at the data from 2012 to 2016. It encompasses the messages from over 70,000 vessels. That's far too many boats and too much data for individuals to comb through. So, the team has trained algorithms to do the work instead - to recognise in the movement of the vessels behaviours such as whether they actually have gear in the water and what sort of gear that might be. Nets or longlines, for example. The team is able to produce ""heat maps"" to illustrate where fishing activity is most intense - such as in the northeast Atlantic and northwest Pacific, as well as in nutrient-rich regions off South America and West Africa. Remarkably, it is the fleets from just five countries (China, Spain, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea) that account for more than 85% of observed fishing effort on the high seas, ie away from their exclusive economic zones. The team says that over the course of the study period, the analysis recorded over 37 million hours of fishing. In that time, vessels consumed 20 billion kilowatt hours of energy and travelled a total of more than 460 million kilometres. That's 600 times the distance to the Moon and back. Longline fishing in the open ocean, for species such as tuna, shark and billfish, was the most widespread activity globally, detected in 45% of the ocean. ""What's most exciting is what comes next,"" says David Kroodsma. ""We can now ask questions that we have the data to answer. Where are different species at risk because of bycatch? Because you can now see the overlap between species' ranges and fishing effort. ""Or, how do subsidies affect fishing? Or, do fishermen respond more to [fuel] prices than to some type of regulation? ""Or, what parts of the ocean need more protection? We can now have much more informed discussion."" What the team has produced is not a complete picture simply because AIS is not on every boat. The smallest vessels do not have to carry it, and of course for those that do - but wish to hide their illegal activity - they can switch it off. But the analysis captures the majority of activity, and on the high seas, where only the largest vessels operate, it is probably missing very little. Commenting on the study, Elvira Poloczanska, from the Alfred Wegener Institute in Bremerhaven, Germany, said AIS had become a powerful new tool. ""Emerging applications of AIS data include fleet and cargo tracking, national fishing fleet monitoring, and maritime security,""she told Science Magazine,external. ""For example, AIS data is yielding information on maritime trade routes and shipping corridors and on trade flows for decision-making, enabling assessments of the contribution of ship exhaust emissions to air pollution, and allowing reduced fishing activity in the exclusive economic zones of many island states - information relevant to conservation planning."" Global Fishing Watch has all the data from the study available for download. It can also be accessed through the Google Earth Engine.

"Additional exam result details are available to students because of GDPR Students in the UK have the right to obtain key information about their exam results for free,says the Information Commissioner's Office.,external Exam boards must provide marks, examiner comments and appeals panel minutes for tests including GCSEs, A-levels, Highers and university exams. The new rules cover this summer's tests and come from the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation. The move could cause ""problems for the exam bodies"", one expert told the BBC. While students can request more information from their exam boards, certain types of information will not be available freely under the rules. An ICO spokesperson told the BBC ""The General Data Protection Regulation gives you the right to see information held about you. This means you can request information about you and your exam performance."" ""It does not give you the right to copies of your answers to exam questions or for your paper to be re-marked."" The exam board AQA charges Â£11.30 per paper for those wanting to look at their exam papers, while OCR charges Â£11.35 to access scripts, according to their company websites. This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? Students do not have the right to make an appeal under the new data rules either, though they can do so following the procedures of their particular exam boards. For the information that can be requested under GDPR, students can expect a response within a month, so long as exam results have been published. If results have not yet been published, students could have to wait up to five months from the date of the request. GCSE results rise despite tougher exams A-level results 2018: Teenagers achieve rise in top grades Scottish exam results 2018: Higher pass rate 'stable' Test your knowledge of GDPR One security specialist told the BBC that the potential deluge of requests could cause problems for exam boards. ""This is an excellent way to make young adults more aware of what data is and how it is stored,"" commented Jake Moore of data security company Eset. ""However, if all students jumped on this prospective bandwagon, it may just cause extra problems for the exam bodies at a time when they are heavily preparing for the back to school season,"" he added.

"Mr Trump was appealing to conservative Christian groups for help US President Donald Trump has warned that his policies will be ""violently"" overturned if the Democrats win November's mid-term elections. He told Evangelical leaders that the vote was a ""referendum"" on freedom of speech and religion, and that these were threatened by ""violent people"". He appealed to conservative Christian groups for help, saying they were one vote away from ""losing everything"". Mid-term elections are widely seen as a test of the president's popularity. Mr Trump has been battling negative publicity after his ex-lawyer and former campaign chief were convicted earlier this month. Can we tell now if Democrats will win US election? Why US mid-term elections matter Will Trump remain bulletproof? An audio recording of Mr Trump's closed-door meeting with Evangelical leaders at the White House was leaked to US media. During the meeting, Mr Trump said the mid-term elections were not just a referendum on him but also ""on your religion, it's a referendum on free speech and the First Amendment [guaranteeing basic freedoms]"". ""It's not a question of like or dislike, it's a question that they will overturn everything that we've done and they will do it quickly and violently. And violently. There is violence. When you look at Antifa - these are violent people,"" he said. Antifa - short for anti-fascist - refers to groups of far-left protesters who fight far-right ideology and regularly clash with far-right demonstrators. The US president has previously criticised left-wing groups, infamously saying that there had been violence on ""many sides"" after a white nationalist killed a left-wing demonstrator at a white nationalist protest in Charlottesville last year. 'A battle for the soul of America' Antifa: Left-wing militants on the rise Urging the Evangelical leaders to use their influence to swing voters, Mr Trump told them they had ""tremendous power"". ""In this room, you have people who preach to almost 200 million people. Depending on which Sunday we're talking about,"" he said. ""Little thing: Merry Christmas, right? You couldn't say 'Merry Christmas',"" he added, according to US media reports. Two of those who heard Mr Trump speak downplayed the remarks, according to a series of tweets,externalby Sarah McCammon, a reporter from National Public Radio (NPR). ""Nobody walked out of there thinking that the Democrats were going to shoot us all,"" she quoted Jerry Falwell Jr as saying. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"This video can not be played Katie Houghton says she self-harmed as a teenager to ""try and take control of feeling out of control"" More than a fifth of 14-year-old girls in the UK said they had self-harmed, a report suggests. A survey of 11,000 children found 22% of the girls and 9% of the boys said they had hurt themselves on purpose in the year prior to the questionnaire. Rates of self-harm were worst (46%) among those who were attracted to people of the same or both genders. The Children's Society report said,externalgender stereotypes and worries about looks were contributing to unhappiness. Willow Smith reveals she used to self-harm Self-harm rising among teenage girls Girls self-harm hospital figures double The self-harm statistics are included in the charity's annual Good Childhood Report, which examines the state of children's wellbeing in the UK. The data on self-harm was analysed by The Children's Society after being collected in 2015 in theMillennium Cohort Study,external, a continuing research project following the lives of 19,000 children born in the UK between 2000 and 2001. More than 11,000 of these children answered a questionnaire about whether they had hurt themselves on purpose in any way in the past year. Out of the 5,624 girls who responded, 1,237 said they had self-harmed. Self-harm is when people hurt themselves as a way of dealing with difficult feelings, painful memories or overwhelming situations and experiences. It can include everything from punching or hitting to cutting or burning. This video can not be played Beth: 'I started self-harming when I was 13' Based on the figures, The Children's Society estimates that 109,000 children aged 14 may have self-harmed across the UK during the 12-month period in 2015 - 76,000 girls and 33,000 boys. It follows NHS data released this month that showed the number of admissions to hospital of girls aged 18 and under for self-harm had almost doubled in two decades, from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 in 2017. The NSPCC says,externalcommon reasons for self-harming include: depression bullying pressure at school emotional abuse grieving having relationship problems with family or friends Matthew Reed, chief executive at The Children's Society, said: ""It is deeply worrying that so many children are unhappy to the extent that they are self-harming. ""Worries about how they look are a big issue, especially for girls, but this report shows other factors such as how they feel about their sexuality and gender stereotypes may be linked to their unhappiness."" An 18-year-old woman who used to self-harm said she had started aged 12 in an attempt to deal with painful or overwhelming feelings. She said: ""It quickly became an obsession. ""My self-harm problem caused me to lie to those who cared about me, time and time again, as I pushed away the people around me."" Self-harm was often ""romanticised"" on social media, which drew in the most vulnerable people, she said. But professional support had helped her to stop and develop healthy ways of coping with her problems. ""Recovery has changed my life. I am a person I never thought I could be with a bright future ahead of me - yet I know others who haven't received the help I did and are still battling. ""To those struggling, please talk to people you can trust - you can and will get through this."" A separate survey of 10- to 17-year-olds and their parents across 2,000 households, also included in The Children's Society report, found the children were unhappiest with school and their appearance. This research also suggests that boys and girls are often harmed by gender stereotypes. Those who felt boys should be tough and girls should have nice clothes were least happy with life. The report also suggests happy family relationships are the biggest positive influence on children's wellbeing. The Children's Society called on the government to make it a requirement for all secondary schools to offer access to a counsellor and have their mental health services assessed in Ofsted inspections. The Department of Health said it is investing an extra Â£300m to provide more mental health help in schools - including trained staff. A spokesperson said: ""We've extended our pilot scheme to deliver training in 20 more areas of the country this year to improve links between 1,200 schools and their mental health services."" The government added it will announce more on how it can improve mental health as part of its long-term plan for the NHS later this year. Emma Thomas, chief executive of Young Minds, said: ""Difficult experiences in childhood, like growing up in poverty or experiencing discrimination, can have a huge impact on mental health - but there are also new pressures that have emerged in recent years. ""The education system now places a greater emphasis than ever on exam results, while the rise of social media can make problems like bullying or body image issues more intense than they were in the past."" The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said mental health was ""one of the biggest health epidemics of our time"" and strongly linked to social disadvantage. A spokesman added: ""This country's mental health crisis is not going to go away overnight but with appropriate action from government there is hope that fewer children will have mental health worries and be happier with their life as a result.""

"There are more than 12 million households where all adults are working The proportion of households in the UK where no-one is working is at its lowest point for over 20 years, the Office for National Statistics says. The figures show 14.3% of households containing working-age adults are ""workless"" - down 0.2% compared with the same point last year. Fewer children were living in families where no-one was currently working. But more children were living in households where no-one had ever worked - up by 32,000 to 204,000. The employment figures show a picture of rising levels of work in the 21 million households with people aged between 16 and 64. There are fewer workless families now than at any point in a data series going back to 1996. In the late 1990s, about 20% of households had no adults working, but that has fallen to about 14%, representing about three million households. Almost 93% of fathers with dependent children are working In about 12 million households, all the adults had jobs - with 7.5 million children living in homes where everyone was working. The proportion of children living in workless households is down to about 10%, about half the levels of the late 1990s. The numbers of lone parents in work have remained broadly constant for the past decade, says the ONS, with a slight rise reported in these latest figures. The figures show that parents with dependent children are more likely to be in work than adults without dependent children. Almost 93% of men and over 74% of women with dependent children are working - including both full-time and part-time jobs. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said: ""One of the best ways to tackle poverty and give children a better chance in life is to have a working adult in the house. ""It gives them a role model to learn from and brings financial security to the home. ""Getting a job means more than just a wage, it's a way out of poverty and welfare dependency,"" she said. But poverty campaigners have highlighted the importance of the quality as well as quantity of jobs - saying the changing labour market can mean families can be stuck in low-paid or insecure jobs. They have warned that most children living in poverty are now in families where at least one parent is working.

"This video can not be played A cordon remains in place around the charred exterior of the Bank Buildings Staff at the Primark store in Belfast city centre which was destroyed by a major fire will be paid this week but have not received certainty beyond that, a trade union has said. Much of the interior of the historic Bank Buildings on Castle Street has fallen in after Tuesday's huge blaze. The fire service said there is ""still a risk"" the building could collapse ""in all or in part"". Crews are expected to remain at the scene tonight and into Thursday. However, the operation is due to be scaled back. The Fire Service has said that there ""continue to be small pockets of fire within the building and a 45m (148ft) exclusion zone remains in place"" but added that the exterior of the building ""remains structurally intact"". Area commander Aidan Jennings said Belfast City Council and Primark's owners have installed a new structure to help support what's left of of Bank Buildings and there had been been further collapse within it. He added that on Thursday morning they'll be trying to get businesses back open and reduce the cordon. A spokesperson said: ""We are continuing to work closely with engineers from Belfast City Council to determine the structural integrity and safety of the building. ""Once this has been completed a fire investigation will commence into the cause of the fire. ""In conjunction with our partners in Belfast City Council and the PSNI we have been facilitating escorted access for business owners in the local area who are affected by the incident to enable them to access and secure their properties."" Primark said it is ""fully committed to supporting staff during this difficult time"". After a meeting between bosses and staff on Wednesday, the company said it is ""continuing to work with the relevant authorities to determine the cause of the fire"". A spokesperson for the retailer said: ""The welfare of our colleagues remains our most important concern and we are fully committed to supporting them during this difficult time. ""Our management team in Belfast are meeting their colleagues over the next few days to provide them with the necessary support and information. ""We would like to thank everyone for their amazing support during this very challenging time for all concerned."" The clock at the top of Bank Buildings was one of the features destroyed by the flames Primark store 'at risk of collapse' History of Belfast's Bank Buildings In pictures: Primark building destroyed It is believed that more than 350 people worked at the store, which was undergoing a major refurbishment and extension that was estimated to cost Â£30m. The Usdaw trade union said it had a ""very positive meeting"" with Primark's management on Wednesday and was told firm answers about workers' futures would be given next week. This video can not be played The landmark building was destroyed by the fire within a matter of hours ""All options are being explored by management to retain their staff, to retain that loyalty and their service,"" said Usdaw's Michaela Lafferty. ""We don't have long-term answers - the company has a short-term solution and that is this week nobody has lost their job and everybody will receive their pay."" This video can not be played Much of the interior of the historic Bank Buildings on Castle Street has collapsed after a fire A 45m (148ft) police cordon is in place around the building. Castle Street is closed from Queen Street to Royal Avenue. Land and Property Services (LPS) is encouraging businesses who have been impacted by the fire to contact them to discuss support available for rates. A spokesperson said: ""During this period, LPS is willing to discuss extended payment arrangements with affected businesses. Ratepayers may also be eligible for the hardship relief scheme."" A trade union representing workers has said that Primark will pay employees their wages this week before reviewing matters next week. It remains unclear what the long-term future holds for staff and whether it will be possible for them all to be redeployed. Guidelines from the Labour Relations Agency (LRA) state that ""an employee who has been put onto a period of lay-off or short-time working for four consecutive weeks or six weeks in a 13-week period may be eligible for a redundancy payment"". Citing legislation from 1996, the LRA notes employees ""must be paid a guarantee payment"" if laid off because of ""a shortage of work of the kind they are employed to do, or any other occurrence affecting the normal working of the business e.g. floods, power failures"". ""The payment is limited to a maximum of five days in any period of three months,"" it adds. To qualify for payment, the worker must not ""refuse suitable alternative employment"" and have at least one month's continuous service. The fire spread rapidly through the buildings during Tuesday afternoon The fire started near the top of the listed five-storey buildingat about 11:00 BST on Tuesday. Firefighters battled the flames throughout the day and overnight into Wednesday after the roof and floors collapsed. No-one was injured in the blaze and it is not yet clear how it started. Staff acted quickly to get evacuate the store when the fire broke out, said Aidan Jennings Structural engineers have been inspecting the building amid fears it could collapse. They are expected to make a decision on whether its famous sandstone facade can be preserved. Mr Jennings added: ""We've had significant collapse within that front part of the structure - steelwork and floors have come down - but at this stage the building still remains standing. ""There is a significant amount of twisted steelwork and collapsed floors so the building does still remain at risk."" Firefighters are still working at the site and could be there for several days The extension to the rear of the building, which was nearing completion, has been saved. Primark's staff deserved praise for getting people out of the store soon after the fire started, added Mr Jennings. ""They quickly evacuated the building - they allowed our crews to focus on the fire and were able to quickly confirm that everyone had left the building."" Belfast City Council held an emergency meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss how it could help staff and other businesses affected by the fire. Allow Twitter content?

Shops and offices that fall within the cordon remain closed. Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey said the city needed to ""rally round those who need support now"". ""Not only has this impacted on the Primark employees and the business itself but it will have a knock-on effect for neighbouring businesses and city centre retailers,"" she said. She added that the council was willing to help Primark ""in any way we can should they wish to seek alternative accommodation"" in the city centre. The Belfast Chamber of Trade said the set-up of a business recovery group would ""provide information, support and assistance to traders and affected by the Primark fire"". President Rajesh Rana added: ""Belfast Chamber is working to collate a list of alternative vacant premises in the city that traders can relocate to on a temporary basis."" Parts of the roof collapsed after the fire started near the top of the building Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said: ""The key message following this meeting is that despite this tragedy, Belfast city centre is still open for business and that it will bounce back from this."" At the scene on Wednesday: BBC News NI's Karen Patterson Belfast woke up to an image as dramatic as those broadcast across the world last night of one of Belfast's most iconic buildings. It is a very sorry sight - Bank Buildings is a shell and all of the floors have collapsed. As I stand at a cordon that stretches around the building there are real concerns about trading opportunities for businesses around the Castle Junction. All buses operating in and out of the city centre on Wednesday are subject to delays and diversions. Some staff have spoken of their shock and concern about their futures. Mary Flynn, from Glengormley in County Antrim, has worked for Primark since it opened in Belfast city centre in 1975 at Queen's Arcade before moving to Bank Buildings. Shops and other buildings that sit within the cordon around the building have been closed She was ""devastated"" to learn about the fire through a phone call from her niece. ""When I heard I was so sad, so upset... but we're just so glad that all the staff and customers got out safely,"" she told BBC News NI. She described her workplace as ""a fabulous store with fabulous people - it was like my second home"". Some workers were left without their house keys after they had to leave their belongings in the building as the fire spread. The original Bank Buildings was erected by Waddell Cunninghamin 1785. It was intended it as a bridge to the 20th Century, with a compromise between the classical style of the upper part of the building and the great expanse of plate glass below. Three bombs exploded in the Bank Buildings in 1975 - a huge fire broke out shortly afterwards and damaged parts of the building. In 1979, the Bank Buildings was taken over by the Dublin-based group Primark and the store was totally refurbished and the exterior restored to its 1903 glory. A trade union representing workers has said that Primark will pay employees their wages this week before reviewing matters next week. It remains unclear what the long-term future holds for staff and whether it will be possible for them all to be re-deployed.

"This video can not be played French and British fishing fleets have come to blows over when and where they can catch scallops The UK government has said it is talking to French authorities to ensure there will be ""no repeat"" of clashes between fishermen over scallops off France's north coast. On Monday, nearly 40 French boats confronted British rivals they say are depleting scallop stocks in the area. The UK's environment secretary says the British boats were fishing legally. France says it is ready to send more police vessels to the area to prevent further clashes. Boats collided and stones were thrown during the confrontation off the coast of Normandy in the early hours of Tuesday. Local official Ingrid Parrot said the situation had been ""extremely tense"" and both sides had thrown objects at each other. She defended sending just one boat to police the incident overnight, saying: ""The aim was to stop the tensions from increasing. We sent only one ship that day, but we will send more if it's necessary."" Reality Check: What are the rules on scallops? Could Brexit calm troubled waters? Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Producers Association, said the incident was ""high seas piracy"" but said the French had agreed to a request for talks. ""We need to decrease tensions in the whole area,"" he told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. The European Commission urged France and Britain to find an ""amicable"" solution. This video can not be played Scallop row: What's the EU's fishing feud about? The French boats gathered overnight on Monday in protest against so-called ""pillaging"" by five larger British vessels. The British were chased away with two boats, Golden Promise and Joanna C, returning to Brixham harbour with damaged windows. The crews alleged they had been surrounded and had rocks and metal shackles thrown at them, but French police said UK boats responded in kind. A video published by French media shows a Scottish scallop dredger, the Honeybourne 3, colliding with French vessels. Tension has rumbled for 15 years, but in the past five a deal has prevailed - larger British boats stayed out of the area in exchange for more fishing rights. British boats can gather scallops year-round, but French law restricts the scallop fishing season to between 1 October and 15 May. Marc Delahaye from the Normandy fishing committee said they also objected to the British using ""great dredgers"" in the area, while the French used smaller boats. The Honeybourne III, a Scottish scallop dredger, docked in West Sussex after the clash The UK scallop industry is worth Â£120m and supports 1,350 jobs. About 60% of the catch is exported - with much of it being bought by the French. But a 2016 report by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) warned that the fishing effort by France, the UK, Belgium and Ireland in the Bay of Seine was ""too high"". International environmental group ClientEarth said it was ""disappointing"" to see boats catching scallops during the spawning season, when it said depleted stocks could reproduce and grow. France was demonstrating ""high environmental standards"" by banning its fleet from fishing during the summer, the group said. Analysis: James Landale, Diplomatic Correspondent Inevitably Brexit looms large. Some French fishermen hope that when the UK leaves the Common Fisheries Policy, British trawlers will not be allowed into these waters. But it may not be as simple as that. It is still not clear what agreement an independent UK may make with the EU on fishing quotas. And the French desire to negotiate some continuing access to British waters may be more important than protecting their scallops off Normandy. So Brexit may change the rules of the game but it is unlikely to bring an end disputes to like this. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the government was talking to French authorities to ensure there was ""no repeat"" of the clashes. He told the BBC his heart went out to the British fishermen involved, who had ""absolutely every right to be fishing in those waters"". The French had a ""legal responsibility"" to ensure their territorial waters were ""appropriately policed"" to allow legal fishing to continue, he added. Prime Minister Theresa May called for an ""amicable solution"" to the row. ""It's what we want and it's what France wants and we will be working on that,"" she said. Mr Park rejected suggestions that British boats were overfishing the area. They catch just 6% of the scallops in the area, he said, so ""if there's any accusation of over fishing it's not on the UK fishermen, it's on the French fishermen."" ""Scallops are plentiful and they're expensive,"" he said. ""We're doing nothing wrong and what we can't do is be bullied."" Sheryll Murray, MP for South East Cornwall, said environment secretary Michael Gove has assured her ""appropriate measures"" are in place to enable UK fishermen to keep working. But she questioned whether French authorities were ""turning a blind eye"" while their fishermen ""took the law into their own hands"". Local French officials said they could not intervene directly because the conflict took place in international waters. By BBC Monitoring French media have framed the scallop showdown as a ""battle"" between two nations, with some outlets highlighting the future impact of Brexit. Under the headline ""The battle for Saint-Jacques scallops off Normandy"", left-wing daily Le Monde cited fishing chief Dimitri Rogoff who said that the UK would normally ""be considered a third country and will not have access to these [fishing] zones"" after it leaves the European Union. French fishermen are nevertheless worried by Brexit ""as Britain plans to pursue its own fishing policy starting from the end of March 2019, particularly regarding access to its territorial waters of boats from EU countries"" noted weekly magazine L'Usine Nouvelle. Popular regional newspaper Ouest-France said that sailors from Normandy ""insist that they respect the [fish] resources"" and had gone to sea ""to explain this to the English"". ""We have won a battle, but we haven't won the war,"" concluded one French fisherman in a report by public TV channel France 3.

"There has been a steep rise in reports of self-harm among girls aged 13 to 16, according to a study of data from GP practices across the UK. The BMJ study,external, which looked at figures from 2011-2014, said GPs could be getting better at picking up self-harm. But it was likely that rising stress and psychological problems in young people were also behind the trend. The NSPCC said giving children support early could be a matter of life or death. Since 2001, girls have had much higher rates of self-harm than boys - 37.4 per 10,000 compared with 12.3 in boys. While self-harm rates stayed constant among 10- to 12-year-olds and 17- to 19-year-olds, there was a 68% increase among 13- to 16-year-olds over the three-year period studied. This took the rate in girls from 45.9 per 10,000 in 2011 to 77 per 10,000 in 2014. The researchers, from the University of Manchester, looked at data for nearly 17,000 patients from more than 600 GP practices. Sophie Martin self-harmed as a teenager Sophie Martin began self-harming when she was 12 years old after being bullied at school. When her dad took her mum to court in a custody battle, she blamed herself. ""I thought it was my fault, I had to be punished for it. And that's when I started self-harming,"" she told BBC News. She said: ""It was a release, it was painful, but it made me feel better."" Things went from bad to worse for Sophie when she confided in her best friend about how she felt. ""She told her boyfriend at the time and then he posted it all over Facebook. That made the bullying worse,"" she said. After her mum found out what was happening, she went to see a GP but it was about a year before she could access mental health services. By that time she had moved schools and also felt like she was leaving her past behind. But a couple of years later, when a relationship broke down, she began self-harming again. The self-harm charityHarmless,externaltook her on and gave her one-to-one sessions with a psychologist. ""Talking to someone really helped.  You don't want to say to your mum 'I hate myself, I hate my body, I hate how I look',"" Sophie says. Two years on, things are looking up. She is now in her last year of a certificate in beauty therapy. ""I'm great now. My anxiety has really dropped. I still have the fear that I will relapse, sort of. ""That's why I like to keep Harmless there so I could message them straight away and say I need to see someone."" Nav Kapur, study author and professor of psychiatry and population health at the University of Manchester, said parents and young people should not be unduly alarmed by the findings. ""We know that for many young people things get better and they no longer hurt themselves as adults. ""But of course we must take self-harm seriously; it's important to understand its underlying causes."" The study also found that young people living in the most deprived areas were the least likely to be referred to specialist mental health services. Self-harm is seen as the biggest risk factor for subsequent suicide, which is now the second most common cause of death in the under-25s worldwide. The NSPCC charity said the figures were ""heart-breaking"". It held more than 15,000 counselling sessions about self-harm last year. ""Self-harm can often be an expression of a deeper problem, which is why early intervention services to support these children are vital. ""Without this, the consequences really can be a matter of life or death."" Tom Madders, director of campaigns at YoungMinds, said school stress, body-image issues, the pressure created by social media and difficult experiences in childhood could all have an impact on the mental health of teenage girls. He said: ""As a society, we also need to do more to prevent mental health problems from developing in the first place. ""To start with, we need to rebalance the education system, so that schools can prioritise wellbeing and not just academic performance.""

"Kay says there's still a lot of stigma around seeking help for self-harm Kay Ska self-harmed for two years and one of the reasons was because she didn't know how to deal with her feelings ""in a healthy way"". ""I think it was just a lot of confusion, hormones and a lot of image issues,"" she told Newsbeat. The 23-year-old is speaking out after figures from the NHS show the number of girls admitted to hospital for self-harm has almost doubled in two decades. The NSPCC says the statistics are  ""sadly unsurprising"". Kay, from Lancashire, has struggled with mental health issues, such as depression, eating disorders, self-harm and PTSD. She runs a blog where people share their mental health stories. ""I really didn't like myself at the time when I self-harmed, I was very negative and in a very low place and I was angry at myself and the world around me."" NHS figures show girls aged 18 and under were admitted to hospital 13,463 times in 2017 - up from 7,327 times in 1997. Common reasons behind self-harming include depression, bullying, pressure at school, emotional abuse, grieving or having relationship problems with family or friends, according to the NSPCC. The same rise hasn't been reflected in boys however - with figures showing admissions of around 2,000 have stayed the same in the last 20 years. Kay thinks the rise in admissions for girls has a lot to do with the pressure that the media puts on women. ""I think media has had such a huge and bad impact for women because you don't see them doing that to guys,"" she says. ""In almost every single magazine they are body shaming women."" She says social media has a significant part to play too. ""People are following perfect social media accounts and they think that the airbrushed photos are true and it's all real when it isn't."" Both Kay and the NSPCC say social media has a huge impact on teenage girls The NSPCC said the figures were ""heartbreaking"" but ""sadly unsurprising"". Chris Cloke, head of safeguarding in communities, also believes social media is a contributing factor as to why more girls are being admitted than boys. ""They're bombarded 24 hours a day with these perfect images and we know if you're a young person, if you're a girl, you're very conscious of what you look like, what you feel and what other people are doing and this of course also puts pressures on you. ""If you've got problems in one area, they can all add up and they may lead children to be very vulnerable and that may lead them to self-harm."" He said he would encourage anyone who is experiencing mental health issues or thinking about self-harming to tell someone. A Department of Health spokesman said an extra Â£300m will be invested to provide extra help in schools, including training staff to support children faster.

"Mr Trump was appealing to conservative Christian groups for help US President Donald Trump has warned that his policies will be ""violently"" overturned if the Democrats win November's mid-term elections. He told Evangelical leaders that the vote was a ""referendum"" on freedom of speech and religion, and that these were threatened by ""violent people"". He appealed to conservative Christian groups for help, saying they were one vote away from ""losing everything"". Mid-term elections are widely seen as a test of the president's popularity. Mr Trump has been battling negative publicity after his ex-lawyer and former campaign chief were convicted earlier this month. Can we tell now if Democrats will win US election? Why US mid-term elections matter Will Trump remain bulletproof? An audio recording of Mr Trump's closed-door meeting with Evangelical leaders at the White House was leaked to US media. During the meeting, Mr Trump said the mid-term elections were not just a referendum on him but also ""on your religion, it's a referendum on free speech and the First Amendment [guaranteeing basic freedoms]"". ""It's not a question of like or dislike, it's a question that they will overturn everything that we've done and they will do it quickly and violently. And violently. There is violence. When you look at Antifa - these are violent people,"" he said. Antifa - short for anti-fascist - refers to groups of far-left protesters who fight far-right ideology and regularly clash with far-right demonstrators. The US president has previously criticised left-wing groups, infamously saying that there had been violence on ""many sides"" after a white nationalist killed a left-wing demonstrator at a white nationalist protest in Charlottesville last year. 'A battle for the soul of America' Antifa: Left-wing militants on the rise Urging the Evangelical leaders to use their influence to swing voters, Mr Trump told them they had ""tremendous power"". ""In this room, you have people who preach to almost 200 million people. Depending on which Sunday we're talking about,"" he said. ""Little thing: Merry Christmas, right? You couldn't say 'Merry Christmas',"" he added, according to US media reports. Two of those who heard Mr Trump speak downplayed the remarks, according to a series of tweets,externalby Sarah McCammon, a reporter from National Public Radio (NPR).

"This video can not be played ""I lost everything I ever had"" - Rex Wade was one of the last children to be sent away More than 100 Britons who were sent abroad as children under a resettlement scheme are to sue the UK government over the abuse they suffered. In March, an inquirysaid 2,000 survivors should receive financial compensationwithin 12 months. The victims' lawyer said the government ""has a legal responsibility for the harm suffered by those children"". Between 1945-70, some 4,000 children were separated from their families and sent to Australia and Zimbabwe. The Independent Inquiry Into Child Sex Abuse (IICSA) considered the children who were forcibly relocated in the post-war period. A scheme saw children from deprived backgrounds who were often already in social care - some as young as three years old -sent away with the promise of a better life. Overseen by government, and managed by charities and the church, it was part of a longstanding policy aimed at easing the strain on UK orphanages and strengthening the British population abroad. Victims say they went on to be sexually, emotionally and physically abused. A group of children from a school in Stevenage were among those to be sent to the Fairbridge school in Molong, Australia Rex Wade was one of the last children to be sent to Australia as part of the programme in 1970. At the age of 10, he was shipped from Cornwall with his brother to Tasmania. He says he was subjected to a punitive regime and was treated ""cruelly for any misdemeanour"", and that his tormentors would set a dog on him and other children if they misbehaved. ""It was physical, verbal and mental abuse,"" he says. ""I lost everything I ever had; the relationships I had with my family. It's a lot to deal with and you just don't get over it."" John Glynn, who was sent to a Christian Brothers institution in Western Australia when he was eight years old, is one of the 100 former migrants to bring the case forward. John Glynn does not believe the British government has done enough to get financial compensation to ageing victims of the UK's child migrant policy At the institution in Clontarf, he was told he was not loved by his family in Britain. Through his seven years with the Christian Brothers he was beaten brutally with a cane, and also sexually abused. ""As I get older it gets worse,"" the 74-year-old says. ""I think about that a lot now. They took my childhood from me. They took my country from me, my heritage."" By Tom Symonds Buildings at Bindoon were constructed by migrant children For several decades, the UK sent children across the world to new lives in institutions where many were abused and used as forced labour. It's a scandal that is still having repercussions now. Imagine the 1950s, in the years before air travel became commonplace or the internet dominated our lives.  Imagine being a child of those times, barely aware of life even in the next town.  An orphan perhaps, living in a British children's home. Now imagine being told that shortly you would board a ship for somewhere called Australia, to begin a new life in a sunlit wonderland. For good. No choice. Read the full article here (published February 2017) More than 130,000 children were shipped to Commonwealth countries from 1618 until 1970, to countries including Canada, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Australia. The IICSA investigated the final 4,000 children sent to Australia and Zimbabwe. It found children suffered sexual and emotional abuse, as well as forced labour. Some were also wrongly told they were orphans, depriving them of the opportunity of meeting their birth parents. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We want to reassure those affected we are committed to providing a timely response to the Inquiry's recommendations."" But despite the recommendation in March, the government is yet to set up a compensation scheme for the surviving child migrants. BBC correspondent Sanchia Berg said many ""of the migrants feel time is running out"" as most are elderly, and some are frail. Since March, 14 of the survivors have died. Lawyer Alan Collins, who is representing the victims, said: ""The government needs to step up to the plate and bring into force its redress scheme. ""Compensation can never put matters right - that's impossible and it would be insulting to suggest otherwise. ""But it is action, it is a recognition that meets the words that have been spoken by the politicians."" In 2010, then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologised on behalf of the British government for sending British children abroad. Labour MP Lisa Nandy has criticised the government's lack of speed in setting up a service to offer financial compensation for victims. She said: ""Over the last six months we've had absolutely nothing - it took us even six weeks to find out which department was responsible [for financial compensation]."" She added the Australian government had successfully put together a commission for compensation a lot sooner, and ""enough is enough"".

"This video can not be played Rebecca Woodhead tells Jean Mackenzie she became pregnant while using Natural Cycles. An advert on Facebook for an app that provides a natural alternative to contraception has been banned by the UK's Advertising Standards Authority. Claims that it was ""highly accurate"" and ""provided a clinically tested alternative to other birth control methods"" were found to be misleading. The Swedish firm behind the Natural Cycles app was warned ""not to exaggerate"" its efficacy. In response, the firm said it respected the outcome of the investigation. It told the BBC that it removed the ad, which ran for approximately four weeks in mid-2017, as soon as it was notified of the complaint. ""We are committed to being open and transparent in our communications to ensure our message is clear and provides women with the information they need to determine if Natural Cycles is right for them. As part of these efforts, every advertisement undergoes a strict approval process,"" the firm said in a statement. ""Natural Cycles has been independently evaluated and cleared by regulators in Europe and the US based on clinical evidence demonstrating its effectiveness as a method of contraception."" The ASA upheld complaints about the language used in the advert The ASA said that the Facebook ad must not appear again in its current form. Natural Cycles requires women to take their temperatures every day using a basal body thermometer and to enter the reading into the app, which also tracks a user's menstrual cycle. The app uses an algorithm to determine a woman's daily fertility based on changes in basal body temperature. Basal thermometers are able to detect a minor rise in temperature around the time of ovulation. Women will see a ""use protection"" warning appear on the app during their fertile days. Launched in 2014, the app now has more than 300,000 users who pay a monthly or annual fee for the service. Elina Berglund Scherwitzl, co-founder of Natural Cycles It was invented by Swedish nuclear physicist Elina Berglund Scherwitzl and her husband. It has previously been approved for use as a medical device by German inspection and certification organisation Tuv Sud, which means it can be used across the EU. One former user - who asked to remain anonymous - told the BBC she had downloaded the app in September 2017 after being attracted by its Facebook campaign. She said the ads had been ""misleading"" as they had suggested the software was simple to use. In practice, she explained, it had proved difficult to provide readings at matching times of the day since she had to care for two young children. Nevertheless, she persevered but became pregnant. When she contacted the firm to complain she said the staff had been ""sympathetic but not apologetic"" and had insisted she must have entered her data incorrectly. Natural Cycles recently won approval from the US Food and Drug Administration, which described it as an effective method of contraception if ""used carefully and correctly"". At the time, Terri Cornelison, assistant director for the health of women at the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said: ""Women should know that no form of contraception works perfectly, so an unplanned pregnancy could still result from correct usage of this device."" Are women turning their back on the pill? Do pregnancy prevention apps work? Can I trust fertility apps? This video can not be played Do pregnancy prevention apps work? Contraception effectiveness is measured by looking at how often it fails - if 100 women use it over the course of a year, how many will become pregnant? Looking at ""typical use"", which allows for some human error, Natural Cycle's founders say the figure would be seven women in every 100. With perfect use, they claim it is one in 100. The most effective type of contraception is the implant, on which 0.0005 in every 100 women will become pregnant. For the hormonal and copper coil it's 0.2 in 100 and just under one in 100 respectively. About nine in every 100 women will become pregnant while relying on the pill. But those figures for traditional contraception are taken from numerous studies done over many years. The two studies done so far on Natural Cycles only look at the app and mean their figures just are not comparable. The Natural Cycles app relies on women taking their temperature at the same time every day and does not give an accurate fertility reading until three months of use. The results can be skewed by various factors including: disturbed sleep or irregular sleep patterns drinking alcohol going to the toilet in the night travelling taking painkillers in the night working shifts In considering the complaint, which was lodged by three people, the ASA took expert advice and reviewed three published papers based on the accumulated data obtained from the app. It found that there was a distinction between typical use of the app and the perfect-use scenario. It felt that the figures presented to users were based on the perfect user rather than typical user and, for the latter, the system could not be described as highly accurate. It also found that presenting the statement ""highly accurate"" alongside the claim ""clinically tested alternative to birth control methods"" gave the impression ""that the app was a precise and reliable method of preventing pregnancies which could be used in place of other established birth control methods"". Natural Cycles told the ASA that the claim ""clinically tested alternative to birth control methods"" was a quote from the news site Business Insider. But, it added, the claims were backed by scientific evidence, including clinical trials. Separately the app is being investigated by Sweden's Medical Products Agency (MPA) which told the BBC it has received approximately 60 complaints relating to unwanted pregnancies as a result of using the app. It is due to publish its conclusions next week.

"There are more than 12 million households where all adults are working The proportion of households in the UK where no-one is working is at its lowest point for over 20 years, the Office for National Statistics says. The figures show 14.3% of households containing working-age adults are ""workless"" - down 0.2% compared with the same point last year. Fewer children were living in families where no-one was currently working. But more children were living in households where no-one had ever worked - up by 32,000 to 204,000. The employment figures show a picture of rising levels of work in the 21 million households with people aged between 16 and 64. There are fewer workless families now than at any point in a data series going back to 1996. In the late 1990s, about 20% of households had no adults working, but that has fallen to about 14%, representing about three million households. Almost 93% of fathers with dependent children are working In about 12 million households, all the adults had jobs - with 7.5 million children living in homes where everyone was working. The proportion of children living in workless households is down to about 10%, about half the levels of the late 1990s. The numbers of lone parents in work have remained broadly constant for the past decade, says the ONS, with a slight rise reported in these latest figures. The figures show that parents with dependent children are more likely to be in work than adults without dependent children. Almost 93% of men and over 74% of women with dependent children are working - including both full-time and part-time jobs. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said: ""One of the best ways to tackle poverty and give children a better chance in life is to have a working adult in the house. ""It gives them a role model to learn from and brings financial security to the home. ""Getting a job means more than just a wage, it's a way out of poverty and welfare dependency,"" she said. But poverty campaigners have highlighted the importance of the quality as well as quantity of jobs - saying the changing labour market can mean families can be stuck in low-paid or insecure jobs. They have warned that most children living in poverty are now in families where at least one parent is working.

"Willow Smith has revealed she ""lost her sanity"" and used to self-harm as a child. The 17-year-old said it happened after the exposure of her song Whip My Hair, which was released in 2010 - when she was nine years old. ""After all of that settled down and there was a lull, I was just listening to a lot of dark music and it was just so crazy,"" she added. ""I was just plunged into this black hole and I was cutting myself.""

"The study was carried out at a goat sanctuary in the UK Scientists have found that goats are drawn to humans with happy facial expressions. The result suggests a wider range of animals can read people's moods than was previously thought. The researchers showed goats pairs of photos of the same person, one of them featuring an angry expression, and the other a happy demeanour. The goats made a beeline for the happy faces, the team reports in the journal Royal Society Open Science. The result implies that the ability of animals to perceive human facial cues is not limited to those with a long history of working as human companions, such as dogs and horses. Instead, it seems, animals domesticated for food production, such as goats, can also decipher human facial cues. The study was carried out at the Buttercups Sanctuary for Goats in Kent, UK. Co-author Dr Alan McElligott, from Queen Mary, University of London, and colleagues set up pairs of black-and-white photos about 1.3m apart on one wall in their test area. Then, a goat would be let loose to explore the set-up. The researchers found that the goats strongly preferred the smiling faces, approaching the happy faces before acknowledging the angry photos. They also spent more time examining the smiling faces with their snouts. But the effect was only significant when the happy-faced photo was placed on the right-hand side. When the happy photos were placed on the left, the goats showed no significant preference either way. The researchers think this is because the goats are using one side of their brain to process the information - something that's seen in other animals. It could either be that the left side of the brain processes positive emotions, or that the right side of the brain is involved in avoidance of angry faces. See more stories and videos like this Dr McElligott, who is now based at the University of Roehampton, said: ""The study has important implications for how we interact with livestock and other species, because the abilities of animals to perceive human emotions might be widespread and not just limited to pets."" Co-author Natalia Albuquerque, from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, said: ""The study of emotion perception has already shown very complex abilities in dogs and horses. ""However, to date, there was no evidence that animals such as goats were capable of reading human facial expressions. Our results open new paths to understanding the emotional lives of all domestic animals."" The study could also have implications for animal welfare, helping change perceptions of these livestock animals by highlighting their sentience.

"The US territory has asked Congress for $139bn in recovery funds Officials in Puerto Rico now say 2,975 people died following Hurricane Maria - a devastating storm that struck the US island territory in September 2017. The revised death toll is nearly 50 times the previous estimate of 64. Governor Ricardo Rossello ""accepted"" the findings in a long-awaited independent investigation. The mayor of the capital, San Juan, accused the US government of deliberately downplaying the impact of the storm. Puerto Rico has struggled to repair its infrastructure and power grid since the storm, and is asking US Congress for $139bn (Â£108bn) in recovery funds. ""I'm giving an order to update the official number of deaths to 2,975,"" Governor Ricardo Rossello told reporters on Tuesday. ""Although this is an estimate, it has a scientific basis."" In a statement, the White House said the federal government supported the governor's efforts to ""ensure a full accountability and transparency of fatalities"" in the hurricane. President Donald Trump was criticised for praising the federal response to the hurricane-ravaged island in the weeks following the storm.Critics accused him of showing more concern for residents in Texas and Florida after they were hit by hurricanes. The authorities have faced criticism for underreporting the toll of Maria - the most powerful storm to hit the region in nearly 90 years. Until now, the official figure was 64 - even thoughthe island had previously acknowledged the death toll was probably much higher. In the wake of the disaster,some experts estimated as many as 4,600 deaths. This video can not be played Months after Maria, many on this US island still suffered in the dark The latest findings - accepted by the island's authorities - were made in a report,externalby experts from George Washington University, which the governor commissioned. The government's initial number was for those killed directly by the hurricane, crushed by collapsing buildings, drowned or hit by flying debris. But the new report also counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis. Total blackout hits 3.4m Puerto Ricans Six graphics that sum up Puerto Rico disaster Puerto Rico profile ""This shows the magnitude of the catastrophe,"" Governor Rossello told El Nuevo Dia newspaper. When asked why his government was unable to recognise a higher death toll until now, he replied: ""I am not perfect. I make mistakes. Now, hindsight tends to be 20-20."" He echoed one finding in the report - that doctors ""lacked awareness"" on how to appropriately certify deaths attributed to natural disasters. ""The responsibility for adjudicating the cause of deaths rested with the doctors,"" Mr Rossello said. ""But unfortunately there was no formal process to prepare them for this kind of devastation. ""At that moment, that was the number [of deceased] that we had and today we have the evidence which indicates the number was definitely higher."" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told the BBC that there had been ""neglect"" by the Trump administration and some local officials hadn't wanted to confront the president about the need for more aid. ""It seemed like it was better to dance to President Trump's tune than to tell the truth that we were all seeing."" she said. ""I did was I thought ought to be done as I screamed, literally, out of the top of my lungs to say 'We're dying here' and the bureaucracy and the inefficiency of the federal government was killing us."" Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington correspondent For close to a year, Puerto Rico's government has clung to the idea that 64 people died as a result of Maria. That figure was always risible - particularly when you consider that the 150 mph (241 km/h) winds caused around $90bn worth of damage and left households for, on average, 84 days without electricity; 64 days without water and 41 days without cellular telephone coverage. In truth, the new official number is still an estimate - based on mortality data and taking into account historical data on migration patterns. But the official recognition will allow the island to move on and focus fully on rebuilding its infrastructure and extracting the tens of billions of dollars needed from Congress to give the three million inhabitants of this already bankrupt territory something of a future. Researchers tracked the number of deaths using death certificates and other mortality data between mid-September 2017 to mid-February of this year. This video can not be played Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico wasn't a ""real catastrophe like Katrina"", Trump told officials in the US territory last year The Caribbean island is home to 3.3 million people, some 8% of which have since left the island, the study said. It also said that those from poorer backgrounds in Puerto Rico were 45% more likely to have been killed in the aftermath of the hurricane. The governor said he would sign an executive order to create a committee to examine and put into practice the report's recommendations. Puerto Rico has been reeling ever since the storm struck - with residents still suffering blackouts, broken infrastructure and a lack of services. Hurricane Maria caused the largest blackout in US history,external, according to research consultancy the Rhodium Group. It is ranked as the third most financially costly cyclone in US history since 1900, yet its death toll is a third higher than the costliest - Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with an estimated 1,833. What is Trump's plan for Puerto Rico? Trump lashes out at hurricane plea mayor Trump puts Puerto Rico on notice over aid The new study raises questions about President Trump's response to the disaster. During a visit in October, Mr Trump had suggested officials should be ""proud"" the death toll - at the time only 16 - was not as high as ""a real catastrophe"" like Katrina.

"British Gas has paid Â£2.65m in refunds, compensation and redress after wrongly overcharging more than 94,000 customers who switched to new providers. According to the regulator Ofgem, British Gas charged customers its more expensive standard variable tariff rate after they decided to switch to a new supplier, due to a system error. British Gas also wrongly charged exit fees to 1,698 fixed deal customers. It also wrongly informed 2.5 million customers they might incur an exit fee. British Gas said following the system error, those who were charged too much were ""promptly refunded as soon as we identified the issue and were paid an additional goodwill gesture"". It said some customers were provided with initial communications containing incorrect terms and conditions - but all other communications they received were correct. ""We have changed our processes to ensure the error has been corrected,"" it added. Anthony Pygram, director of conduct and enforcement at Ofgem, said: ""British Gas failed its customers who were coming to the end of their fixed contracts and switched supplier by unfairly penalising them and applying charges in error. ""Many more customers could have been deterred from getting a better deal due to the incorrect terms and conditions."" Those customers who were switched to a more expensive British Gas standard variable rate tariff, after they decided to switch to a new supplier, were overcharged by a total of Â£782,450, according to Ofgem. Meanwhile, the total of the incorrect exit fees charged to the 1,698 affected fixed deal customers totalled Â£64,968. Ofgem's investigation found that British Gas had provided 2.5 million customers with incorrect terms and conditions, which stated that exit fees were payable during the 49 day period before their fixed deals expired. Under industry conditions, a customer is generally entitled to switch at any time during or after this ""switching window"" without having to pay an exit fee. Ofgem said this switching window was designed to encourage customers to switch to a better deal before they were rolled onto a default tariff at the end of their contract. The regulator opened an investigation in July 2017 following concerns raised by websiteMoneySavingExpert.com,external. Before the investigation had been completed, British Gas refunded in full all customers who had been overcharged by more than Â£1 and paid Â£502,633 in compensation to them. Following Ofgem's findings, British Gas agreed to pay a further Â£244,770 in compensation to customers wrongly charged exit fees, and also paid Â£1,050,229 into Ofgem's consumer redress fund. The redress scheme is a pot of money open to charitable organisations that support energy customers in England, Scotland and Wales.

"Facebook hopes Watch will encourage users to spend longer within its app Facebook's Watch video-streaming service is rolling out worldwide, just over a year after its US launch. Users will be able to choose from a range of shows - from both established brands and new players - and have the ability to view clips saved from their News Feeds. The firm plans to allow all content creators to feature advertising breaks, so long as they hit certain metrics. Until now, only select publishers had been given the opportunity. To begin with, only videos shown to audiences in the UK, US, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand will have this facility. The revenue split will be 55% to the creators and 45% to Facebook. Next month the service will premiere one of its biggest budget dramas: Sorry For Your Loss Facebook had intended to reveal the roll-out on Wednesday, but brought forward the announcement after details leaked. As a consequence, some users may not be able to access its pages yet. Watch is often portrayed as a rival to Google's YouTube, but it also competes for attention against traditional TV channels as well as online outlets including Netflix, Amazon Video, BBC iPlayer and Facebook's own Instagram TV. A study published last week suggests that it only had niche appeal in its first year in the US. Of 1,632 adult Facebook users questioned, 50% had never heard of Watch, while 24% said they were aware of the on-demand service but had never used it,according to the Diffusion Group.,external Only 14% told the market research firm that they used it at least once a week. Another report noted that although some Watch shows had attracted audiences numbering in their millions, they often struggled to retain them. ""This seems to be a pattern with most Facebook Watch shows: lots of people sample, few return,""wrote Verne Gay for Newsday.,external Even so, some big name stars have been involved in original programming made for the platform. Red Table Talk has been one of Watch's most popular shows in the US They include: Jada Pinkett Smith, who headlines the talk show Red Table Talk Elizabeth Olsen, who stars in the forthcoming drama Sorry For Your Loss about a woman grieving for her husband Bear Grylls, the British adventurer, who hosts a reality show Face the Wild ABC, Fox News, Vice and Buzzfeed are among others who have made content for the service. Facebook claims that its advantage against other platforms is the ways Watch helps viewers interact with others. ""It is built on the notion that watching video doesn't have to be a passive experience,"" explained Fidji Simo, Facebook's vice-president of video. ""You can have a two-way conversation about the content with friends, other fans or even the creators themselves."" She added that a Watch Party feature lets users co-ordinate themselves to watch a show together, while an Interactivity Platform allows creators to run polls, challenges and quizzes to boost engagement. India-based Watch viewers will be able to see La Liga football matches from Spain Facebook says the most common feedback it had from creators over the past year was a call for it to allow more of them to include ad breaks. To qualify publishers must: have created videos lasting longer than three minutes have attracted more than 30,000 viewers who stayed for more than one minute when watching the content over the past two months have more than 10,000 followers be located in one of the countries where the ad break facility is available One industry watcher predicted the terms would appeal to established independent video-makers,some of whom have been concernedat the way Google's YouTube has run its own advertising programme. This video can not be played WATCH: YouTube faced criticism for an ad crackdown in 2017 ""For a very long time YouTube had the monopoly on online video when it came to offering creators a way to make money from adverts,"" commented Alex Brinnand, editor of TenEighty magazine. ""And for a while now, many creators have been looking for other potential revenue streams - some have started using [Amazon's] Twitch for example. ""So, this will be welcomed as it provides further options."" Facebook said that a second wave of countries - including France, Germany, Norway, Mexico and Thailand would receive ad breaks in September. The BBC is not providing original content to Facebook Watch, but has not ruled out doing so in the future. ""We've got a strong track record collaborating and experimenting with social media platforms to engage with BBC audiences,"" said a spokesman. ""We continue to watch the market closely and explore options for the future.""

"British Gas has paid Â£2.65m in refunds, compensation and redress after wrongly overcharging more than 94,000 customers who switched to new providers.

British Gas also wrongly charged exit fees to 1,698 fixed deal customers. It also wrongly informed 2.5 million customers they might incur an exit fee. British Gas said following the system error, those who were charged too much were ""promptly refunded as soon as we identified the issue and were paid an additional goodwill gesture"".

"Pension schemes have been asked to consider whether they are being too generous when offering lump sums to people thinking about cashing out of ""defined benefit"" retirement schemes. It comes amid concern that overly generous payouts could damage the remaining funds. The Pensions Regulator wrote to 14 schemes earlier this year, encouraging them to consider making reductions. A record Â£21bn flowed out of defined schemes in the year to March. Defined benefit schemes promise people a certain level of income when they retire, such as final salary pensions, and are often described as ""gold-plated"". However, in recent years firms have been offering people large cash sums to transfer out, as it gets more expensive to cover their obligations. Steel pensions targeted by 'vultures' Pensions: Why your wages might go down The letter was obtained by Royal London, one of the UK's largest pension fund managers, following a freedom of information request. Sir Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London, said people were routinely offered 25 to 30 times their annual pension as a lump sum transfer value - but it could be as much as 40 times. This could mean that for a Â£10,000-per-year pension, someone could be offered anywhere between Â£250,000 and Â£400,000. The former pensions minister said such generous payouts might pose a risk if the pension scheme was in deficit, or if the employer faced financial difficulties. If large numbers of workers transferred out, he said, it could worsen the scheme's funding position and put other member's pots in jeopardy. ""I would hope that well-run pension schemes would be taking expert advice when deciding how much to offer to members wishing to transfer out,"" Sir Steve said. ""But the regulator's letter is a helpful reminder to all schemes that they need to be fair not only to those transferring out but also those left behind, especially where the scheme in question is in deficit."" In its letter, the Pensions Regulator said that transfers presented ""certain risks"" to members as they did not promise a guaranteed stream of income. It also told the schemes, which have not been named, that it was in the ""best financial interests"" of most members to stick with their defined benefit schemes. The costs of defined benefit schemes have risen as people live longer, and companies now tend to offer employees less generous defined contribution schemes. However, large numbers of current and former workers still rely on them. A spokesman for the Pensions Regulator said: ""Our primary concern is that defined benefit scheme members requesting a cash equivalent transfer value have all the information they need to make an informed decision about what is in their best interests. ""This includes understanding the fees that are charged under any new pension arrangement as these can make a significant difference to the value of the fund. ""As a result, we are working closely with the Financial Conduct Authority and The Pensions Advisory Service to provide an increased level of support to trustees and scheme members where there is uncertainty around the future of a defined benefit pension scheme. ""This includes providing letters for trustees to send members alerting them to the risks of transferring and giving practical information."" Reality Check: Are pensions on the brink?

"The study was carried out at a goat sanctuary in the UK Scientists have found that goats are drawn to humans with happy facial expressions. The result suggests a wider range of animals can read people's moods than was previously thought. The researchers showed goats pairs of photos of the same person, one of them featuring an angry expression, and the other a happy demeanour. The goats made a beeline for the happy faces, the team reports in the journal Royal Society Open Science. The result implies that the ability of animals to perceive human facial cues is not limited to those with a long history of working as human companions, such as dogs and horses. Instead, it seems, animals domesticated for food production, such as goats, can also decipher human facial cues. The study was carried out at the Buttercups Sanctuary for Goats in Kent, UK. Co-author Dr Alan McElligott, from Queen Mary, University of London, and colleagues set up pairs of black-and-white photos about 1.3m apart on one wall in their test area. Then, a goat would be let loose to explore the set-up. The researchers found that the goats strongly preferred the smiling faces, approaching the happy faces before acknowledging the angry photos. They also spent more time examining the smiling faces with their snouts. But the effect was only significant when the happy-faced photo was placed on the right-hand side. When the happy photos were placed on the left, the goats showed no significant preference either way. The researchers think this is because the goats are using one side of their brain to process the information - something that's seen in other animals. It could either be that the left side of the brain processes positive emotions, or that the right side of the brain is involved in avoidance of angry faces. See more stories and videos like this Dr McElligott, who is now based at the University of Roehampton, said: ""The study has important implications for how we interact with livestock and other species, because the abilities of animals to perceive human emotions might be widespread and not just limited to pets."" Co-author Natalia Albuquerque, from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, said: ""The study of emotion perception has already shown very complex abilities in dogs and horses. ""However, to date, there was no evidence that animals such as goats were capable of reading human facial expressions. Our results open new paths to understanding the emotional lives of all domestic animals."" The study could also have implications for animal welfare, helping change perceptions of these livestock animals by highlighting their sentience.

"The US territory has asked Congress for $139bn in recovery funds Officials in Puerto Rico now say 2,975 people died following Hurricane Maria - a devastating storm that struck the US island territory in September 2017. The revised death toll is nearly 50 times the previous estimate of 64. Governor Ricardo Rossello ""accepted"" the findings in a long-awaited independent investigation. The mayor of the capital, San Juan, accused the US government of deliberately downplaying the impact of the storm. Puerto Rico has struggled to repair its infrastructure and power grid since the storm, and is asking US Congress for $139bn (Â£108bn) in recovery funds. ""I'm giving an order to update the official number of deaths to 2,975,"" Governor Ricardo Rossello told reporters on Tuesday. ""Although this is an estimate, it has a scientific basis."" In a statement, the White House said the federal government supported the governor's efforts to ""ensure a full accountability and transparency of fatalities"" in the hurricane. President Donald Trump was criticised for praising the federal response to the hurricane-ravaged island in the weeks following the storm.Critics accused him of showing more concern for residents in Texas and Florida after they were hit by hurricanes. The authorities have faced criticism for underreporting the toll of Maria - the most powerful storm to hit the region in nearly 90 years. Until now, the official figure was 64 - even thoughthe island had previously acknowledged the death toll was probably much higher. In the wake of the disaster,some experts estimated as many as 4,600 deaths. This video can not be played Months after Maria, many on this US island still suffered in the dark The latest findings - accepted by the island's authorities - were made in a report,externalby experts from George Washington University, which the governor commissioned. The government's initial number was for those killed directly by the hurricane, crushed by collapsing buildings, drowned or hit by flying debris. But the new report also counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis. Total blackout hits 3.4m Puerto Ricans Six graphics that sum up Puerto Rico disaster Puerto Rico profile ""This shows the magnitude of the catastrophe,"" Governor Rossello told El Nuevo Dia newspaper. When asked why his government was unable to recognise a higher death toll until now, he replied: ""I am not perfect. I make mistakes. Now, hindsight tends to be 20-20."" He echoed one finding in the report - that doctors ""lacked awareness"" on how to appropriately certify deaths attributed to natural disasters. ""The responsibility for adjudicating the cause of deaths rested with the doctors,"" Mr Rossello said. ""But unfortunately there was no formal process to prepare them for this kind of devastation. ""At that moment, that was the number [of deceased] that we had and today we have the evidence which indicates the number was definitely higher."" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told the BBC that there had been ""neglect"" by the Trump administration and some local officials hadn't wanted to confront the president about the need for more aid. ""It seemed like it was better to dance to President Trump's tune than to tell the truth that we were all seeing."" she said. ""I did was I thought ought to be done as I screamed, literally, out of the top of my lungs to say 'We're dying here' and the bureaucracy and the inefficiency of the federal government was killing us."" Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington correspondent For close to a year, Puerto Rico's government has clung to the idea that 64 people died as a result of Maria. That figure was always risible - particularly when you consider that the 150 mph (241 km/h) winds caused around $90bn worth of damage and left households for, on average, 84 days without electricity; 64 days without water and 41 days without cellular telephone coverage. In truth, the new official number is still an estimate - based on mortality data and taking into account historical data on migration patterns. But the official recognition will allow the island to move on and focus fully on rebuilding its infrastructure and extracting the tens of billions of dollars needed from Congress to give the three million inhabitants of this already bankrupt territory something of a future. Researchers tracked the number of deaths using death certificates and other mortality data between mid-September 2017 to mid-February of this year. This video can not be played Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico wasn't a ""real catastrophe like Katrina"", Trump told officials in the US territory last year The Caribbean island is home to 3.3 million people, some 8% of which have since left the island, the study said. It also said that those from poorer backgrounds in Puerto Rico were 45% more likely to have been killed in the aftermath of the hurricane. The governor said he would sign an executive order to create a committee to examine and put into practice the report's recommendations. Puerto Rico has been reeling ever since the storm struck - with residents still suffering blackouts, broken infrastructure and a lack of services. Hurricane Maria caused the largest blackout in US history,external, according to research consultancy the Rhodium Group. It is ranked as the third most financially costly cyclone in US history since 1900, yet its death toll is a third higher than the costliest - Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with an estimated 1,833. What is Trump's plan for Puerto Rico? Trump lashes out at hurricane plea mayor Trump puts Puerto Rico on notice over aid The new study raises questions about President Trump's response to the disaster. During a visit in October, Mr Trump had suggested officials should be ""proud"" the death toll - at the time only 16 - was not as high as ""a real catastrophe"" like Katrina.

The Fire Service has said that there ""continue to be small pockets of fire within the building and a 45m (148ft) exclusion zone remains in place"" but added that the exterior of the building ""remains structurally intact"". Area commander Aidan Jennings said Belfast City Council and Primark's owners have installed a new structure to help support what's left of of Bank Buildings and there had been been further collapse within it. He added that on Thursday morning they'll be trying to get businesses back open and reduce the cordon. A spokesperson said: ""We are continuing to work closely with engineers from Belfast City Council to determine the structural integrity and safety of the building. ""Once this has been completed a fire investigation will commence into the cause of the fire. ""In conjunction with our partners in Belfast City Council and the PSNI we have been facilitating escorted access for business owners in the local area who are affected by the incident to enable them to access and secure their properties."" Primark said it is ""fully committed to supporting staff during this difficult time"". After a meeting between bosses and staff on Wednesday, the company said it is ""continuing to work with the relevant authorities to determine the cause of the fire"". A spokesperson for the retailer said: ""The welfare of our colleagues remains our most important concern and we are fully committed to supporting them during this difficult time. ""Our management team in Belfast are meeting their colleagues over the next few days to provide them with the necessary support and information. ""We would like to thank everyone for their amazing support during this very challenging time for all concerned."" The clock at the top of Bank Buildings was one of the features destroyed by the flames Primark store 'at risk of collapse' History of Belfast's Bank Buildings In pictures: Primark building destroyed It is believed that more than 350 people worked at the store, which was undergoing a major refurbishment and extension that was estimated to cost Â£30m. The Usdaw trade union said it had a ""very positive meeting"" with Primark's management on Wednesday and was told firm answers about workers' futures would be given next week. This video can not be played The landmark building was destroyed by the fire within a matter of hours ""All options are being explored by management to retain their staff, to retain that loyalty and their service,"" said Usdaw's Michaela Lafferty. ""We don't have long-term answers - the company has a short-term solution and that is this week nobody has lost their job and everybody will receive their pay."" This video can not be played Much of the interior of the historic Bank Buildings on Castle Street has collapsed after a fire A 45m (148ft) police cordon is in place around the building. Castle Street is closed from Queen Street to Royal Avenue. Land and Property Services (LPS) is encouraging businesses who have been impacted by the fire to contact them to discuss support available for rates. A spokesperson said: ""During this period, LPS is willing to discuss extended payment arrangements with affected businesses. Ratepayers may also be eligible for the hardship relief scheme."" A trade union representing workers has said that Primark will pay employees their wages this week before reviewing matters next week. It remains unclear what the long-term future holds for staff and whether it will be possible for them all to be redeployed. Guidelines from the Labour Relations Agency (LRA) state that ""an employee who has been put onto a period of lay-off or short-time working for four consecutive weeks or six weeks in a 13-week period may be eligible for a redundancy payment"". Citing legislation from 1996, the LRA notes employees ""must be paid a guarantee payment"" if laid off because of ""a shortage of work of the kind they are employed to do, or any other occurrence affecting the normal working of the business e.g. floods, power failures"". ""The payment is limited to a maximum of five days in any period of three months,"" it adds. To qualify for payment, the worker must not ""refuse suitable alternative employment"" and have at least one month's continuous service. The fire spread rapidly through the buildings during Tuesday afternoon The fire started near the top of the listed five-storey buildingat about 11:00 BST on Tuesday. Firefighters battled the flames throughout the day and overnight into Wednesday after the roof and floors collapsed. No-one was injured in the blaze and it is not yet clear how it started. Staff acted quickly to get evacuate the store when the fire broke out, said Aidan Jennings Structural engineers have been inspecting the building amid fears it could collapse. They are expected to make a decision on whether its famous sandstone facade can be preserved. Mr Jennings added: ""We've had significant collapse within that front part of the structure - steelwork and floors have come down - but at this stage the building still remains standing. ""There is a significant amount of twisted steelwork and collapsed floors so the building does still remain at risk."" Firefighters are still working at the site and could be there for several days The extension to the rear of the building, which was nearing completion, has been saved. Primark's staff deserved praise for getting people out of the store soon after the fire started, added Mr Jennings. ""They quickly evacuated the building - they allowed our crews to focus on the fire and were able to quickly confirm that everyone had left the building."" Belfast City Council held an emergency meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss how it could help staff and other businesses affected by the fire. Allow Twitter content?

Shops and offices that fall within the cordon remain closed. Belfast Lord Mayor Deirdre Hargey said the city needed to ""rally round those who need support now"". ""Not only has this impacted on the Primark employees and the business itself but it will have a knock-on effect for neighbouring businesses and city centre retailers,"" she said. She added that the council was willing to help Primark ""in any way we can should they wish to seek alternative accommodation"" in the city centre. The Belfast Chamber of Trade said the set-up of a business recovery group would ""provide information, support and assistance to traders and affected by the Primark fire"". President Rajesh Rana added: ""Belfast Chamber is working to collate a list of alternative vacant premises in the city that traders can relocate to on a temporary basis."" Parts of the roof collapsed after the fire started near the top of the building Retail NI Chief Executive Glyn Roberts said: ""The key message following this meeting is that despite this tragedy, Belfast city centre is still open for business and that it will bounce back from this."" At the scene on Wednesday: BBC News NI's Karen Patterson Belfast woke up to an image as dramatic as those broadcast across the world last night of one of Belfast's most iconic buildings. It is a very sorry sight - Bank Buildings is a shell and all of the floors have collapsed. As I stand at a cordon that stretches around the building there are real concerns about trading opportunities for businesses around the Castle Junction. All buses operating in and out of the city centre on Wednesday are subject to delays and diversions. Some staff have spoken of their shock and concern about their futures. Mary Flynn, from Glengormley in County Antrim, has worked for Primark since it opened in Belfast city centre in 1975 at Queen's Arcade before moving to Bank Buildings. Shops and other buildings that sit within the cordon around the building have been closed She was ""devastated"" to learn about the fire through a phone call from her niece. ""When I heard I was so sad, so upset... but we're just so glad that all the staff and customers got out safely,"" she told BBC News NI. She described her workplace as ""a fabulous store with fabulous people - it was like my second home"". Some workers were left without their house keys after they had to leave their belongings in the building as the fire spread. The original Bank Buildings was erected by Waddell Cunninghamin 1785. It was intended it as a bridge to the 20th Century, with a compromise between the classical style of the upper part of the building and the great expanse of plate glass below. Three bombs exploded in the Bank Buildings in 1975 - a huge fire broke out shortly afterwards and damaged parts of the building. In 1979, the Bank Buildings was taken over by the Dublin-based group Primark and the store was totally refurbished and the exterior restored to its 1903 glory. A trade union representing workers has said that Primark will pay employees their wages this week before reviewing matters next week. It remains unclear what the long-term future holds for staff and whether it will be possible for them all to be re-deployed. Guidelines from the Labour Relations Agency (LRA) states that ""an employee who has been put onto a period of lay-off or short-time working for four consecutive weeks or six weeks in a 13-week period may be eligible for a redundancy payment"".

" Eva, a 19-year-old student at Nairobi Aviation College, was sitting in her tiny room in shared quarters in Kitengela feeling broke, hungry, and desperate. She used the remaining 100 Kenyan shillings she had in her wallet and took a bus to the city centre, where she looked for the first man who would pay to have sex with her. After 10 minutes in a dingy alley, Eva went back to Kitengela with 1,000 Kenyan shillings to feed herself for the rest of the month. Six years ago, when she was at university, Shiro met a married man nearly 40 years her senior. At first, she received just groceries. Then it was trips to the salon. Two years into their relationship, the man moved her into a new apartment because he wanted her to be more comfortable. Another two years down the line, he gave Shiro a plot of land in Nyeri county as a show of commitment. In exchange, he gets to sleep with Shiro whenever he feels like it. Eva's experience is transactional sex in its most unvarnished form -  a hurried one-off encounter, driven by desperation. Shiro's story illustrates an altogether more complex phenomenon - the exchange of youth and beauty for long-term financial gain, motivated not by hunger but by aspiration, glamorised by social media stars, and often wrapped in the trappings of a relationship. Older men have always used gifts, status, and influence to buy access to young women. The sugar daddy has probably been around, in every society, for as long as the prostitute. So you might ask: ""Why even have a conversation about transactional sex in Africa?"" The answer is that in Kenya, and in some other African countries, ""sugar"" relationships seem to have become both more common and more visible: what once was hidden is now out in the open - on campuses, in bars, and all over Instagram. Exactly when this happened is hard to say. It could've been in 2007 when Kim Kardashian's infamous sex tape was leaked, or a little later when Facebook and Instagram took over the world, or perhaps when 3G internet hit Africa's mobile phones. But somehow, we have arrived at a point where having a ""sponsor"" or a ""blesser"" - the terms that millennials usually apply to their benefactors - has for many young people become an accepted, and even a glamorous lifestyle choice. You only have to visit the student districts of Nairobi, one recent graduate told the BBC, to see how pervasive the sponsor culture has become. ""On a Friday night just go sit outside Box House [student hostel] and the see what kind of cars drive by - drivers of ministers, and politicians sent to pick up young girls,"" says Silas Nyanchwani, who studied at the University of Nairobi. Until recently there was no data to indicate how many young Kenyan women are involved in sugar relationships. But this year the Busara Centre for Behavioural Economicsconducted a studyfor BBC Africa in which they questioned 252 female university students between the ages of 18 and 24. They found that approximately 20% of the young women who participated in the research has or has had a ""sponsor."" The sample size was small and the study was not fully randomised, so the results only give an indication of the possible numbers, they cannot be taken as definitive. Also, only a small percentage openly admitted to having a sugar daddy; the researchers were able to infer that a number were hiding the truth from answers they gave to other questions, using a technique called list randomisation. But interestingly, when talking about others, not about themselves, the young women estimated on average that 24% of their peers had engaged in a transactional sexual relationship with an older man - a figure very close to that reached by the researchers. Jane, a 20-year-old Kenyan undergraduate who readily admits to having two sponsors, sees nothing shameful in such relationships - they are just part of the everyday hustle that it takes to survive in Nairobi, she says. She also insists that her relationships with Tom and Jeff, both married, involve friendship and intimacy as well as financial exchange. ""They help you sometimes, but it's not always about sex. It's like they just want company, they want someone to talk to,"" she says. She says that her religious parents brought her up with traditional values, but she has made her own choices. One of her motives, she says, is to be able to support her younger sisters, so they won't need to rely on men for money. But she has also been inspired by Kenya's celebrity ""socialites"" - women who have transformed sex appeal into wealth, becoming stars of social media. Among them are the stars of the reality TV show Nairobi Diaries, Kenya's own blend of Keeping up with the Kardashians and The Real Housewives of Atlanta. The show has launched several socialites out of Nairobi's slums and on to yachts off the coast of Malibu or the Mediterranean. ""Nairobi Diaries is like the Kardashians playing out [on screen] in real time. If I look hot, I look good, there has got be some rich guy who will pay good money to possess me,"" says Oyunga Pala, Nairobi columnist and social commentator. The best known of the Kenyan socialites is probably Vera Sidika, who went from dancing in music videos on to the set of the Nairobi Diaries, and from there launched a business career based on her fame and her physique. ""My body is my business - and it is a money maker,"" she said back in 2014, when discussing her controversial skin-lightening procedures. Nowadays, Vera is keen to promote herself as an entrepreneur, and runs a successful brand of ""detox"" herbal infusions called Veetox Tea. Equally famous is model and socialite Huddah Monroe, who also rose to fame on reality TV - in her case Big Brother Africa, in 2013 - and who now runs a well-established line of cosmetics. ""If you have to expose your body, make money out of it,"" she was reported as saying, referring to the semi-nude images that she shows off to her 1.3 million Instagram followers. In the past, some of Kenya's socialites have styled themselves as #SlayQueens, and have been quite upfront about the financial benefits that have come from dating tycoons. Having made it to the top, though, they often begin to cultivate a different image - presenting themselves as independent, self-made businesswomen and encouraging Kenyan girls to work hard and stay in school. The millions of fans scrolling through their Instagram posts, though, are not blind. The sudden emphasis on entrepreneurship does not hide the fact that these women used their sex appeal to create opportunities in the first place. And many - quite understandably - are attempting to apply this methodology to their own lives. One of those who has succeeded is Bridget Achieng, a woman from the sprawling Nairobi slum of Kibera, who worked as a domestic servant - a house girl - but who gained a social media following on the back of a sexy photoshoot, and then found her way on to the cast of Nairobi Diaries. Her message to aspiring socialites, though, is that nothing is free. ""You want a million bucks, you will do something that is worth a million bucks."" If one end of the sugar spectrum features young women with their sights set on a hot pink Range Rover, a luxury condo and first-class tickets to Dubai, at the other are women angling for little more than some mobile phone credit and maybe a lunch at Java coffee house. But the gulf between them may not be so deep as it seems. ""Should I leave all these Gucci Prada? Na which young girl no dey fear hunger?"" sang the Ghanaian singer Ebony Reigns, encapsulating the mixture of social aspiration and economic anxiety that many young women feel. The desire not to go hungry and the desire to taste the good life can easily run side by side. And the fortunes of a woman dependent on a sponsor can change in an instant - either for better or worse. Grace, a 25-year-old single mum from northern Nairobi, has a regular sponsor, but is actively seeking a more lucrative relationship with a man who will invest in her career as a singer. She is poor by the standards of middle-class Kenyans, often living hand-to-mouth, dancing for cash in a nightclub, and struggling to put her daughter through school. But her determination to feed and educate her child coexists with a naked ambition to become rich and famous through modelling and music. ""I need to be a star,"" she says, citing not just Vera Sidika but also Beyoncé. Is she driven more by vanity or poverty, aspiration or desperation? The lines are blurred. Both Grace and Jane have come of age in the last decade, bombarded since childhood with images of female status built on sex appeal. But according to Crystal Simeoni, an expert on gender and economic policy, Kenyan society encourages sugar relationships in other ways too. If women have become more willing to profit financially from their youth and beauty, she says, it's partly because of Kenya's gross economic inequalities, lack of social mobility, and widespread corruption. ""The way things are constructed in this country makes it so much harder for a smaller person to make ends meet,"" she argues. Hard work won't get them anywhere. ""They have to get a sponsor, rob a bank, or win a tender."" Michael Soi, a well-known artist whose paintings satirise Kenya's culture of transactional sex, takes a similar but more cynical view, attributing the phenomenon more to laziness and a get-rich-quick mentality than to structural injustice. The days of waking up early and working from morning to night are behind us, he says: ""Right now the ass is the new brain, and this is what you use to get what you want."" The phenomenon isn't confined to women. George Paul Meiu, who studies transactional relationships between men of Kenya's Samburu tribe  and older European women, has described how their youth and good looks have become valuable commodities in Kenya's beach resorts. Thanks to a set of ""African warrior"" stereotypes and myths about tribal sexual prowess, the Samburu and others like them are particularly appealing to both local and foreign sugar mummies. Some Samburu villages, he says, claim they have been unable to defend themselves against cattle raids from neighbouring tribes because so many young men have migrated to the coast to become beach boys. ""A beach boy is someone who gets up in the morning, smokes a joint, lies under a coconut tree waiting for bikini-clad white woman passing on the beach and runs after them,"" says artist Michael Soi. But as most of those dependent on sugar relationships are female, they have dominated the public debate. There are concerns about the morality of their lifestyle, but also about its consequences for their health. Kerubo, a 27-year-old from Kisii in Western Kenya, maintains that she has control of her relationship with her sugar daddy, Alfred. But when I ask her about safe sex, this illusion quickly evaporates. Both Alfred and her other sponsor, James, prefer not to use condoms, she says. In fact she has had unprotected sex with multiple sugar daddies, who then have sex with other women, as well as with their wives, exposing all of these partners to the risk of sexually transmitted diseases. Dr Joyce Wamoyi from the National Institute for Medical Research in Tanzania says girls and young women between the ages of 15 and 24 have consistently been at higher risk of HIV infection than any other section of the population in sub-Saharan Africa. Sugar relationships, she says, are contributing to these risks because the women who engage in them do not have the power to insist on the use of condoms. ""With sex work, men are more likely to use condoms because it's more explicit that this is selling and buying."" A look at the Kenyan tabloids also suggests that women are at risk of violence from their sponsors. It's not hard to find headlines such as ""Stabbed to death by a man who has been funding her university education,"" ""Kenyan 'sponsor' threatens lover, posts COFFINS on Facebook and she DIES afterwards,"" ""Pretty 22-Year-Old Girl Killed By Her Sugar Daddy."" These articles all describe, sometimes in graphic detail, sugar relationships that led to murder. Jackie Phamotse, a South African businesswoman who survived an abusive relationship with a ""blesser"", described her experiences in a tell-all book, Bare: The Blesser's Game. Most young women, she says, are not aware of the dangers. ""Some of the girls who disappear around our continent were in these transactional relationships… Looking at the police reports, these are cases of girls who were in relationships with older people, and they were rejected at some point and someone decided to kill them."" Phamotse eventually fled her abuser, with nothing to show for the relationship. ""I had to escape so I didn't find any financial privilege,"" she says. ""I left the house and the car, and had to rebuild my life."" No-one really knows how many sugar relationships end in sexual abuse or physical harm. Kenyan academics and NGOs have made extensive studies of domestic violence, and of the risks faced by sex workers. But on the subject of transactional sex there is no research - only the lurid anecdotes of the tabloids. Among Kenyan feminists, the rise of sponsor culture has provoked intense debate. Does the breaking of old taboos around sex represent a form of female empowerment? Or is sponsor culture just another way in which the female body can be auctioned for the pleasure of men? ""There has been a rising growth of the women's movement in Africa and a rising feminist consciousness,"" says Oyunga Pala, the Nairobi columnist. ""Women who were vilified for being sexually active have been given license to just be. There is less slut-shaming than before."" But while some feminists argue that any choice a woman makes is inherently feminist - because it was made by a woman - others question how free the choice to enter a sponsor relationship really is. ""A feminist approach to freedom of expression, even with sex work and prostitution, is a northern perspective that says you should be allowed to do what you want to do,"" says Crystal Simeoni. ""But that is coming from a point of privilege. A lot of times these women don't have a choice - it's life or death."" Mildred Ngesa, an ambassador for the global activist group Female Wave of Change, makes a similar argument. After decades of women struggling for the right to vote, to own land, to go to school, she argues, the ""choice"" to engage in sugar relationships is steeped in contradiction. ""If we say it's her right to be a prostitute, we are sending her right back into the jaws of patriarchy."" But is it prostitution, or something different in subtle but important ways? Jane, the student, makes a distinction, arguing that ""in these relationships, things are done on your terms"", and Dr Kirsten Stoebenau, a social scientist who has researched transactional sex in Kenya, agrees that this is significant. ""It only becomes sex work when the woman engaging in these relationships describes her sexual partners as clients, when she describes herself as engaged in the sexual economy and when the encounter and exchange is pre-negotiated, explicit, usually immediately remunerated, and often devoid of any emotional connection,"" she says. Grace, the aspiring singer struggling to put food on the table, has a slightly different perspective - to her the similarities with sex work are more apparent. ""I prefer the sponsor thing, rather than standing on the street,"" she says. ""Because you have that one person who is supporting you… you don't need to sleep with so many men."" The artist Michael Soi notes that Kenya remains on the surface a religious society with traditional sexual mores - but only on the surface. Those who deplore sex before marriage and infidelity within marriage rarely practise what they preach, he argues, and the condemnation of sugar relationships is tainted by the same hypocrisy. ""We're constantly bombarded with moral ethics, and with what religion does and doesn't allow. But it's all a pretence,"" he says. ""We're just burying our heads in the sand and pretending these things don't happen."" For many young Kenyans, the values espoused in families, schools, and churches simply do not align with the economic realities of the country, or cannot compete with the material temptations that, in the age of reality TV and social media, are everywhere visible. Even within the family, most Kenyan girls have it drummed into them from an early age that they must marry a rich man, not a poor one. It's taken for granted in these conversations that men will provide the money on which women will survive. So for some it's only a small step to visualising the same transaction outside marriage. ""What is wrong about sex anyway?"" asks Jane. ""People just make it sound wrong. But sometimes, it ain't wrong at all."" Some names have been changed.

"Pension schemes have been asked to consider whether they are being too generous when offering lump sums to people thinking about cashing out of ""defined benefit"" retirement schemes. It comes amid concern that overly generous payouts could damage the remaining funds. The Pensions Regulator wrote to 14 schemes earlier this year, encouraging them to consider making reductions. A record Â£21bn flowed out of defined schemes in the year to March. Defined benefit schemes promise people a certain level of income when they retire, such as final salary pensions, and are often described as ""gold-plated"". However, in recent years firms have been offering people large cash sums to transfer out, as it gets more expensive to cover their obligations. Steel pensions targeted by 'vultures' Pensions: Why your wages might go down The letter was obtained by Royal London, one of the UK's largest pension fund managers, following a freedom of information request. Sir Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London, said people were routinely offered 25 to 30 times their annual pension as a lump sum transfer value - but it could be as much as 40 times. This could mean that for a Â£10,000-per-year pension, someone could be offered anywhere between Â£250,000 and Â£400,000. The former pensions minister said such generous payouts might pose a risk if the pension scheme was in deficit, or if the employer faced financial difficulties. If large numbers of workers transferred out, he said, it could worsen the scheme's funding position and put other member's pots in jeopardy. ""I would hope that well-run pension schemes would be taking expert advice when deciding how much to offer to members wishing to transfer out,"" Sir Steve said. ""But the regulator's letter is a helpful reminder to all schemes that they need to be fair not only to those transferring out but also those left behind, especially where the scheme in question is in deficit."" In its letter, the Pensions Regulator said that transfers presented ""certain risks"" to members as they did not promise a guaranteed stream of income. It also told the schemes, which have not been named, that it was in the ""best financial interests"" of most members to stick with their defined benefit schemes. The costs of defined benefit schemes have risen as people live longer, and companies now tend to offer employees less generous defined contribution schemes. However, large numbers of current and former workers still rely on them. A spokesman for the Pensions Regulator said: ""Our primary concern is that defined benefit scheme members requesting a cash equivalent transfer value have all the information they need to make an informed decision about what is in their best interests. ""This includes understanding the fees that are charged under any new pension arrangement as these can make a significant difference to the value of the fund. ""As a result, we are working closely with the Financial Conduct Authority and The Pensions Advisory Service to provide an increased level of support to trustees and scheme members where there is uncertainty around the future of a defined benefit pension scheme. ""This includes providing letters for trustees to send members alerting them to the risks of transferring and giving practical information."" Reality Check: Are pensions on the brink?

"The UK has been training members of the Nigerian armed forces since 2015 The UK is to increase its military support to Nigeria to help protect its citizens and British workers in the country from terror attacks. The Nigerian armed forces will be given specialist equipment and training to counter the use of improvised explosive devices by Islamist insurgents. On a visit to Abuja, Theresa May said tackling the ""menace"" from groups like Boko Haram was in the UK's interest. She has also agreed a Â£10.5m package to help victims of modern slavery. As part of this, the UK will provide counselling to up to 1,700 people who have been subjected to forced labour, domestic servitude and sexual abuse and help them re-integrate into their communities. A joint initiative with France will also see the UK assist Nigeria and Niger strengthen their border cooperation to prevent trafficking of migrants to Libya and Europe. May's mission to woo Africa after Brexit PM seeks new jobs partnership with Africa May sticking by 'sensible' Brexit plans After talks with President Muhammadu Buhari in the nation's capital Abuja, Mrs May announced the two countries had signed a defence and security partnership which could see the UK train, for the first time, full army units to combat insurgents in the north-east of Nigeria. The UK, which has trained 30,000 Nigerian troops since 2015, will also help set up an emergency response mechanism, along the lines of the UK's Cobra crisis system, to deal with terror attacks while also stepping up efforts to tackle the propaganda spread by Islamic State-Daesh and other militant groups. ""We are determined to work side by side with Nigeria to help them fight terrorism, reduce conflict and lay the foundations for the future stability and prosperity that will benefit us all,"" Mrs May said. The prime minister heard from those working on the frontline of fighting human trafficking And spoke to two victims of modern slavery The PM also announced further co-operation on piracy, organised crime and human trafficking, including a new taskforce to help Nigeria recover stolen assets held in the UK. Labour's Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott said Mrs May's ""warm words"" rang hollow as her government had cut Border Force staff and police officers, who were ""the frontline in the fight against modern slavery"". Mrs May's three-day trip to Africa, which began in South Africa on Tuesday, is aimed at deepen economic and trade ties with growing African economies ahead of Britain leaving the EU in 2019. Mrs May said Brexit would increase opportunities to extend existing commercial links with Nigeria - the UK's second largest trading partner in Africa - particularly in the area of financial services. ""We offer, as the United Kingdom the important capacity the bring in the access to capital markets through the City of London together with professional service expertise with great private sector companies,"" she said. She has alreadyaannouncedÂ£4bn of extra British support for African economies and said she wanted the UK to overtake the US to become the G7's biggest investor in Africa by 2022.

""We are working for a good deal, we have put forward our proposal for a good deal,"" she said. ""I believe that deal is to the benefit, not only of the UK, but the EU."" By BBC Africa business editor Larry Madowo Nigeria is Britain's second largest trading partner in Africa, but should the country be so focused on the UK? Tunji Andrews, an economist based in Nigeria's commercial hub Lagos, believes Nigeria should concentrate more on its relationship with the European Union. ""The diversity of demand of the EU market makes it slightly more attractive. ""I think it's impossible not to look at the British market at this point, but I'll also say that while Britain remains a viable trade partner, it just doesn't hold the same value to Africa as China and to a lesser extent, the US."" Nigeria's top export to the UK is crude oil and its largest import is refined oil, a structural inefficiency that leads to regular fuel shortages as the populous West African nation lacks a properly functioning refinery.

"Teenagers who smoke and drink alcohol are causing visible damage to their arteries by the age of 17, a study has revealed. Tests showed stiffening of the arteries had begun by this relatively young age. These physical changes have been linked with an increased risk of heart and blood vessel problems, such as stroke and heart attack, in later life. But the study also found that the arteries of teenagers who stopped smoking or drinking returned to normal. The researchers studied data between 2004 and 2008 from 1,266 youngsters taking part in theAvon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC),,externalwhich charts the health of 14,500 families in the Bristol area. The study has been published in theEuropean Heart Journal.,external No alcohol safe to drink, global study confirms How one country persuaded teens to give up drink and drugs E-cigs lead teenagers to smoking, survey suggests Online music videos 'expose teens to smoking and drinking' The participants detailed their smoking and drinking habits at the ages of 13, 15 and 17 and tests were then done to discover if there had been any stiffening of their arteries. They had to report facts including: how many cigarettes they had smoked in their lifetime the age at which they started to drink alcohol Those who had smoked more than 100 cigarettes or tended to binge drink had a higher incidence of stiffened arteries than those who had smoked fewer than 20 cigarettes or had fewer than two drinks per day. Teenagers who took part in the study preferred to drink beer rather than wine or spirits The report's senior author, Prof John Deanfield, from the UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, said: ""We found that in this large contemporary British cohort, drinking and smoking in adolescence, even at lower levels compared to those reported in adult studies, is associated with arterial stiffening and atherosclerosis progression. ""However, we also found that if teenagers stopped smoking and drinking during adolescence, their arteries returned to normal - suggesting that there are opportunities to preserve arterial health from a young age."" Dr Marietta Charakida, who carried out the research at the UCL Institute of Cardiovascular Science, said: ""Injury to the blood vessels occurs very early in life as a result of smoking and drinking and the two together are even more damaging. ""Although studies have shown teenagers are smoking less in recent years, our findings indicated approximately one in five teenagers were smoking by the age of 17. ""In families where parents were smokers, teenagers were more likely to smoke.""

He said: ""It's never too late to make changes that may literally end up saving your life. ""This study suggests that the damage to arteries can occur even in the young, leading to serious trouble later on in life.

"This video can not be played ""I lost everything I ever had"" - Rex Wade was one of the last children to be sent away More than 100 Britons who were sent abroad as children under a resettlement scheme are to sue the UK government over the abuse they suffered. In March, an inquirysaid 2,000 survivors should receive financial compensationwithin 12 months. The victims' lawyer said the government ""has a legal responsibility for the harm suffered by those children"". Between 1945-70, some 4,000 children were separated from their families and sent to Australia and Zimbabwe. The Independent Inquiry Into Child Sex Abuse (IICSA) considered the children who were forcibly relocated in the post-war period. A scheme saw children from deprived backgrounds who were often already in social care - some as young as three years old -sent away with the promise of a better life. Overseen by government, and managed by charities and the church, it was part of a longstanding policy aimed at easing the strain on UK orphanages and strengthening the British population abroad. Victims say they went on to be sexually, emotionally and physically abused. A group of children from a school in Stevenage were among those to be sent to the Fairbridge school in Molong, Australia Rex Wade was one of the last children to be sent to Australia as part of the programme in 1970. At the age of 10, he was shipped from Cornwall with his brother to Tasmania. He says he was subjected to a punitive regime and was treated ""cruelly for any misdemeanour"", and that his tormentors would set a dog on him and other children if they misbehaved. ""It was physical, verbal and mental abuse,"" he says. ""I lost everything I ever had; the relationships I had with my family. It's a lot to deal with and you just don't get over it."" John Glynn, who was sent to a Christian Brothers institution in Western Australia when he was eight years old, is one of the 100 former migrants to bring the case forward. John Glynn does not believe the British government has done enough to get financial compensation to ageing victims of the UK's child migrant policy At the institution in Clontarf, he was told he was not loved by his family in Britain. Through his seven years with the Christian Brothers he was beaten brutally with a cane, and also sexually abused. ""As I get older it gets worse,"" the 74-year-old says. ""I think about that a lot now. They took my childhood from me. They took my country from me, my heritage."" By Tom Symonds Buildings at Bindoon were constructed by migrant children For several decades, the UK sent children across the world to new lives in institutions where many were abused and used as forced labour. It's a scandal that is still having repercussions now. Imagine the 1950s, in the years before air travel became commonplace or the internet dominated our lives.  Imagine being a child of those times, barely aware of life even in the next town.  An orphan perhaps, living in a British children's home. Now imagine being told that shortly you would board a ship for somewhere called Australia, to begin a new life in a sunlit wonderland. For good. No choice. Read the full article here (published February 2017) More than 130,000 children were shipped to Commonwealth countries from 1618 until 1970, to countries including Canada, New Zealand, Zimbabwe and Australia. The IICSA investigated the final 4,000 children sent to Australia and Zimbabwe. It found children suffered sexual and emotional abuse, as well as forced labour. Some were also wrongly told they were orphans, depriving them of the opportunity of meeting their birth parents. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We want to reassure those affected we are committed to providing a timely response to the Inquiry's recommendations."" But despite the recommendation in March, the government is yet to set up a compensation scheme for the surviving child migrants. BBC correspondent Sanchia Berg said many ""of the migrants feel time is running out"" as most are elderly, and some are frail. Since March, 14 of the survivors have died. Lawyer Alan Collins, who is representing the victims, said: ""The government needs to step up to the plate and bring into force its redress scheme. ""Compensation can never put matters right - that's impossible and it would be insulting to suggest otherwise. ""But it is action, it is a recognition that meets the words that have been spoken by the politicians."" In 2010, then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown apologised on behalf of the British government for sending British children abroad. Labour MP Lisa Nandy has criticised the government's lack of speed in setting up a service to offer financial compensation for victims. She said: ""Over the last six months we've had absolutely nothing - it took us even six weeks to find out which department was responsible [for financial compensation]."" She added the Australian government had successfully put together a commission for compensation a lot sooner, and ""enough is enough"".

"A letter from the nursing union lists concerns about the impact of Brexit Brexit poses an ""immediate risk to the provision of safe and effective care"" for patients in the UK, according to the Royal College of Nursing. The union has made the warning in a letter to leaders of the UK's main political parties on behalf of its 435,000 members. It also wants the parties to back a second referendum on any Brexit deal. A government spokeswoman said plans are in place to ensure patients receive the same standards of care after Brexit. The UK will leave the European Union on 29 March 2019. Brexit: All you need to know NHS to stockpile drugs for no deal Brexit NHS plans 'extensively' for no-deal Brexit In the letter, Maria Trewern, chair of council at the RCN, wrote: ""As the debate across our membership has made clear, the implications of Brexit for the health and care system will be numerous. ""There are risks that, if not credibly addressed, may damage population health, as well as severely impact on our members' ability to provide safe and effective care for their patients in both the short and the long term."" The letter warned that Brexit could exacerbate ongoing problems in the NHS, such as workforce sustainability. The union also said that it could have particular implications for nursing staff providing care in areas that interface between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, along with threats to fair employment practices, workers' rights and cross-border exchange of knowledge, research and skills. The letter said the union is backing a second referendum on any final deal for Brexit to ""give citizens the opportunity to make an informed choice and vote on decisions that will affect generations now and in the future"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said staff from the EU were a ""vital part of our NHS and social care workforce"" and will have ""an important role to play in the future of health and social care in this country"". She added: ""We are preparing for all situations, including a no-deal Brexit, and we have worked closely with partners to draw up contingency plans that will ensure patients continue to receive care in exactly the same way they do now.""

"Food prices and strong demand for summer products have caused shop prices to rise UK shop prices have risen for the first time in five years, according to the latest data from the British Retail Consortium (BRC). It said shop prices increased by 0.1% in August, breaking a cycle of 63 months when prices fell. It comes after food inflation jumped to a seven-month high of 1.9% after the recent heatwave, which hit crop yields. BRC warned of much steeper price rises if the UK quit the European Union without a trade deal. According to the trade group, non-food price deflation also slowed to 1% in August, down from 1.4% in July - its lowest level since 2013. It blamed strong demand for summer products earlier in the season, which reduced the need for discounting. However, this did not apply to clothing, where price deflation continued at the same rate as in July. Food prices 'to rise 5%' after hot weather UK inflation rate rises for first time since November The data follows warnings consumers could face a food ""price shock"" in the coming months due to this year's extreme weather. On Tuesday, consultancy CEBR said the winter cold spell, known as the Beast from the East, and summer heatwave, had pushed up wholesale prices of staples such as wheat, carrots and lettuce. It said this would feed through to shops, pushing up consumer food prices by 5% - the equivalent of about Â£7 per month per household. Farmers have also been impacted by rising costs of oil and agricultural products on global markets, according to the BRC. However, it said overall shop price inflation still remained well below the wider rate of consumer price inflation -  which currently stands at 2.5%. ""Despite significant increases in costs in the supply chain, this month's figures show that retailers are keeping price increases faced by consumers to a minimum,"" said the British Retail Consortium's chief executive Helen Dickinson OBE. ""However, current inflationary pressures pale in comparison to potential increases in costs retailers will face in the event the we leave the EU without a deal. If that does happen retailers will not be able to shield consumers from price increases.""

"This video can not be played French and British fishing fleets have come to blows over when they can catch scallops French and British fishermen have clashed in the English Channel in an escalating battle over scallops. About 40 French boats tried to stop five larger British boats from fishing 12 nautical miles (22km) off the Normandy coast, in the Bay of Seine. Fishing boats collided and stones were thrown, but no-one was injured. UK boats are entitled to fish in the scallop-rich area, but their presence has angered the French, who accuse the British of depleting shellfish stocks. Now UK fishermen are demanding government protection, while the French bewail the loss of a ""primary resource"". The French boats gathered overnight on Monday in protest against so-called British ""pillaging"". ""The French went to contact the British to stop them working and they clashed with each other,"" said Dimitri Rogoff, who heads the Normandy fishing committee. Scallop wars: Could Brexit calm troubled waters? The British were unable to match the local flotilla for numbers and were ultimately chased away. Two British boats, Golden Promise and Joanna C, returned to Brixham harbour with damaged windows. The crews alleged they had been were surrounded and had rocks and metal shackles thrown at them. A video on French media showed a Scottish scallop dredger, the Honeybourne 3, colliding with French vessels. A French local government spokesperson, Ingrid Parrot, said: ""Things were thrown on both sides - from the English and from the French. Both parties were extremely tense."" British boats are legally entitled to fish off the Normandy coast - but their French counterparts accuse them of ""pillaging"" Tension has rumbled for 15 years, but in the past five years a deal has prevailed - larger British boats stayed out of the area in exchange for more fishing rights. British boats can gather scallops year-round, but French law restricts the scallop fishing season to between 1 October and 15 May. ""For the Brits, it's an open bar - they fish when they want, where they want, and as much as they want,"" Mr Rogoff complained. ""We don't want to stop them from fishing, but they could at least wait until 1 October so that we can share. ""Scallops are a flagship product for Normandy, a primary resource and a highly sensitive issue."" Mike Park, chief executive of the Scottish White Fish Producers Association, described the clashing incident as ""clear piracy"". Speaking about the Scottish boat, he told BBC Scotland: ""He's fully entitled to be there. UK vessels can enter that French zone, it's not illegal. ""The Peterhead vessel is going about its business. The French vessels are probably attacking it."" Fears fishermen 'will not survive' Brexit no deal Fish thrown into Thames in Brexit deal protest World's fishing fleets mapped from orbit Appeals for calm were issued by Britain's National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, which said some boats had been filmed manoeuvring dangerously. ""We have raised the matter with the British government and asked for protection for our vessels, which are fishing legitimately,"" its chief executive, Barrie Deas, said. ""The deeper issues behind the clashes should be settled by talking around the table, not on the high seas where people could be hurt.""

"The study was carried out at a goat sanctuary in the UK Scientists have found that goats are drawn to humans with happy facial expressions. The result suggests a wider range of animals can read people's moods than was previously thought. The researchers showed goats pairs of photos of the same person, one of them featuring an angry expression, and the other a happy demeanour. The goats made a beeline for the happy faces, the team reports in the journal Royal Society Open Science. The result implies that the ability of animals to perceive human facial cues is not limited to those with a long history of working as human companions, such as dogs and horses. Instead, it seems, animals domesticated for food production, such as goats, can also decipher human facial cues. The study was carried out at the Buttercups Sanctuary for Goats in Kent, UK. Co-author Dr Alan McElligott, from Queen Mary, University of London, and colleagues set up pairs of black-and-white photos about 1.3m apart on one wall in their test area. Then, a goat would be let loose to explore the set-up. The researchers found that the goats strongly preferred the smiling faces, approaching the happy faces before acknowledging the angry photos. They also spent more time examining the smiling faces with their snouts. But the effect was only significant when the happy-faced photo was placed on the right-hand side. When the happy photos were placed on the left, the goats showed no significant preference either way. The researchers think this is because the goats are using one side of their brain to process the information - something that's seen in other animals. It could either be that the left side of the brain processes positive emotions, or that the right side of the brain is involved in avoidance of angry faces. See more stories and videos like this Dr McElligott, who is now based at the University of Roehampton, said: ""The study has important implications for how we interact with livestock and other species, because the abilities of animals to perceive human emotions might be widespread and not just limited to pets."" Co-author Natalia Albuquerque, from the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil, said: ""The study of emotion perception has already shown very complex abilities in dogs and horses. ""However, to date, there was no evidence that animals such as goats were capable of reading human facial expressions. Our results open new paths to understanding the emotional lives of all domestic animals."" The study could also have implications for animal welfare, helping change perceptions of these livestock animals by highlighting their sentience.

It comes after food inflation jumped to a seven-month high of 1.9% after the recent heatwave, which hit crop yields. BRC warned of much steeper price rises if the UK quit the European Union without a trade deal. According to the trade group, non-food price deflation also slowed to 1% in August, down from 1.4% in July - its lowest level since 2013. It blamed strong demand for summer products earlier in the season, which reduced the need for discounting. However, this did not apply to clothing, where price deflation continued at the same rate as in July. Food prices 'to rise 5%' after hot weather UK inflation rate rises for first time since November The data follows warnings consumers could face a food ""price shock"" in the coming months due to this year's extreme weather. On Tuesday, consultancy CEBR said the winter cold spell, known as the Beast from the East, and summer heatwave, had pushed up wholesale prices of staples such as wheat, carrots and lettuce. It said this would feed through to shops, pushing up consumer food prices by 5% - the equivalent of about Â£7 per month per household. Farmers have also been impacted by rising costs of oil and agricultural products on global markets, according to the BRC. However, it said overall shop price inflation still remained well below the wider rate of consumer price inflation -  which currently stands at 2.5%. ""Despite significant increases in costs in the supply chain, this month's figures show that retailers are keeping price increases faced by consumers to a minimum,"" said the British Retail Consortium's chief executive Helen Dickinson OBE. ""However, current inflationary pressures pale in comparison to potential increases in costs retailers will face in the event the we leave the EU without a deal. If that does happen retailers will not be able to shield consumers from price increases.""

"A letter from the nursing union lists concerns about the impact of Brexit Brexit poses an ""immediate risk to the provision of safe and effective care"" for patients in the UK, according to the Royal College of Nursing. The union has made the warning in a letter to leaders of the UK's main political parties on behalf of its 435,000 members. It also wants the parties to back a second referendum on any Brexit deal. A government spokeswoman said plans are in place to ensure patients receive the same standards of care after Brexit. The UK will leave the European Union on 29 March 2019. Brexit: All you need to know NHS to stockpile drugs for no deal Brexit NHS plans 'extensively' for no-deal Brexit In the letter, Maria Trewern, chair of council at the RCN, wrote: ""As the debate across our membership has made clear, the implications of Brexit for the health and care system will be numerous. ""There are risks that, if not credibly addressed, may damage population health, as well as severely impact on our members' ability to provide safe and effective care for their patients in both the short and the long term."" The letter warned that Brexit could exacerbate ongoing problems in the NHS, such as workforce sustainability. The union also said that it could have particular implications for nursing staff providing care in areas that interface between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, along with threats to fair employment practices, workers' rights and cross-border exchange of knowledge, research and skills. The letter said the union is backing a second referendum on any final deal for Brexit to ""give citizens the opportunity to make an informed choice and vote on decisions that will affect generations now and in the future"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said staff from the EU were a ""vital part of our NHS and social care workforce"" and will have ""an important role to play in the future of health and social care in this country"". She added: ""We are preparing for all situations, including a no-deal Brexit, and we have worked closely with partners to draw up contingency plans that will ensure patients continue to receive care in exactly the same way they do now.""

"Raneem Oudeh (left) and her mother, Khaola Saleem, were pronounced dead at the scene A woman who was stabbed to death with her mother was on the phone to police as she was attacked, detectives said. Raneem Oudeh, 22, and her mother Khaola Saleem, 49, were stabbed in a street in Solihull in the early hours of Monday. West Midlands Police are searching for Ms Oudeh's ex-partner Janbaz Tarin, 21, in connection with the deaths. Ms Oudeh made ""a number of calls"" to police on Sunday evening and the ""situation quickly escalated"" as police arranged to see her, the force said. Midlands Live: Nurse quits A&E over staffing safety fears; Dumped dog 'may have been used in fight' West Midlands Police did not directly answer claims in the Birmingham Mail that Miss Oudehrang police three times,externalin the hours before her death but officers did not immediately send an officer out. Clarifying ""speculation"" about the police contact, a force spokesman said: ""There were a number of calls from Ms Oudeh to police on Sunday evening and we tried to physically locate her but were unsuccessful. ""Contact was being made to arrange to see Miss Oudeh and it was during this conversation that the situation quickly escalated and the call handler immediately dispatched officers to the location in Northdown Road where they arrived within minutes."" The force has said it referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct as it had previous contact with the victims' family. Anyone who sees Janbaz Tarin has been asked not to approach him but to ring 999 immediately Officers rushed to Ms Saleem's house in Northdown Road, Solihull, shortly after 00:30 BST on Monday, but found the pair fatally wounded. Despite the efforts of emergency services neither could be saved. Mr Tarin, who is from Afghanistan, was Ms Oudeh's former partner but is not the father of her two-year-old son. Several addresses linked to Mr Tarin have been searched and computer equipment has been seized, along with mobile phones, for analysis. A suspected murder weapon has been recovered and a van has been seized for forensic examination, detectives said. Forensic examinations have taken place in Northdown Road Ms Oudeh and Mrs Saleem, who had five other children, were born in Syria.

"This video can not be played Katie Houghton says she self-harmed as a teenager to ""try and take control of feeling out of control"" More than a fifth of 14-year-old girls in the UK said they had self-harmed, a report suggests. A survey of 11,000 children found 22% of the girls and 9% of the boys said they had hurt themselves on purpose in the year prior to the questionnaire. Rates of self-harm were worst (46%) among those who were attracted to people of the same or both genders. The Children's Society report said,externalgender stereotypes and worries about looks were contributing to unhappiness. Willow Smith reveals she used to self-harm Self-harm rising among teenage girls Girls self-harm hospital figures double The self-harm statistics are included in the charity's annual Good Childhood Report, which examines the state of children's wellbeing in the UK. The data on self-harm was analysed by The Children's Society after being collected in 2015 in theMillennium Cohort Study,external, a continuing research project following the lives of 19,000 children born in the UK between 2000 and 2001. More than 11,000 of these children answered a questionnaire about whether they had hurt themselves on purpose in any way in the past year. Out of the 5,624 girls who responded, 1,237 said they had self-harmed. Self-harm is when people hurt themselves as a way of dealing with difficult feelings, painful memories or overwhelming situations and experiences. It can include everything from punching or hitting to cutting or burning. This video can not be played Beth: 'I started self-harming when I was 13' Based on the figures, The Children's Society estimates that 109,000 children aged 14 may have self-harmed across the UK during the 12-month period in 2015 - 76,000 girls and 33,000 boys. It follows NHS data released this month that showed the number of admissions to hospital of girls aged 18 and under for self-harm had almost doubled in two decades, from 7,327 in 1997 to 13,463 in 2017. The NSPCC says,externalcommon reasons for self-harming include: depression bullying pressure at school emotional abuse grieving having relationship problems with family or friends Matthew Reed, chief executive at The Children's Society, said: ""It is deeply worrying that so many children are unhappy to the extent that they are self-harming. ""Worries about how they look are a big issue, especially for girls, but this report shows other factors such as how they feel about their sexuality and gender stereotypes may be linked to their unhappiness."" An 18-year-old woman who used to self-harm said she had started aged 12 in an attempt to deal with painful or overwhelming feelings. She said: ""It quickly became an obsession. ""My self-harm problem caused me to lie to those who cared about me, time and time again, as I pushed away the people around me."" Self-harm was often ""romanticised"" on social media, which drew in the most vulnerable people, she said. But professional support had helped her to stop and develop healthy ways of coping with her problems. ""Recovery has changed my life. I am a person I never thought I could be with a bright future ahead of me - yet I know others who haven't received the help I did and are still battling. ""To those struggling, please talk to people you can trust - you can and will get through this."" A separate survey of 10- to 17-year-olds and their parents across 2,000 households, also included in The Children's Society report, found the children were unhappiest with school and their appearance. This research also suggests that boys and girls are often harmed by gender stereotypes. Those who felt boys should be tough and girls should have nice clothes were least happy with life. The report also suggests happy family relationships are the biggest positive influence on children's wellbeing. The Children's Society called on the government to make it a requirement for all secondary schools to offer access to a counsellor and have their mental health services assessed in Ofsted inspections. The Department of Health said it is investing an extra Â£300m to provide more mental health help in schools - including trained staff. A spokesperson said: ""We've extended our pilot scheme to deliver training in 20 more areas of the country this year to improve links between 1,200 schools and their mental health services."" The government added it will announce more on how it can improve mental health as part of its long-term plan for the NHS later this year. Emma Thomas, chief executive of Young Minds, said: ""Difficult experiences in childhood, like growing up in poverty or experiencing discrimination, can have a huge impact on mental health - but there are also new pressures that have emerged in recent years. ""The education system now places a greater emphasis than ever on exam results, while the rise of social media can make problems like bullying or body image issues more intense than they were in the past."" The Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said mental health was ""one of the biggest health epidemics of our time"" and strongly linked to social disadvantage. A spokesman added: ""This country's mental health crisis is not going to go away overnight but with appropriate action from government there is hope that fewer children will have mental health worries and be happier with their life as a result.""

"There has been a steep rise in reports of self-harm among girls aged 13 to 16, according to a study of data from GP practices across the UK. The BMJ study,external, which looked at figures from 2011-2014, said GPs could be getting better at picking up self-harm. But it was likely that rising stress and psychological problems in young people were also behind the trend. The NSPCC said giving children support early could be a matter of life or death. Since 2001, girls have had much higher rates of self-harm than boys - 37.4 per 10,000 compared with 12.3 in boys. While self-harm rates stayed constant among 10- to 12-year-olds and 17- to 19-year-olds, there was a 68% increase among 13- to 16-year-olds over the three-year period studied. This took the rate in girls from 45.9 per 10,000 in 2011 to 77 per 10,000 in 2014. The researchers, from the University of Manchester, looked at data for nearly 17,000 patients from more than 600 GP practices. Sophie Martin self-harmed as a teenager Sophie Martin began self-harming when she was 12 years old after being bullied at school. When her dad took her mum to court in a custody battle, she blamed herself. ""I thought it was my fault, I had to be punished for it. And that's when I started self-harming,"" she told BBC News. She said: ""It was a release, it was painful, but it made me feel better."" Things went from bad to worse for Sophie when she confided in her best friend about how she felt. ""She told her boyfriend at the time and then he posted it all over Facebook. That made the bullying worse,"" she said. After her mum found out what was happening, she went to see a GP but it was about a year before she could access mental health services. By that time she had moved schools and also felt like she was leaving her past behind. But a couple of years later, when a relationship broke down, she began self-harming again. The self-harm charityHarmless,externaltook her on and gave her one-to-one sessions with a psychologist. ""Talking to someone really helped.  You don't want to say to your mum 'I hate myself, I hate my body, I hate how I look',"" Sophie says. Two years on, things are looking up. She is now in her last year of a certificate in beauty therapy. ""I'm great now. My anxiety has really dropped. I still have the fear that I will relapse, sort of. ""That's why I like to keep Harmless there so I could message them straight away and say I need to see someone."" Nav Kapur, study author and professor of psychiatry and population health at the University of Manchester, said parents and young people should not be unduly alarmed by the findings. ""We know that for many young people things get better and they no longer hurt themselves as adults. ""But of course we must take self-harm seriously; it's important to understand its underlying causes."" The study also found that young people living in the most deprived areas were the least likely to be referred to specialist mental health services. Self-harm is seen as the biggest risk factor for subsequent suicide, which is now the second most common cause of death in the under-25s worldwide. The NSPCC charity said the figures were ""heart-breaking"". It held more than 15,000 counselling sessions about self-harm last year. ""Self-harm can often be an expression of a deeper problem, which is why early intervention services to support these children are vital. ""Without this, the consequences really can be a matter of life or death."" Tom Madders, director of campaigns at YoungMinds, said school stress, body-image issues, the pressure created by social media and difficult experiences in childhood could all have an impact on the mental health of teenage girls. He said: ""As a society, we also need to do more to prevent mental health problems from developing in the first place. ""To start with, we need to rebalance the education system, so that schools can prioritise wellbeing and not just academic performance.""

"The US territory has asked Congress for $139bn in recovery funds Officials in Puerto Rico now say 2,975 people died following Hurricane Maria - a devastating storm that struck the US island territory in September 2017. The revised death toll is nearly 50 times the previous estimate of 64. Governor Ricardo Rossello ""accepted"" the findings in a long-awaited independent investigation. The mayor of the capital, San Juan, accused the US government of deliberately downplaying the impact of the storm. Puerto Rico has struggled to repair its infrastructure and power grid since the storm, and is asking US Congress for $139bn (Â£108bn) in recovery funds. ""I'm giving an order to update the official number of deaths to 2,975,"" Governor Ricardo Rossello told reporters on Tuesday. ""Although this is an estimate, it has a scientific basis."" In a statement, the White House said the federal government supported the governor's efforts to ""ensure a full accountability and transparency of fatalities"" in the hurricane. President Donald Trump was criticised for praising the federal response to the hurricane-ravaged island in the weeks following the storm.Critics accused him of showing more concern for residents in Texas and Florida after they were hit by hurricanes. The authorities have faced criticism for underreporting the toll of Maria - the most powerful storm to hit the region in nearly 90 years. Until now, the official figure was 64 - even thoughthe island had previously acknowledged the death toll was probably much higher. In the wake of the disaster,some experts estimated as many as 4,600 deaths. This video can not be played Months after Maria, many on this US island still suffered in the dark The latest findings - accepted by the island's authorities - were made in a report,externalby experts from George Washington University, which the governor commissioned. The government's initial number was for those killed directly by the hurricane, crushed by collapsing buildings, drowned or hit by flying debris. But the new report also counted those who died in the six months following the storm as a result of poor healthcare provision and a lack of electricity and clean water. Repeated power cuts also led to an increased number of deaths from diabetes and sepsis. Total blackout hits 3.4m Puerto Ricans Six graphics that sum up Puerto Rico disaster Puerto Rico profile ""This shows the magnitude of the catastrophe,"" Governor Rossello told El Nuevo Dia newspaper. When asked why his government was unable to recognise a higher death toll until now, he replied: ""I am not perfect. I make mistakes. Now, hindsight tends to be 20-20."" He echoed one finding in the report - that doctors ""lacked awareness"" on how to appropriately certify deaths attributed to natural disasters. ""The responsibility for adjudicating the cause of deaths rested with the doctors,"" Mr Rossello said. ""But unfortunately there was no formal process to prepare them for this kind of devastation. ""At that moment, that was the number [of deceased] that we had and today we have the evidence which indicates the number was definitely higher."" San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz told the BBC that there had been ""neglect"" by the Trump administration and some local officials hadn't wanted to confront the president about the need for more aid. ""It seemed like it was better to dance to President Trump's tune than to tell the truth that we were all seeing."" she said. ""I did was I thought ought to be done as I screamed, literally, out of the top of my lungs to say 'We're dying here' and the bureaucracy and the inefficiency of the federal government was killing us."" Gary O'Donoghue, BBC Washington correspondent For close to a year, Puerto Rico's government has clung to the idea that 64 people died as a result of Maria. That figure was always risible - particularly when you consider that the 150 mph (241 km/h) winds caused around $90bn worth of damage and left households for, on average, 84 days without electricity; 64 days without water and 41 days without cellular telephone coverage. In truth, the new official number is still an estimate - based on mortality data and taking into account historical data on migration patterns. But the official recognition will allow the island to move on and focus fully on rebuilding its infrastructure and extracting the tens of billions of dollars needed from Congress to give the three million inhabitants of this already bankrupt territory something of a future. Researchers tracked the number of deaths using death certificates and other mortality data between mid-September 2017 to mid-February of this year. This video can not be played Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico wasn't a ""real catastrophe like Katrina"", Trump told officials in the US territory last year The Caribbean island is home to 3.3 million people, some 8% of which have since left the island, the study said. It also said that those from poorer backgrounds in Puerto Rico were 45% more likely to have been killed in the aftermath of the hurricane. The governor said he would sign an executive order to create a committee to examine and put into practice the report's recommendations. Puerto Rico has been reeling ever since the storm struck - with residents still suffering blackouts, broken infrastructure and a lack of services. Hurricane Maria caused the largest blackout in US history,external, according to research consultancy the Rhodium Group. It is ranked as the third most financially costly cyclone in US history since 1900, yet its death toll is a third higher than the costliest - Hurricane Katrina in 2005, with an estimated 1,833. What is Trump's plan for Puerto Rico? Trump lashes out at hurricane plea mayor Trump puts Puerto Rico on notice over aid The new study raises questions about President Trump's response to the disaster. During a visit in October, Mr Trump had suggested officials should be ""proud"" the death toll - at the time only 16 - was not as high as ""a real catastrophe"" like Katrina.
