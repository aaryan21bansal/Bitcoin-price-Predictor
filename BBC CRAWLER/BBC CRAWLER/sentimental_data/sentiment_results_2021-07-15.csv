"This video can not be played Richard Gnodde is the boss of Goldman Sachs International Bankers returning on Monday to Goldman Sachs' Â£1bn London head office will be required to wear masks in the building despite the easing of government rules. However, unlike some competitors, Goldman will not require staff to be vaccinated to come into work. It hopes 70% of UK staff will return to the office in the coming weeks. The boss of Goldman Sachs International Richard Gnodde said the company remained as committed to its London head office as ever. Mr Gnodde told the BBC: ""The centre of gravity for our workforce is going to be in our buildings and it will be in this building. ""Our focus is very much on securing a safe workplace. People will still be wearing masks in the building."" He said the bank would not insist on people being vaccinated in order to come in, nor would they force people to return if they felt uncomfortable doing so: ""[We will] continue to manage our exit from this in a cautious and appropriate way to make sure that our people feel comfortable."" Goldman bankers ordered to disclose vaccine status Firms don't plan to rush back to offices on Monday Financial services is a crown jewel in the UK economy and contributes 12% of all taxes paid in the UK. Since the Brexit vote, more than Â£1tn of customer and company money, trillions more in transaction volumes and an estimated 8,000 jobs have left the capital. This has left some questioning whether that crown was in danger of slipping. On the day real royalty in the shape of Prince Charles visited Goldman's offices, Mr Gnodde told the BBC that the future for London remains bright. ""We put this building in place through the Brexit period and it really underscores our confidence that London will remain one of the world's leading financial centres,"" Mr Gnodde said. ""There has been some movement of assets. So you know, that has gone. And our access to the European market is not as free as it used to be. We have to build and create new opportunities."" Richard Gnodde said the company remained committed to its London head office But there was also a thinly disguised warning. Creating those opportunities will need the help of the government and regulators to keep London competitive with other international centres. Mr Gnodde thinks that lessons can be learnt from the big bank deregulation of financial services in 1985. ""The UK was unambiguously supportive of financial services - it was crystal clear. I really want to stress this point - certainty -  in terms of support for business is absolutely key. ""And it has to be consistent. You can't support business on Monday and Tuesday, and then criticise it on a Wednesday and Thursdayâ¦ that sends a confusing message. Certainty is critical."" When City bosses talk about competitiveness, it's often code for lighter regulation. Outside the EU, many have called for a bonfire of regulation. If Mr Gnodde had the match which bits would he burn? ""Eliminate duplication and unnecessary excessive reporting. Let's do what we have to do to have effective regulation. But let's cut out some of the bureaucratic elements to enable firms to use their capital resources efficiently."" Some traders have been working in Canary Wharf during the pandemic Doing more business with the fastest growing parts of the globe means grappling with the economic might of China. How complicated could that be when Chinese firms are being booted out of telecoms infrastructure, democracy in Hong Kong is under assault and China is facing allegations of using forced labour of the Uyghur population? ""I think this this is a multifaceted relationship,"" he answered. ""I think our relationship with China, in many ways will be as a partner. If we're going to tackle climate change, we're going to have to do this together. We live on the same planet. They will be a customer and a client of many of our businesses. And then absolutely, we should have the right appropriate conversations on the political arena in the areas where we compete."" It's a big world out there with plenty of opportunity - and while Mr Gnodde accepts the UK outside the EU is arguably a smaller fish, that's not necessarily an bad thing. ""Sometimes being a smaller fish is an advantage. Your level of paranoia goes up - you need to move to innovate, to create. Look over the last century and the issues that this country has been through and we're absolutely confident that the people of Britain will take it forward again."" Statements like that will be sure to help mend a sometime fractious relationship between the City and the government over the past few years.

"The UK is ""not out of the woods yet"" and people should act with caution as Covid restrictions in England end on Monday, Prof Chris Whitty has said. England's chief medical officer warned that Covid hospitalisations were doubling every three weeks and could hit ""scary numbers"" in future. Prof Whitty said the pandemic still had a ""long way to run in the UK"". Solicitor General Lucy Frazer said while cases will rise, there were ""consequences for not opening up"". But she warned: ""Of course, if we get into a situation where it is unacceptable and we do need to put back further restrictions, then that of course is something the government will look at."" It comes as: the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimated 577,700 people in the community had Covid in Englandin the week ending 10 July - equal to one in 95 people the UK recorded almost 50,000 new cases on Thursday - the highest daily number since January more than half a million self-isolation alertswere sent to people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales during the first week of July - a rise of 46% on the previous week Meat processorswarned of product shortages due to staff absences, driven by ""pings"" sent from the app The ONS figures for England represent a rise on the previous week, when one in 160 people were estimated to have the virus. Prof Whitty told an online seminar hosted by the Science Museum on Thursday evening that the situation in the UK could become very dangerous for individual hospitals. He said: ""I don't think we should underestimate the fact that we could get into trouble again surprisingly fast. ""I think saying the numbers in hospital are low now, that does not mean the numbers will be low in hospital in five, six, seven, eight weeks' time. ""They could actually be really quite serious."" Where will I need to keep wearing a mask... and why? How are Covid rules changing on Monday? Sainsbury's and Tesco to encourage mask-wearing He added: ""We've still got 2,000 people in hospital and that number is increasing. If we double from 2,000 to 4,000 from 4,000 to 8,000, 8,000 and so on it doesn't take many doubling times until you're in very, very large numbers indeed."" While Prof Whitty cautioned ""we are not by any means out of the woods yet"", he added that ""we are in much better shape due to the vaccine programme, and drugs, and a variety of other things"". ""But this has got a long way to run in the UK, and it's got even further to run globally,"" he said. Prof Whitty warned the doubling rate could see the situation become dangerous for individual hospitals But Prof Whitty said it was crucial that from 19 July in England, people ""take things incredibly slowly"" - adding that he anticipated most people would still take precautions. ""If you look over what people have done, and in fact if you look at what people intend to do now, people have been incredibly good at saying, 'I may be a relatively low risk, but people around me are at high risk, and I'm going to modify my behaviours, I'm going to reduce my contacts, I'm going to improve ventilation...',"" he said. From 19 July,almost all legal restrictions on social contact will be removed in England, but some guidance will remain. Different rules apply in the the rest of the UK. Nightclubs will be allowed to reopen for the first time since March last year and capacity limits will be removed for all venues and events. There will no longer be any limits on how many people can meet and the 1m-plus distancing rule will also end. The legal requirement to wear face coverings in some enclosed public places will expire, but Health Secretary Sajid Javid has previously said masks would still be ""expected and recommended"" in crowded indoor areas. But the UK's two largest supermarkets - Tesco and Sainsbury's -have said they will continue to ask shoppers to wear masks from Mondayto protect staff and shoppers. NHS Covid app pings more than 500,000 in a week Covid staff shortage could shut meat production Should I be working at home or going to the office? Prof Whitty predicted that in the medium term, coronavirus could mutate into a ""vaccine escape variant"" that could take the UK ""some of the way backwards"" into the worst days of the pandemic. ""The further out in time we go, the more tools we have at our disposal from science, the less likely that is but you can never take that possibility completely off the table,"" he said. ""But you know, science has done a phenomenal job so far and it will continue to do so."" Prof Whitty's comments echo his statements at Monday's Downing Street coronavirus briefing where Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed the final stage of unlocking in England would take place on 19 July. The chief medical officer said the ""overwhelming view"" of the scientific community was that moving ""slowly"" through the next step of easing restrictions was ""essential"". He added that while the numbers of people being admitted to hospital with Covid were ""not trivial"", they were rising at a much lower rate than previous waves. Explaining the government's approach, Ms Frazer told Sky News: ""It is really important that we get the balance right between ensuring that we keep this virus under control and we take the necessary clinical measures to do that, but that we also recognise that there are consequences of not opening up and not allowing people to go about their daily lives."" She added that ""a large number of people have been vaccinated, we've had a really tough time, we're still asking people to take responsibility and we do need to ask ourselves, if we don't open up now, when will we be able to open up?"" On Thursday, the UK recorded new 48,553 new infections and a further 63 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Delta virus variant cases rose by 17% in the latest week, with a further 36,800 recorded, Public Health England (PHE) said. The variant continues to account for approximately 99% of confirmed cases of coronavirus across the UK. The ONS estimated one in 90 people in Scotland had the virus in the week to 10 July, one in 360 in Wales, and one in 290 in Northern Ireland.

"More than half a million isolation alerts were sent to people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales during the first week of July. Some 530,126 alerts telling people to self-isolate were sent in the week to 7 July, a 46% rise on the previous week. One union has warned factories are on the verge of shutting because of staff shortages, withNissan and Rolls Royce the latest firms to raise concerns. The UK has recorded another 48,553 daily coronavirus cases. Cases have increased 32.6% over the last week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously warned there could be 50,000 cases a day by 19 July - when most legal restrictions are due to end in England. Latest government figures,externalalso show a further 63 Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts NHS Covid app: Should it stay or should it go? What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? Alerts are sent through the NHS Covid app to tell individuals they have been in close contact with a positive coronavirus case. Anyone alerted is advised to self-isolate for 10 days. Social distancing rules are being lifted in England on Monday, leading to concerns about a bigger rise in the number of alerts. The latest figures show that 520,194 alerts were sent in England in the week to 7 July, with another 9,932 sent in Wales. Unite said hundreds of employees were off work at some sites, with the app causing ""havoc"" on production lines. Assistant general secretary Steve Turner said it was no exaggeration to say factories were on the verge of shutting and that at some sites hundreds of staff are off work. ""It is clear that something has to be done in time for July 19, or else people will simply start deleting the app en masse to avoid isolation notices,"" he said. Steve Robinson, chief executive of homecare company Prama, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that around a quarter of his staff were currently off work after being ""pinged"". He said he was currently offering three times the normal salary to cover emergency shifts. Tim Moran, who runs cold supply chain company Lineage Logistics' UK division, said he had more staff absent than at any point during the pandemic and it meant the firm couldn't meet the demand to deliver food to customers. Prof Lucy Easthope, who advises the government on disaster planning, said the issue of staff shortages because of the app hadn't come as a surprise. She told the PM programme: ""We feared we would see in some workforces 80% absenteeism. There will come a point where we simply can't operate like that, particularly around things like food production."" She said she knew of some companies advising people not to have the app, which she said was in its ""death throes"". ""The app is not the way to do this now. It has always been that we should have had local contact tracing through public health and that now needs to be properly resourced."" Despite the rise in the number of people getting ""pinged"" - data from the most recent week showed the most downloads of the app (342,483) since the seven days to 6 June (393,842). It has already been announced that from 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated in England will no longer have to self-isolate after close contact with someone who tests positive. The BBC has been told the team behind the app has been askedto adjust the measurements that trigger the alerts so that fewer are sent out- although the time frame for the change is not yet known. However, the Department of Health and Social Care said that while the sensitivity of the app was kept under constant review there were no plans to change its sensitivity at this time. Other reasons people have to self-isolate include if they test positive, live with someone who tests positive, or are told to do so by contact tracers. People in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own). If you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid and share the information with the app. The app uses Bluetooth readings to infer if you had recently been within 2m of them for at least 15 minutes. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. Meanwhile, the UK's two largest supermarkets - Tesco and Sainsbury's - have said they will continue to ask shoppers to wear masks when the legal requirement to do so in England is dropped on Monday. The government has said it ""expects and recommends"" shoppers in England to wear face masks from Monday. But the legal requirement to cover your face in enclosed spaces will end. Different rules apply in the devolved nations. And the government has been criticised over itsdecision to add Bulgaria and Croatia to its green travel list from Monday- but not give Foreign Office approval for travel to the countries. The decision to allow people to travel there without isolating on return was announced on Wednesday, but the government's travel advice pages for both countries currently states that it  ""advises against all but essential travel"". Government travel advice affects operators' and passengers' insurance. Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said not aligning Foreign Office travel advice with government travel policies was causing ""huge confusion for passengers and carriers"".

"Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for more access and transparency The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has urged China to be more co-operative with the WHO's second phase of the investigation into the origins of Covid-19. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus called for more access and transparency. The first phase of the WHO's investigation ended in February. It concluded that it was highly unlikely that the virus came from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, and that it probably originated in bats. Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, Dr Tedros said the WHO needed access to raw patient data from just before and the start of the pandemic this time around. China did not share this data with the WHO team during the first investigation, he added. He also called for clear information about the laboratory in Wuhan, stating that as a medical professional himself, he knew accidents could happen. This was the strongest indication yet that the WHO is still considering the lab leak theory, despite its experts saying this was unlikely, the BBC's Imogen Foulkes reports from Geneva. Speculation about a leak at the Wuhan Institute of Virology - one of China's top virus research labs - began last year and was propagated by former US President Donald Trump. Dr Tedros also warned against the idea that the pandemic was coming to an end. The WHO's emergency committee said that new and more dangerous variants were expected to spread around the world. ""The pandemic is nowhere near finished,"" the committee warned in a statement. Committee chairman Didier Houssin said ""we are still running after this virus and the virus is still running after us"". Coronavirus-linked deaths in Africa surged by 43% in the space of a week, driven by a lack of intensive-care beds and oxygen, according to the WHO.

"This video can not be played Angela Merkel has worked with four US presidents in 16 years The US and Germany will stand together against Russian aggression, President Joe Biden said as he welcomed outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel to Washington. Mr Biden said he had voiced concern to Mrs Merkel over a Russia-to-Germany gas pipeline, but they agreed Moscow cannot be allowed to use energy as a weapon. The US president said the two allies also opposed anti-democratic actions by China. Mrs Merkel, who has worked with four US presidents, is leaving office. ""We stand together and will continue to stand together to defend our eastern flank allies at Nato against Russian aggression,"" Mr Biden told Thursday's joint news conference with Mrs Merkel. He acknowledged the two did not see eye to eye on the nearly complete $11bn (Â£8bn) Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline. The White House has said it will be used by Russia as leverage over Ukraine and other neighbours. ""Good friends can disagree,"" said Mr Biden, who recently waived sanctions against Nord Stream 2. The US president also said: ""We will stand up for democratic principles and human rights when we see China or any other country working to undermine free and open societies."" Despite being strong trade partners, Berlin has at times been critical of Beijing on the issue of human rights. Mr Biden also told reporters the US had no plans ""at the moment"" to send troops to Haiti amid growing unrest after the assassination of its president. Asked about ongoing protests in Cuba, Mr Biden said the ""failed state"" was repressing its citizens. ""Communism is a failed system, a universally failed system,"" he said. ""And I don't see socialism as a very useful substitute."" Protests prompt Cuba to lift import tax on food Ex-soldiers 'knew of plot to kill Haiti president' Both leaders emphasised the amicable nature of their hour-long meeting, with Mrs Merkel referring more than once to her host as ""Dear Joe"". Mr Biden told his guest: ""I will miss seeing you at our summits."" Mrs Merkel expressed ""sympathy"" for the dozens of people killed by heavy flooding back home in Germany.

"Staff absences could see shortages of meat products, the industry has warned. Meat processors are seeing up to one in 10 of their workforce told to self-isolate by the NHS Covid app. Some companies could be forced âto start shutting down production lines all together,â warned Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA). As Covid cases exceed 250,000 a week, a growing number of businesses are reporting disruption due to absence. The UK meat processing industry employs about 97,000 workers in the UK, but it was suffering from shortages before the pandemic began. Many firms were operating with 10% fewer staff than they needed. The latest increase in absences has added to the problem. âAs a result, companies are having to simplify down their range of products to compensate for key skills being removed from their production lines,â says Mr Allen. âIf the UK workforce situation deteriorates further, companies will be forced to start shutting down production lines all together.â The BMPA represents about 90% of the industry by value of production. Should I be working at home or going to the office? Nissan and Rolls-Royce hit as staff told to isolate NHS Covid app: Should it stay or should it go? Where will I need to keep wearing a mask... and why? The first products to be hit could be the cuts which require more work from skilled butchers, such as French-trimmed lamb chops with the fat removed, according to Mr Allen. These are also among the most profitable lines for processors, so the financial impact could be significant. Mr Allen called for greater clarity about how long to isolate for when pinged by the app and continued access for business to free Covid testing kits, which is due to end on 19 July. Businesses are warning of increasing levels of Covid absence, as the current wave of infections grows. The number of people notified by the app in England and Wales recently passedhalf a million in a single week. Lord Bilimoria, president of the CBI - which represents 190,000 businesses - said that number came as a ""genuine shock."" ""Staff shortages are being felt acutely across all sectors and in all areas of business particularly, hospitality and leisure,"" he said. Lord Bilimoria believes the NHS Test and Trace system needs an ""overhaul"" and is calling on the government to ""urgently"" bring forward its plans to allow double-jabbed individuals not to self-isolate if they have been informed by the app that they have come into contact with a Covid positive individual. Earlier this month, Health Secretary Sajid Javid warned that the number of cases could hit 100,000 a day - more than double the current level. Car-makersNissan and Rolls-Roycehave warned that production could be affected by large numbers of staff being told to isolate and UK Hospitality, the trade body for bars and restaurants,said it was causing âcarnageâ among its members. From 16 August,the rules in England will changeso that anyone who has had two vaccinations will not be required to self-isolate if the app says they have been in close contact with an infected person. Post-Brexit recruitment difficulties have made staffing problems worse in the meat processing industry, with some firms drawing 80% of their staff from the European Union, according to Mr Allen. âWeâve been calling on the government for months to add butchers to the Shortage Occupation List, which would allow the industry to temporarily fill these growing vacancies with overseas workers until the current crisis has passed,â he said.

"Police have appealed for dashcam footage A number of people are believed to have died in a motorway crash involving two lorries and several cars, police have said. It happened on the northbound carriageway of the A1(M) at Bowburn, between Bradbury and Carrville, County Durham, at 18:20 BST. The motorway has been closed in both directions. Appealing for dashcam footage of the crash, Durham Police said there ""appear to have been fatalities"". The North East Ambulance Service said it was ""incredibly busy"" dealing with the crash, which it warned could lead to delays in attending other emergencies in the area. Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service said it had taken more than an hour to put out the lorry fire. Seven crews, including Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service's Heavy Rescue Unit, had been sent to the site, it said. ""On arrival at the scene crews were faced with a multi-vehicle collision across both carriageways and a heavy goods vehicle well alight,"" a spokesperson said. The Great North Air Ambulance was also deployed to transport casualties.

"This video can not be played Government proposals on the legacy of the past will ""draw a line under the Troubles"" - PM The government has confirmed it intends to bring forward legislation to ban all prosecutions related to the Troubles. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said the legacy proposals would allow Northern Ireland to ""draw a line under the Troubles"". Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told Parliament it was a decision not taken lightly. Some victims' groups and Stormont's executive parties have expressed opposition to the proposals. However, Mr Lewis said it was ""the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation"". In his Commons statement, he outlined a ""statute of limitations, to apply equally to all Troubles-related incidents"". It is understood it would apply to former members of the security forces as well as ex-paramilitaries. A statute of limitations is a law which prevents legal proceedings being taken after a certain period of time. The plans also include an end to all legacy inquests and civil actions related to the conflict. The government's paper makes no mention of what might happen to cases currently before the courts. This video can not be played ""A painful recognition of where we are"" - NI Secretary Brandon Lewis Mr Lewis said: ""We know that the prospect of the end of criminal prosecutions will be difficult for some to accept, and this is not a position that we take lightly. ""But we have arrived at the view that this would be the best way to facilitate an effective information retrieval and provision process, and the best way to help Northern Ireland move further along the road to reconciliation. ""It is a painful recognition of the reality of where we are."" Political reaction to PM's Troubles prosecutions plan Mr Lewis said that the proposals also include a body to help families recover information on Troubles incidents and an oral history initiative. ""Ongoing litigation processes often fail to deliver for families and victims, and their continued presence in a society which is trying to heal from the wounds of its past risks preventing it being able to move forward,"" he said. In terms of ""drawing a line"", this is incredibly far-reaching. It goes beyond a ban on Troubles-era prosecutions, of which there have been just nine in the past six years. Ending legacy inquests and civil actions is arguably of greater impact when you consider the figures. Currently, there around 36 inquests relating to the Troubles due to be heard. Many of these relate to killings by the Army and police. Alongside this, there are more than 1,000 civil claims lodged against the Ministry of Defence and other state agencies. The government is proposing all this is closed down in a new approach which is sweeping in scope. However, the opposition is loud. The Irish government says it is not a fait accompli or a done deal. But with a big majority at Westminster, the government has set off in a direction of travel which few predict will be reversed. Northern Ireland's five main political parties, the Irish government and several victims' groups have been highly critical of any suggested blanket ban on prosecutions for Troubles-era offences. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said a meeting of the Stormont Party Leaders Forum is expected to take place with Mr Lewis on Friday. He said he hoped the parties would use it to express their joint opposition to the proposals. Earlier, the prime minister defended the government's plans as ""measured and balanced"". Boris Johnson told MPs: ""The sad fact remains that there are many members of the armed services who continue to face the threat of vexatious prosecutions well into their 70s and 80s. ""We are finally bringing forward a solution to this problem, to enable the people of Northern Ireland to draw a line under the Troubles and to enable the people of Northern Ireland to move forward."" A statute of limitations would end all prosecutions in Troubles-related cases Prior to the announcement, Northern Ireland's largest cross-community victims' group, Wave, said ""victims and survivors should not be treated this way"". It added that if Mr Lewis ""is serious about effectively dealing with legacy he must talk to those most impacted by pain and trauma"". Reports that the secretary of state was to announce a plan to end Troubles prosecutions also angered relatives of the1974 Birmingham pub bombings. Julie Hambleton, whose sister Maxine, was among 21 people killed in the IRA bomb attacks, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to protest against the reported proposal. ""At what point did your government lose all sight of its moral, ethical and judicial backbone?â¯,"" Ms Hambleton's letter asks. Two IRA bombs exploded at the Mulberry Bush and the Tavern in the Town in Birmingham in November 1974 John Teggart, whose father Danny was one of the victims of the Ballymurphy shootings in 1971, said the proposals were a ""slap in the face"" for victims. ""It dances on the graves of all our loved ones and all those who affected in the conflict,"" he told BBC News NI's Evening Extra. Serena Hamilton, whose father Cpl David Graham was an Ulster Defence Regiment soldier killed by the IRA in Coalisland, County Tyrone, in 1977, said she was ""absolutely disgusted"". ""How can you move forward when you haven't got justice in the first place for such heinous crimes that happened to the likes of my father?,"" she asked on Evening Extra. Lord Dannatt, a former Army chief, who served in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, said the proposals represented the ""least worst option"" and offered families a way to get answers about what happened. ""There is now a mechanism where questions can be asked, facts can be ascertained and they will be able to get some degree of closure in knowing what happened because the people answering those questions, whether they're paramilitaries or retired soldiers, will be able to answer those questions truthfully and honestly without the fear of being prosecuted and dragged through the courts."" Amnesty International rejected the proposals as showing an ""appalling and offensive disregard for victims"". Its Northern Ireland campaign manager, Grainne Teggart, said: ""Many victims are having their worst fears realised in these proposals, the government is closing down paths to justice."" Ian Simpson, from the Northern Ireland Veterans' Association, said ""today is a shameful day"". He continued: ""Today, the veterans and innocent victims have been betrayed to the uttermost by Boris Johnson and the British government. ""People who held the line in Northern Ireland, who gave us peace in Northern Ireland, have been put on a pedestal with terrorists, people who went out on a daily basis to murder and to maim."" The government statement followed significant recent developments in a number of high-profile Troubles prosecution cases. In May,two former paratroopers were acquitted of the 1972 murder of Official IRA man Joe McCann after their trial collapseddue to the inadmissibility of prosecution evidence. Joe McCann was shot near his home in the Markets area of Belfast in April 1972 Both soldiers had been interviewed by a police legacy unit, the Historical Enquiries Team (HET), in 2010 and it was that evidence which formed a substantial part of the prosecution's case. But the judge ruled that evidence inadmissible and as the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) did not appeal against that decision, the case could not proceed. Then, earlier this month, the McCann murder trial collapse had implications for two other high-profile cases - the Bloody Sunday trial and the prosecution for the murder of 15-year-old Daniel Hegarty. What happened on Bloody Sunday? Why did prosecutors drop cases against ex-soldiers? The PPS met the families of Daniel Hegarty and two men killed on Bloody Sunday to explain that given ""related evidential features"" to the McCann case, prosecutors no longer believed there was a reasonable prospect that key evidence against the soldiers accused of their loved one's murders would be ruled admissible. The Bloody Sunday case was due to be formally dismissed in court last week, but instead it was adjourned following a legal challenge by a brother of one of the men shot dead on Bloody Sunday.

"Face masks will continue to be law in most places for months to come in Wales People travelling into Wales from England will be told to wear face masks by rail companies, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Face coverings continue to be mandatory on public transport and in shops in Wales, while in England people will just be advised to wear them. Mr Drakeford said it would be ""simpler"" if the same face-mask rules were applied across the whole of the UK. It comes after he announcedmajor changes to Covid rules in Wales. The legal requirement to wear a face covering in shops, public transport and other enclosed public spaces in Englandwill end on Monday, with the UK government only advising people to wear masks. The majority of Covid rules in Wales are set to be scrapped from 7 August, as the nation moves into alert level zero. However, face masks will still be legally required in shops and most indoor public places, meaning greater rules will exist here than over the border in England. Where do I have to wear a face mask? Speaking on ITV's Good Morning Britain on Thursday, Mr Drakeford said it would be ""simpler and clearer for everybody"" if the UK government were to ""bring itself in line"" with Wales and Scotland on face coverings. ""I think it will be difficult for people in England to know exactly what is required of them,"" he added. Transport for Waleshas already said it will ask passengers travelling cross-border to continue to wear masks. Earlier on Thursday, speaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Drakeford said public transport companies would ""make sure that people are aware that when travelling in Wales different rules apply"". From Saturday, the numbers of people who are able to meet up indoors and outdoors will increase as Wales moves ""fully"" into alert level one. The Welsh government previously took the decision to hold back on some parts of the level one unlocking four weeks ago due to the rise in cases because of the more transmissible Delta variant. Social distancing laws in Wales outdoors will be scrapped, meaning people will be able to go within two metres of people they do not live with - or who are not in their extended households - without breaking Covid laws. However, while this means people will be able to hug many friends - as long as they do so outside - for the first time in months, the Welsh government has urged people to ""exercise caution"" when getting close to those they do not live with. ""Coronavirus is still circulating in the community and we would encourage everyone to think about how they can protect themselves and their loved ones,"" they said. Also on Saturday, changes to indoor rules mean any six people will be able to meet in a private home - meaning people can eat together and stay overnight and go on holiday together. These people do not have to be in your extended household. Social distancing laws are set to end on 7 August, when Wales is set to move into its current lowest level of Covid restrictions - known as alert level zero - dependant on the public health situation. Instead, businesses will be left to decide if they still need to keep customers and workers apart through risk assessment, and to bring in their own measures, such as social distancing and queuing systems, and increased ventilation. This video can not be played Covid: What are the latest rules to be relaxed? However, cafe and business owners toldBBC Radio Walesthey were concerned the Welsh government was asking them to make decisions which affected people's health. Health Minister Eluned Morgan said it was not asking pub landlords and other business owners to be ""doctors"" and there were ""clear guidelines"" to help them set rules. ""Most places have been doing these measures since the beginning of the pandemic... what they need to do is to make sure those rules are known to those people who work there... or who want to enter those premises,"" she said. She dismissed claims that not having set rules could cause confusion, saying she was sure ""people will act responsibly"" when thinking about changes. While face masks will remain mandatory in shops and many other public places, from 7 August people will not have to wear them in pubs, restaurants and cafes. Ms Morgan said this was because people already had to take masks off to eat and drink and the rules were to protect the most vulnerable people in society who still had to go to the supermarket. ""The big difference between going to shops is that a lot of people don't have any choice and they have to go to shops in order to make sure they are going to be able to eat,"" she said.

"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Levelling up is not a jam-spreading exercise"" Boris Johnson has set out the ""skeleton"" of a plan to ""level up"" the country, by spreading power and opportunity more evenly. In a speech in Coventry, the PM insisted his flagship policy will not make the ""rich parts"" of the UK poorer but would be a ""win win"" for everyone. He also pledged to hand more power to local leaders, with the possibility of elected mayors for counties. Labour described Mr Johnson's speech as ""gibberish nonsense"". The party's deputy leader Angela Rayner dismissed the PM's promises as a ""PR exercise"", adding that Mr Johnson ""does not do detail, he does soundbites"". ""It is all jam tomorrow and a load of baloney. What he pretends and what he says he is going to do, is not what happens in reality."" PM must level up the North at pace, say Tory MPs By-election loss a warning shot - Tory co-chairman Levelling up must be more targeted, say peers What is levelling up and how is it going? In a wide-ranging speech, Mr Johnson said the government wanted to ""rewrite the rulebook"" on local devolution and offer county areas in England ""new deals"" to give them the same powers as those currently given to major cities. And he promised a flexible approach to those deals, including the option for directly elected mayors, but said there was no ""one-size-fits-all"" template. This video can not be played The prime minister âpromises jam tomorrowâ but fails to deliver says the Labour leader. The former London mayor urged local leaders with ideas for how to improve their communities to come forward, promising to give them ""the tools to make things happen for their communities"".. He said he did not want to see the return of what he called ""loony-left"" councils, but added: ""We will deal with anybody."" The Conservatives first promised to ""level up"" the country in their manifesto for the 2019 general election, in which they targeted - and won - so-called ""red wall"" parliamentary seats in the Midlands and northern England previously dominated by Labour. The plan, some of which has already been outlined, involves investing in transport, skills and businesses to address regional disparities. The government is expected to publish more details in September. Asked what his clear strategy was for ""levelling up"", he said: ""I am respectfully going to urge you to just go back over some of what I said because I do think that in all fairness there was at least the skeleton of what to do."" Boris Johnson again tried to explain the purpose of the ""levelling up"" agenda and talked about the UK's huge regional imbalances, entrenched inequalities and squandered opportunities. In well-trailed remarks he also said that the aim of getting more government spending and private investment into poorer parts of the UK would not come at the detriment of London and the south east - an attempt to reassure traditional Tory voters who might be feeling left out themselves. In terms of policy prescription the speech was fairly thin. A White Paper is promised in the autumn and today Mr Johnson clattered through a list of things - from tackling crime, building football pitches, laying railway lines - that he seemed to say all fell under the umbrella of levelling up. But he also proposed greater regional devolution and suggested county leaders could get new powers. He said if anyone could think of a better title than county mayors they should email him, which rather summed up the speech. In his speech, the prime minister said the government will have ""made progress in levelling up when we have begun to raise living standards, spread opportunity, improved our public services and restored people's sense of pride in their community"". Investing in more deprived areas will relieve pressure on parts of the UK that are ""over-heating"" and that previous governments focused too much on ""areas where house prices are already high and where transport is already congested"", he added. But he insisted that there will not be ""levelling down"" in prosperous places, adding: ""We don't want to decapitate the tall poppies. ""We don't think you can make the poor parts of the country richer by making the rich parts poorer."" He said that ""levelling up is not a jam-spreading operation. It's not robbing Peter to pay Paul. It's not zero-sum. It's win-win"". The PM's speech was welcomed by county councils. County Councils Network spokesman Martin Hill said: ""Local areas should be able to decide the most appropriate devolution arrangements for counties"". He added: ""We are pleased that this looks firmly on the table.""

"This video can not be played Watch: Canadians say the conditions are ""unbearable"" North America experienced its warmest June on record, according to the EU's Earth observation programme. That will come as no surprise given the unprecedentedly high temperatures recently recorded during the heatwave that hit Canada and parts of the US. But UK residents may be startled to learn that despite the rain and cloud they experienced, it was the second warmest June on record for Europe. It was also the fourth warmest June ever recorded worldwide. Life in the 'hottest place on Earth' A really simple guide to climate change Dozens dead as heatwave shatters records Copernicus, the EU's Earth observation programme, produces its figures for world temperatures from computer-generated analyses using billions of measurements from satellites, aircraft and weather stations around the world. Climate experts say the findings point to a frightening escalation in temperature extremes. ""We are getting used to record high temperatures being recorded somewhere around the world every year now,"" says Prof Peter Stott of the UK Met Office. He says what meteorologists like him find shocking is not that the world is experiencing more heatwaves but that temperature records are increasingly being broken by such large margins. In Canada and the north-western US, several cities recorded temperatures a full 5 degrees Celsius above previous records. A Siberian heatwave last year saw temperatures more than 5C above the previous record between January and June. A study by the Met Office on the extreme heat in the Russian region found that reaching such temperatures was almost impossible without human-caused climate change. It anticipates similar results from studies of the Canadian heatwave. Portland residents flocked to cooling centres amid the recent heatwave Its initial calculations suggest the odds of the sort of temperatures experienced in Canada occurring without climate change are very low indeed, says Professor Stott. ""It is telling us that changes in average climate are leading to rapid escalation not just of extreme temperatures, but of extraordinarily extreme temperatures,"" he adds. That is exactly what the science says we should expect, Prof Friederike Otto of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University told the BBC. ""Every decade the world has increased the rate of greenhouse gas emissions and that has increased the rate of warming. So, of course, heat records are being broken more frequently,"" she maintains. Prof Otto believes the risks from the increasing number of heatwaves the world now experiences is not taken seriously enough. The UK has also been experiencing soaring temperatures Storms and flood provide dramatic before-and-after images and cause widespread damage to property. Heatwaves, by contrast, do not leave a trail of destruction in their wake. Prof Otto describes them as ""silent killers"". ""People rarely drop dead on the street, but die quietly in their poorly insulated and un-air-conditioned homes."" Indeed, how many victims these events claim is often only apparent months after the event when statisticians can calculate excess mortality. Prof Otto says even if we do manage to achieve the dramatic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions that many countries around the world are now committed to, we will still see more frequent and more intense heatwaves than we have today. She advises that, alongside cutting carbon emissions, we should be investing in adaption and resilience to ensure our communities can withstand the higher temperatures we can expect in the future.

"Boris Johnson says he is not attracted to proposals for new taxes intended to reduce sugar and salt. The PM said a government-commissioned review of the food we eat was likely to contain good ideas, but he did not want to impact ""hard-working people"". The review, led by businessman Henry Dimbleby, said taxes raised could extend free school meal provision and support better diets among the poorest. England's National Food Strategy,externalalso suggested GPs prescribe fruit and veg. Mr Johnson's official spokesman said the PM would ""carefully consider"" the report, and promised the government would respond with proposals for future laws in six months' time.

But Mr Dimbleby said: ""We do not actually believe that for most things it will hike the price - what it will do is it will reformulate, it will make people take sugar and salt out."" The review describes the Covid-19 pandemic as a ""painful reality check"" that has revealed the scale of food-related ill-health.

Psychologist David Halpern, who advises the government, told Today taxing sugar and salt could act as a ""double nudge"" on behaviour.

Poor diet contributes to 64,000 deaths a year in England alone and costs the economy Â£74bn, the review says. It claims more than half of over-45s now live with diet-related health conditions. And our eating habits are not just damaging our health, they are also destroying the environment, the review warns. The food we eat accounts for about a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the review.

It is also the second-biggest contributor to climate change, after the energy industry. Calorie for calorie, highly processed foods are three times cheaper than healthy food, the report found. The review recommended the new tax be set at Â£3/kg for sugar and Â£6/kg for salt sold wholesale for use in processed foods, or in restaurants and catering businesses. This would represent a very dramatic increase in the cost of these two important ingredients. The tax could raise as much as Â£3.4bn a year, the review team calculated. But the previous sugar levy on soft drinks brought in less tax revenue than expected because manufacturers voluntarily reduced the amount of sugar to avoid it. The National Food Strategy recognised that by raising prices of some products the sugar and salt tax would be likely to put extra financial strain on the poorest families. In a series of recommendations designed to get fresh food and ingredients to low-income households with children, it recommended: money raised from the new taxes is used to extend free school meals to families with a household income of Â£20,000 or less, well above the current ceiling of Â£7,400 increasing spending on other schemes to improve the diets of families on low incomes and improving food education a trial of a ""Community Eatwell"" programme involving GPs prescribing fruit and vegetables to people with poor diets and low incomes.

"Several users reporting racist abuse on Bukayo Saka's Instagram were told the comments were ""probably"" within guidelines Instagram has admitted a mistake in its technology meant racist comments and emojis were not removed. It comes after a flood of racist abuse was directed at England footballers Bukayo Saka, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho following the men's Euro 2020 final. Instagram boss Adam Mosseri said content had ""mistakenly"" been identified as within guidelines instead of referred to human moderators. The issue had now been fixed, he said. âWe have technology to try and prioritise reports and we were mistakenly marking some of these as benign comments, which they are absolutely not,â he told BBC News. âThe issue has since been addressed. ""Reports on these types of comments should [now] be reviewed properly.â Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, BBC News reported a comment containing several orangutan emojis on Sakaâs Instagram. Within minutes, a notification was received saying the platformâs technology âfound that this comment probably doesnât go against our guidelinesâ. BBC News requested a further review but received no response. On Thursday, Saka himself responded to the abuse. ""To the social media platforms... I don't want any child or adult to have to receive the hateful and hurtful messages that me, Marcus and Jadon have received this week,"" he wrote. ""I knew instantly the kind of hate that I was about to receive and that is a sad reality that your powerful platforms are not doing enough to stop these messages."" Allow Twitter content?

Following Mr Mosseriâs comments, on Wednesday night, several more racist comments and emojis were reported - but no notification of the results of any review was received. A quick scroll on Saka's account reveals plenty more racist comments yet to be reported and removed. Facebook 'horrified' by footballer abuse Online racists face football ban of up to 10 years Southgate, PM & FA condemn player abuse âIt is absolutely not OK to send racist emojis, or any kind of hate speech, on Instagram,â Mr Mosseri added in a series of tweets. ""To imply otherwise is to be deliberately misleading and sensational. âEmojis are difficult, as are words whose meaning changes based on context. ""Slurs evolve as well, so the work is never done.â Racism on Instagram has been a long-standing issue, with a vast amount of content to moderate. In April,Liverpool Football Clubcriticised the platform after some of its players were sent racist monkey emojis. Instagram has previously consulted with anti-discrimination and anti-bullying groups to curate a list of offensive terms, phrases and emojis. This video can not be played Racist abuse of England players is ""unforgivable"", England manager Gareth Southgate says Users can also filter out specific words or emojis on their accounts, by changing the Hidden Words tool in settings. But Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Hate (CCDH) said it was ""beyond belief"" that racist abuse continued to bypass Instagram's filters. ""Of the 105 accounts we identified as having racially abused England footballers, 88 are still up,"" he said, adding it was ""a far cry"" from the social network's promised solution. ""From its failure to identify monkey emojis as racist, to its flat-out refusal to issue lifetime bans to racists, Instagram - and its parent company Facebook - have failed to act,"" he said. ""We have heard enough talk. It's time for the UK Government to follow Germany's lead in passing laws and impose serious financial penalties on firms that give a megaphone to racism and extremism.""

We'll be wrapping up our live coverage shortly but, before we go, here's a quick summary of the main Covid-related stories in the UK and around the world: However in the North East of England, Nexus, which runs Tyne and Wear Metro, says it will make the wearing of masks at stations and on trains a condition of carriage, apart from for those who are exempt. A Nexus spokesman said customers could be refused travel if they did not wear masks, adding: ""You should also wear face coverings when inside bus stations and interchanges or travelling on the Shields Ferry."" We heard on Wednesday that the London Underground will continue to enforce mask wearing on their trains after Monday when the restrictions in England are eased. Read more. The leader of Birmingham City Council has written to the prime minister urging him to rethink plans to end the legal requirement for face coverings on public transport. Thelegal requirement to wear a face covering,externalin shops, public transport and other enclosed public spaces will end on 19 July. It will be replaced with government guidance.

Councillor Ian Ward branded the move a ""potentially disastrous decision at such a pivotal moment"". In his letter to Boris Johnson, he wrote that more than 500,000 people in Birmingham were not yet fully vaccinated and positive Covid cases and hospital admissions were increasing in the city. ""This decision will put people who are clinically vulnerable in an unfair position,"" Mr Ward wrote, adding: ""I believe now is not the time to remove this legal requirement."" On Wednesday, West Midlands MayorAndy Street announced passengers travelling on public transport in the West Midlands would be ""expected"" to wear face coverings, but he has no power to enforce this on trains and buses. The number of job vacancies in the UK surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the three months to June, according to new data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there were 862,000 jobs on offer between April and June, 77,500 higher than the first three months of 2020. The ONS said the rise was driven by vacancies in hospitality and retail. The number of people on payrolls also grew in June, showing the biggest rise since the start of the pandemic. There was a particularly sharp increase in the food and accommodation sectors, as more people returned to work following the reopening of the hospitality industry in England in May. Employment minister Mims Davies said there was still work to do but the figures showed the country was ""on the right track and pushing for recovery"". Read more Bangladesh is to start vaccinating some of the 850,000 Rohingya refugees who fled across the border from Myanmar, local officials are quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. Refugee commissioner Shah Rezwan Hayat says about 48,000 Rohingya aged over 55 will be eligible for jabs next month with help from the World Health Organization. ""We are targeting 55-year-olds due to vaccine shortages. Hopefully, we will be able to give everyone the vaccine in phases if there is no shortage,"" Hayat says. Bangladesh has recently seen a surge in infections across the country, including in crowded Rohingya camps on the Myanmar border. At least five camps are in lockdown, and the movement of aid workers and other visitors severely restricted. Most of Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in 2017 to escape a clampdown by Myanmar's military. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Throughout the pandemic, Hong Kong has managed to keep cases low Hong Kong is set to move to Englandâs green list on 19 July, meaning that travellers from China's special administrative region will no longer need to quarantine
on arrival. Hong Kong is currently somewhat Covid-free. The
city has only confirmed one local case in the last two weeks. However, flights look unlikely to fully resume in both directions,
asthe UK is classed as an âextremely high-riskâ country by Hong Kong.,external This is due to rising cases of the Delta variant.Hong Kong banned flights from the UK on 1 July for this reason. The Hong Kong Free Press website suggests that some may be looking
to imminently leave Hong Kong for political reasons, saying âthere has been an
uptick in the number of Hongkongers leaving for good in recent weeksâ,
taking advantage of special UK visas that were introduced at the beginning of
the year. Nevertheless, local Hong Kong media note that the authorities are
easing restrictions to allow Hongkongers to return from the UK. The South China
Morning Post says bans are now being lifted on residents and workers
returning from the UK âif they hold recognised jab recordsâ, given that the 1
July flight ban left many stranded. The newspaper adds that unvaccinated children who are
stranded in the UK may be allowed to return to Hong Kong âon
compassionate groundsâ. A further 48,553 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK, according to government figures. And 63 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid,  the highest day-on-day rise since 26 March. It brings the UK total to 128,593. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 154,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate. Care homes are struggling with staffing issues as restrictions ease, according to the National Care Association. Chairwoman Nadra Ahmed tells Sky News recruitment is ""an enormous challenge"" and many staff are also being pinged by the NHS Test and Trace app to isolate. She adds that the sector expects to lose staff once mandatory vaccination is introduced for care home workers in England from October. ""We are going to have to manage the number of people coming into a care home, we're not going to be able to enable three or four different lots of visitors in because we've still got to do all that clinical cleaning,"" she says. ""We've got to do the testing, we've got to sort all of that out, and we haven't got the staff."" A pub which deliberately opened during a coronavirus lockdown has lost its licence to serve alcohol. Paul Henderson opened The Porky Pint in Billingham in January to protest against Covid regulations and the ""devastation"" caused to pubs, Stockton Council's licensing committee heard. Councillors heard the landlord had failed to pay a Â£1,000 fine and deemed the breach ""extremely serious"". Mr Henderson says he is considering appealing. Read more. The Isle of Man has scrapped mandatory isolation for people who've come in to close contact with someone who's tested positive for Covid. People will instead be offered free home testing for seven days using lateral flow tests. Until now, those who were not fully vaccinated were automatically told to isolate, even if they themselves had tested negative. The chief minister of the island, which lies in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland, said the number of people in isolation had became a ""concern"". Howard Quayle said the new regime was an ""appropriate alternative to having large numbers of our community in self-isolation"". Read more. A surge in flu and other respiratory viruses could put pressure on people's health and the NHS this winter, a report by leading medics warns. An Academy of Medical Sciences report says testing for flu, Covid and a respiratory virus common in children and the elderly - called RSV - may help doctors treat cases more quickly. The report, by 29 leading experts and requested by the government, says there is great uncertainty about what the next few months will hold across the UK, but it urges policymakers to prepare for a challenging winter. During lockdown last winter, the UK population was hardly exposed to the viruses which normally circulate. But they are now set to make a comeback as restrictions lift and society opens up.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The pandemic is believed to have started in Wuhan in late 2019 The head of the World Health Organization has urged China to be more co-operative with the WHO's planned second phase investigation into the origins of Covid-19. Speaking in Geneva, Tedros Adhanom Grebreyesus said there was a ""challenge of access and transparency"", and asked China to provide the raw data from immediately before and at the start of the pandemic. He also said the WHO investigation team should have ""direct information"" about the situation of the laboratory in Wuhan before and at the start of the pandemic, saying that - as an epidemiologist - he knew ""laboratory accidents can happen"". Tedros also expressed concern that some countries were acting as if the pandemic was coming to an end, when in fact it was ""nowhere near finished"". The Chinese economy's sharp rebound from the coronavirus pandemic has now slowed, official figures show. Gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 7.9% in the second quarter of 2021 compared with the same time last year. That was less than half the rate seen in the previous quarter and missed economists' forecasts of 8.1% growth. GDP is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. Economists have raised concerns about the recovery of the world's second largest economy in recent months. Read our full story Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia Correspondent People queue to refill oxygen in Yangon The UN human rights envoy to Myanmar has warned that rapidly rising Covid infections and the political turmoil following a military coup in February are creating a perfect storm, which will lead to much greater loss of life unless there is significant international assistance. Tom Andrews says loss of public trust in the military government means it is incapable of addressing the crisis. Even before the coup Myanmar had one of the weakest public health systems in Asia, a legacy of decades of military rule in the past. Under the civilian government testing and vaccinating against Covid was improving - but since the militaryâs power seizure the health system has broken down, with doctors and nurses among the many professional groups organising resistance to the coup. Soldiers have occupied hospitals, and dozens of medical staff have been arrested, including the man who was running Myanmarâs vaccination programme. Of those who are being tested for Covid, up to one-third are found to be infected - an alarming proportion which suggests real case numbers are much higher than the 4,000-5,000 officially recorded every day. People are trying to stock up on oxygen to treat patients at home, though the military has now banned this, and this week opened fire on a crowd queuing up to fill their own tanks. Covid-19 case rates in all regions of England are at their highest level since at least January, according Public Health England. The highest rates are in north-east England - at 835.8 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 11 July. This is the highest level for the region since comparable figures began in summer 2020, when mass testing was first introduced across the country. Yorkshire and the Humber has the second highest rate, 462.7, which also the region's highest rate since summer 2020. All other regions are recording their highest rate since January. The Commons Speaker has told union officials he has ""no power"" to prevent MPs from entering Parliament or the debating chamber without a face covering. Unions representing staff based in Parliament have called for MPs to continue wearing masks, following new guidance - set to come into force on 19 July - which only encourages politicians to use face coverings, while staff are forced to wear them. Writing to officials, Lindsay Hoyle said: ""As you are aware, I have no power to prevent democratically-elected members from coming onto the estate when the House is sitting. ""As such, there is no meaningful way to enforce a requirement on members to wear a face covering."" Asda,
Lidl and Waitrose have become the latest retailers to say they will encourage customers and employees to continue wearing face masks in their supermarkets, even after the legal requirement in England is lifted on Monday. Asda says it will have signage and announcements to encourage
customers to follow government guidance and will continue to provide face
coverings in shops for people who wish to use them. Waitrose and John Lewis are also recommending that staff and customers wear masks, although a spokesman for the companies says it will ultimately be up to individual judgment. Aldi also confirmed it would continue to encourage customers to wear face coverings. They join Sainsbury's, Tesco and Lidl, who have already said they will ask customers to keep wearing masks.

Rolls Royce is the latest manufacturer to warn that if the number of staff being told to isolate rises much further, it may impact on production at its factory in Goodwood, southern England. A spokesman for the luxury carmaker said the number of employees self-isolating as a result of being ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app has been rising and it is watching the situation carefully. He added that the situation was not yet critical, but if the numbers continued to rise, Rolls Royce would have to cut one of the two shifts at the factory. This would effectively halve production at a time when it is running at full capacity in order to meet very high demand. A man whose wife died after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid jab has said a vaccine damages scheme needs to be made easier for families to access. Kurt Weideling lost his wife Nicola in May after the 45-year-old suffered rare complications after the jab. He is now trying to apply for compensation through the UK government's Vaccine Damage Payment programme, which was set up in 1979 and offers those who are ""severely disabled as a result of a vaccination against certain diseases"" a one-off tax-free payment of Â£120,000. He said people like Nicola ""have effectively died as heroes"" as they had made the sacrifice for a vaccine programme that has saved thousands of lives. There was a ""pretty fundamental ethical responsibility to those families"" who have lost loved ones who have had the jab, after the UK continued with its vaccine programme ""knowing that a certain number of people would die"", he added. The government says it has received 145 claims for vaccine damage payments after a Covid vaccination but, to date, no payments have been made. The Department of Health says vaccines are safe and effective and have already prevented 30,000 Covid deaths in England. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"More than half a million isolation alerts were sent to people using the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales during the first week of July. Some 530,126 alerts telling people to self-isolate were sent in the week to 7 July, a 46% rise on the previous week. One union has warned factories are on the verge of shutting because of staff shortages, withNissan and Rolls Royce the latest firms to raise concerns. The UK has recorded another 48,553 daily coronavirus cases. Cases have increased 32.6% over the last week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson had previously warned there could be 50,000 cases a day by 19 July - when most legal restrictions are due to end in England. Latest government figures,externalalso show a further 63 Covid deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts NHS Covid app: Should it stay or should it go? What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? Alerts are sent through the NHS Covid app to tell individuals they have been in close contact with a positive coronavirus case. Anyone alerted is advised to self-isolate for 10 days. Social distancing rules are being lifted in England on Monday, leading to concerns about a bigger rise in the number of alerts. The latest figures show that 520,194 alerts were sent in England in the week to 7 July, with another 9,932 sent in Wales. Unite said hundreds of employees were off work at some sites, with the app causing ""havoc"" on production lines. Assistant general secretary Steve Turner said it was no exaggeration to say factories were on the verge of shutting and that at some sites hundreds of staff are off work. ""It is clear that something has to be done in time for July 19, or else people will simply start deleting the app en masse to avoid isolation notices,"" he said. Steve Robinson, chief executive of homecare company Prama, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that around a quarter of his staff were currently off work after being ""pinged"". He said he was currently offering three times the normal salary to cover emergency shifts. Tim Moran, who runs cold supply chain company Lineage Logistics' UK division, said he had more staff absent than at any point during the pandemic and it meant the firm couldn't meet the demand to deliver food to customers. Prof Lucy Easthope, who advises the government on disaster planning, said the issue of staff shortages because of the app hadn't come as a surprise. She told the PM programme: ""We feared we would see in some workforces 80% absenteeism. There will come a point where we simply can't operate like that, particularly around things like food production."" She said she knew of some companies advising people not to have the app, which she said was in its ""death throes"". ""The app is not the way to do this now. It has always been that we should have had local contact tracing through public health and that now needs to be properly resourced."" Despite the rise in the number of people getting ""pinged"" - data from the most recent week showed the most downloads of the app (342,483) since the seven days to 6 June (393,842). It has already been announced that from 16 August, people who have been fully vaccinated in England will no longer have to self-isolate after close contact with someone who tests positive. The BBC has been told the team behind the app has been askedto adjust the measurements that trigger the alerts so that fewer are sent out- although the time frame for the change is not yet known. However, the Department of Health and Social Care said that while the sensitivity of the app was kept under constant review there were no plans to change its sensitivity at this time. Other reasons people have to self-isolate include if they test positive, live with someone who tests positive, or are told to do so by contact tracers. People in England and Wales can download the NHS Covid app (Northern Ireland and Scotland have their own). If you are using the app and spend enough time close to another person with it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid and share the information with the app. The app uses Bluetooth readings to infer if you had recently been within 2m of them for at least 15 minutes. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged - to self-isolate for 10 days. Meanwhile, the UK's two largest supermarkets - Tesco and Sainsbury's - have said they will continue to ask shoppers to wear masks when the legal requirement to do so in England is dropped on Monday. The government has said it ""expects and recommends"" shoppers in England to wear face masks from Monday. But the legal requirement to cover your face in enclosed spaces will end. Different rules apply in the devolved nations. And the government has been criticised over itsdecision to add Bulgaria and Croatia to its green travel list from Monday- but not give Foreign Office approval for travel to the countries. The decision to allow people to travel there without isolating on return was announced on Wednesday, but the government's travel advice pages for both countries currently states that it  ""advises against all but essential travel"". Government travel advice affects operators' and passengers' insurance. Airlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said not aligning Foreign Office travel advice with government travel policies was causing ""huge confusion for passengers and carriers"".

Conservatorship abuse can involve financially exploiting or imposing excessive personal restrictions on someone in your care. If a court rules that abuse has taken place, the appointed conservator could be removed/suspended and may face financial penalties such as reimbursement payments and legal costs. Following the ruling, the singer posted an Instagram video of herself doing cartwheels in celebration with a caption thanking her fans and adding ""#FreeBritney"". It is the first time she has used the hashtag, which has been used by her supporters to campaign against the conservatorship she has been subject to since 2008. This week's hearing saw Spears address a court for the second time in less than a month. In court last month, she made a dramatic plea to demanded that her father be removed from the legal agreement that has controlled her affairs for years. ""You're allowing my dad to ruin my life,"" she reiterated on Wednesday. ""I have to get rid of my dad and charge him with conservatorship abuse."" The conservatorship was put in place in 2008, when concerns over Spears' mental health prompted her father to petition the court for legal authority over his daughter's life. Explainer: Britney Spears' conservatorship case Spears' supporters rallied outside the court, and also gathered on the other side of the country in central Washington DC as the hearing was being held. Last month a judge denied the pop star's request to remove her father from his role overseeing her conservatorship. Judge Brenda Penny said she could not make a ruling until the singer files a formal petition to terminate the arrangement. Wednesday's court ruling paves the way for Spears' lawyer of choice, former federal prosecutor Mathew Rosengart, to take charge of the complex legal battle. He will replace Samuel Ingham, the court-appointed lawyer who had been representing Spears since 2008 beforestepping down last week. During the hearing, Mr Ingham interrupted the court to say Spears was texting him. The singer wanted to address the court again, he said. The judge officially accepted Mr Ingham's resignation before inviting Spears to speak. Mr Rosengart, the high-powered Hollywood lawyer who has previously represented Steven Spielberg and Sean Penn, was also in court. A tearful Spears told the court that under the conservatorship, her hair vitamins and coffee had been confiscated. ""Ma'am, that's not abuse, that's just [expletive] cruelty,"" she told Judge Penny. ""Excuse my language, but it's the truth."" The singer said her top priority was removing her father from his role in the legal arrangement that governs her personal and financial affairs. She said she did not wish to submit to a ""stupid"" medical assessment and would be ""happy"" for co-conservator Jodi Montgomery to remain. Spears continued: ""I just want you to understand how much of my time they have taken by forcing me to do these psyche tests and nothing comes of it."" She said she has ""extreme abandonment issues"" because of her father. The singer also told the court she was ""extremely scared of my dad"", who is a recovering alcoholic, and feared he was always going to ""show up drunk somewhere and embarrass me"". Jamie Spears is currently the sole person in charge of his daughter' $60m (Â£43m) estate. This video can not be played What we can all learn from Britney Spearsâ case But his lawyers have previously denied he was responsible for the restrictions apparently placed on his daughter's private life.

She claimed she was prevented from having a contraceptive intrauterine device (IUD) removed, to make sure that she didn't get pregnant. While her father has overseen her estate for 13 years, his legal team say he has not been in charge of her personal affairs since September 2019, when he stepped down from that role due to ill health.

"The UK's two largest supermarkets will continue to ask shoppers to wear masks, even after the legal requirement to do so in England is dropped on Monday. Sainsbury's and Tesco have joined the bookseller, Waterstones, which hassaid customers should wear masksto protect staff and other shoppers. Sainsbury's said signs and tannoy announcements would remind shoppers to cover their faces. Tesco said it wanted to ""be on the safe side"". The chain will also continue to limit the number of shoppers in store at any one time. The government has said it ""expects and recommends"" shoppers in England to wear face masks from Monday. But the legal requirement to cover your face in enclosed spaces will end. Different rules apply in the devolved nations. Waterstones to encourage shoppers to wear masks Where will I have to carry on wearing a mask? Masks to remain compulsory on London transport Thenew guidance,externalleaves firms to decide their own safety policies after 19 July when Covid rules are lifted. Along with Tesco, Sainsbury's and Waterstones, several other businesses and organisations have said they will ask customers to keep their masks. They include: Asda, which will continue to offer masks to its customers John Lewis, including its Waitrose grocery chain Aldi and Lidl supermarkets Ryanair and easyJet, along with several other airlines and holiday firms London Underground and other regional transport services. The decision poses a dilemma for businesses, however, since it is not clear whether encouraging mask-wearing will put off or attract shoppers. Primark has said it won't have signage requesting customers to wear masks but hopes they will continue to do so. John Timpson, founder of the keycutting and shoe repair chain, said the decision would be left to customers. Sainsbury's said its strategy reflected feedback from customers and colleagues, with the majority of those surveyed in favour of keeping the mask policy in place. The chain said some Covid measures, such as screens between self-service checkouts and checkout queues, would be gradually removed. However screens between checkout staff and customers will remain in place. The recommendation to wear a mask isbased on scientists' advicethat it will help prevent the wearer from infecting others through the wider dispersal of airborne particles. Critics of the government's new strategy say, given the current rapid spread of the virus, rules on mask-wearing should be retained after other social restrictions are eased in England on 19 July. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are maintaining stricter rules on face-coverings. The trades union body, the TUC, called the government's strategy in England ""a recipe for rising infections"". The shop workers' union, Usdaw, said the policy would create confusion and put shop workers at risk. In its advice, the government says: ""Face coverings are no longer required by law. However, the government expects and recommends that people continue to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces."" It said this would apply to offices, factories, shops, construction sites, and close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians. The government said it expected any return to work to be ""gradual"" and asked employers to continue to use measures to reduce potential Covid spread, such as risk assessments, thorough cleaning and ensuring adequate ventilation. However, much of the language in the guidance involves ""encouraging"" employers, staff and customers to ""consider"" measures which are already widespread, such as hand-washing, sanitiser use and contactless payments. The TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said the guidelines ""have been published without proper consultation with unions or employers, just two full working days before restrictions end on Monday"". ""Instead of providing clear and consistent guidance on how to keep staff safe at work, the government is abandoning workers and employers,"" she said. Employers body the Institute of Directors said the guidance ""fails to inspire confidence in the return to work"". Dr Roger Barker, policy director at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Like everybody else, businesses across the country having been awaiting 'freedom day' with bated breath. ""But instead we have had a series of mixed messages and patchwork requirements from government that have dampened that enthusiasm."" The British Retail Consortium, which represents big chains, said violence and abuse against shop workers had been on the rise during the pandemic, adding that ""colleagues cannot be put in the firing line because of this change in policy"". Chief executive of the trade body Helen Dickinson said retailers will be asking customers to be ""considerate to those around them"" when choosing whether to wear a face covering. The beauty industry trade body Babtac said that they will be working with members to provide more clarity. Head of Babtac, Lesley Blair, told the BBC that while it may no longer be law, the group ""would certainly encourage"" their members to continue to wear masks for the time being, especially when working in close proximity to customers.

"The number of job vacancies in the UK surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the three months to June, according to new data. The Office for National Statistics said there were 862,000 jobs on offer between April and June, 77,500 higher than the first three months of 2020. The rise was driven by vacancies in hospitality and retailing. The number of people on payrolls also grew in June, showing the biggest rise since the start of the pandemic. It increased by 356,000 in June to 28.9 million. There was a sharp increase in payrolls in both the food and accommodation sectors as more people returned to work, following a further easing of Covid restrictions in England during May that allowed the hospitality industry to reopen. Some regions of the UK saw payroll numbers rise past levels seen before Covid forced the country into lockdown, including the North East, the North West, the East Midlands and Northern Ireland. However, the ONS said the number of payroll workers remained 206,000 below pre-pandemic levels. ""The labour market is continuing to recover, with the number of employees on payroll up again strongly in June,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""However, it is still over 200,000 down on pre-pandemic levels, while a large number of workers remain on furlough."" The ONS also said that the unemployment rate was 4.8% between March and May, representing a fall from 5% between December and February. Commenting on the sharp rise in vacancies, Chris Gray, director at recruitment firm Manpower UK, said: ""I think what we're seeing is that we're already in a tight labour market. Employers are already having to be very creative. ""But some are also a little bit anxious, maybe desperate, and advertising the same job more than once, so we've got to be mindful of some of those inflated numbers."" The ONS said arts, entertainment and recreation recorded the sharpest rise in vacancies. It added that in the accommodation and food services sectors, vacancies increased by 73,400 to 102,000. ""In this sector, there is evidence of a shortage of skilled staff and of employees finding alternative areas of employment prior to the sector reopening,"" it said. The rise in vacancies above pre-pandemic levels may sound like good news but to businesses it points to a problem: skills shortages. ""The recruitment difficulties faced by firms go well beyond temporary bottlenecks and with many facing an increasing skills gap, staff shortages may drag on any recovery,"" according to the British Chambers of Commerce. It combines unpleasantly with other labour market figures released today, showing that the number of UK-born workers in the workforce has dropped by more than a million from the end of 2019 to the first quarter of this year to 26.12 million. Meanwhile, the number of non-UK-born workers has only risen by about 200,000, according to the ONS, to 6.06 million. And the number of EU-born workers is down from 2.43 million to 2.3 million, although that fall is much smaller than many had predicted last year. Seeing the number of UK-born workers drop by a million is probably not what most Brexit supporters were hoping for. But, of course, it is almost certainly an effect not so much of Brexit but of the pandemic and successive lockdowns. Some of those UK-born workers will have re-joined the workforce since March and the reliability of the figures is questioned by some. But it underlines what businesses say the labour market needs right now: retraining on a big scale to upskill those UK-born workers who've left the workforce and meet some of those skills shortages that could hold the recovery back. Companies haverecently told the BBC they are having difficulties recruiting staff. Mark Lee, who runs the Red Lion Country Inn, a B&B in Yorkshire, said before the pandemic he would receive about 50 applications if he advertised a job. However, he is now struggling to fill a number of roles. A survey of recruitment firms by accountancy firm KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation found a number of factors contributing to problems in hiring workers, including Brexit, pandemic-related uncertainty and the furlough scheme. However, Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""While there is growing evidence that firms are finding it more difficult to hire workers, we suspect that most of these labour shortages will prove temporary and that they will be confined to a few sectors.""

"Ed Sheeran is currently the most-streamed artist in the UK, with his comeback single Bad Habits The music industry is weighted against artists, with even successful pop stars seeing ""pitiful returns"" from streaming, a committee of MPs has said. They are calling for a ""complete reset"" of the market, with musicians given a ""fair share"" of the Â£736.5 million that UK record labels earn from streaming. In a report, they said royalties should be split 50/50, instead of the current rate, where artists receive about 16%. The findings came after a six-month inquiry into music streaming. ""While streaming has brought significant profits to the recorded music industry, the talent behind it - performers, songwriters and composers - are losing out,"" said Julian Knight, MP, who chairs parliament's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee. ""Only a complete reset of streaming that enshrines in law their rights to a fair share of the earnings will do."" The findings will be seen as a victory by pop stars like Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, Melanie C, Wolf Alice and Jessie Ware, whorecently called on the Prime Ministerto reform the way musicians get paid when their songs are streamed. Musician Tom Gray, whose #BrokenRecord campaign prompted the inquiry, said he was ""overjoyed"" by the findings. ""It feels like a massive vindication,"" he said. ""They've really come to the same conclusions that we've been saying for a very long time."" The BPI, which represents the UK recorded music industry, was more cautious. It said streaming was ""enabling more artists than ever"" to earn a ""long-term, sustainable income"" and that new policies should be properly examined to ensure against ""unintended consequences for investment into new talent"". At present, Spotify is believed to pay between Â£0.002 and Â£0.0038 per stream, while Apple Music pays about Â£0.0059. YouTube pays the least - about Â£0.00052 (or 0.05 pence) per stream. All that money goes to rights-holders, a blanket term that covers everything from massive record companies to artists who release their own music. That money is then divided up between everyone involved in making the record. Often, the recording artist will only receive about 13% of the revenue, with labels and publishers keeping the rest. Artists who release their own music, or who work with independent labels and distribution companies, tend to get a higher share. A survey by the Ivors Academy and Musicians' Union found that in 2019, 82% of professional musicians made less than Â£200 from streaming, whilst only 7% made more than Â£1,000. This video can not be played Nile Rodgers says that streaming numbers are meaningless when it comes to getting paid The hearings were full of testy exchanges. Some witnesses said they were scared to speak out for fear of reprisals; and the head of one record label was described as ""living in cloud cuckoo land"" after he claimed artists were happy with the music streaming model. Mercury Prize nominee Nadine Shah made headlines after telling the committee she had been forced to move back in with her parents because ""earnings from my streaming are not significant enough to keep the wolf away from the door"". Pop songwriter Fiona Bevan revealed she'd earned just Â£100 for a track on Kylie Minogue's number one album, Disco. ""Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers,"" she told MPs. ""It's quite shameful."" Chic's Nile Rodgers said that the finances of streaming are shrouded in secrecy, adding: ""We don't even know what a stream is worth and there's no way you could even find out what a stream is worth, and that's not a good relationship."" 'Right now, hit songwriters are driving Ubers' Streaming 'is threatening the future of music' Stones and Jones call for streaming reforms The three major labels - Sony, Universal and Warner Music - faced some of the toughest questioning of the inquiry, and were accused of a ""lack of clarity"" by MPs. They largely argued to maintain the status quo, saying any disruption could damage investment in new music, and resisted the idea that streaming was comparable to radio - where artists receive a 50/50 royalty split. ""Streaming is 24-7 in every country in the world, you can listen to the greatest record store ever - it's clearly a sale, it's not radio, it's on-demand,"" said David Joseph, CEO of Universal Music UK. Representatives from the streaming companies suggested they were ""open-minded"" about changing the royalty system, but noted that 70% of their income already goes to labels, publishers and artists. ""It is a narrow-margin business, so it wouldn't actually take that much to upset the so-called apple cart,"" said Apple Music's Elena Segal. Streaming now accounts for 80% of music consumption in the UK The committee's report said streaming had ""undoubtedly helped save the music industry"" after decades of piracy, ""but it is clear that what has been saved does not work for everyone"". They recommended that the government pass legislation to give performers the right to ""equitable remuneration"", whereby labels and artists receive an equal share of streaming royalties. The report called it a ""simple yet effective solution"", as the right already exists in UK law when songs are played on radio and TV. MPs also raised ""deep concerns"" about the dominance of the major music companies, and urged the government to refer the case to the Competition and Markets Authority. Other recommendations included: Musicians and songwriters should be allowed to reclaim the rights to their work from labels after a set period of time. Artists should be given the right to adjust their contract if their work is successful beyond the remuneration they received. The government should explore ways to ensure songwriters, who receive minimal streaming royalties, can have sustainable careers. Curators who make playlists on services like Spotify and Apple Music should adhere to a ""code of conduct"" to avoid bribes and favouritism. The government should require publishers and royalty societies to inform artists about how much money is flowing through the system. Warner and Universal Music should follow Sony's example, andcancel their artists' historical debts. The committee also expressed concerns that ""the economics of streaming entrench historically successful artists and create barriers for new performers"", with perennial hits by Abba, Queen and Fleetwood Mac starving up-and-coming musicians of opportunities. Figures released yesterday showed thatnew music accounted for just 33% of the music streamed,externalin the US this year, with older songs dominating people's listening choices. The streaming services themselves largely escaped criticism, but MPs said YouTube's dominance was a cause for concern - citing figures that it accounts for 51% of music streaming while contributing 7% of music industry revenue. They warned that users' ability to upload music to YouTube without licensing it from record labels gave it an ""unfair advantage""; and urged the government to introduce ""legally enforceable obligations to normalise licensing arrangements"" on sites that host user-generated videos, such as YouTube, TikTok and Facebook. Kate Bush was one of more than 230 artists who wrote to the Prime Minister asking for reforms Tom Gray said the report confirmed what his#BrokenRecordcampaign had been telling record labels all along: ""That their business model needs to change and that they need to face the reality of that and get on with it"". He said he hoped the government would enact the recommendations quickly, potentially by acting on a private member's bill by Labour MP Kevin Brennan that seeks to change copyright laws around streaming. ""This is something that they can do for the British cultural sector, where they don't have to go and negotiate with Brussels,"" he told the BBC. ""If they want to help British creators, inventors and performers, this is something they can just do."" TheAssociation of Independent Music(AIM) welcomed the report's praise for independent record labels, who traditionally pay higher royalty rates to their artists. ""However, our view is that equitable remuneration will not deliver the outcome they are hoping for,"" said CEO Paul Pacifico. ""It is a 20th Century solution not fit for the 21st Century digital market and will leave the next generation of artists worse off."" TheBPIargued that streaming worked in artists' favour - with 2,000 artists set to achieve 10 million streams this year, the equivalent of selling 10,000 CDs, or making about Â£29,000. It warned unpicking the current system could damage investment in new music. ""When considering this report, the Government also needs to consider the vital role that labels play as the leading investors into artists' careers, with investment in artists by record labels growing year-on-year,"" said CEO Geoff Taylor. ""We will carefully examine the findings of this report, but it is essential that any policy proposals avoid unintended consequences for investment into new talent, and do not imperil this country's extraordinary global success in music."" Meanwhile, theMusicians Unioncalled the report ""revolutionary"". ""It grasps the issue, identifies the problems and recommends achievable and practical solutions, which won't cost the taxpayer a penny,"" said general secretary Horace Trubridge. In a joint statement, theFeatured Artists CoalitionandMusic Managers Forumsaid the ""landmark"" report could ""fundamentally improve"" the economic situation for thousands of musicians. ""This is a once in a lifetime moment to reset our business along fairer and more equitable lines, it is not an opportunity to be wasted.""

"Environmental activists fear for the Papua rainforest - among the most biodiverse places in the world A Korean palm oil giant has been rejected from the world's leading green certification body in the wake of a BBC investigation. The BBC had earlier found evidencethat the Korindo group had been buying up swathes of Asia's largest remaining rainforests in the remote Indonesian province of Papua. A visual analysis suggested that fires had then been deliberately set to these forests, a clear violation of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The regulator's tree logo - found on paper products throughout the UK and Europe - is meant to tell consumers the product is sourced from ethical and sustainable companies. At the time of the BBC's investigation late last year, the FSC said they would not expel Korindo but were working with the Korean company to address social and environmental problems. But now the green body says the relationship has ""become untenable"" and Korindo's trademark licenses with FSC will be terminated from October. ""We were not able to verify improvements in Korindo's social and environmental performance,"" Kim Carstensen, FSC international director general said. He said the decision would ""give us clarity and a breath of fresh air while Korindo continues its efforts to improve."" Korindo groups chief sustainability officer Kwangyul Peck said in a statement that the company was ""very shocked by the FSC decision."" He insists they were following all the steps of ""an agreed roadmap of improvements"" and said despite their expulsion from the FSC ""they remain committed to sustainability and human rights."" Korindo controls more land in Papua than any other conglomerate.  The company has cleared nearly 60,000 hectares of forests inside its government-granted concessions - an area the size of Chicago or Seoul. A 2018 report by the FSC into the allegations against Korindo was never published, after legal threats from the company, but the BBC obtained a copy. The report found ""evidence beyond reasonable doubt"" that Korindo's palm oil operation destroyed 30,000 hectares of high conservation forest in breach of FSC regulations and that the company was, ""on the balance of probability â¦ supporting the violation of traditional and human rights for its own benefit."" A visual investigation by the Forensic Architecture group at Goldsmiths University in London and Greenpeace International, published in conjunction with the BBC, also found evidence that indicated deliberate burning. This video can not be played Watch how the Forensic Architecture Group established what was happening in Papua Kiki Taufik, head of the Greenpeace Southeast Asia forest campaign said the FSC decision was ""better late than never"" saying they had ""finally come to their senses"". But he said the Indonesian government continues to ""grant companies like Korindo forest concessions, allowing them to violate the rights of indigenous people."" ""It is crucial that buyers and certification bodies don't keep helping them create a facade of sustainability and transparency,"" he said. After the BBC's investigation last year, the Indonesian parliament had launched an inquiry into Korindo's conduct - though the findings have not been made public. The rich rainforest in Papua, among the most biodiverse places on earth, is threatened by deforestation The Korindo group strongly denies starting any fires or involvement in any human rights violations, saying it follows the law.  They also insisted they paid fair compensation to tribes. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil -  found in everything from shampoo to biscuits - and Papua is its newest frontier. The rich forests in the remote province of Papua had until recently escaped relatively untouched, but the government has rapidly opened the area up to investors, vowing to bring prosperity to one of the poorest regions in the country. Vast areas of forest have been cleared to make way for row upon row of oil palm trees. Indonesia's palm oil exports were worth about $19bn (Â£14bn) last year, according to data from Gapki, the nation's palm oil association.

"This video can not be played Henry Dimbleby says the ""junk food cycle must be broken"" Sugar and salt should be taxed and vegetables prescribed by the NHS, an independent review of the food we eat has suggested. The report, led by businessman Henry Dimbleby, said taxes raised could extend free school meal provision and support better diets among the poorest. England's National Food Strategy,externalalso wants GPs to try prescribing fruit and vegetables to encourage healthy eating. Boris Johnson said he was not attracted to extra taxes on hard-working people. The prime minister added he would study the report, and promised the government would respond with proposals for future laws within six months. Meanwhile, the food industry warned new taxes on wholesale sugar and salt could lead to higher food prices in shops. Ian Wright, of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said: ""Obesity and food is very much about poverty, and we need measures to tackle poverty and to help people to make choices they need to make."" Prince Charles warns of threat to small farms 'Once-in-a-lifetime' chance for sustainable food Will my child get free school meals this summer holiday? The review, commissioned by the government in 2019, said historic reforms of the food system are needed to protect the NHS, improve the health of the nation and save the environment. The new taxes would be applied to wholesale sugar and salt purchased by manufacturers, which could in turn raise some prices on shelves. But Mr Dimbleby said: ""We do not actually believe that for most things it will hike the price - what it will do is it will reformulate, it will make people take sugar and salt out."" The review described the Covid-19 pandemic as a ""painful reality check"" that has revealed the scale of food-related ill-health. ""Our high obesity rate has been a major factor in the UK's tragically high death rate,"" said Mr Dimbleby, who co-founded the fast food chain Leon. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the focus should turn to preventing people getting to the NHS. He said his proposals - if implemented in full - could save 38 calories per person per day, helping the average person lose 2kg (4.4lb) in weight a year. Asked if this was an example of the nanny state where the posh tell the poor what is good for them, Mr Dimbleby said ""it's only posh people who ever say that to me... if you go to communities, they really want to change our food system"". Psychologist David Halpern, who advises the government, told Today taxing sugar and salt could act as a ""double nudge"" on behaviour. He compared the concept to thesugar levy on soft drinks, introduced in April 2018 and which drove manufacturers to remove sugar from productsthrough reformulation. He added that levy led to a reduction of sugar added into soft drinks of about a third, while sales also rose at the same time. Efforts to cut sugar out of food way off target Ministers 'should urge public to eat less meat' Call for massive expansion in vegetable growing Poor diet contributes to 64,000 deaths a year in England alone and costs the economy Â£74bn, the review said. It claims more than half of over-45s now live with diet-related health conditions. And our eating habits are not just damaging our health, they are also destroying the environment, the review warned. The food we eat accounts for about a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the review. The global food system is the single biggest contributor to biodiversity loss, deforestation, drought, freshwater pollution and the collapse of aquatic wildlife, said the review. It is also the second-biggest contributor to climate change, after the energy industry. Calorie for calorie, highly processed foods are three times cheaper than healthy food, the report found. The review recommended the new tax be set at Â£3/kg for sugar and Â£6/kg for salt sold wholesale for use in processed foods, or in restaurants and catering businesses. This would represent a very dramatic increase in the cost of these two important ingredients. The tax could raise as much as Â£3.4bn a year, the review team calculated. But the previous sugar levy on soft drinks brought in less tax revenue than expected because manufacturers voluntarily reduced the amount of sugar to avoid it. The National Food Strategy recognised that by raising prices of some products the sugar and salt tax would be likely to put extra financial strain on the poorest families. In a series of recommendations designed to get fresh food and ingredients to low-income households with children, it recommended: money raised from the new taxes is used to extend free school meals to families with a household income of Â£20,000 or less, well above the current ceiling of Â£7,400 increasing spending on other schemes to improve the diets of families on low incomes and improving food education a trial of a ""Community Eatwell"" programme involving GPs prescribing fruit and vegetables to people with poor diets and low incomes. It encouraged the government to set a target to reduce the nation's meat consumption by 30% over 10 years. Other recommendations included helping farmers transition to more sustainable farming methods and dividing land equally between high intensity farming, environment-friendly low-intensity agriculture and nature reserves. The first partof the two-part review was published last summer and looked at food as part of trade deals and farming payments. Restaurateur and Great British Bake-Off judge Prue Leith called it ""a compelling and overdue plan of action"" which, if adopted, would put ""our food system on the right path to health and prosperity"". Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said she wanted to see government policies designed to meet Mr Dimbleby's recommendations but feared it could end up being ignored.

"Flu and other winter viruses will make a comeback in autumn, but vaccines should help A surge in flu and other respiratory viruses could put pressure on people's health and the NHS this winter, warns a report by leading medics. They say testing for flu, Covid and a respiratory virus common in children and the elderly - called RSV - may help doctors treat cases more quickly. The Academy of Medical Sciences report,externalcalls for people with any symptoms to isolate and stay at home. This will help protect against all respiratory viruses this winter. The report, by 29 leading experts and requested by the government, says there is great uncertainty about what the next few months will hold across the UK, but it urges policymakers to prepare for a challenging winter. During lockdown last winter, the UK population was hardly exposed to the viruses which normally circulate. But they are now set to make a comeback as restrictions lift and society opens up. Already this summer, there has beena rise in winter viruses in children coming to A&E. Report author Prof Azra Ghani, from Imperial College London, says their modelling suggests a summer peak of Covid-19 infections ""with subsequent local outbreaks over winter"". But ""we can't completely rule out another winter wave"", she said. ""Whilst we expect the peak in deaths to be considerably lower than last winter, under some scenarios we could see hospital admissions rise to similar levels."" Will 19 July unlocking gamble pay off or backfire? How many people have been vaccinated so far? Where will I have to carry on wearing a mask? In a worst-case scenario this could mean around twice the levels of flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as a normal autumn and winter, the report says. There are between 10,000 and 30,000 deaths from flu in a normal winter, and about 20,000 children under five are admitted to hospital each year with RSV, which can cause a lung infection called bronchiolitis. The authors say these viruses often produce similar symptoms, so testing for all three at once would help distinguish between them. This could be done through Test and Trace or in GP practices, but the turnaround would need to be very fast so that anti-virals could be used to treat flu in the most vulnerable. Dr Alexander Edwards, from the University of Reading, said the ""triple tests"" had ""great appeal"", but the logistics could be a challenge. ""Whether there will be enough instruments and testing capacity available for this to be available widely in primary care remains to be seen,"" he said. The report also recommends booster Covid vaccines alongside flu vaccines this autumn to reduce the spread of the virus,which is already being planned by the NHS for the over-50s,and improving infection control in hospitals. It says all adults need to be vaccinated against Covid by September. Currently, two-thirds of UK adults have received two doses and 87% have had one dose. But the number one way to reduce transmission is for people to have a test when they have symptoms and stay at home if they are ill, says Prof Dame Anne Johnson, president of the Academy of Medical Sciences. ""We are calling on the government to urgently strengthen the financial and practical support that will allow all people to self-isolate if they need to, whatever their circumstances,"" she said. The medics also emphasise the importance of face coverings, social distancing and meeting friends outdoors - to protect against Covid as well as other respiratory viruses, as society opens up.

"This video can not be played The deadly floods have left homes and cars destroyed At least 70 people have died in Germany and Belgium after record rainfall caused rivers to burst their banks. Most of the victims were in Germany, but at least 11 have died in Belgium, with more reported missing. The German states of Rhineland-Palatinate and North Rhine-Westphalia were worst hit, but the Netherlands is also badly affected. More heavy rain is forecastacross the region on Friday, while local officials have blamed climate change. Armin Laschet, the premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, blamed the extreme weather on global warming during a visit to a hard-hit area. ""We will be faced with such events over and over, and that means we need to speed up climate protection measures... because climate change isn't confined to one state,"" he said. Experts say that climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events, but linking any single event to global warming is complicated. PICTURES: Deadly floods hit Germany and Belgium German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is in the US ahead of a meeting with President Joe Biden, called the flooding a ""catastrophe"" and said she was ""grieving those who have lost their lives"". ""My thoughts are with you, and you can trust that all forces of our government - federal, regional and community - collectively will do everything under the most difficult conditions to save lives, alleviate dangers and to relieve distress."" Your device may not support this visualisation In Germany, police helicopters and hundreds of soldiers have been deployed to affected areas to help stranded residents. Dozens of people waited on rooftops to be rescued. Schools have been closed around the west of Germany, while transport links have been severely disrupted. About 25 houses are in danger of collapsing in the district of Schuld bei Adenau in the mountainous Eifel region, where a state of emergency has been declared, according to German broadcaster SWR. It said some houses had been completely cut-off and could no longer be reached by boat. The army has been deployed to help people in affected areas Residents in the region told AFP news agency they were stunned by the disaster. ""Nobody was expecting this - where did all this rain come from? It's crazy,"" Annemarie Mueller, a 65-year-old resident of Mayen, said. ""It made such a loud noise and given how fast it came down we thought it would break the door down."" Local teacher Ortrud Meyer, 36, said she had ""never seen anything like this"". ""My father-in-law is almost 80, he's from Mayen, and he says he's never experienced anything like this,"" she said.

Residents of LiÃ¨ge, Belgium's third-largest urban area after Brussels and Antwerp, were ordered to evacuate. Those unable to leave should move to the upper floors of their buildings, local officials said. The Meuse river which flows through the city is expected to rise by another 1.5 metres, despite being on the verge of overflowing already. Officials are also concerned that a dam bridge in the area may collapse and urged people to help each other. ""The crisis situation is exceptional and solidarity must prevail,"" the local authority said in a statement. Residents of the Belgian town of Pepinster, which lies at the confluence of two rivers in LiÃ¨ge province, were evacuated in a large truck on Thursday, but conditions in the municipality of Trooz are so bad that evacuation efforts have been halted. In the Netherlands, there have been no casualties reported but thousands of people in towns and villages along the Meuse river have been urged to leave their houses quickly. In the Dutch city of Maastricht, 10,000 people have been ordered to evacuate.

"The government should raise its ambitions on paying farmers to improve the countryside, the report says An independent review of UK food policy is calling for ""a gold standard level of scrutiny"" to ensure new trade deals do not undermine the environment. Verification schemes should address concerns such as imports of beef reared on land recently cleared of rainforest. And the government should press on with plans to pay English farmers to improve the countryside. The report aims to ensure a food system that is healthy, affordable, sustainable, resilient, and productive. It was commissioned by the government in 2019. Author of the first report of the National Food Strategy, food entrepreneur Henry Dimbleby, said the UK had a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" to decide what kind of trading nation it wanted to be when the transition period ends. ""We should use that freedom to decide that we want to uphold standards,"" he said. ""And the government should be confident of scrutiny on the trade deals that it is doing."" Trade deals should not only increase wealth but restore the environment and protect animal welfare, he added. A second report will examine the food system in more depth The 110-page report calls for the adoption of a statutory duty that would give Parliament the opportunity to properly scrutinise any new trade deals. And it urges the government to press on with its Environmental Land Management Scheme, which would pay English farmers Â£2.4bn a year to improve the countryside, such as by capturing carbon or increasing biodiversity. ""Be bolder. Go faster,"" the report said. The second part of the National Food Strategy, due to be published in 2021, will examine issues such as climate change, biodiversity, pollution and zoonotic disease. Commenting, Minette Batters, president of the NFU, said that now the UK can pursue its own path through trade, it must ensure ""our environmental, animal welfare and safety standards are not undermined so that our farmers can continue producing high quality, sustainable food"". The report's main remit is for England, with health and food governed separately under devolution. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"The number of job vacancies in the UK surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the three months to June, according to new data. The Office for National Statistics said there were 862,000 jobs on offer between April and June, 77,500 higher than the first three months of 2020. The rise was driven by vacancies in hospitality and retailing. The number of people on payrolls also grew in June, showing the biggest rise since the start of the pandemic. It increased by 356,000 in June to 28.9 million. There was a sharp increase in payrolls in both the food and accommodation sectors as more people returned to work, following a further easing of Covid restrictions in England during May that allowed the hospitality industry to reopen. Some regions of the UK saw payroll numbers rise past levels seen before Covid forced the country into lockdown, including the North East, the North West, the East Midlands and Northern Ireland. However, the ONS said the number of payroll workers remained 206,000 below pre-pandemic levels. ""The labour market is continuing to recover, with the number of employees on payroll up again strongly in June,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""However, it is still over 200,000 down on pre-pandemic levels, while a large number of workers remain on furlough."" The ONS also said that the unemployment rate was 4.8% between March and May, representing a fall from 5% between December and February. Commenting on the sharp rise in vacancies, Chris Gray, director at recruitment firm Manpower UK, said: ""I think what we're seeing is that we're already in a tight labour market. Employers are already having to be very creative. ""But some are also a little bit anxious, maybe desperate, and advertising the same job more than once, so we've got to be mindful of some of those inflated numbers."" The ONS said arts, entertainment and recreation recorded the sharpest rise in vacancies. It added that in the accommodation and food services sectors, vacancies increased by 73,400 to 102,000. ""In this sector, there is evidence of a shortage of skilled staff and of employees finding alternative areas of employment prior to the sector reopening,"" it said. The rise in vacancies above pre-pandemic levels may sound like good news but to businesses it points to a problem: skills shortages. ""The recruitment difficulties faced by firms go well beyond temporary bottlenecks and with many facing an increasing skills gap, staff shortages may drag on any recovery,"" according to the British Chambers of Commerce. It combines unpleasantly with other labour market figures released today, showing that the number of UK-born workers in the workforce has dropped by more than a million from the end of 2019 to the first quarter of this year to 26.12 million. Meanwhile, the number of non-UK-born workers has only risen by about 200,000, according to the ONS, to 6.06 million. And the number of EU-born workers is down from 2.43 million to 2.3 million, although that fall is much smaller than many had predicted last year. Seeing the number of UK-born workers drop by a million is probably not what most Brexit supporters were hoping for. But, of course, it is almost certainly an effect not so much of Brexit but of the pandemic and successive lockdowns. Some of those UK-born workers will have re-joined the workforce since March and the reliability of the figures is questioned by some. But it underlines what businesses say the labour market needs right now: retraining on a big scale to upskill those UK-born workers who've left the workforce and meet some of those skills shortages that could hold the recovery back. Companies haverecently told the BBC they are having difficulties recruiting staff. Mark Lee, who runs the Red Lion Country Inn, a B&B in Yorkshire, said before the pandemic he would receive about 50 applications if he advertised a job. However, he is now struggling to fill a number of roles. A survey of recruitment firms by accountancy firm KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation found a number of factors contributing to problems in hiring workers, including Brexit, pandemic-related uncertainty and the furlough scheme. However, Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said: ""While there is growing evidence that firms are finding it more difficult to hire workers, we suspect that most of these labour shortages will prove temporary and that they will be confined to a few sectors.""

"An outline planning application for the gigafactory has been submitted ""Mission critical"" plans have been submitted for an electric car battery plant that could create up to 6,000 new jobs. Proposals for the ""gigafactory"" at Coventry Airportwere first put forward in February. Coventry City Council is putting forward the blueprint alongside Coventry Airport Ltd. Steve Turner, from the Unite union, said the factory would be a ""shot in the arm"" for the West Midlands economy. Backers say the plant, which would be 5.7 million sq ft in size, could attract Â£2bn of investment. The city council and Warwick District Council will vote on the proposals later this year. If plans are passed, the site could be operational by 2025, though it would need investment from the private sector. The factory will be powered by 100% green energy, and will be able to recycle used batteries as well as build new ones, according to the plans. Car manufacturer Tesla is building its fourth ""gigafactory"" in Germany Councillor George Duggins, leader of Coventry City Council, said the submission of the plans was the ""next important step"" in the drive to bring battery production to the West Midlands. ""We are the ideal location for a gigafactory as the home of the UK automotive sector, alongside world-leading research in battery technology,"" he said. Latest news from the West Midlands The city is already home to the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre, a research centre for the next-generation battery technologies. Andy Street, the Mayor of the West Midlands, said it was ""mission critical that the West Midlands secures a gigafactory"" to safeguard its key industry, economy and the ""future of our planet"". Mr Turner, Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing, said members have been ""battling"" for the factory to come to Coventry, adding it would be a ""shot in the arm for the region"". ""We urge the government to get onside, work with us to get this gigafactory up and running so that the country can take another step forward in electric battery production,"" he said.

"Environmental activists fear for the Papua rainforest - among the most biodiverse places in the world A Korean palm oil giant has been rejected from the world's leading green certification body in the wake of a BBC investigation. The BBC had earlier found evidencethat the Korindo group had been buying up swathes of Asia's largest remaining rainforests in the remote Indonesian province of Papua. A visual analysis suggested that fires had then been deliberately set to these forests, a clear violation of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). The regulator's tree logo - found on paper products throughout the UK and Europe - is meant to tell consumers the product is sourced from ethical and sustainable companies. At the time of the BBC's investigation late last year, the FSC said they would not expel Korindo but were working with the Korean company to address social and environmental problems. But now the green body says the relationship has ""become untenable"" and Korindo's trademark licenses with FSC will be terminated from October. ""We were not able to verify improvements in Korindo's social and environmental performance,"" Kim Carstensen, FSC international director general said. He said the decision would ""give us clarity and a breath of fresh air while Korindo continues its efforts to improve."" Korindo groups chief sustainability officer Kwangyul Peck said in a statement that the company was ""very shocked by the FSC decision."" He insists they were following all the steps of ""an agreed roadmap of improvements"" and said despite their expulsion from the FSC ""they remain committed to sustainability and human rights."" Korindo controls more land in Papua than any other conglomerate.  The company has cleared nearly 60,000 hectares of forests inside its government-granted concessions - an area the size of Chicago or Seoul. A 2018 report by the FSC into the allegations against Korindo was never published, after legal threats from the company, but the BBC obtained a copy. The report found ""evidence beyond reasonable doubt"" that Korindo's palm oil operation destroyed 30,000 hectares of high conservation forest in breach of FSC regulations and that the company was, ""on the balance of probability â¦ supporting the violation of traditional and human rights for its own benefit."" A visual investigation by the Forensic Architecture group at Goldsmiths University in London and Greenpeace International, published in conjunction with the BBC, also found evidence that indicated deliberate burning. This video can not be played Watch how the Forensic Architecture Group established what was happening in Papua Kiki Taufik, head of the Greenpeace Southeast Asia forest campaign said the FSC decision was ""better late than never"" saying they had ""finally come to their senses"". But he said the Indonesian government continues to ""grant companies like Korindo forest concessions, allowing them to violate the rights of indigenous people."" ""It is crucial that buyers and certification bodies don't keep helping them create a facade of sustainability and transparency,"" he said. After the BBC's investigation last year, the Indonesian parliament had launched an inquiry into Korindo's conduct - though the findings have not been made public. The rich rainforest in Papua, among the most biodiverse places on earth, is threatened by deforestation The Korindo group strongly denies starting any fires or involvement in any human rights violations, saying it follows the law.  They also insisted they paid fair compensation to tribes. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil -  found in everything from shampoo to biscuits - and Papua is its newest frontier. The rich forests in the remote province of Papua had until recently escaped relatively untouched, but the government has rapidly opened the area up to investors, vowing to bring prosperity to one of the poorest regions in the country. Vast areas of forest have been cleared to make way for row upon row of oil palm trees. Indonesia's palm oil exports were worth about $19bn (Â£14bn) last year, according to data from Gapki, the nation's palm oil association.

"The UK's two largest supermarkets will continue to ask shoppers to wear masks, even after the legal requirement to do so in England is dropped on Monday. Sainsbury's and Tesco have joined the bookseller, Waterstones, which hassaid customers should wear masksto protect staff and other shoppers. Sainsbury's said signs and tannoy announcements would remind shoppers to cover their faces. Tesco said it wanted to ""be on the safe side"". The chain will also continue to limit the number of shoppers in store at any one time. The government has said it ""expects and recommends"" shoppers in England to wear face masks from Monday. But the legal requirement to cover your face in enclosed spaces will end. Different rules apply in the devolved nations. Waterstones to encourage shoppers to wear masks Where will I have to carry on wearing a mask? Masks to remain compulsory on London transport Thenew guidance,externalleaves firms to decide their own safety policies after 19 July when Covid rules are lifted. Along with Tesco, Sainsbury's and Waterstones, several other businesses and organisations have said they will ask customers to keep their masks. They include: Asda, which will continue to offer masks to its customers John Lewis, including its Waitrose grocery chain Aldi and Lidl supermarkets Ryanair and easyJet, along with several other airlines and holiday firms London Underground and other regional transport services. The decision poses a dilemma for businesses, however, since it is not clear whether encouraging mask-wearing will put off or attract shoppers. Primark has said it won't have signage requesting customers to wear masks but hopes they will continue to do so. John Timpson, founder of the keycutting and shoe repair chain, said the decision would be left to customers. Sainsbury's said its strategy reflected feedback from customers and colleagues, with the majority of those surveyed in favour of keeping the mask policy in place. The chain said some Covid measures, such as screens between self-service checkouts and checkout queues, would be gradually removed. However screens between checkout staff and customers will remain in place. The recommendation to wear a mask isbased on scientists' advicethat it will help prevent the wearer from infecting others through the wider dispersal of airborne particles. Critics of the government's new strategy say, given the current rapid spread of the virus, rules on mask-wearing should be retained after other social restrictions are eased in England on 19 July. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are maintaining stricter rules on face-coverings. The trades union body, the TUC, called the government's strategy in England ""a recipe for rising infections"". The shop workers' union, Usdaw, said the policy would create confusion and put shop workers at risk. In its advice, the government says: ""Face coverings are no longer required by law. However, the government expects and recommends that people continue to wear a face covering in crowded, enclosed spaces."" It said this would apply to offices, factories, shops, construction sites, and close-contact services such as hairdressers and beauticians. The government said it expected any return to work to be ""gradual"" and asked employers to continue to use measures to reduce potential Covid spread, such as risk assessments, thorough cleaning and ensuring adequate ventilation. However, much of the language in the guidance involves ""encouraging"" employers, staff and customers to ""consider"" measures which are already widespread, such as hand-washing, sanitiser use and contactless payments. The TUC's general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said the guidelines ""have been published without proper consultation with unions or employers, just two full working days before restrictions end on Monday"". ""Instead of providing clear and consistent guidance on how to keep staff safe at work, the government is abandoning workers and employers,"" she said. Employers body the Institute of Directors said the guidance ""fails to inspire confidence in the return to work"". Dr Roger Barker, policy director at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Like everybody else, businesses across the country having been awaiting 'freedom day' with bated breath. ""But instead we have had a series of mixed messages and patchwork requirements from government that have dampened that enthusiasm."" The British Retail Consortium, which represents big chains, said violence and abuse against shop workers had been on the rise during the pandemic, adding that ""colleagues cannot be put in the firing line because of this change in policy"". Chief executive of the trade body Helen Dickinson said retailers will be asking customers to be ""considerate to those around them"" when choosing whether to wear a face covering. The beauty industry trade body Babtac said that they will be working with members to provide more clarity. Head of Babtac, Lesley Blair, told the BBC that while it may no longer be law, the group ""would certainly encourage"" their members to continue to wear masks for the time being, especially when working in close proximity to customers.

Councillor Ian Ward branded the move a ""potentially disastrous decision at such a pivotal moment"". In his letter to Boris Johnson, he wrote that more than 500,000 people in Birmingham were not yet fully vaccinated and positive Covid cases and hospital admissions were increasing in the city. ""This decision will put people who are clinically vulnerable in an unfair position,"" Mr Ward wrote, adding: ""I believe now is not the time to remove this legal requirement."" On Wednesday, West Midlands MayorAndy Street announced passengers travelling on public transport in the West Midlands would be ""expected"" to wear face coverings, but he has no power to enforce this on trains and buses. The number of job vacancies in the UK surpassed pre-pandemic levels in the three months to June, according to new data. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said there were 862,000 jobs on offer between April and June, 77,500 higher than the first three months of 2020. The ONS said the rise was driven by vacancies in hospitality and retail. The number of people on payrolls also grew in June, showing the biggest rise since the start of the pandemic. There was a particularly sharp increase in the food and accommodation sectors, as more people returned to work following the reopening of the hospitality industry in England in May. Employment minister Mims Davies said there was still work to do but the figures showed the country was ""on the right track and pushing for recovery"". Read more Bangladesh is to start vaccinating some of the 850,000 Rohingya refugees who fled across the border from Myanmar, local officials are quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. Refugee commissioner Shah Rezwan Hayat says about 48,000 Rohingya aged over 55 will be eligible for jabs next month with help from the World Health Organization. ""We are targeting 55-year-olds due to vaccine shortages. Hopefully, we will be able to give everyone the vaccine in phases if there is no shortage,"" Hayat says. Bangladesh has recently seen a surge in infections across the country, including in crowded Rohingya camps on the Myanmar border. At least five camps are in lockdown, and the movement of aid workers and other visitors severely restricted. Most of Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in 2017 to escape a clampdown by Myanmar's military. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Throughout the pandemic, Hong Kong has managed to keep cases low Hong Kong is set to move to Englandâs green list on 19 July, meaning that travellers from China's special administrative region will no longer need to quarantine
on arrival. Hong Kong is currently somewhat Covid-free. The
city has only confirmed one local case in the last two weeks. However, flights look unlikely to fully resume in both directions,
asthe UK is classed as an âextremely high-riskâ country by Hong Kong.,external This is due to rising cases of the Delta variant.Hong Kong banned flights from the UK on 1 July for this reason. The Hong Kong Free Press website suggests that some may be looking
to imminently leave Hong Kong for political reasons, saying âthere has been an
uptick in the number of Hongkongers leaving for good in recent weeksâ,
taking advantage of special UK visas that were introduced at the beginning of
the year. Nevertheless, local Hong Kong media note that the authorities are
easing restrictions to allow Hongkongers to return from the UK. The South China
Morning Post says bans are now being lifted on residents and workers
returning from the UK âif they hold recognised jab recordsâ, given that the 1
July flight ban left many stranded. The newspaper adds that unvaccinated children who are
stranded in the UK may be allowed to return to Hong Kong âon
compassionate groundsâ. A further 48,553 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK, according to government figures. And 63 more people have died within 28 days of testing positive for Covid,  the highest day-on-day rise since 26 March. It brings the UK total to 128,593. Separate figures published by the Office for National Statistics show there have now been 154,000 deaths registered in the UK where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate. Care homes are struggling with staffing issues as restrictions ease, according to the National Care Association. Chairwoman Nadra Ahmed tells Sky News recruitment is ""an enormous challenge"" and many staff are also being pinged by the NHS Test and Trace app to isolate. She adds that the sector expects to lose staff once mandatory vaccination is introduced for care home workers in England from October. ""We are going to have to manage the number of people coming into a care home, we're not going to be able to enable three or four different lots of visitors in because we've still got to do all that clinical cleaning,"" she says. ""We've got to do the testing, we've got to sort all of that out, and we haven't got the staff."" A pub which deliberately opened during a coronavirus lockdown has lost its licence to serve alcohol. Paul Henderson opened The Porky Pint in Billingham in January to protest against Covid regulations and the ""devastation"" caused to pubs, Stockton Council's licensing committee heard. Councillors heard the landlord had failed to pay a Â£1,000 fine and deemed the breach ""extremely serious"". Mr Henderson says he is considering appealing. Read more. The Isle of Man has scrapped mandatory isolation for people who've come in to close contact with someone who's tested positive for Covid. People will instead be offered free home testing for seven days using lateral flow tests. Until now, those who were not fully vaccinated were automatically told to isolate, even if they themselves had tested negative. The chief minister of the island, which lies in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland, said the number of people in isolation had became a ""concern"". Howard Quayle said the new regime was an ""appropriate alternative to having large numbers of our community in self-isolation"". Read more. A surge in flu and other respiratory viruses could put pressure on people's health and the NHS this winter, a report by leading medics warns. An Academy of Medical Sciences report says testing for flu, Covid and a respiratory virus common in children and the elderly - called RSV - may help doctors treat cases more quickly. The report, by 29 leading experts and requested by the government, says there is great uncertainty about what the next few months will hold across the UK, but it urges policymakers to prepare for a challenging winter. During lockdown last winter, the UK population was hardly exposed to the viruses which normally circulate. But they are now set to make a comeback as restrictions lift and society opens up.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The pandemic is believed to have started in Wuhan in late 2019 The head of the World Health Organization has urged China to be more co-operative with the WHO's planned second phase investigation into the origins of Covid-19. Speaking in Geneva, Tedros Adhanom Grebreyesus said there was a ""challenge of access and transparency"", and asked China to provide the raw data from immediately before and at the start of the pandemic. He also said the WHO investigation team should have ""direct information"" about the situation of the laboratory in Wuhan before and at the start of the pandemic, saying that - as an epidemiologist - he knew ""laboratory accidents can happen"". Tedros also expressed concern that some countries were acting as if the pandemic was coming to an end, when in fact it was ""nowhere near finished"". The Chinese economy's sharp rebound from the coronavirus pandemic has now slowed, official figures show. Gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 7.9% in the second quarter of 2021 compared with the same time last year. That was less than half the rate seen in the previous quarter and missed economists' forecasts of 8.1% growth. GDP is one of the most important ways of showing how well, or badly, an economy is doing. It's a measure - or an attempt to measure - all the activity of companies, governments and individuals in an economy. Economists have raised concerns about the recovery of the world's second largest economy in recent months. Read our full story Jonathan HeadBBC South East Asia Correspondent People queue to refill oxygen in Yangon The UN human rights envoy to Myanmar has warned that rapidly rising Covid infections and the political turmoil following a military coup in February are creating a perfect storm, which will lead to much greater loss of life unless there is significant international assistance. Tom Andrews says loss of public trust in the military government means it is incapable of addressing the crisis. Even before the coup Myanmar had one of the weakest public health systems in Asia, a legacy of decades of military rule in the past. Under the civilian government testing and vaccinating against Covid was improving - but since the militaryâs power seizure the health system has broken down, with doctors and nurses among the many professional groups organising resistance to the coup. Soldiers have occupied hospitals, and dozens of medical staff have been arrested, including the man who was running Myanmarâs vaccination programme. Of those who are being tested for Covid, up to one-third are found to be infected - an alarming proportion which suggests real case numbers are much higher than the 4,000-5,000 officially recorded every day. People are trying to stock up on oxygen to treat patients at home, though the military has now banned this, and this week opened fire on a crowd queuing up to fill their own tanks. Covid-19 case rates in all regions of England are at their highest level since at least January, according Public Health England. The highest rates are in north-east England - at 835.8 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 11 July. This is the highest level for the region since comparable figures began in summer 2020, when mass testing was first introduced across the country. Yorkshire and the Humber has the second highest rate, 462.7, which also the region's highest rate since summer 2020. All other regions are recording their highest rate since January. The Commons Speaker has told union officials he has ""no power"" to prevent MPs from entering Parliament or the debating chamber without a face covering. Unions representing staff based in Parliament have called for MPs to continue wearing masks, following new guidance - set to come into force on 19 July - which only encourages politicians to use face coverings, while staff are forced to wear them. Writing to officials, Lindsay Hoyle said: ""As you are aware, I have no power to prevent democratically-elected members from coming onto the estate when the House is sitting. ""As such, there is no meaningful way to enforce a requirement on members to wear a face covering."" Asda,
Lidl and Waitrose have become the latest retailers to say they will encourage customers and employees to continue wearing face masks in their supermarkets, even after the legal requirement in England is lifted on Monday. Asda says it will have signage and announcements to encourage
customers to follow government guidance and will continue to provide face
coverings in shops for people who wish to use them. Waitrose and John Lewis are also recommending that staff and customers wear masks, although a spokesman for the companies says it will ultimately be up to individual judgment. Aldi also confirmed it would continue to encourage customers to wear face coverings. They join Sainsbury's, Tesco and Lidl, who have already said they will ask customers to keep wearing masks.

Rolls Royce is the latest manufacturer to warn that if the number of staff being told to isolate rises much further, it may impact on production at its factory in Goodwood, southern England. A spokesman for the luxury carmaker said the number of employees self-isolating as a result of being ""pinged"" by the NHS Covid app has been rising and it is watching the situation carefully. He added that the situation was not yet critical, but if the numbers continued to rise, Rolls Royce would have to cut one of the two shifts at the factory. This would effectively halve production at a time when it is running at full capacity in order to meet very high demand. A man whose wife died after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid jab has said a vaccine damages scheme needs to be made easier for families to access. Kurt Weideling lost his wife Nicola in May after the 45-year-old suffered rare complications after the jab. He is now trying to apply for compensation through the UK government's Vaccine Damage Payment programme, which was set up in 1979 and offers those who are ""severely disabled as a result of a vaccination against certain diseases"" a one-off tax-free payment of Â£120,000. He said people like Nicola ""have effectively died as heroes"" as they had made the sacrifice for a vaccine programme that has saved thousands of lives. There was a ""pretty fundamental ethical responsibility to those families"" who have lost loved ones who have had the jab, after the UK continued with its vaccine programme ""knowing that a certain number of people would die"", he added. The government says it has received 145 claims for vaccine damage payments after a Covid vaccination but, to date, no payments have been made. The Department of Health says vaccines are safe and effective and have already prevented 30,000 Covid deaths in England. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"The British Guiana One-Cent Magenta stamp was produced in 1856 An $8.3m (Â£6.2m) stamp is returning to the UK for the first time in 143 years, after being sold at auction to a British rare stamp dealer. The British Guiana 1c Magenta was bought by rare stamp dealer Stanley Gibbons last month. The dealer said that, gram for gram, the stamp is thought to be the most valuable man-made item in the world. It is the only survivor of a small batch printed on the former British colony British Guiana, now Guyana. The stamp, printed on magenta paper and measuring 29 x 26mm, bears a three-masted ship and the colony's motto, ""We give and expect in return"". It went into circulation in 1856, when a shipment of stamps was delayed from London and the colony's postmaster asked printers to make three types of temporary stamp until the shipment arrived. Once it arrived, the postmaster ordered them to be taken out of circulation - but one of the one cent stamps survived. It was discovered around 20 years later and returned to Britain for a short time, but was then sent to a collection abroad. On arriving at Heathrow Airport, it will be met by an armoured truck and will go on display at Stanley Gibbons' shop in London in a specially commissioned, zero-oxygen frame. Graham Shircore, chief executive of Stanley Gibbons, called it ""the Holy Grail of philately"". ""It's truly one of a kind, and we're delighted to be welcoming it back on to British soil where we hope it will remain,"" he said. The dealer intends to make the stamp available to collectors through a shared-ownership scheme. ""This isn't just for wealthy collectors. We are developing a pricing model that will allow anyone to join the club,"" he added. The stamp has been on display at the Smithsonian National Stamp Museum in Washington DC, on loan from its former owner, the US shoe designer Stuart Weitzman. It has marks from all of its previous owners, including the government of France and John du Pont, who was convicted in 1997 of murdering Olympic Gold Medallist David Schultz and died in prison in 2010.

"An outline planning application for the gigafactory has been submitted ""Mission critical"" plans have been submitted for an electric car battery plant that could create up to 6,000 new jobs. Proposals for the ""gigafactory"" at Coventry Airportwere first put forward in February. Coventry City Council is putting forward the blueprint alongside Coventry Airport Ltd. Steve Turner, from the Unite union, said the factory would be a ""shot in the arm"" for the West Midlands economy. Backers say the plant, which would be 5.7 million sq ft in size, could attract Â£2bn of investment. The city council and Warwick District Council will vote on the proposals later this year. If plans are passed, the site could be operational by 2025, though it would need investment from the private sector. The factory will be powered by 100% green energy, and will be able to recycle used batteries as well as build new ones, according to the plans. Car manufacturer Tesla is building its fourth ""gigafactory"" in Germany Councillor George Duggins, leader of Coventry City Council, said the submission of the plans was the ""next important step"" in the drive to bring battery production to the West Midlands. ""We are the ideal location for a gigafactory as the home of the UK automotive sector, alongside world-leading research in battery technology,"" he said. Latest news from the West Midlands The city is already home to the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre, a research centre for the next-generation battery technologies. Andy Street, the Mayor of the West Midlands, said it was ""mission critical that the West Midlands secures a gigafactory"" to safeguard its key industry, economy and the ""future of our planet"". Mr Turner, Unite assistant general secretary for manufacturing, said members have been ""battling"" for the factory to come to Coventry, adding it would be a ""shot in the arm for the region"". ""We urge the government to get onside, work with us to get this gigafactory up and running so that the country can take another step forward in electric battery production,"" he said.

"Letting small family farms go to the wall will ""break the backbone of Britain's rural communities"", Prince Charles has said. The focus on producing plentiful and cheap food threatens the survival of the country's smaller farms, he says. If they go it will ""rip the heart out of the British countryside"", he warns. The government says it wants to support all farmers and ""the choices that they take on their own holdings"". It comes ahead of the publication of the National Food Strategy, the first major review of Britain's food system in more than 70 years. The strategy was commissioned by the government and is headed by Henry Dimbleby, the founder of the Leon restaurant chain. Thursday's report will explore the links between food production and environmental degradation including climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution and the sustainable use of resources. It will include recommendations for the government, which has promised to respond with a White Paper within six months. 'Once-in-a-lifetime' chance for sustainable food Unhealthy diets are âslow-motion disasterâ The first part of the strategy was published in July last year and highlighted the connection between obesity, poverty and the UK's high Covid-19 death toll. The Prince of Wales has been concerned with food and the environment for most of his adult life. His latest intervention comes in the form of an essay forRadio 4's Today programme. In it, he condemns the super-efficient intensive agricultural system that produces much of the food we eat as a ""dead end"". He describes how, over the years, he has watched with increasing concern as many of the nation's ""precious landscapes"" have been slowly diminished in the name of ""efficiency"". We don't take account of what he calls the ""hidden costs"" of modern industrial farming, warns the prince. He cites damage to soils and watercourses and the emissions that add to global warming. ""We must put nature back at the heart of the equation"", he urges, or we risk undermining the true source of all our prosperity - nature. ""How we produce food has a direct impact on the Earth's capacity to sustain us, which has a direct impact on human health and economic prosperity,"" he says. He does find some cause for optimism, however. He says he is increasingly confident we can achieve a transition to more sustainable forms of agriculture and praises the efforts of high-profile figures including footballer Marcus Rashford, chef Jamie Oliver and Henry Dimbleby to improve the nation's food system from ""field to fork"". He describes visiting a new centre for farm and food education in the Cotswolds which aims to produce healthy food in an environmentally-friendly and economically-viable way. There are promising investment opportunities in these kind of innovative approaches to agriculture, he believes, and he says he is working to link private investors with the pioneers of these new sustainable approaches to farming. A particular concern is improving soil health and fertility. ""If we regenerate degraded soils around the world, we could capture as much as 70% of the world's carbon emissions,"" the Prince suggests. ""Only by benefitting nature can we benefit people,"" concludes the Prince. And that is the only way of ensuring the future of our living planet, he says. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said new environmental land management schemes would ""support farmers to produce high quality food in a more sustainable way, and deliver the environmental change that we all want to see"". ""Our new system will be centred around incentivising sustainable farming practices alongside profitable food production and rewarding farmers for producing public goods such as better air and water quality, protecting wildlife and soil health,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We want to support all of our farmers, and the choices that they take on their own holdings. We have recently set out further details of theSustainable Farming Incentive,external, which will eventually be open to every farmer in England.""

"This video can not be played Henry Dimbleby says the ""junk food cycle must be broken"" Sugar and salt should be taxed and vegetables prescribed by the NHS, an independent review of the food we eat has suggested. The report, led by businessman Henry Dimbleby, said taxes raised could extend free school meal provision and support better diets among the poorest. England's National Food Strategy,externalalso wants GPs to try prescribing fruit and vegetables to encourage healthy eating. Boris Johnson said he was not attracted to extra taxes on hard-working people. The prime minister added he would study the report, and promised the government would respond with proposals for future laws within six months. Meanwhile, the food industry warned new taxes on wholesale sugar and salt could lead to higher food prices in shops. Ian Wright, of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said: ""Obesity and food is very much about poverty, and we need measures to tackle poverty and to help people to make choices they need to make."" Prince Charles warns of threat to small farms 'Once-in-a-lifetime' chance for sustainable food Will my child get free school meals this summer holiday? The review, commissioned by the government in 2019, said historic reforms of the food system are needed to protect the NHS, improve the health of the nation and save the environment. The new taxes would be applied to wholesale sugar and salt purchased by manufacturers, which could in turn raise some prices on shelves. But Mr Dimbleby said: ""We do not actually believe that for most things it will hike the price - what it will do is it will reformulate, it will make people take sugar and salt out."" The review described the Covid-19 pandemic as a ""painful reality check"" that has revealed the scale of food-related ill-health. ""Our high obesity rate has been a major factor in the UK's tragically high death rate,"" said Mr Dimbleby, who co-founded the fast food chain Leon. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the focus should turn to preventing people getting to the NHS. He said his proposals - if implemented in full - could save 38 calories per person per day, helping the average person lose 2kg (4.4lb) in weight a year. Asked if this was an example of the nanny state where the posh tell the poor what is good for them, Mr Dimbleby said ""it's only posh people who ever say that to me... if you go to communities, they really want to change our food system"". Psychologist David Halpern, who advises the government, told Today taxing sugar and salt could act as a ""double nudge"" on behaviour. He compared the concept to thesugar levy on soft drinks, introduced in April 2018 and which drove manufacturers to remove sugar from productsthrough reformulation. He added that levy led to a reduction of sugar added into soft drinks of about a third, while sales also rose at the same time. Efforts to cut sugar out of food way off target Ministers 'should urge public to eat less meat' Call for massive expansion in vegetable growing Poor diet contributes to 64,000 deaths a year in England alone and costs the economy Â£74bn, the review said. It claims more than half of over-45s now live with diet-related health conditions. And our eating habits are not just damaging our health, they are also destroying the environment, the review warned. The food we eat accounts for about a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the review. The global food system is the single biggest contributor to biodiversity loss, deforestation, drought, freshwater pollution and the collapse of aquatic wildlife, said the review. It is also the second-biggest contributor to climate change, after the energy industry. Calorie for calorie, highly processed foods are three times cheaper than healthy food, the report found. The review recommended the new tax be set at Â£3/kg for sugar and Â£6/kg for salt sold wholesale for use in processed foods, or in restaurants and catering businesses. This would represent a very dramatic increase in the cost of these two important ingredients. The tax could raise as much as Â£3.4bn a year, the review team calculated. But the previous sugar levy on soft drinks brought in less tax revenue than expected because manufacturers voluntarily reduced the amount of sugar to avoid it. The National Food Strategy recognised that by raising prices of some products the sugar and salt tax would be likely to put extra financial strain on the poorest families. In a series of recommendations designed to get fresh food and ingredients to low-income households with children, it recommended: money raised from the new taxes is used to extend free school meals to families with a household income of Â£20,000 or less, well above the current ceiling of Â£7,400 increasing spending on other schemes to improve the diets of families on low incomes and improving food education a trial of a ""Community Eatwell"" programme involving GPs prescribing fruit and vegetables to people with poor diets and low incomes. It encouraged the government to set a target to reduce the nation's meat consumption by 30% over 10 years. Other recommendations included helping farmers transition to more sustainable farming methods and dividing land equally between high intensity farming, environment-friendly low-intensity agriculture and nature reserves. The first partof the two-part review was published last summer and looked at food as part of trade deals and farming payments. Restaurateur and Great British Bake-Off judge Prue Leith called it ""a compelling and overdue plan of action"" which, if adopted, would put ""our food system on the right path to health and prosperity"". Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said she wanted to see government policies designed to meet Mr Dimbleby's recommendations but feared it could end up being ignored.

The prime minister added he would study the report, and promised the government would respond with proposals for future laws within six months. Meanwhile, the food industry warned new taxes on wholesale sugar and salt could lead to higher food prices in shops. Ian Wright, of the Food and Drink Federation, which represents manufacturers, said: ""Obesity and food is very much about poverty, and we need measures to tackle poverty and to help people to make choices they need to make."" Prince Charles warns of threat to small farms 'Once-in-a-lifetime' chance for sustainable food Will my child get free school meals this summer holiday? The review, commissioned by the government in 2019, said historic reforms of the food system are needed to protect the NHS, improve the health of the nation and save the environment. The new taxes would be applied to wholesale sugar and salt purchased by manufacturers, which could in turn raise some prices on shelves. But Mr Dimbleby said: ""We do not actually believe that for most things it will hike the price - what it will do is it will reformulate, it will make people take sugar and salt out."" The review described the Covid-19 pandemic as a ""painful reality check"" that has revealed the scale of food-related ill-health. ""Our high obesity rate has been a major factor in the UK's tragically high death rate,"" said Mr Dimbleby, who co-founded the fast food chain Leon. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the focus should turn to preventing people getting to the NHS. He said his proposals - if implemented in full - could save 38 calories per person per day, helping the average person lose 2kg (4.4lb) in weight a year. Asked if this was an example of the nanny state where the posh tell the poor what is good for them, Mr Dimbleby said ""it's only posh people who ever say that to me... if you go to communities, they really want to change our food system"". Psychologist David Halpern, who advises the government, told Today taxing sugar and salt could act as a ""double nudge"" on behaviour. He compared the concept to thesugar levy on soft drinks, introduced in April 2018 and which drove manufacturers to remove sugar from productsthrough reformulation. He added that levy led to a reduction of sugar added into soft drinks of about a third, while sales also rose at the same time. Efforts to cut sugar out of food way off target Ministers 'should urge public to eat less meat' Call for massive expansion in vegetable growing Poor diet contributes to 64,000 deaths a year in England alone and costs the economy Â£74bn, the review said. It claims more than half of over-45s now live with diet-related health conditions. And our eating habits are not just damaging our health, they are also destroying the environment, the review warned. The food we eat accounts for about a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions, according to the review. The global food system is the single biggest contributor to biodiversity loss, deforestation, drought, freshwater pollution and the collapse of aquatic wildlife, said the review. It is also the second-biggest contributor to climate change, after the energy industry. Calorie for calorie, highly processed foods are three times cheaper than healthy food, the report found. The review recommended the new tax be set at Â£3/kg for sugar and Â£6/kg for salt sold wholesale for use in processed foods, or in restaurants and catering businesses. This would represent a very dramatic increase in the cost of these two important ingredients. The tax could raise as much as Â£3.4bn a year, the review team calculated. But the previous sugar levy on soft drinks brought in less tax revenue than expected because manufacturers voluntarily reduced the amount of sugar to avoid it. The National Food Strategy recognised that by raising prices of some products the sugar and salt tax would be likely to put extra financial strain on the poorest families. In a series of recommendations designed to get fresh food and ingredients to low-income households with children, it recommended: money raised from the new taxes is used to extend free school meals to families with a household income of Â£20,000 or less, well above the current ceiling of Â£7,400 increasing spending on other schemes to improve the diets of families on low incomes and improving food education a trial of a ""Community Eatwell"" programme involving GPs prescribing fruit and vegetables to people with poor diets and low incomes. It encouraged the government to set a target to reduce the nation's meat consumption by 30% over 10 years. Other recommendations included helping farmers transition to more sustainable farming methods and dividing land equally between high intensity farming, environment-friendly low-intensity agriculture and nature reserves. The first partof the two-part review was published last summer and looked at food as part of trade deals and farming payments. Restaurateur and Great British Bake-Off judge Prue Leith called it ""a compelling and overdue plan of action"" which, if adopted, would put ""our food system on the right path to health and prosperity"". Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said she wanted to see government policies designed to meet Mr Dimbleby's recommendations but feared it could end up being ignored.

"The British Guiana One-Cent Magenta stamp was produced in 1856 An $8.3m (Â£6.2m) stamp is returning to the UK for the first time in 143 years, after being sold at auction to a British rare stamp dealer. The British Guiana 1c Magenta was bought by rare stamp dealer Stanley Gibbons last month. The dealer said that, gram for gram, the stamp is thought to be the most valuable man-made item in the world. It is the only survivor of a small batch printed on the former British colony British Guiana, now Guyana. The stamp, printed on magenta paper and measuring 29 x 26mm, bears a three-masted ship and the colony's motto, ""We give and expect in return"". It went into circulation in 1856, when a shipment of stamps was delayed from London and the colony's postmaster asked printers to make three types of temporary stamp until the shipment arrived. Once it arrived, the postmaster ordered them to be taken out of circulation - but one of the one cent stamps survived. It was discovered around 20 years later and returned to Britain for a short time, but was then sent to a collection abroad. On arriving at Heathrow Airport, it will be met by an armoured truck and will go on display at Stanley Gibbons' shop in London in a specially commissioned, zero-oxygen frame. Graham Shircore, chief executive of Stanley Gibbons, called it ""the Holy Grail of philately"". ""It's truly one of a kind, and we're delighted to be welcoming it back on to British soil where we hope it will remain,"" he said. The dealer intends to make the stamp available to collectors through a shared-ownership scheme. ""This isn't just for wealthy collectors. We are developing a pricing model that will allow anyone to join the club,"" he added. The stamp has been on display at the Smithsonian National Stamp Museum in Washington DC, on loan from its former owner, the US shoe designer Stuart Weitzman. It has marks from all of its previous owners, including the government of France and John du Pont, who was convicted in 1997 of murdering Olympic Gold Medallist David Schultz and died in prison in 2010.

"The government should raise its ambitions on paying farmers to improve the countryside, the report says An independent review of UK food policy is calling for ""a gold standard level of scrutiny"" to ensure new trade deals do not undermine the environment. Verification schemes should address concerns such as imports of beef reared on land recently cleared of rainforest. And the government should press on with plans to pay English farmers to improve the countryside. The report aims to ensure a food system that is healthy, affordable, sustainable, resilient, and productive. It was commissioned by the government in 2019. Author of the first report of the National Food Strategy, food entrepreneur Henry Dimbleby, said the UK had a ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity"" to decide what kind of trading nation it wanted to be when the transition period ends. ""We should use that freedom to decide that we want to uphold standards,"" he said. ""And the government should be confident of scrutiny on the trade deals that it is doing."" Trade deals should not only increase wealth but restore the environment and protect animal welfare, he added. A second report will examine the food system in more depth The 110-page report calls for the adoption of a statutory duty that would give Parliament the opportunity to properly scrutinise any new trade deals. And it urges the government to press on with its Environmental Land Management Scheme, which would pay English farmers Â£2.4bn a year to improve the countryside, such as by capturing carbon or increasing biodiversity. ""Be bolder. Go faster,"" the report said. The second part of the National Food Strategy, due to be published in 2021, will examine issues such as climate change, biodiversity, pollution and zoonotic disease. Commenting, Minette Batters, president of the NFU, said that now the UK can pursue its own path through trade, it must ensure ""our environmental, animal welfare and safety standards are not undermined so that our farmers can continue producing high quality, sustainable food"". The report's main remit is for England, with health and food governed separately under devolution. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.
