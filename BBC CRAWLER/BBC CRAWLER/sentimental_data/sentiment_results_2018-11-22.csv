"This video can not be played PM Theresa May has said a Brexit deal is now ""within our grasp"". Theresa May has hailed the draft agreement on post-Brexit relations as ""right for the whole of the UK"" and insisted a deal ""is within our grasp"". Thepolitical declaration,external- outlining how UK-EU trade, security and other issues will work - has been ""agreed in principle"", the European Council says. London and Brussels have already agreed the draft terms of the UK's exit from the EU on 29 March 2019. The prime minister told MPs it would deliver the Brexit people voted for. The political declaration is a separate document to the 585-page withdrawal agreement, published last week, which covers the UK's Â£39bn ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights after Brexit and the thorny issue of the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" - how to avoid the need for a manned border on the island of Ireland. The withdrawal agreement is legally-binding - the political declaration is not. It sets out broad aspirations for the kind of relationship the UK and the EU will have after Brexit. Some of the wording of it is non-committal and allows both sides to keep their options open. Parliament Live: Theresa May statement to MPs Reality Check: The important bits of the political declaration A guide to where we are with Brexit ""The negotiations (on the political declaration) are now at a critical moment and all our efforts must be focused on working with our European partners to bring this process to a final conclusion in the interests of all our people,"" said the PM. ""The British people want Brexit to be settled, they want a good deal that sets us on a course for a brighter future, and they want us to come together as a country and to move on to focus on the big issues at home, like our NHS. ""The deal that will enable us to do this is now within our grasp. In these crucial 72 hours ahead, I will do everything possible to deliver it for the British people."" This video can not be played Corbyn: EU agreement is 'worst of all worlds' But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn described the agreement as ""26 pages of waffle"" which ""could have been written two years ago"". ""This is the blindfold Brexit we all feared - a leap in the dark. It falls short of Labour's six tests,"" he added. ""What on earth have the government been doing for the past two years?"" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who is campaigning for another referendum, described it as an ""agreement to have an agreement"" that was ""full of worryingly vague aspirations"". Theresa May goes back to Brussels on Saturday for more talks with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker Negotiators try to get an agreement with Spain over Gibraltar EU leaders meet on Sunday to sign off on the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration If that is agreed Mrs May starts the process of getting MPs to back the deal - most are currently against it If MPs back the deal it then has to be ratified by the European Parliament The UK leaves the EU on 29 March - and trade talks on the future relationship start Tensions remain over some parts of the withdrawal agreement. Spain's prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, has said his government is ""annoyed"" that the divorce agreement does not specify that Gibraltar's future must be decided directly by officials in Madrid and London - and France is understood to have sought amendments to the wording on fishing rights in UK waters. On Thursday evening, he said further changes must be made to the withdrawal agreement:  ""After my conversation with Theresa May, our positions remain far away."" Mrs May said she had spoken to Mr Sanchez and was ""confident that on Sunday we will be able to agree a deal for the whole of the United Kingdom family including Gibraltar"" - and that the UK's sovereignty over the territory was not under threat. This video can not be played Adam Fleming has had a look at what's in the draft document Commitment to respect the indivisibility of the EU's four freedoms - free movement of people, money, goods and services A specific reference to the end of free movement in the UK An aspiration to use technology to ensure there is no need for the Northern Ireland backstop to be used A clear continuing role for the European Court of Justice in the interpretation of EU law - which is likely to anger Brexiteers If all goes as planned, the UK and the EU will use the political declaration as the basis for a trade agreement, to be hammered out during a 21-month transition period that is due to kick-in after Brexit happens on 29 March, during which the UK will continue to be a member of the EU single market and customs union. The draft document says: ""The future relationship will be based on a balance of rights and obligations, taking into account the principles of each party. ""This balance must ensure the autonomy of the union's decision-making and be consistent with the union's principles, in particular with respect to the integrity of the single market and the customs union and the indivisibility of the four freedoms. ""It must also ensure the sovereignty of the United Kingdom and the protection of its internal market, while respecting the result of the 2016 referendum including with regard to the development of its independent trade policy and the ending of free movement of people between the Union and the United Kingdom."" Please upgrade your browser In the Commons, Mrs May faced calls from Brexiteer Conservative MPs, including former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, and Jeffrey Donaldson of the DUP, who have threatened to vote down the deal, to ditch the Northern Ireland ""backstop"" and come forward with the alternatives set out in the political declaration instead. Opponents of Brexit were also critical of the new document. Conservative MP Philip Lee, who quit the government in protest at its handling of Brexit, said it ""reads like a letter to Santa"", while Labour's Chuka Umunna, a leading supporter of the People's Vote campaign for a new referendum, said it was ""entirely aspirational and doesn't finalise anything"". Conservatives Sir Nicholas Soames and Nick Herbert were among a handful of MPs to speak out in favour of Mrs May's deal during the debate. Scottish Conservative MPs are also concerned that the declaration will not protect the interests of the UK fishing industry. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But the government insists the UK's ""red lines"" on fishing have been protected, and the text acknowledges the UK will be ""an independent coastal state"" with the rights and responsibilities that entails. A government source said the EU had wanted ""existing reciprocal access to fishing waters and resources [to] be maintained"" but this had been rejected. Post-Brexit who will lead Europe? The withdrawal agreement - what it all means DUP-Tory deal not dead, says Foster The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said Scotland's fishing rights had been ""thrown overboard like they were discarded fish"", adding, ""so much for taking back control, more like trading away Scotland's interests"". And Sammy Wilson, Brexit spokesman for the DUP, which has been in a confidence-and-supply agreement with the government, said the ""non-binding aspirational agreement"" had been drafted to ""help the prime minister, rather than mitigate the very damaging and dangerous draft withdrawal agreement"". Several EU countries have raised concerns about Mrs May's planned meeting with Mr Juncker on Saturday night, saying that it should not lead to any changes in the text. Germany has reiterated that Angela Merkel would not attend Sunday's meeting if the text has not been agreed in advance. Separately, EU diplomats have said the Spanish government ""sees the making of a compromise"" on the issue of Gibraltar.

"Salman Abedi killed 22 people in the bombing at Manchester Arena in May 2017 MPs reviewing the 2017 terror attacks say MI5 has accepted it made a mistake in not tracking the Manchester bomber. A report by the Intelligence and Security Committee said MI5 recognised it had moved ""too slowly"" to establish how dangerous Salman Abedi, 22, was. The security service had cause to monitor Abedi's return to the UK from Libya days before the attack in which 22 people died, the report said. Martin Hibbert, injured in the blast, said the truth was now coming out. And Dan Hett, from Survivors Against Terror - who lost his brother Martyn in the attack - said the ""litany of mistakes in 2017 must urgently be learnt from"". In wide-ranging criticisms, the committee said the government had also failed to fully learn lessons from attacks dating back 13 years. Abedi is believed to have been taught bomb-making while in Libya, before returning to Manchester in May last year to construct his device. He walked into the foyer of Manchester Arena, where thousands had been watching US singer Ariana Grande perform, and blew himself up. A previous report into the attack revealed that MI5 had planned to review the risks posed by Abedi - but the meeting was not scheduled to take place before the attack occurred. The Manchester bomb attack changed my life What we know about Manchester bomber Who were the victims? In its findings, the ISC said there had been ""no follow-up action"" after Abedi visited a jailed terrorist organiser from Manchester. Last December, an independent assessment of MI5's own secret review of the attack revealed for the first time that an opportunity had been missed to monitor Abedi's movements - which would have revealed his return to the UK from Libya, days before he struck. ""MI5 have since admitted that given the information they had on Abedi, they should have done so,"" said the committee. ""Abedi had been flagged for review but MI5's systems moved too slowly."" Since then, MPs said the security service had already changed its systems in an attempt to better identify potential extremists like him. The committee said one failing it had identified was so sensitive, it could not be shared publicly. But it added: ""What we can say is that there were a number of a failings in the handling of Salman Abedi's case. ""While it is impossible to say whether these would have prevented the devastating attack on 22 May, we have concluded that as a result of the failings, potential opportunities to prevent it were missed."" Manchester was a city in mourning after the attack Mr Hibbert, who was left paralysed by the explosion, welcomed the report's release. His daughter was also wounded as they left the arena when the bomb went off. ""It doesn't make things any easier but it means at last there is some compassion being shown and some accountability in terms of people saying 'We didn't do our job'. ""It's a start. It's just sad that it's taken 18 months,"" he said. Another survivor, Robby Potter, who took his 11-year-old daughter Tegan to the concert, said he was considering taking legal action against MI5. His injuries from 37 pieces of flying shrapnel have meant he's been unable to return to his job as a drainage engineer, and now drives lorries. ""I'd have more respect for them if they had said immediately after [the attack] 'we made a mistake - we underestimated this man',"" he said. ""I love my country but I was let down. This could have been stopped, and we're finding out now that it should have been stopped."" In their highly-critical report, MPs and peers on the committee also found: Measures to control access to chemicals needed for bomb-making were ""hopelessly out of date"" Communication companies were still failing to meet their social duties to detect terror planning online - and it recommended putting pressure on them by targeting their profits There had also been ""fundamental failings"" by the Home Office, police and Surrey County Council over their handling of the teenager who placed a bomb on the London Underground in September 2017 MI5 should rethink how it ""joins the dots"" on some suspects because it had failed to appreciate the potential dangers posed by Khalid Masood, the Westminster Bridge attacker, despite a trail of evidence over six years The committee also attacked the Home Office for failing to properly co-operate over its attempts to investigate how the Parsons Green attacker, Ahmed Hassan, went undetected. It had made ""multiple attempts"" to extract the ""full evidence"" from the Home Office - but the information had not been provided in time. ""This is unacceptable,"" said the committee. ""From what we have seen to date there were fundamental failings in the handling of this case by the Home Office, the police and Surrey County Council. ""This litany of errors will require a separate comprehensive review to which the Home Office must be directly answerable."" Salman Abedi was a ""closed subject of interest"" for MI5 - someone who had once been a cause of concern - but there had been an assessment on the available intelligence that he was not going to turn to violence. That meant the 22-year-old went into a pool of 20,000 closed SOIs - people who are not under active investigation anymore. What the review makes clear is that the system for triggering a rethink of individuals in that closed group was too slow to react to a changing picture - and the security service has acknowledged its processes didn't, on this occasion, deliver. The big problem is that intelligence on suspects is fragmentary. A British-Libyan young man travelling to Libya is not the stuff of red alerts. But his visit to a jailed recruiter and facilitator would have been a relevant piece of information for the review of Abedi that had been planned. That information hadn't reached MI5 before the attack. And that's why the committee says there are really serious questions to be answered by all arms of government over whether everyone is learning lessons from every terrorism conspiracy of recent years. The committee said that despite these concerns about government, it recognised that MI5 and the police had taken the mistakes seriously. ""We note that both MI5 and counter-terrorism policing have been thorough in their desire to learn from past mistakes,"" it said. ""We also know and acknowledge the determination with which they approach their work, which we regard as impressive. ""However, it has been striking how many of the issues which arose in relation to the 2017 terrorist attacks have been previously raised by this committee in our reports on the 7/7 attacks [in 2005] and on the killing of Fusilier Lee Rigby [in 2013]. ""We have previously made recommendations in all these areas yet the government failed to act on them. The lessons of last year's tragic events must now result in real action."" Home Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""We have updated our counter-terrorism strategy, introduced new legislation to allow threats to be disrupted earlier and have increased information-sharing with local authorities. ""We are also ensuring technology companies play their part by stopping terrorists from exploiting their platforms,"" he added. Scotland Yard said the police and MI5 have foiled 13 plots since the Westminster attack in March 2017. Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the head of counter-terrorism policing, said: ""We will not let the terrorists who carried out these appalling attacks to succeed in scaring and dividing us."" The Met was, he said, doing more now to improve the handling and assessment of intelligence and making better use of data. It is currently handling more than 700 live investigations, involving 3,000 people posing the biggest threat and another 20,000 who are also considered a concern. 22 March:Khalid Masood runs down and kills four people onWestminster Bridgebefore stabbing a policeman to death outside Parliament. 22 May:Salman Abedi, 22, detonates a home-made bomb inManchester Arena'sfoyer blowing crowds off their feet as they leave an Ariana Grande concert.

"Artwork: The extinct Hippopotamus gorgops was bigger than modern hippos, reaching lengths of 4.3m New research has disputed a longstanding view that early humans helped wipe out many of the large mammals that once roamed Africa. Today, Africa broadly has five species of massive, plant-eating mammal; but millions of years ago there were many more types of giant herbivore. Why so many types vanished is not known, but many experts have blamed our tool-using, meat-eating ancestors. Now, researchers say the mammal decline began long before humans appeared. Writing in the journal Science, Tyler Faith, from the Natural History Museum of Utah, and colleagues argue that long-term environmental change drove the extinctions. This mainly took the form of an expansion of grasslands, in response to falling atmospheric carbon dioxide (COâ) levels. ""Despite decades of literature asserting that early hominins (human relatives) impacted ancient African faunas, there have been few attempts to actually test this scenario or to explore alternatives,"" said Dr Faith. A transition from eating mainly vegetables and fruit to predominantly eating meat may have driven the evolution of humans' big brains. This transition occurred in concert with the development of stone tools, which would have allowed our ancestors to butcher the carcasses of animals; either as scavengers or hunters. Artwork: The extinct giraffe Sivatherium maurusium vanishes from the fossil record around 700,000 years ago To investigate whether humans played a role, the researchers compiled a seven-million-year record of herbivore extinctions in eastern Africa. They focused on the very largest species, the so-called ""megaherbivores"" which weigh more than 2,000lbs (907kg). Today, only elephants, hippos, giraffes and white and black rhinos fall into this category. But the three-million-year-old human relative ""Lucy"" (Australopithecus afarensis) shared her East African habitat with three species of giraffe, two species of rhino, a hippo and four elephant-like species. Australia extinction 'due to man' Human link to giant turtle's end The results of the analysis showed that over the last seven million years, some 28 lineages of large mammal went extinct in Africa. Furthermore, the onset of the herbivore decline began roughly 4.6 million years ago, and the rate of decline did not change following the appearance ofHomo erectus, one of the earliest human ancestors that could have contributed to the extinctions. ""This extinction process kicks in over a million years before the very earliest evidence for human ancestors making tools or butchering animal carcasses and well before the appearance of any hominin species realistically capable of hunting them, likeHomo erectus,"" said Dr Faith. The fossilised jawbone of a sabre-toothed cat from South Africa. The disappearance of massive herbivores may also have affected the carnivores that fed on them The researchers also examined records of climatic and environmental trends. They conclude that the climate is a much more likely culprit than humans. Climate change seems to have been behind the replacement of large shrubs and trees by grasslands. ""The key factor in the Plio-Pleistocene megaherbivore decline seems to be the expansion of grasslands, which is likely related to a global drop in atmospheric COâ over the last five million years,"" said co-author John Rowan, from University of Massachusetts Amherst. ""Low COâ levels favour tropical grasses over trees, and as a consequence savannas became less woody and more open through time. We know that many of the extinct megaherbivores fed on woody vegetation, so they seem to disappear alongside their food source."" The loss of big mammals in Africa could also explain other extinctions that have been blamed on our ancient ancestors. For example, some scientists have suggested that increasingly carnivorous early human groups led to a decline in predators and scavengers. ""We know there are also major extinctions among African carnivores at this time and that some of them, like saber-tooth cats, may have specialised on very large prey, perhaps juvenile elephants,"" said co-author Prof Paul Koch from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC). ""It could be that some of these carnivores disappeared with their megaherbivore prey."" Writing in the same issue of Science, RenÃ© Bobe and Susana Carvalho from the University of Oxford raised a few words of caution over the conclusions: ""It is not clear what ecological roles hominins played throughout the long evolutionary history of megaherbivores in Africa, and how these roles changed over time and varied across geographic space. ""Another question is when hominins became systematic predators of animals larger than themselves."" They added: ""The causes of megaherbivore decline are probably complex, multidimensional, and varied across time and space. The precise timing of key hominin behavioural innovations remains poorly constrained by the current archaeological and palaeontological records.""

""If we find that it gets to a level where we are going to lose control or where people are going to start getting hurt, we will close entry into the country for a period of time until we can get it under control,"" he told reporters. ""The whole border. I mean the whole border. Mexico will not be able to sell their cars into the United States where they make so many cars,"" he added. The migrants say they are fleeing poverty, violence and persecution Mr Trump's reference to lethal force came afterDefence Secretary James Mattis said military police at the border would be unarmed. ""They don't have guns in their hands, there is no armed element going in,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. On Thursday Mr Trump also warned that the US government could shut down next month if no more money was provided for a wall between the US and Mexico. ""Could there be a shutdown? There certainly could and it will be about border security, of which the wall is a part,"" he said. He has renewed his attacks after earlier saying a federal judge who blocked his executive order to deny illegal migrants the right to seek asylum was an ""Obama judge"". ""Judges must not legislate security and safety at the border. They know nothing about it and are making our country unsafe,"" he said in a tweet. It comes afterSupreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts took the unusual step of rebuking Mr Trump's criticism, telling the Associated Press that ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges"".

Almost 3,000 Central American migrants have arrived in the Mexican border city of Tijuana after crossing Mexico and parts of Central America. More than 2,750 have sought refuge in a shelter set up by the mayor's office. Hundreds of Tijuana residents have protested against the migrants' presenceand urged them to leave. This video can not be played Anti-migrant protesters clashed with a pro-migrant demonstrator in the Mexican city of Tijuana The town's mayor has said he expects the number of migrants in the city to reach 10,000 in the coming weeks. US officials have warned that anyone found entering the country illegally will face arrest, prosecution and deportation. The migrants say they are leaving their respective countries in the hope of building a better future for themselves and their families. Some say they have been threatened or mistreated by criminal gangs operating in their home towns. Many are travelling with their children whom they say they do not want to fall prey to the gangs. Others hope to get jobs abroad which will pay enough for them to send money to their relatives who stayed behind. Migrants, part of the caravan, en route to the Mexican border city of Tijuana Many say their dream is to reach the US. Some of them have relatives there already whom they hope to join; others have chosen it as their destination because they think they will earn higher salaries there than in Latin America. While Central Americans have long fled their homelands for the US and have sometimes joined forces along the way, the organised nature of this caravan is relatively new. Migrants are often kidnapped by people traffickers and drug gangs which force them to work for them. A large group such as this one is harder to target and therefore offers more protection.

"Police say they are seeking a woman in connection with a stabbing in the grounds of a hospital in Ayr. A female community support worker, 42, is being treated for serious injuries, which are not life-threatening. A woman has been arrested on what police described as an unrelated matter but she is said to be ""a person of interest in the inquiry"". Detectives said the site at Ailsa Hospital was no longer on a security lockdown. They are asking for the public's help to find a woman who was seen leaving the area shortly after the incident. She was wearing a dark woolly hat and a dark jacket. Supt Brian Shaw said: ""I am urging anyone who witnessed the attack to get in touch with us. I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who was in the area around 10.00am and has information about a woman who was seen leaving the area shortly after the 42-year-old woman was stabbed."" Police outside the hospital The area around the addiction services buildings remains taped off The woman is described as being about 5ft 2in to 5ft 3in tall, of slight build with a pale complexion. She was wearing a dark woolly hat and a dark jacket. Supt Shaw confirmed the victim had received treatment in hospital and was now ""sitting up in bed and speaking with detectives"". He said: ""She doesn't have any life-threatening injuries, but obviously this has been a very traumatic time for her."" He said the hospital was now open as normal, but there were ""increased high-visibility patrols in the area to reassure patients, staff and the wider public."" Allow Twitter content?

"Police have said they believe Novichok could remain a threat for up to 50 years if left in a sealed container. What do we know about how long the nerve agent poses a danger? The death of Dawn Sturgess is a potent reminder of just how dangerous Novichok is and why it is vital to work out how she came into contact with it. Police are searching for a contaminated container they think was handled by Ms Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley - who remains critically ill in hospital. Counter-terror chief Neil Basu said it was ""implausible"" the poisoning was not linked to the attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in early March. But withno guarantee that all traces of Novichok have been found, what is known about how long it lasts? All nerve agents poison in the same way, which is to inhibit the enzyme involved in regulating the body's messages along nerves and between nerves and muscle. The effect is devastating, with muscles compromised and nerves linked to other organs rendered ineffective. Glands also stop working properly and breathing becomes more difficult. How badly affected people are varies greatly - for example, some people are able to break down the chemicals three times as fast as others. The dose received and how long it takes to get medical treatment also influences how sick people become. How healthy someone is also makes a big difference - the more robust someone is, the better able they are to cope. So what do we know about Novichok and how long it remains in the environment? Regrettably, very little. There is insufficient scientific data to be certain about the time it takes for this chemical to degrade and for the threat it poses to end. Some people have suggested that it disappears relatively quickly and that the poisoning of Ms Sturgess and Mr Rowley is therefore a separate attack to the one on the Skripals. But that would be jumping to conclusions. Dawn Sturgess died on Sunday after being taken ill on 30 June Nerve agents fall into two categories in terms of how long they remain in the environment. ""Less persistent"" nerve agents - those that degrade more quickly - include a range of chemical weapons put into munitions for battlefield use. These substances - including tabun and sarin - are broken down by water and can evaporate. Because they can form vapours, they pose a danger through inhalation. Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Why Ebola keeps coming back Why North Korea is destroying its nuclear test site How big is the Kremlin's diplomatic network? ""More persistent"" nerve agents were produced to enable the military to contaminate areas for some time - thereby denying access to the enemy unless suitably clothed in protective gear. The recent hot weather in the UK illustrates how difficult it would be for soldiers to operate in such an environment. Those involved in searching for the Novichok container were able to remain in their protective suits for only about 30 minutes at a time. This group of nerve agents includes VX. They do not vaporise as easily and are what is referred to as a ""contact-hazard"". Uptake through the skin happens with all nerve agents but is the likely route of exposure for these ""persistent agents"". The chemical structure of what has been published about Novichok places this chemical in the more persistent category. And if stored in any container, the amount of time it remains a danger would be extended. The phrase ""Novichok"" applies to a group of advanced nerve agents - highly toxic chemicals that prevent the nervous system from working properly and can be fatal Nerve agents will take effect within minutes or even seconds if inhaled and slightly more slowly if exposure is the result of skin contamination Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian and was developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s Some versions of Novichok are thought to be five to eight times more toxic than the VX nerve agent the US says was used to kill North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's brother last year But even the ""non-persistent"" agent sarin can hang around. In 1992, I was part of a team collecting soil and bomb fragments from a site in Iraq, four years after a bomb had exploded. We found sarin under a fleck of paint on a bomb fragment. We were lucky, if you like, in our find - the agent was still present because it was a site of high contamination. Novichok: Murder inquiry after Dawn Sturgess dies What are Novichok agents and what do they do? Salisbury poisoning: What is Novichok? This also explains whyinspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have found sarin in Syria, months after the detonation of munitions. The police investigating the murder of Dawn Sturgess and the poisoning of Charlie Rowley and the Skripals face a daunting task. But they are being advised by very knowledgeable experts who are well aware of the dangers the Novichok agent poses. And no reminder is needed of how important it is to find the nerve agent ""container"" or other source of this latest poisoning.

"Police arrested four members of the family on Tuesday and their detention has been extended Four members of the same family have been arrested after a nine-year-old boy was beaten to death at his home in the eastern French city of Mulhouse. Police sources told local media that the boy had refused to do his homework and was hit with a broom handle. The boy's elder brother, sister and stepsister were all present at the time of the incident. Although his mother was not there, she too has been arrested and was aware of what was going on, reports say. The boy's death in September prompted a vigil in the centre of Mulhouse among residents who rallied round his parents. But the family's initial accounts of what had happened and the ensuing post-mortem examination prompted police to continue their investigation. Bruises were discovered on the boy's body, particularly on his feet, according to Alsace website DNA. Although he had suffered a cardiac arrest, pathologists said the cause of death had been the blows he had suffered, DNA reported. A police source was quoted as saying he had been struck by blunt objects. The boy's mother had been away from home on a business trip but had actively encouraged his punishment because he did not want to do his homework, French media said. Domestic violence is 'France's shame' Egypt schoolboy dies after beating Fresh call for smacking ban in the home The four members of the family were being held in custody in Mulhouse on Thursday and were due to appear before the local prosecutor ahead of a judicial investigation. Although the 19-year-old elder brother is suspected of carrying out the killing, an investigating judge will try to shed further light on the tragedy. The boy's death comes at a time when France's National Assembly is about to consider a ban on smacking. The two proposals are for children to be entitled to an education free of violence, and for those in parental authority to be banned from using ""means of humiliation such as physical or verbal violence, corporal punishment and moral abuse"".

"This video can not be played Michele Jacques found rent-to-own meant paying over the odds for her cooker Plans to cap the costs of buying domestic goods such as TVs and fridges through rent-to-own shops have been welcomed by the stores' customers. Michele Jacques, from Droylsden in Manchester, ended up spending Â£700 on a cooker as a result of interest rates that can reach 99% a year. Had she gone to a High Street shop, it could have cost her as little as Â£250. The proposals from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) mean rent-to-own customers would pay much less. Rent-to-own customers make monthly payments, in effect renting goods until they have paid in full. ""Interest rates should be capped. They shouldn't be allowed to make so much profit from vulnerable people,"" said Ms Jacques. ""It does make you frustrated. It makes you angry."" She said the cap proposed by the FCA was ""the correct thing to do"". First, the FCA will limit the amount of interest that customers pay. From April 2019, they will pay no more in interest than the cost of the product itself. So if a cooker costs Â£300, they will pay no more than Â£600 in total, including the cost of credit. However, rent-to-own shops will still be able to charge for insurance and warranties on top of that. Second, the cost of the goods themselves will be limited. Shops will be able to charge no more than the median - i.e the middle price - of three mainstream retailers. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA said: ""Today's measures are designed to bring down very high prices in the rent-to-own sector, which is used by some of the most financially vulnerable in our society. ""A cap will prevent firms charging over the odds for essential everyday items like cookers or washing machines. We believe a cap is the only intervention that will effectively tackle the highest prices."" The FCA says the cap could save about 400,000 consumers up to Â£22.7m a year. In a series of examples, someone who buys a Hotpoint cooker on a rent-to-own basis could save as much as Â£606 over a three-year period, or Â£3.88 a week. Someone buying an Indesit fridge freezer through rent-to-own could save Â£360 a year, or Â£2.31 a week. The main providers of rent-to-own goods are Brighthouse and PerfectHome. A BrightHouse spokesman said: ""BrightHouse has been working closely and constructively with the FCA over a number of years. This comprehensive process has led to many changes in the way we operate as a business and serve our customers. ""We're going to carefully consider today's announcement, while continuing to offer those excluded from mainstream credit ways to get the household goods they need."" PerfectHome said it too would consider the plans in detail. The proposed cap was welcomed by the debt charity StepChange, The Money Advice Trust, and by  Citizens Advice. ""This cap is a victory for people who struggle with the runaway costs of rent-to-own agreements,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""A cap gets to the heart of the problem by stopping costs from spiralling out of control and pushing people into further debt. ""Our evidence has repeatedly shown that well-designed caps can reduce the harm high-cost credit can cause, as they have done in the payday loan market."" However Andrew Hagger, a personal finance expert at Moneycomms, said rent-to-own goods will remain expensive. ""The measures are long overdue and will help, but you have to question whether a 100% mark up is acceptable. It's a big shift in the right direction, but in essence customers can end up paying double the retail price which still seems excessive.""

"Health service staff in NI will be able to receive pay rises of more than 1% after extra money was allocated to the Department of Health. Staff in other departments will only be able to get rises of above 1% if it can be paid for with efficiency savings. Health has received an additional Â£109m as a consequence of increased funding in the recent Westminster budget. Public sector pay was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 a year. Since 2013, rises have been capped at 1%. NI health workers want action on pay gap NHS pay: Unions agree deal for 1.3 million staff What Northern Ireland budget means for health and education Public sector pay was frozen for two years in 2010, except for those earning less than Â£21,000 Analysis: BBC News NI Health Correspondent Marie-Louise Connolly At last, the Department of Health is in a position to make a formal pay offer to trade unions. If agreed, workers could see the difference in their packets in the new year. The offer is based on applying this year's English NHS pay settlement to current pay rates in Northern Ireland. If it goes ahead would represent an estimated 3% increase, or slightly more than Â£60m, on the pay bill for staff on Agenda for Change terms and conditions. The offer has been a long time coming with unions threatening a consultative ballot on industrial action. Read morehere. A statement from the Department of Finance (DoF) said: ""With pay policy now in place for 2018/19, this will enable departments and other public sector employers to engage with their staff groups and develop pay proposals."" A health union described the pay offer from the Department of Finance as ""too little too late."" ""We need to see the roll-out of the Agenda for Change restructuring which is already ongoing across the rest of the UK and which has been fully funded by the Treasury.,"" said Kevin McAdam from Unite. ""Because of the failure to review the grades of healthcare workers here, the pay gap with those doing the same jobs in England, Scotland and Wales has been even further exacerbated. ""As an example, a paramedic in Northern Ireland is paid Â£28,462 - a full Â£8,000 less than they would receive in Scotland."" Pay policy would normally have to be agreed by the finance minister. Recent legislation passed at Westminster allowed the DoF to make the decision in the absence of a minister.

"Noel Edmonds has formally kick-started his legal action against Lloyds Bank as he enters the I'm a Celebrity jungle. The TV personality is seeking at least Â£30m over an alleged scam involving staff at the Reading branch of HBOS, which was later bought by Lloyds. He claims his former firm Unique Group was destroyed because of fraud. Lloyds has rejected the basis of his claim. On Friday his lawyers served Lloyds with a pre-case letter to initiate action, which could start next month. A spokesperson for Lloyds Banking Group said it would review the letter before responding. ""We fully understand the anguish he feels at the failure of his businesses, but on the information we have seen so far we simply cannot agree that this is the result of actions taken by the former HBOS business. ""We are content for the matter to be considered by a court if he pursues his legal action. However we cannot allow ourselves to be pressed into paying out money without cause just because an individual uses their celebrity status to attack us."" The spokesperson said 71 of the 72 customers affected by the fraud at the HBOS Impaired Assets office based in Reading have been made compensation offers and 64 had been accepted. It comes as Mr Edmonds says he will use his appearance in the ITV reality show to promote his cause in his battle for compensation from Lloyds. The former Deal Or No Deal host said in videos released to the Press Association that Lloyds would ""have to pay up"", adding: ""I am totally convinced at trial we will win."" ""It's not going to do any harm to be in the jungle on ITV at peak time every single day for a few weeks,"" he said. Lloyds has set aside Â£100m for victims of the fraud at the hands of HBOS Reading staff between 2003 and 2007. Corrupt staff from the HBOS branch were jailed last yearfor a Â£245m loans scam between 2003 and 2007 that destroyed several businesses. It was revealed they squandered the profits on prostitutes and luxury holidays.

"Shoppers are scrambling to buy ""Kevin the carrot"" soft toy featured in Aldi's Christmas advert. Customers of the discount chain have taken to social media to complain that supplies of Kevin, his wife Katie and three baby carrots have run out. The Â£3.99 version is not available online and there are reports of queues and even fights at the stores. A spokesman said demand for the toys, which went on sale today, had been ""exceptionally"" high. A 100cm Kevin the carrot toy - on sale for Â£19.99 - was also sold out online. The queues in the stores were not quite on the scale of those in the summer when customers were clambering to buy Build-A-Bear in an offer - later abandoned -  to buy any bear for the price of their child's age.

"This video can not be played Daniela Tejada said her husband Matthew Hedges was ""scared"" in court The wife of a British academic jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates says the British government put UK interests above his right to freedom. Daniela Tejada spoke to the BBC shortly after returning to the UK from Abu Dhabi where she saw Durham University'sMatthew Hedges sentenced to life. The 31-year-old denies spying butprosecutors said he had confessed. Ms Tejada has arrived for a meeting in London with the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Mr Hunt met the UAE ambassador in London earlier for ""a very frank conversation"" and Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the situation, which was ""being raised at the highest level"" in the UAE. Hedges, who is originally from Exeter, said he had been in the country conducting research on the UAE's security strategy for his PhD thesis when he was arrested at Dubai airport on 5 May. Daniela Tejada met Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to discuss her husband's case According to the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner, sources in the UAE claim ""espionage material"" was found on Hedges' laptop. However, Mr Hunt has insisted there was no basis for the spy charges. Ms Tejada told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office had been ""stepping on eggshells instead of taking a firm stance"" and only began to take her husband's case seriously once he had beenreleased on bail on 29 Octoberafter enduring months of solitary confinement. ""I was under the impression they were putting their interests with the UAE above a British citizen's rightful freedom and welfare,"" Ms Tejada said. She said she had contacted the Foreign Office ""on a weekly basis"" since her husband's arrest in May. ""They just disregarded my requests, they said it wasn't part of their job, it wasn't part of their duty,"" she continued. ""On one occasion, one of the case workers said the Foreign Office did not have a duty of care so weren't obliged to make such representations."" Ms Tejada said she felt the Foreign Office had disregarded her early requests for help She said: ""I believe they should have taken a firmer stance from the beginning, if not publicly then through their private representations. ""This is something they failed to do throughout. ""He was being detained in unacceptable conditions for something that he didn't do."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said his ""heart goes out"" to Hedges and his family but that Mr Hunt had ""raised this case personally with the crown prince on 12 November"". He told Today: ""The Foreign Office has been acting on (Hedges') behalf at the highest possible levels."" Following a question in the House Lords, Baroness Goldie (Conservative) said consulate staff had met Hedges on six occasions, ""three before his recent bail and three whilst on bail"". She said Mr Hunt was also ""urgently seeking a call"" with the UAE's Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. News and updates from the North East Does UAE stability come at a price? United Arab Emirates profile Ms Tejada said she had been unable to speak to her husband since he was sentenced but she could ""imagine he is just as distraught as I am"". ""He was very, very scared standing in front of the judge,"" she said, because he was aware of the possibility of receiving an arbitrary judgement. ""I asked him to look at me if he was feeling too nervous and he tried to do so on a couple of occasions but was asked to face the judge."" She said Hedges was shaking when the translator told him the sentence and ""asked to double check if he had heard it right"". Matthew Hedges was arrested in the UAE in May Ms Tejada said there had been no due process, adding: ""He was put through so much strain for six months that absolutely nothing he said or did could be used against him. ""Anything used against Matt is completely unfounded."" Mr Hedges' family claim he signed a document written in Arabic - a language he cannot speak or read - that later transpired to be a confession. This came after he was interrogated without a lawyer or consular help, his family added. Ms Tejada later told Reuters: ""Handing a life sentence to an innocent researcher who held the UAE in high regard speaks volumes about their lack of tolerance and respect for human life."" UAE Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi said Hedges had ""confessed in detail to his crimes"" and was ""accorded full rights"" with a ""fair and transparent trial"". Abdulla Al Naqbi, head of the Department of Legal Affairs for the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs, added: ""Compelling and powerful evidence was presented in court. That included information extracted from his personal electronic devices by expert forensic analysis techniques, evidence provided by UAE intelligence agencies, witness testaments and Mr Hedges' own confession. ""The case was heard by three judges in the security division of the Higher Federal Court who met a total of four times. In the first session on 3 October Mr Hedges was asked whether he had proper representation and was offered the services of a court-appointed lawyer, which he accepted. ""It is not true that he was asked to sign documents he did not understand."" The ministry said the UAE was ""determined to protect its important strategic relationship with a key ally"" and added that it hoped both sides could find ""an amicable solution"" to the case."" The UAE attorney general previously said the sentence - which could see the academic serve up to 25 years in jail before being deported - was not final as he had the right to appeal. Frank Gardner, security correspondent, BBC News Britain has a very deep and quite long-standing defence relationship with the UAE - it is an ally. There are roughly 200 serving British personnel permanently based in the UAE. There is an airbase called Al Minhad just south of Dubai where RAF Typhoons and Tornadoes are rotating in and out, including for flights to Afghanistan. There is a port called Port Zayed which is the most visited Royal Navy port in the world. And hundreds of Emirati officers are trained at Sandhurst military academy. Britain has got a very close defence, security and counter-terrorism relationship with the UAE and though there is no suggestion of that being threatened, if the situation escalates, the calls to reconsider that relationship will increase. The suggestion Britain would send a spy makes no sense. I'm sure MI6 would use academics to spy on a place if they could, but only in hard-to-target countries. I cannot imagine what an academic could get out of the UAE that the UK couldn't get by asking the UAE directly. There is nothing I can see that Matthew Hedges has done which in any way would constitute spying. There are far greater sensitivities there than in this country - somebody has reported him to the authorities saying he is asking suspicious questions. I've known someone, who was a businessman in Dubai - a former British army officer - who was arrested because he upset the wrong person and didn't have the connections that would get him out of jail. Prof Clive Jones, Hedges' supervisor at Durham University, said there would now have to be ""some kind of moratorium"" on sending students to do field work in the UAE and the wider Gulf region. He said Hedges had been looking at civil-military relations in the UAE since the Arab Spring and ""there was nothing clandestine or covert"" about the material he had. Prof Jones said there had been no ""inkling"" of any danger and Hedges was ""no stranger"" to the UAE, having ""lived there on and off"" since he was nine years old. This video can not be played Shana Marshall, a friend of Matthew Hedges, says she is ""shocked"" at the UAE's verdict Prof Jones said: ""He knew many of the people he was going out to interview, so again it is utterly bizarre, and indeed perverse, and indeed a miscarriage of justice, that this has befallen him."" Conservative MP and former soldier Johnny Mercer said it would be ""absolutely disgraceful,external"" if Ms Tejada's claims were found to be true, adding: ""We have no interests with the UAE that outweigh the rights and freedoms of our citizens abroad."" He earlier said the case was ""unacceptable"" and ""consequences must be immediate until he is released"".

"Lina Tantash stalked her ex-boyfriend Jarlath Rice for 10 years sending thousands of abusive messages A ""vicious, manipulative"" stalker who turned her ex's life into a ""living nightmare"" after he broke a so-called love contract has been jailed for four years. ""Devious"" Lina Tantash, 44, waged a 10-year harassment campaign against Jarlath Rice, Lewes Crown Court heard. She bombarded him with 20,000 abusive texts, hacked his voicemails and sent Â£200 worth of pizza to his work. Tantash was convicted of stalking at an earlier hearing. Sentencing her, Recorder Stephen Lennard told Tantash: ""You are a vicious, manipulative and devious woman."" Prosecutor Ryan Richter told the court Mr Rice and Tantash had a fling in Dublin in 2007. Despite being together only a few weeks, she insisted he sign a love contract she had drawn up in exchange for her paying off his debts, Mr Richter said. The agreement included him marrying her within a year, not changing his number and speaking to her by phone every night, the court heard. When he tried to end things, moving to Brighton for a new job in 2015, she followed him. Tantash set up 11 email accounts - with addresses including loveyouandmissyousomuch and seemefridaynightibegyou - and would send messages and selfies to Mr Rice, the court heard. Jarlath Rice was sent thousands of abusive messages and physically assaulted In 2017 he was working at DV8 - a college for vulnerable young people - which Tantash called up to 40 times a day asking for him. Sometimes she put on an American accent to disguise her voice, Mr Richter told the court. During an open evening at DV8 in October 2017, Tantash opened a Just Eat account in the college's name and had Â£200 worth of food sent there. She also targeted Mr Rice's colleague Sarah Borland, wrongly assuming the pair were romantically involved. Ms Borland received a string of abusive phone calls and emails containing threats to kill her if she didn't leave Mr Rice alone, the court heard. Tantash also bombarded Mr Rice's family with calls in a bid to contact him telling them Mr Rice owed her 50,000 euros (Â£44,332). On another occasion, she told a work associate of Mr Rice to hand over his contact details ""for the sake of your children"", Mr Richter said. In a victim impact statement read out in court, Mr Rice said Tantash's behaviour had amounted to ""an aggressive and abusive dismantling"" of his life. Life ""had become a living nightmare"", leading him to fear for his family and suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts, he said. Stalking trebles as prosecution rates fall Stalking victim: 'I didn't get justice' Stalkers to be tagged under new scheme Mr Rice also said he was physically assaulted, and repeatedly moved house to escape Tantash. Teresa Mulrooney, defending, spoke of the shame Tantash faced and how the news had reached her elderly father in Jordan. Addressing the judge directly, Tantash said: ""I'm happy to leave the UK if you want me to."" After the hearing, Felicity Lineham, from the CPS, said: ""Her behaviour was carefully planned to cause maximum distress but all the time she saw nothing wrong with what she was doing or the impact it was having on her victims.""

"The CUBO housing units can be manufactured in a week, and built in just four hours A 23-year-old designer has won a top Â£50,000 ($64,385) prize after creating a low-cost bamboo housing unit to address the Philippines' slum crisis. Earl Patrick Forlales' design takes just four hours to construct, and at Â£50 per sq metre it's also affordable. He told the BBC World Service: ""It's a functional home on its own, but it's more than just a house. ""It's designed to turn community waste into energy and other valuable resources."" Mr Forlales, who comes from Manila and studied material science engineering, will use the prize money from the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Cities for our Future competition to start work on his ""CUBO"" communal housing units next year. Manila has a population of 12 million people, four million of whom live in impoverished slums. Some 2.5 million more workers are expected to arrive over the next three years - placing the fast-growing city under housing strain. BBC Reel: Bali's beautiful bamboo home Philippines country profile Mr Forlales' modular CUBO homes will be used to house the newcomers, before being extended to the slums at large. Mr Forlales will start work on the first of his modular homes in 2019 The project is designed to help the influx of workers moving to Manila's slums The young designer was inspired by his grandparent's rural bamboo house - though his bamboo will be treated and laminated for a 10-times-longer lifecycle. The material is an eco-friendly choice, as it releases 35% more oxygen than trees and can be harvested annually without causing soil degradation. The CUBO homes also have slanted roofs to catch rainwater, and stilts to keep out floodwater. Why bamboo is booming again in Taiwan Watch: Travelling the world on a bamboo bike Mr Forlales has picked out a plot of land in Manila for the project's first homes, and hopes his design can help other crowded cities too. In theory, it's viable anywhere that bamboo grows - which includes South-East Asia, and parts of Africa and Latin America. He plans to raise funds for the project by selling waste plastic to factories. Bamboo is readily available in the Philippines, and can be grown on poor-quality land At Â£50-60 per sq metre, the housing is considered highly affordable ""CUBO started as nothing more than an idea, conceived while spending time at my grandparent's house - it is incredible to think that it now will become a reality,"" Mr Forlales said. ""I would like to thank RICS for the opportunity to develop the idea, and look forward to working with them to put this money to good use in Manila, and then hopefully elsewhere around the world."" Earl Patrick Forlales hopes the design can also be used in other overcrowded cities Bamboo back in business for Taiwan Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Michael Ron David Kadar (R) was arrested in the Israeli town of Ashkelon in March 2017 An American-Israeli man has been sentenced to 10 years in jail after being convicted of making thousands of hoax threats to Jewish centres in the US, UK and other countries. Michael Ron David Kader, 20, from southern Israel, was found guilty in June of making more than 2,000 threats. He threatened to bomb or attack Jewish schools, community centres, police stations, airports and airlines. It led to fears among Jewish leaders of a resurgence in anti-Semitism. 'Disruption and anxiety' in US Jewish centres Muslims offer to guard US Jewish sites In February 2017, several British Jewish schools were targeted and the Jewish Museum in London was evacuated after bomb threats attributed to him. In other incidents, a British Airways flight from London to New York was evacuated and searched after landing, and French and Swiss fighter jets were scrambled ready to intercept an El Al flight. Bomb threats were also made to a number of Jewish community centres in parts of the US, and the Israeli embassy and Anti-Defamation League in Washington DC. Kadar was arrested in the Israeli town of Ashkelon in March 2017 following a joint investigation by the Israeli and US authorities, including the FBI. His trial was told he used the internet to make hoax telephone calls to the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia - often disguising his voice as a woman, and using sophisticated software to cover his tracks. Some of the offences were committed while he was under the age of 18. Kadar's parents argued that he had a brain tumour that caused autism and other mental problems, and that he should not be considered legally competent. This video can not be played 'Our son is not responsible for his actions' But the judge, while acknowledging Kadar was autistic, said he ""has a high IQ and understands his deeds very well"". The ruling from the Tel Aviv district court for youth said that Kadar would have received a much longer sentence if not for his medical condition. Kadar was not named in Israeli courts because he was tried as a minor, buthe was identified in indictment papers issued by the US.,external 'Our son should not be locked up' Video, 00:00:50'Our son should not be locked up' Israel holds teen over US bomb threats Ex-journalist held over US Jewish threats Muslims offer to guard US Jewish sites 'Disruption and anxiety' in US Jewish centres Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Thedraft political declaration,externalon the future relationship between the EU and the UK, after Brexit, is out. Theresa May describes it as the right deal for the UK. A few points to rememberâ¦ This is not a legally binding document. It's not very long either, but it has grown from last week's seven-page outline to 26 pages. It sits alongside the 585-page Draft Withdrawal Agreement (which will be legally binding if it gets ratified). This is also a draft, agreed by negotiators, but it still needs to be approved by the leaders of all 28 EU countries at a summit scheduled to take place on Sunday. Don't expect major changes. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened - currently after 29 March 2019. It contains plenty of aspirations involving shared interests, close partnerships and ambitious co-operation, but many of the details are still to come. Here's an initial look at what's in the text: A reminder that this really is about everything, not just about trade: the entire scope of the future relationship between the UK and its nearest neighbours. Both sides want that relationship to be as close and co-operative as possible but that aspiration will be tested in the years ahead. Again, it's worth emphasising that this is not a legally binding document, so there are no guarantees about what the post-Brexit world will look like. And no-one can say for certain how long it will all take to negotiate. The bottom line of both parties is included early on. Anything that is negotiated must be consistent with the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. And nothing will be agreed that threatens the sovereignty of the United Kingdom. As we've seen for months now, the issue of the Irish border is where the combination of these core principles becomes most complicated. So trade in goods should be ""as close as possible"", but that's not the same as being frictionless. It leaves a lot of wriggle room in negotiations, with no guarantee of the final outcome. The two sides are committing themselves to an ""ambitious, wide-ranging and balanced"" economic partnership, based on a comprehensive free trade agreement. But there is also repeated emphasis that there must be a level playing field, which ensures open and fair competition. The more economic rights you retain, the EU is reminding the UK, the more obligations to which you have to sign up. When the outline of this draft emerged last week, this was a notion that raised alarm bells for many supporters of Brexit. Dominic Raab mentioned it in his resignation statement. Their fear, which will not be dispelled by this draft text, is that temporary customs arrangements could easily turn into some form of permanent customs union, preventing the UK from doing its own trade deals on goods around the world. The government denies this, and argues that there is nothing wrong in wanting ambitious customs arrangements in the future, including the need to avoid checks on what are known as ""rules of origin"". The declaration also mentions explicitly an ""independent trade policy"" for the UK in the future. We are, this emphasises, open to any solution that will avoid the proposed backstop solution, to keep the Irish border open. That includes technological and other solutions that critics of the Brexit negotiations say have been ignored for too long. The trouble is that technological solutions that avoid the need for any border infrastructure are not in operation anywhere in the world. UK officials see this as a key sentence, which suggests there is plenty of room for manoeuvre in the negotiations to come. It makes clear, they argue, that it is not the case that the UK can only have either a basic free trade agreement (like Canada) or membership of the single market (like Norway), with nothing in-between. But none of the language here commits the EU to anything specific. As expected, the regulation of financial services will be based on a system of ""equivalence"" and the aim is to negotiate the details in this key sector before the end of June 2020. There's nothing in the language here to suggest that the UK will get better terms than any other third country dealing with the EU - but that will be a key negotiating aim. There are also plenty of aspirational words on ""ambitious and comprehensive"" plans for the service sector in general, but there is an awful lot to negotiate. There are plenty of nods towards the way the world economy is changing, and the importance of comprehensive agreements on data. The UK hopes that in the negotiations to come, it can be well positioned to take advantage of new technologies and the digital economy. But the EU has already made it clear that the UK cannot expect to have the same access to all EU databases - in various economic and security areas - as it would have as an EU member state. This fulfils the prime minister's pledge that the UK will take back control of its borders and free movement of EU citizens to the UK will come to an end. But it means, of course, that free movement for UK citizens travelling to the EU will also stop. The document says both sides want to preserve visa-free travel for short-term visits (don't worry about your holidays) but it suggests by implication that visas could be introduced for longer stays. There is neutral language here, including the ""best endeavours"" principle that commits both sides to doing everything they can to reach a deal. But that disguises the fact that there are still deep disagreements on fishing, and on getting the right balance between access for UK produce to EU markets, and access for EU boats to UK fishing waters. Expect this one to run and run, because the UK is not alone in having a vocal fishing lobby with more political power than its overall contribution to the economy might suggest. There is a lot in this document on security - both on internal police co-operation and on broader foreign policy and defence co-operation. The EU needs the UK in many of these areas, but the draft makes clear that - on internal security matters in particular - there is a variety of legal and technical issues to overcome. We can expect, though, that UK and EU foreign policy will be co-ordinated as closely as possible in the future. Rather like the Draft Withdrawal Agreement, the political declaration envisages a system of dispute resolution involving a joint committee and an arbitration panel. But once again, on matters of EU law (and there will be a lot of that involved in any future relationship) the final word will rest with the European Court of Justice. The government will point out that after Brexit the direct jurisdiction of the ECJ in the UK will come to an end. There is a plethora of other issues in the draft document that this article hasn't covered: transport, energy, intellectual property and so on. Both sides say they hope all these issues and more can be wrapped up by the end of 2020. It's an ambitious timetable.

"Police arrested four members of the family on Tuesday and their detention has been extended Four members of the same family have been arrested after a nine-year-old boy was beaten to death at his home in the eastern French city of Mulhouse. Police sources told local media that the boy had refused to do his homework and was hit with a broom handle. The boy's elder brother, sister and stepsister were all present at the time of the incident. Although his mother was not there, she too has been arrested and was aware of what was going on, reports say. The boy's death in September prompted a vigil in the centre of Mulhouse among residents who rallied round his parents. But the family's initial accounts of what had happened and the ensuing post-mortem examination prompted police to continue their investigation. Bruises were discovered on the boy's body, particularly on his feet, according to Alsace website DNA. Although he had suffered a cardiac arrest, pathologists said the cause of death had been the blows he had suffered, DNA reported. A police source was quoted as saying he had been struck by blunt objects. The boy's mother had been away from home on a business trip but had actively encouraged his punishment because he did not want to do his homework, French media said. Domestic violence is 'France's shame' Egypt schoolboy dies after beating Fresh call for smacking ban in the home The four members of the family were being held in custody in Mulhouse on Thursday and were due to appear before the local prosecutor ahead of a judicial investigation. Although the 19-year-old elder brother is suspected of carrying out the killing, an investigating judge will try to shed further light on the tragedy. The boy's death comes at a time when France's National Assembly is about to consider a ban on smacking. The two proposals are for children to be entitled to an education free of violence, and for those in parental authority to be banned from using ""means of humiliation such as physical or verbal violence, corporal punishment and moral abuse"".

"This video can not be played Michele Jacques found rent-to-own meant paying over the odds for her cooker Plans to cap the costs of buying domestic goods such as TVs and fridges through rent-to-own shops have been welcomed by the stores' customers. Michele Jacques, from Droylsden in Manchester, ended up spending Â£700 on a cooker as a result of interest rates that can reach 99% a year. Had she gone to a High Street shop, it could have cost her as little as Â£250. The proposals from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) mean rent-to-own customers would pay much less. Rent-to-own customers make monthly payments, in effect renting goods until they have paid in full. ""Interest rates should be capped. They shouldn't be allowed to make so much profit from vulnerable people,"" said Ms Jacques. ""It does make you frustrated. It makes you angry."" She said the cap proposed by the FCA was ""the correct thing to do"". First, the FCA will limit the amount of interest that customers pay. From April 2019, they will pay no more in interest than the cost of the product itself. So if a cooker costs Â£300, they will pay no more than Â£600 in total, including the cost of credit. However, rent-to-own shops will still be able to charge for insurance and warranties on top of that. Second, the cost of the goods themselves will be limited. Shops will be able to charge no more than the median - i.e the middle price - of three mainstream retailers. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA said: ""Today's measures are designed to bring down very high prices in the rent-to-own sector, which is used by some of the most financially vulnerable in our society. ""A cap will prevent firms charging over the odds for essential everyday items like cookers or washing machines. We believe a cap is the only intervention that will effectively tackle the highest prices."" The FCA says the cap could save about 400,000 consumers up to Â£22.7m a year. In a series of examples, someone who buys a Hotpoint cooker on a rent-to-own basis could save as much as Â£606 over a three-year period, or Â£3.88 a week. Someone buying an Indesit fridge freezer through rent-to-own could save Â£360 a year, or Â£2.31 a week. The main providers of rent-to-own goods are Brighthouse and PerfectHome. A BrightHouse spokesman said: ""BrightHouse has been working closely and constructively with the FCA over a number of years. This comprehensive process has led to many changes in the way we operate as a business and serve our customers. ""We're going to carefully consider today's announcement, while continuing to offer those excluded from mainstream credit ways to get the household goods they need."" PerfectHome said it too would consider the plans in detail. The proposed cap was welcomed by the debt charity StepChange, The Money Advice Trust, and by  Citizens Advice. ""This cap is a victory for people who struggle with the runaway costs of rent-to-own agreements,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""A cap gets to the heart of the problem by stopping costs from spiralling out of control and pushing people into further debt. ""Our evidence has repeatedly shown that well-designed caps can reduce the harm high-cost credit can cause, as they have done in the payday loan market."" However Andrew Hagger, a personal finance expert at Moneycomms, said rent-to-own goods will remain expensive. ""The measures are long overdue and will help, but you have to question whether a 100% mark up is acceptable. It's a big shift in the right direction, but in essence customers can end up paying double the retail price which still seems excessive.""

"Facebook said it had Mr Soros investigated after he had called it a ""menace"" One of George Soros's top officials has called on US politicians to probe Facebook, after the social network confirmed that it had hired a PR firm to make claims about the financier. The head of Mr Soros's grant-making networkclaimed Facebook had smeared the philanthropist,external, adding ""this needs independent, congressional oversight"". Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's deputy chief, has also clarified her role. She said she had been told of the PR firm but had not remembered its name. The latest developments follow the social network's decision to publish a memo by its departing communications chief, Elliot Schrage. In it, he confirmed Facebook had directedthe PR firm Definers to investigate Soros's links,externalto the Freedom from Facebook campaign, which is seeking the company's break-up. Mr Schrage added that related documents were then sent to journalists on Facebook's behalf. The memo had originally been sent to Facebook's staff and had already been leakedto the news site Techcrunch,external. But its re-publication by Facebook represented the first confirmation that Definers had not been engaged in a rogue operation. Patrick Gaspard, president of Mr Soros's Open Society Foundations, responded by calling for an official investigation, and suggested that Facebook had deliberately timed the revelation to coincide with the US Thanksgiving holiday.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. In addition to publishing Mr Schrage's message, Facebook also issued an update from its chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg. A week ago, she wrotethat she had not known that Facebook had hired Definers,external, the PR firm involved, nor knew about the work it had done on her company's behalf. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg had also described both himself and his deputy as having been kept ""out of the loop"". Ms Sandberg now acknowledges that she had in fact been told about the company. ""Last week, I didn't remember a firm called Definers,"" she wrote. ""I asked our team to look into the work Definers did for us and to double-check whether anything had crossed my desk, ""Some of their work was incorporated into materials presented to me and I received a small number of emails where Definers was referenced."" Facebook appeals against Cambridge Analytica fine Facebook ads urge its staff to leak secrets Mark Zuckerberg, missing in inaction Sheryl Sandberg has denied being involved in Definers' actions Ms Sandberg added that she rejected claims that her firm had sought to put the spotlight on Mr Soros in order to exploit racist conspiracy theories against him. ""It was never anyone's intention to play into an anti-Semitic narrative against Mr Soros or anyone else. Being Jewish is a core part of who I am and our company stands firmly against hate,"" she wrote. Some company-watchers have suggested that Facebook's decision to publish the memo marks an attempt to protect Ms Sandberg. She had reportedly angered ""many people"" within her firm by attempting to distance herself from the controversy,according to an earlier report by the Wall Street Journal,external, which said she had a reputation for closely managing Facebook's media strategies.

Mr Schrage wrote that he took responsibility for the affair. He said that his team had only asked Definers to look into Mr Soros after the billionaire had described the social network as being a ""menace to society"". But Mr Schrage provided no evidence that Mr Soros was more directly involved in the campaign. And although he acknowledged that he ""should have known of the decision to expand [Definers'] mandate,"" he did not address specifically how he thought the PR firm had overstepped the mark. His memo did, however, touch on the fact that Facebook has become prone to leaks. ""I'm deeply disappointed that so much internal discussion and finger pointing has become public,"" Mr Schrage wrote. ""This is a serious threat to our culture and ability to work together in difficult times."" The New York Times has also published,externala follow-up report to its original expose about Facebook and Definers. Definers is accused of having worked against Tim Cook It contains claims that Definers also engaged in a campaign against Apple at a time the PR firm was working for the chip-maker Qualcomm - the two tech firms are involved in a long-running legal battle. The report alleges that Definers promoted the idea that Tim Cook might seek to become US President in 2020, which the newspaper suggested had been done to undermine the Apple chief executive's relationship with President Trump. The BBC has contacted all three companies for comment but has not had a response. The NYT did, however, publish a statement from Definers saying its work was ""absolutely no different than what public affairs firms do every day for their clients across industries and issues across the country"".

This is report stage debate, where MPs can pick apart the bill and suggest amendments, as well as vote on changes they think should be made.

This is followed by the second readings of the Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Bill; and the Homes (Fit for Human Habitation Bill) - which both cleared the Commons with government support, and have a good chance of becoming law. Private members' bills House of CommonsParliament The purpose of this bill is to create a new civil Stalking Protection Order to protect members of
the public. The new order will:  The new order is designed for use particularly in cases where the stalking occurs outside a domestic abuse context, or where the perpetrator is not a
current or former intimate partner of the victim - so-called âstranger stalkingâ. The bill is designed to provide the police with an additional tool to protect
victims of stalking. Read more about the bill:Devon MP calls for change to stalking laws - BBC News PA parliamentary editor Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Private members' bills House of CommonsParliament The agenda lists 122 bills for consideration (27 of them from Friday frequent flyer, Sir Christopher Chope). Realistically, though, only the first three or four bills have any chance of being debated. Top of the list is the remaining stages (report and third reading) of Dr Sarah Wollaston'sStalking Protection Bill,external. This aims to deal with a gap in the law on stalking, which is mostly configured around stalking by ex-partners, by focusing more on the problem of ""stranger stalkers"". And it also provides for anti-stalking orders which can be issued ""on the balance of probability"" to restrain stalking, when it may not be possible to reach the ""beyond reasonable doubt"" standard of proof required for criminal cases. They could cover banning people from approaching a person and their friends and family, in the digital as well as physical world, and breaches could result in criminal penalties. This bill commands enthusiastic government support, so it seems set fair to clear the Commons and go to the Lords. Then MPs will turn to the Parking (Code of Practice) Bill from the Conservative, Sir Greg Knight. This aims to ensure the private parking sector operates in a consistent and transparent manner for the motorist. Next on the agenda are second reading debates for a series of bills from Sir Christopher Chope - on Voter Registration, Student Loans (Debt Interest) and Border Control Bill. At this stage of the parliamentary year these have no chance of making progress - but they do provide a chance to raise an issue, and perhaps extract some comment from the government. Welcome to a day of private members' bill debate in the House of Commons and the House of Lords - a double whammy. We'll be showing live coverage on this page - you can watch using the tabs above, to bring up video from both chambers. Remember, you can watch on your mobile devices too. Thanks for joining us. A draft agreement on future EU-UK relations paves the way for a deal this weekend, the PM says. That's where we leave our coverage of an eventful day in the House of Commons. The main event of course came at 3pm, when Theresa May updated MPs on thedraft agreementon post-Brexit relations she has agreed with the EU. She told MPs the agreement will honour the result of the referendum, as well as protecting jobs and ""the integrity of our precious United Kingdom"". But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn described the declaration as ""26 pages of waffle"" which ""could have been written two years ago"". Brexiteer Tory MPs criticised the agreement for what they saw as a further loss of sovereignty. DUP MPs said they would not support a deal whilst proposals for a 'backstop' on the Irish border remain in place. Other MPs insisted that there should be a further referendum on the final deal - an idea Theresa May repeatedly rejected. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom earlier declined to give MPs a date when their vote on the deal will take place, when she announced forthcoming parliamentary business. MPs also debated the announcement yesterday that Bombardier is tocut a further 490 jobsfrom its Northern Ireland operations. House of CommonsParliament After almost two and a half hours, Theresa May finishes answering questions from MPs on the draft Brexit political declaration. Today's sitting will finish with a short adjournment debate led by Labour MP Mark Tami on psychological support after cancer treatment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Michael Ron David Kadar (R) was arrested in the Israeli town of Ashkelon in March 2017 An American-Israeli man has been sentenced to 10 years in jail after being convicted of making thousands of hoax threats to Jewish centres in the US, UK and other countries. Michael Ron David Kader, 20, from southern Israel, was found guilty in June of making more than 2,000 threats. He threatened to bomb or attack Jewish schools, community centres, police stations, airports and airlines. It led to fears among Jewish leaders of a resurgence in anti-Semitism. 'Disruption and anxiety' in US Jewish centres Muslims offer to guard US Jewish sites In February 2017, several British Jewish schools were targeted and the Jewish Museum in London was evacuated after bomb threats attributed to him. In other incidents, a British Airways flight from London to New York was evacuated and searched after landing, and French and Swiss fighter jets were scrambled ready to intercept an El Al flight. Bomb threats were also made to a number of Jewish community centres in parts of the US, and the Israeli embassy and Anti-Defamation League in Washington DC. Kadar was arrested in the Israeli town of Ashkelon in March 2017 following a joint investigation by the Israeli and US authorities, including the FBI. His trial was told he used the internet to make hoax telephone calls to the US, UK, Canada, New Zealand and Australia - often disguising his voice as a woman, and using sophisticated software to cover his tracks. Some of the offences were committed while he was under the age of 18. Kadar's parents argued that he had a brain tumour that caused autism and other mental problems, and that he should not be considered legally competent. This video can not be played 'Our son is not responsible for his actions' But the judge, while acknowledging Kadar was autistic, said he ""has a high IQ and understands his deeds very well"". The ruling from the Tel Aviv district court for youth said that Kadar would have received a much longer sentence if not for his medical condition. Kadar was not named in Israeli courts because he was tried as a minor, buthe was identified in indictment papers issued by the US.,external 'Our son should not be locked up' Video, 00:00:50'Our son should not be locked up' Israel holds teen over US bomb threats Ex-journalist held over US Jewish threats Muslims offer to guard US Jewish sites 'Disruption and anxiety' in US Jewish centres Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Nearly one in four young women has a mental illness, with emotional problems such as depression and anxiety the most common, figures for England show. The official NHS report found young women aged 17 to 19 were twice as likely as young men to have problems, with 23.9% reporting a disorder. Problems are less common in younger age groups, but are rising, albeit slowly. In children aged five to 15, one in nine had a disorder, up from one in 10 when the review was done 13 years ago. Thefindings are based on a survey,externalof more than 9,000 young people. The results have been gathered by statistics body NHS Digital and assessed by experts to try to ensure only diagnosable conditions are included. Dr Bernadka Dubicka, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the numbers of young women with problems was ""alarming"". She said body image pressures, exam stress and the negative effects of social media may all affect girls disproportionately, while they were also more likely to be victims of abuse and sexual assault. ""We can only speculate. We still do not fully understand this - all we know is that we see more girls in our clinics. ""We have to make sure services are available for them."" Youth mental health report in charts Why help ends at a milestone birthday It comes as the Children's Commissioner for England warned there was a ""vast gap"" in NHS mental health support. Anne Longfield's report criticised slow progress made in improving specialist community services for children. She said waiting times were too long and she was concerned about numbers being rejected by services in some areas. Nearly half of those in their late teens with mental health problems had self-harmed or attempted suicide. For younger teens it was about a quarter. This video can not be played Poor mental health ""has taken so much of my life from me"" Emma Blezard, 18, says her mental health problems have robbed her of her teenage years. She started experiencing difficulties when she was 13, suffering from anxiety and panic attacks before developing an eating disorder. It was a year before she let on to her parents. She ended up having suicidal thoughts and was sectioned in hospital at one point. ""I've missed so much of my life because of this illness - I've lost friends, I've missed birthday, holidays. ""I wish I could do things over."" Even when she was receiving treatment, she felt she did not deserve it. ""I became really isolated. At school I spent a lot of time out of lessons with the nurse. It was very difficult."" She has travelled all over the country for treatment and says she still struggles, although her problems are more manageable now. ""I don't think they will ever go away."" This video can not be played How should we talk about mental health? It may be a factor, although it is hard to tell. The NHS Digital review found children aged 11 to 19 with a mental health problem were more likely to use social media. Nearly a third of them spent over four hours a day on social media. Those who did not have a mental health problem were two to three times less likely to spend that amount of time on it. The young people with mental health problems were more likely to say their mood was affected by the number of ""likes"" they got and they were also more likely to compare themselves to others on social media. The report cited cyber-bullying as an issue too. But while this does suggest social media can have a negative impact, it does not prove it is to blame. People with mental health problems may be just more likely to find themselves on it, rather than it causing their problems in the first place. Indeed, they could even be using social media for support. How to help a friend who is struggling 'I'll only get help if I try to kill myself' Child mental health referrals up 26% in five years, says report Children 'must be suicidal to get help' A mother's love: 'Fearful of failing to keep her alive' The majority of problems reported, particularly in the older age groups, are linked to emotional disorders. These are on the rise, whereas the other disorders they looked at - behavioural and hyperactivity - have remained relatively stable over time. University College London psychiatrist Dr Michael Bloomfield said: ""Adolescence is a critical period for a person's development, particularly as our brains go through important changes during our teenage years. ""Since prevention is better than cure, it is really important for all of us in society to understand together why this is and start reducing the rates of mental disorders in young people."" The NHS is only treating a fraction of the young people who have problems. The Children's Commissioner's analysis of NHS figures from 2017-18 show that 325,000 children were treated by community services, while there are another 5,000 in hospital. That is fewer than 3% of the population. The figures showed that more than a third of young people referred to community services were turned away. This could be because their needs were not severe enough to need help and could be dealt with through other services, such as in school or by charities and council social care teams. But Ms Longfield said she was concerned children were getting turned away because services simply did not have time to see them. Her report also raised concerns about waiting times. Just under half of people who received treatment after a referral in 2017-18 had waited longer than six weeks. The average waiting time was nearly two months. The commissioner believes children's services are under-funded. Around Â£700m is spent on child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and eating disorders support. By comparison, services for adults receive 15 times more despite children representing 20% of the population. The commissioner said an extra Â£1.7bn would need to be invested to bring children's services in line. She said this could help pay for more early help by funding NHS counsellors in schools for example. Emma Thomas, chief executive of the Young Minds charity, said there was a lack of support for children. She said the charity gets ""calls every day"" about children who are waiting for help or have been denied help. ""This can have devastating consequences - in some cases, children start to self-harm, become suicidal or drop out of school while waiting for the help they need."" She agreed early intervention and better funding were essential. Both NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care have made improving children's mental health care a priority. In fact, the commissioner's report noted that investment was increasing and there had been good progress in terms of tackling eating disorders with new services and strict targets for access. Last month, in his Budget, the chancellor announced at least Â£2bn of the extra Â£20bn earmarked for the NHS by 2023 would go on mental health. A new four-week target for access to CAMHS is also going to be piloted soon and NHS England has promised another 70,000 children will be able to access support in the coming years. National mental health director Claire Murdoch said the scale of the problem identified by NHS Digital showed the importance of ""ramping up"" access to services. She said the NHS long-term plan, due out soon, would set out more details about future investment. ""Everyone who works with children and young people, whether in the public, private or voluntary sector, has to play their part if we are to protect young people's mental wellbeing."" Ministers have also being putting pressure on social media firms to do more about cyber-bullying and aggressive behaviour online. One option being considered is a new regulator for the internet.

"Shoppers are scrambling to buy ""Kevin the carrot"" soft toy featured in Aldi's Christmas advert. Customers of the discount chain have taken to social media to complain that supplies of Kevin, his wife Katie and three baby carrots have run out. The Â£3.99 version is not available online and there are reports of queues and even fights at the stores. A spokesman said demand for the toys, which went on sale today, had been ""exceptionally"" high. A 100cm Kevin the carrot toy - on sale for Â£19.99 - was also sold out online. The queues in the stores were not quite on the scale of those in the summer when customers were clambering to buy Build-A-Bear in an offer - later abandoned -  to buy any bear for the price of their child's age. But, on social media at least, the sales of the cuddly carrots have generated interest. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Gen Korobov served in the Russian air force before becoming GRU chief (Aug 2017 pic) The head of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, General Igor Korobov, has died aged 62, Russia's defence ministry says. Gen Korobov, who took up the post in 2016, is said to have died after ""a serious and long illness"" on Wednesday. The GRU was this year linked to a nerve agent attack in Britain on Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Gen Korobov is understood to have faced criticism by Russian officials over the failure of the operation. The attack on Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury on 4 March led to them requiring weeks of hospital treatment. The poisoning is alleged to have been carried out by suspects Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga, both identified by British authorities as GRU operatives, and ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. Russia denies the allegations. The UK and its Western allies expelled more than 150 Russian diplomats in retaliation for the attack. Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far This video can not be played What we know about the GRU Vice-Admiral Igor Kostyukov, who has commanded Russian forces in Syria, will serve as interim GRU chief. He had already taken over while Gen Korobov was ill, military sources told Russian media. The appointment of a permanent chief is a matter for President Vladimir Putin. The GRU, or Main Intelligence Directorate, is the intelligence arm of the Russian military, tasked with carrying out undercover international operations. UK accuses Russian spies of cyber-attacks Gen Korobov had received the Hero of Russia medal - the state's highest award. In December 2016 the US added Gen Korobov to its list of senior Russian officials subject to sanctions, accusing him of involvement in computer hacking. Other Western sanctions target Russians accused of helping the separatist insurgents in Ukraine. Russia has two other main spy organisations: the Federal Security Service (FSB), mainly involved in internal security, and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), whose role is similar to that of Britain's MI6. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow writes: Igor Korobov's career in the Soviet, then Russian military, spanned more than 40 years. He joined military intelligence in the mid-1980s and rose through the GRU ranks to a key position, overseeing strategic intelligence-gathering. In 2016 he was given the top job: agency chief. Under Korobov, and his predecessor Igor Sergun, the GRU became the Kremlin's spy agency of choice for a series of high-profile and highly controversial operations.  The GRU has been linked to Russia's military operation in eastern Ukraine, to Moscow's meddling in the US election and to a failed coup in Montenegro. The defence ministry described Korobov as a ""wonderful person"". But 2018 has been less than wonderful for the agency he headed. A series of botched operations - most notably the Salisbury poisoning - has thrust the GRU into the limelight and raised questions about its methods and activities. Korobov reportedly died ""after a long, extended illness"". Did he fall ill, as rumours suggest, after a dressing-down from the president? I can't confirm that. But what's clear is that if you take on the role of GRU chief, don't expect a carriage clock and a happy retirement at the end of it. Korobov's predecessor, Igor Sergun, also died while in office. Sergei Skripal - the spy at centre of poison mystery How the Dutch foiled Russian 'cyber-attack' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Modernisation of the GRU headquarters in Moscow was completed in 2006 Gen Korobov was described by Russia's defence ministry on Wednesday as ""a wonderful person, a faithful son of Russia and a patriot of his homeland,"" Reuters news agency reported. The ministry did not provide any further details about his death. The GRU is highly secretive - its total staff is not known, nor is its organisational structure known in detail. The GRU was involved in undercover operations in Ukraine - including Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 - and allegedly in the computer hacking during the 2016 US presidential election. Russians charged with US election hack The GRU includes Spetsnaz special forces - crack military units - who have fought in the Syrian war, helping President Bashar al-Assad's troops, and against separatist rebels in Chechnya. In the Soviet period they fought against Western-backed guerrillas in Afghanistan. In 2015 President Putin admitted that GRU units had been deployed in Crimea shortly before the peninsula was annexed. President Putin (3rd R) visited the new GRU HQ in November 2006 Among the GRU's tasks are: agent-running, sabotage, hi-tech eavesdropping and reconnaissance, the government daily Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported. The Spetsnaz logo is a black bat with wings spread out across the globe. According to the Russian news website Meduza,external, GRU officers get three years of specialist training, which includes cybernetics, foreign languages, geopolitics, use of codes and other elements of espionage.

"The Leaning Tower of Pisa is now stable and has actually been straightened slightly thanks to restoration work It's enough to give a monument an identity crisis. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is known worldwide for its precarious tilt - but now experts have revealed it's going straight. The tower's Surveillance Group, which monitors restoration work, said the landmark is ""stable and very slowly reducing its lean."" The 57m (186ft) medieval monument has been straightened by 4cm (1.5in) over the past two decades, the team said. ""It's as if it's had two centuries taken off its age,"" Professor Salvatore Settis explained. Nunziante Squeglia, a professor of geotechnics at the University of Pisa who works with the surveillance team, added: ""What counts the most is the stability of the bell tower, which is better than expected."" Back in 1990, the tourist favourite was closed to the public for the first time in 800 years amid fears it could be on the verge of toppling. At the time, it was tilting by 4.5m from the vertical. An international committee led by Prof Michele Jamiolkowski, a Polish expert, worked to stabilise it between 1993 and 2001. By the end, the tilt had been corrected by 45cm, at a cost of Â£200m. Tiny town catches 58k speeders in two weeks Rome police seize mafia luxury villas Huge waterspout hits Italian city The lean is as old as the tower itself, having crept in five years after construction began in 1173. The layer of clay and sand the tower is built on is softer on the south side than the north - so by the time builders got to the third storey, shifting soil had unsettled its foundations. And while engineers may ultimately take credit for rescuing the relic, visitors can rest assured it's still available for the obligatory pictures...

Top of the list is the remaining stages (report and third reading) of Dr Sarah Wollaston'sStalking Protection Bill,external. This aims to deal with a gap in the law on stalking, which is mostly configured around stalking by ex-partners, by focusing more on the problem of ""stranger stalkers"". And it also provides for anti-stalking orders which can be issued ""on the balance of probability"" to restrain stalking, when it may not be possible to reach the ""beyond reasonable doubt"" standard of proof required for criminal cases. They could cover banning people from approaching a person and their friends and family, in the digital as well as physical world, and breaches could result in criminal penalties. This bill commands enthusiastic government support, so it seems set fair to clear the Commons and go to the Lords. Then MPs will turn to the Parking (Code of Practice) Bill from the Conservative, Sir Greg Knight. This aims to ensure the private parking sector operates in a consistent and transparent manner for the motorist. Next on the agenda are second reading debates for a series of bills from Sir Christopher Chope - on Voter Registration, Student Loans (Debt Interest) and Border Control Bill. At this stage of the parliamentary year these have no chance of making progress - but they do provide a chance to raise an issue, and perhaps extract some comment from the government. Welcome to a day of private members' bill debate in the House of Commons and the House of Lords - a double whammy. We'll be showing live coverage on this page - you can watch using the tabs above, to bring up video from both chambers. Remember, you can watch on your mobile devices too. Thanks for joining us. A draft agreement on future EU-UK relations paves the way for a deal this weekend, the PM says. That's where we leave our coverage of an eventful day in the House of Commons. The main event of course came at 3pm, when Theresa May updated MPs on thedraft agreementon post-Brexit relations she has agreed with the EU. She told MPs the agreement will honour the result of the referendum, as well as protecting jobs and ""the integrity of our precious United Kingdom"". But Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn described the declaration as ""26 pages of waffle"" which ""could have been written two years ago"". Brexiteer Tory MPs criticised the agreement for what they saw as a further loss of sovereignty. DUP MPs said they would not support a deal whilst proposals for a 'backstop' on the Irish border remain in place. Other MPs insisted that there should be a further referendum on the final deal - an idea Theresa May repeatedly rejected. Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom earlier declined to give MPs a date when their vote on the deal will take place, when she announced forthcoming parliamentary business. MPs also debated the announcement yesterday that Bombardier is tocut a further 490 jobsfrom its Northern Ireland operations. House of CommonsParliament After almost two and a half hours, Theresa May finishes answering questions from MPs on the draft Brexit political declaration. Today's sitting will finish with a short adjournment debate led by Labour MP Mark Tami on psychological support after cancer treatment. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Gen Korobov served in the Russian air force before becoming GRU chief (Aug 2017 pic) The head of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, General Igor Korobov, has died aged 62, Russia's defence ministry says. Gen Korobov, who took up the post in 2016, is said to have died after ""a serious and long illness"" on Wednesday. The GRU was this year linked to a nerve agent attack in Britain on Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Gen Korobov is understood to have faced criticism by Russian officials over the failure of the operation. The attack on Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury on 4 March led to them requiring weeks of hospital treatment. The poisoning is alleged to have been carried out by suspects Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga, both identified by British authorities as GRU operatives, and ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. Russia denies the allegations. The UK and its Western allies expelled more than 150 Russian diplomats in retaliation for the attack. Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far This video can not be played What we know about the GRU Vice-Admiral Igor Kostyukov, who has commanded Russian forces in Syria, will serve as interim GRU chief. He had already taken over while Gen Korobov was ill, military sources told Russian media. The appointment of a permanent chief is a matter for President Vladimir Putin. The GRU, or Main Intelligence Directorate, is the intelligence arm of the Russian military, tasked with carrying out undercover international operations. UK accuses Russian spies of cyber-attacks Gen Korobov had received the Hero of Russia medal - the state's highest award. In December 2016 the US added Gen Korobov to its list of senior Russian officials subject to sanctions, accusing him of involvement in computer hacking. Other Western sanctions target Russians accused of helping the separatist insurgents in Ukraine. Russia has two other main spy organisations: the Federal Security Service (FSB), mainly involved in internal security, and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), whose role is similar to that of Britain's MI6. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow writes: Igor Korobov's career in the Soviet, then Russian military, spanned more than 40 years. He joined military intelligence in the mid-1980s and rose through the GRU ranks to a key position, overseeing strategic intelligence-gathering. In 2016 he was given the top job: agency chief. Under Korobov, and his predecessor Igor Sergun, the GRU became the Kremlin's spy agency of choice for a series of high-profile and highly controversial operations.  The GRU has been linked to Russia's military operation in eastern Ukraine, to Moscow's meddling in the US election and to a failed coup in Montenegro. The defence ministry described Korobov as a ""wonderful person"". But 2018 has been less than wonderful for the agency he headed. A series of botched operations - most notably the Salisbury poisoning - has thrust the GRU into the limelight and raised questions about its methods and activities. Korobov reportedly died ""after a long, extended illness"". Did he fall ill, as rumours suggest, after a dressing-down from the president? I can't confirm that. But what's clear is that if you take on the role of GRU chief, don't expect a carriage clock and a happy retirement at the end of it. Korobov's predecessor, Igor Sergun, also died while in office. Sergei Skripal - the spy at centre of poison mystery How the Dutch foiled Russian 'cyber-attack' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Modernisation of the GRU headquarters in Moscow was completed in 2006 Gen Korobov was described by Russia's defence ministry on Wednesday as ""a wonderful person, a faithful son of Russia and a patriot of his homeland,"" Reuters news agency reported. The ministry did not provide any further details about his death. The GRU is highly secretive - its total staff is not known, nor is its organisational structure known in detail. The GRU was involved in undercover operations in Ukraine - including Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 - and allegedly in the computer hacking during the 2016 US presidential election. Russians charged with US election hack The GRU includes Spetsnaz special forces - crack military units - who have fought in the Syrian war, helping President Bashar al-Assad's troops, and against separatist rebels in Chechnya. In the Soviet period they fought against Western-backed guerrillas in Afghanistan. In 2015 President Putin admitted that GRU units had been deployed in Crimea shortly before the peninsula was annexed. President Putin (3rd R) visited the new GRU HQ in November 2006 Among the GRU's tasks are: agent-running, sabotage, hi-tech eavesdropping and reconnaissance, the government daily Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported. The Spetsnaz logo is a black bat with wings spread out across the globe. According to the Russian news website Meduza,external, GRU officers get three years of specialist training, which includes cybernetics, foreign languages, geopolitics, use of codes and other elements of espionage.

"This video can not be played Who are the Sentinelese? The family of a US man reportedly killed by arrows fired by members of an endangered tribe in India's Andaman and Nicobar islands have said they forgive those who killed him. In a statement, they said John Allen Chau ""loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people"". Seven people who helped him reach North Sentinel island have been arrested. The Indian authorities say it may take ""some days"" to recover Mr Chau's body. A missionary who was in contact with Mr Chau in the last days of his trip says his aim was to bring the gospel to the island's tribesmen. Outsiders are banned from even approaching the island to protect the people who live there, and their way of life. The complete isolation of the Sentinelese people means contact with the outside world could put them at risk, as they are likely to have no immunity to even common illnesses such as flu and measles. Mr Chau's family released a statement on Instagram, saying he had gone to the island of ""his own free will"". ""We also ask for the release of those friends he had in the Andaman Islands. He ventured out of his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,"" the statement said. Allow Instagram content?

A murder case has been registered against unknown persons, and seven people, including at least five fishermen, have been arrested for helping Mr Chau reach the island, police say. The authorities have sent a helicopter and a ship to the area to identify where the incident took place. ""We maintained a distance from the island and have not yet been able to spot the body. It may take some more days and... [reconnaissance] of the area,"" Dependra Pathak, director-general of police on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, told the AFP news agency. Police have roped in field experts, including Indian anthropologists and tribal welfare and forest officers, to help them tackle the situation. ""We have to take care that we must not disturb them or their habitat by any means. It is a highly sensitive zone and it will take some time,"" he said. Who was US man killed in remote islands? The sad truth about uncontacted tribes On his last visit to the island, Mr Chau had taken a boat with local fishermen towards the remote North Sentinel island. He then ventured alone in a canoe to the beach. As soon as he set foot on the island, he was attacked with bows and arrows, according to the fishermen. Few images of the endangered tribe exist According to extracts of a journal published in the Washington Post,external, on a previous visit, he had shouted at them: ""My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you."" One of the tribesmen shot at him with an arrow, which pierced his waterproof Bible, he wrote. In a last note to his family, he wrote: ""You guys might think I'm crazy in all this but I think it's worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people. ""God, I don't want to die."" He had taken scissors, safety pins and a football as gifts to the tribe, according to a source quoted by Reuters news agency who had access to his notes and asked not to be named. He wrote he was ""doing this to establish the kingdom of Jesus on the island... Do not blame the natives if I am killed,"" the source said. Jeff King is president of International Christian Concern, the organisation with which Mr Chau was aligned, and was in contact with him during his visit. ""John went there to bring the gospel to these people... He had talked about it... planned it for a while, so it wasn't a whim, it wasn't a lark,""he told the BBC's Newsday programme. ""He'd been in the islands before, to this particular island... there were three or four visits on that day, and what happened was on the first visit he was turned back by arrows; the second visit, he came with two big fish as a gift. ""My understanding was the men accepted the gift; they sat together for an hour; he said they were menacing and they actually shot him. He went back to the boat, and then gradually went back a third time. That's when the fishermen who were looking through binoculars saw that they'd killed him and were taking him apart. ""This was not a job he was doing - this was a dream he had that unfortunately went wrong."" The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a chain of small islands hundreds of kilometres east of India in the Indian Ocean. Contact with several tribes on the islands is illegal to protect their indigenous way of life. In 2017, the Indian government also said taking photographs or making videos of the aboriginal Andaman tribes would be punishable with imprisonment of up to three years. Two Indian fishermen fishing illegally off North Sentinel Island were killed by the tribe in 2006. The Sentinelese stand guard on an island beach in 2005 The Sentinelese are totally cut off from the rest of the world. Global organisations like London-based Survival International have been campaigning to protect the indigenous tribes living in the Andamans. The tribe live on their own island, roughly the size of Manhattan, but most of what is known about them comes from viewing them from a distance.

A first boat, with six men and one woman, was intercepted by Border Force officers off the coast of Dover at about 01:30 GMT. A second, with seven men on board, was spotted hours later at about 08:00. All 14 people have been passed to immigration officials for interview. So far this month 93 suspected Iranian migrants have crossed the Channel. One of the dinghies was taken to Dover Harbour South East Coast Ambulance Service said the patients from both boats were ""checked over at the scene"". None of them needed hospital treatment. Charlie Elphicke, MP for Dover and Deal, said: ""The Home Office say they have stepped up patrols in the South East, yet clearly not enough is being done. ""The numbers we are seeing are unprecedented and deeply concerning."" In a separate incident earlier, the French authorities said a helicopter and rescue ships saved 11 migrants whose boat was in distress off the coast of the French town of Wimereux.

"Motorists should be offered cheaper insurance if they take a course to make them more aware of cyclists on the roads, the government says. The Department for Transport also wants to give councils more powers to tackle parking in cycling lanes. It is proposing a series of 50 measures in a bid to reduce the number of cyclists and pedestrians killed. Last year, 100 cyclists died on UK roads and 470 pedestrians were killed, an increase of 5%. What is stopping women from cycling? Half of tracks 'unsafe for 12 year olds' How to get into cycling - BBC Get Inspired guide A new cycling and walking ""champion"" would be appointed by the government as part of the plans, to make sure the DfT's policies meet the needs of road users across the UK. This video can not be played 'I'm going to die on this roundabout' - Watch Graham Simmons' helmet-cam footage Local authorities will be encouraged to spend about 15% of their local transport infrastructure funding on walking and cycling. The DfT also wants to create a new police unit to analyse evidence of dangerous driving that has been caught on camera by other road users. The ""back office unit"", as outlined in the two-year plan, would allow police forces to handle video and photographic evidence that has been captured on devices like dash cams. It comes after a similar operation was tried out by North Wales Police in October 2016, leading to the force dealing with 129 cases by the following August as a result of submitted footage. A review of the Highway Code could also be carried out to consider its guidance about how drivers should behave in relation to vulnerable road users. An alliance of walking and cycling organisations - Cycling UK, The Ramblers, British Cycling, Living Streets and Sustrans - said they were frustrated the overall strategy did not place more emphasis on speed reduction. Cycling UK chief executive Paul Tuohy said: ""Lowering vehicle speeds around people walking, cycling and horse riding doesn't just reduce the danger to them, but also their perception of the danger. ""While the DfT's proposals for amendments to the Highway Code will help save lives, ignoring the threat and dangers of speeding is disappointing."" This video can not be played What is the 'Dutch reach'? Cycling and Walking Minister Jesse Norman said: ""Greater road safety - and especially the protection of vulnerable road users such as cyclists, pedestrians and horse riders - is essential. ""We want to improve air quality, encourage healthy exercise, reduce obesity and boost our high streets and economic productivity. ""That means more support for cycling and walking, and that's what these new measures are designed to deliver."" A spokesperson for the Association of British Insurers says ""We are unaware of this proposal. There have been no discussions between the ABI and the government on any proposals around motor insurance premiums and its bikeability scheme. ""Insurers support improved road safety, but in 2017 less than 0.1% of motor claims involved cyclists, so it is hard to see how this could have any meaningful impact on premiums.""

"Coal fired plants such as this one in Arizona are a significant source of carbon emissions Concentrations of key gases in the atmosphere that are driving up global temperatures reached a new high in 2017. In theirannual greenhouse gas bulletin,external, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says there is no sign of reversal in this rising trend. Carbon dioxide levels reached 405 parts per million (ppm) in 2017, a level not seen in 3-5 million years. Researchers also note the resurgence of a banned gas called CFC-11. China 'home foam' gas key to ozone mystery Five things we have learned from the IPCC report Why industry can combat climate change Concentrations differ from emissions in that they represent what remains in the atmosphere after some of the gases are absorbed by the seas, land and trees. Since 1990 the warming impact of these long lived gases on the climate has increased by 41%. 2017 continues the rise in concentrations of CO2 which are now 46% greater than the levels in the atmosphere before the industrial revolution. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was smaller than the rise from 2015 to 2016, but is close to the average growth rate seen over the last decade. The scientists at the WMO believe that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere right now hasn't been seen in a long, long time. ""The last time the Earth experienced a comparable concentration of CO2 was 3-5 million years ago, when the temperature was 2-3C warmer and sea level was 10-20 metres higher than now,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas. Renewable energy will need to increase rapidly to help the world move away from carbon energy That's because of the impact of El NiÃ±o, thenaturally occurring weather phenomenonwhich peaked in 2015 and 2016. This triggered droughts in some parts of the world, which in turn reduced the ability of forests and vegetation in these areas to soak up CO2, hence more of it stayed in the atmosphere. Not so much. Scientists are very worried that when they measure the chemistry of the atmosphere they find that things are still going in the wrong direction. ""I am very concerned that the three greenhouse gases most responsible for climate change (CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide) are all rising upwards unabated,"" said Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ© from the University of East Anglia. ""CO2 concentrations are now well above 400ppm - levels were 321ppm when I was born, that is a big rise in a human lifetime!"" There have been a number of reports about CFC-11, a gas that's used in home insulation.  Unfortunately, production is a real double whammy for the environment, damaging the ozone layer while also contributing to global warming. The ozone hole over Antarctica in the year 2000 Under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, the global agreement to protect the ozone layer, CFC-11 was supposed to be phased out of production. Instead researchers have seen a marked slowdown in reductions in the level of this gas, indicating that someone, somewhere is making new batches. Earlier this year, the Environmental Investigation Agencytraced CFC-11 production,externalto a number of factories across China. Scientists in the field are worried that the detected levels of this mysterious chemical may be a harbinger of worse things to come. ""It's possible that the new emissions are the tip of the iceberg,"" said Dr Matt Rigby, an atmospheric chemist at the University of Bristol. ""If the signals we've seen are due to CFC-11 released during the manufacture of products such as foams, there could be much more that has been locked up in these new materials, which will ultimately be released to the atmosphere over the coming decades."" The news on these two gases is not good either. Methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, and about 60% of it in the atmosphere comes from human activities like cattle farming, rice cultivation and fossil fuel extraction. Levels in the atmosphere are now about 1,859 parts per billion - 257% of what they were before the industrial revolution, and the rate of increase is pretty constant over the last decade. Nitrous oxide comes from natural and human sources including fertiliser use and industry. It's now about 122% of pre-industrial levels. Essentially, they underline the fact that there is no sign in the atmosphere that efforts to cut greenhouse gases are having any success. The report also highlights the fact that these gases can impact our climate for centuries after they have been emitted. ""CO2 remains in the atmosphere for hundreds of years and in the oceans for even longer,"" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Elena Manaenkova. ""There is currently no magic wand to remove all the excess CO2 from the atmosphere. ""Every fraction of a degree of global warming matters, and so does every part per million of greenhouse gases."" Climate change is likely to increase wildfire impacts The scientists behind it certainly hope so. They believe that their analysis needs to be seen alongside the recent IPCC 1.5C report which warned that the world needed to be essentially carbon neutral by 2050. The WMO bulletin comes out just a week or so before climate negotiators begin at theCOP24 meeting,externalin Katowice, Poland, where countries will discuss putting the Paris climate agreement into practice and increasing their ambitions when it comes to cutting warming gases. ""The new IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5C shows that deep and rapid reductions of emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases will be needed in all sectors of society and the economy,"" said IPCC Chair Hoesung Lee. ""The WMO greenhouse gas bulletin, showing a continuing rising trend in concentrations of greenhouse gases, underlines just how urgent these emissions reductions are.""

"Police arrested four members of the family on Tuesday and their detention has been extended Four members of the same family have been arrested after a nine-year-old boy was beaten to death at his home in the eastern French city of Mulhouse. Police sources told local media that the boy had refused to do his homework and was hit with a broom handle. The boy's elder brother, sister and stepsister were all present at the time of the incident. Although his mother was not there, she too has been arrested and was aware of what was going on, reports say. The boy's death in September prompted a vigil in the centre of Mulhouse among residents who rallied round his parents. But the family's initial accounts of what had happened and the ensuing post-mortem examination prompted police to continue their investigation. Bruises were discovered on the boy's body, particularly on his feet, according to Alsace website DNA. Although he had suffered a cardiac arrest, pathologists said the cause of death had been the blows he had suffered, DNA reported. A police source was quoted as saying he had been struck by blunt objects.

A female community support worker, 42, is being treated for serious injuries, which are not life-threatening. A woman has been arrested on what police described as an unrelated matter but she is said to be ""a person of interest in the inquiry"". Detectives said the site at Ailsa Hospital was no longer on a security lockdown. They are asking for the public's help to find a woman who was seen leaving the area shortly after the incident. She was wearing a dark woolly hat and a dark jacket. Supt Brian Shaw said: ""I am urging anyone who witnessed the attack to get in touch with us. I am particularly keen to hear from anyone who was in the area around 10.00am and has information about a woman who was seen leaving the area shortly after the 42-year-old woman was stabbed."" Police outside the hospital The area around the addiction services buildings remains taped off The woman is described as being about 5ft 2in to 5ft 3in tall, of slight build with a pale complexion.

"Carlos Ghosn has been ousted after nearly two decades at the helm of Japanese carmaker Nissan, following allegations of financial misconduct. He has been accused by Nissan of under-reporting his salary and using company assets for personal use. But some see it as part of the firm's attempt to rebalance power in its alliance with Renault and Mitsubishi, which Mr Ghosn also chairs. The 64-year-old was the architect of the tie-up between the three firms. The board also voted to remove senior executive Greg Kelly. Nissan's board issued a statement which said the decision to dismiss the two men was unanimous. The board's mission was ""to minimise the potential impact and confusion on the day-to-day cooperation among the Alliance partners"", it added. Mr Ghosn and Mr Kelly remain in custody in Tokyo. Is Carlos Ghosn's arrest a âhatchet jobâ? The corporate scandals that rocked Japan Carlos Ghosn: The driven 'cost killer' Nissan has accused Mr Ghosn of ""significant acts of misconduct"", including under-reporting his pay package and personal use of company assets. On Monday, the firm said it had been conducting an internal investigation for several months, prompted by a whistleblower. Nissan also accused Mr Kelly of having been ""deeply involved"" in the misconduct. Prosecutors have said the two men conspired to understate Mr Ghosn's compensation, starting in 2010. Mr Ghosn is accused of filing annual securities reports containing fake statements, which could mean up to 10 years in prison, or a fine of 10m yen, or both. Broadcaster NHK has also reported, citing unnamed sources, that Nissan spent millions of dollars on luxury homes in four countries without legitimate business justifications. Millions of dollars had been spent to purchase and renovate the homes in Brazil, Lebanon, France and the Netherlands, NHK said. Mr Ghosn has not been charged. Japanese news agency Kyodo is reporting that Nissan's chief executive Hiroto Saikawa will take over as interim chairman. He promised earlier this week that Nissan would try to ""stabilise the situation, and normalise day-to-day operations"" for staff and business partners. Nissan's board said it would establish a committee to look at appointing a permanent successor to Mr Ghosn. Mitsubishi Motors will meet to discuss Mr Ghosn's role there next week. Two days ago Renault's board said it was appointing a temporary deputy chief executive to take over the running of the French car firm. Nissan's Hiroto Saikawa said he believed the misconduct ""went on for a long period"" His hero status was so big that his life was serialised in one of Japan's famous cartoon comic books The Brazilian-born boss of Lebanese descent and a French citizen says his background left him with a feeling of being different, which helped him adapt to new cultures In France he was known as Le Cost Killer, a comment on the deep cuts he made to revive Renault He was once tipped as a potential president of Lebanon, a move he eventually dismissed because he already had ""too many jobs"" In a 2011 poll of people the Japanese would like to run their country Mr Ghosn came seventh, in front of Barack Obama (ninth) The future of the Nissan-Mitsubishi-Renault partnership remains unclear in the aftermath of the allegations. Before his arrest Mr Ghosn was seeking to strengthen it, according to theaccording to the Financial Times.,externalThe paper reported that he had been planning a merger between Renault and Nissan - a deal which Nissan's board opposed. Butsources told the BBCthat a full merger - to create a single company - ""was never on the cards"". Despite selling fewer vehicles, Renault has a 43% shareholding in Nissan, while Nissan's stake in Renault is only 15%. Prior to Thursday's board meeting, Nissan boss Mr Saikawa insisted the partnership would ""not be affected"" by the arrest of Mr Ghosn and Mr Kelly.

"The prospect of Brexit looms large in Berlin these days and people are not happy about it.  ""We lose Britain, and we keep Italy: it's grotesque"", one former minister commented ruefully to me. That barbed remark lays bare a real anxiety among Germans, that somehow the European Union's centre of gravity will shift once the UK has gone, that a delicate balance will be upset, and it will not be in Berlin's favour. Identifying Italy hints at one source of concern, that the southern Europeans will want to carry in their free spending way. What was for a long time the subtext of European debates, that Germany can be expected to subsidise the others because of war guilt as well as the strength of its economy, became increasingly overt during the Greek debt crisis. Now Italy, with far larger debts, is on a budgetary collision course with the EU. Play: You decide Britain's Brexit future Brexit blind dates: Love Island's Zara and Magid Magid Why Switzerland worries about Brexit There is though another aspect to the comments one hears these days about how the post-Brexit EU might function, and it hints at a deeper and more emotive schism. If a generation of German politicians has hailed the European project as a triumph for peace this was at least in part because it has provided a way of converting long rivalry with France from the cause of 20th Century wars to the 'engine' of the Continent's economic success. Now though one hears disparagement of France and its president Emanuel Macron from different political quarters. A senior German journalist, commenting on the prominence given to Angela Merkel's meetings with President Macron to mark the 100th anniversary of the First World War armistice, said to me, anger in her voice, ""you see? This is our future, this will have to be our future partner, because you are leaving"". Meeting Alexander Gauland, leader of the right wing Alternative for Germany party in his spectacular office overlooking the Reichstag, he too cannot hold back on the subject on France. ""The British are the only believers in free trade,"" he told us in a Newsnight interview, ""the French are bureaucratic in a way we don't like in our party"". Of course there are still pro-French voices in German politics, including those who feel that Chancellor Merkel has missed a real opportunity to build the Eurozone by spurning Mr Macron's proposals for further financial integration. But in my recent contacts at least, I have noticed rather more members of the German establishment who reject what the president stands for, suspecting another attempt to get Germany to finance French public spending and worrying about the destabilizing effect of Brexit. ""For decades there has been a delicate triangle of power running Europe,"" the former minister quoted earlier says, ""and with Berlin, Paris, and London each playing their own distinctive role"". His concern is that removing the UK, with its big contributions to European security and financial prudence will lead to bigger problems for the EU. Germany, even during the long Merkel years, has been diffident about playing the leadership role in Europe. It is comfortable with tactical interventions on monetary or political matters, much less so in flexing diplomatic or military muscle. The prospect of Brexit has brought the realization that France may now try to fill this vacuum. While many German politicians are uneasy about the idea of leading Europe, it seems that the idea of letting President Macron (who one person I was talking to this week in Berlin called, ""a charlatan"") play that role by default disturbs them. Indeed it may rankle so much that it causes Germany to abandon its post Second World War reluctance to exert its power in Europe. You can watchNewsnighton BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or oniPlayer.

"This video can not be played Arlene Foster said the deal with the Conservatives is ""still in existence"" Theresa May's support agreement with the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) to keep her minority government in power is not dead, Arlene Foster has said. The DUP entered a confidence-and-supply deal with the Conservatives in 2017. But their relationship has become strained due to the DUP's opposition to the PM's draft Brexit withdrawal deal. When asked by BBC News NI if the relationship was dying, Mrs Foster said no but a rethink was needed ""in relation to this withdrawal agreement"". DUP-Tory pact 'may be reviewed' The DUP leader said the support deal is ""very much still in existence"". Her party securedmore than Â£1bn of extra funding for Northern Ireland from the governmentin exchange for crucial support in votes in Parliament from its 10 MPs. Speaking on Wednesday, Mrs Foster warned that the arrangement is ""not just about money"" but also ""making sure the union is secure"". The tension between the parties has arisen due to the DUP's rejection ofthe so-called Brexit backstopin Mrs May's EU withdrawal agreement. The backstop would allow the Irish border to remain frictionless in the event of the UK leaving the EU without securing an all-encompassing deal. Theresa May's Brexit withdrawal deal has been consistently criticised by the DUP It is a last-resort position that would result in Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, with goods going into the region being checked to see if they met EU standards. The DUP has repeatedly said it would not accept any extra Northern Ireland-only checks. This weekthe DUP chose not to support the government on key voteson a number of amendments to its Finance Bill. Instead, its 10 MPs abstained in the votes and supported one Labour Party amendment. Asked at what point she would consider ending DUP's support for the government, Mrs Foster said: ""We're not there yet."" Speaking about the confidence-and-supply arrangement, she added: ""It's not dying but we need to see a rethink in relation to this withdrawal agreement. ""We need to see a better deal for Northern Ireland and a better deal for the United Kingdom."" Influential business groups in Northern Ireland have given their support to Mrs May's deal but they have been met with criticism from some DUP MPs. This video can not be played Sammy Wilson: ""The government had broken one of the fundamental agreements they had with us."" On Monday, Sammy Wilson accused businesspeople and farmers who supported the proposal of being government ""puppets"" who were ""dancing to the government's tune"".

"This video can not be played Daniela Tejada said her husband Matthew Hedges was ""scared"" in court The wife of a British academic jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates says the British government put UK interests above his right to freedom. Daniela Tejada spoke to the BBC shortly after returning to the UK from Abu Dhabi where she saw Durham University'sMatthew Hedges sentenced to life. The 31-year-old denies spying butprosecutors said he had confessed. Ms Tejada has arrived for a meeting in London with the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Mr Hunt met the UAE ambassador in London earlier for ""a very frank conversation"" and Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the situation, which was ""being raised at the highest level"" in the UAE. Hedges, who is originally from Exeter, said he had been in the country conducting research on the UAE's security strategy for his PhD thesis when he was arrested at Dubai airport on 5 May. Daniela Tejada met Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to discuss her husband's case According to the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner, sources in the UAE claim ""espionage material"" was found on Hedges' laptop. However, Mr Hunt has insisted there was no basis for the spy charges. Ms Tejada told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office had been ""stepping on eggshells instead of taking a firm stance"" and only began to take her husband's case seriously once he had beenreleased on bail on 29 Octoberafter enduring months of solitary confinement. ""I was under the impression they were putting their interests with the UAE above a British citizen's rightful freedom and welfare,"" Ms Tejada said. She said she had contacted the Foreign Office ""on a weekly basis"" since her husband's arrest in May. ""They just disregarded my requests, they said it wasn't part of their job, it wasn't part of their duty,"" she continued. ""On one occasion, one of the case workers said the Foreign Office did not have a duty of care so weren't obliged to make such representations."" Ms Tejada said she felt the Foreign Office had disregarded her early requests for help She said: ""I believe they should have taken a firmer stance from the beginning, if not publicly then through their private representations. ""This is something they failed to do throughout. ""He was being detained in unacceptable conditions for something that he didn't do."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said his ""heart goes out"" to Hedges and his family but that Mr Hunt had ""raised this case personally with the crown prince on 12 November"". He told Today: ""The Foreign Office has been acting on (Hedges') behalf at the highest possible levels."" Following a question in the House Lords, Baroness Goldie (Conservative) said consulate staff had met Hedges on six occasions, ""three before his recent bail and three whilst on bail"". She said Mr Hunt was also ""urgently seeking a call"" with the UAE's Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. News and updates from the North East Does UAE stability come at a price? United Arab Emirates profile Ms Tejada said she had been unable to speak to her husband since he was sentenced but she could ""imagine he is just as distraught as I am"". ""He was very, very scared standing in front of the judge,"" she said, because he was aware of the possibility of receiving an arbitrary judgement. ""I asked him to look at me if he was feeling too nervous and he tried to do so on a couple of occasions but was asked to face the judge."" She said Hedges was shaking when the translator told him the sentence and ""asked to double check if he had heard it right"". Matthew Hedges was arrested in the UAE in May Ms Tejada said there had been no due process, adding: ""He was put through so much strain for six months that absolutely nothing he said or did could be used against him. ""Anything used against Matt is completely unfounded."" Mr Hedges' family claim he signed a document written in Arabic - a language he cannot speak or read - that later transpired to be a confession. This came after he was interrogated without a lawyer or consular help, his family added. Ms Tejada later told Reuters: ""Handing a life sentence to an innocent researcher who held the UAE in high regard speaks volumes about their lack of tolerance and respect for human life."" UAE Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi said Hedges had ""confessed in detail to his crimes"" and was ""accorded full rights"" with a ""fair and transparent trial"". Abdulla Al Naqbi, head of the Department of Legal Affairs for the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs, added: ""Compelling and powerful evidence was presented in court. That included information extracted from his personal electronic devices by expert forensic analysis techniques, evidence provided by UAE intelligence agencies, witness testaments and Mr Hedges' own confession. ""The case was heard by three judges in the security division of the Higher Federal Court who met a total of four times. In the first session on 3 October Mr Hedges was asked whether he had proper representation and was offered the services of a court-appointed lawyer, which he accepted. ""It is not true that he was asked to sign documents he did not understand."" The ministry said the UAE was ""determined to protect its important strategic relationship with a key ally"" and added that it hoped both sides could find ""an amicable solution"" to the case."" The UAE attorney general previously said the sentence - which could see the academic serve up to 25 years in jail before being deported - was not final as he had the right to appeal. Frank Gardner, security correspondent, BBC News Britain has a very deep and quite long-standing defence relationship with the UAE - it is an ally. There are roughly 200 serving British personnel permanently based in the UAE. There is an airbase called Al Minhad just south of Dubai where RAF Typhoons and Tornadoes are rotating in and out, including for flights to Afghanistan. There is a port called Port Zayed which is the most visited Royal Navy port in the world. And hundreds of Emirati officers are trained at Sandhurst military academy. Britain has got a very close defence, security and counter-terrorism relationship with the UAE and though there is no suggestion of that being threatened, if the situation escalates, the calls to reconsider that relationship will increase. The suggestion Britain would send a spy makes no sense. I'm sure MI6 would use academics to spy on a place if they could, but only in hard-to-target countries. I cannot imagine what an academic could get out of the UAE that the UK couldn't get by asking the UAE directly. There is nothing I can see that Matthew Hedges has done which in any way would constitute spying. There are far greater sensitivities there than in this country - somebody has reported him to the authorities saying he is asking suspicious questions. I've known someone, who was a businessman in Dubai - a former British army officer - who was arrested because he upset the wrong person and didn't have the connections that would get him out of jail. Prof Clive Jones, Hedges' supervisor at Durham University, said there would now have to be ""some kind of moratorium"" on sending students to do field work in the UAE and the wider Gulf region. He said Hedges had been looking at civil-military relations in the UAE since the Arab Spring and ""there was nothing clandestine or covert"" about the material he had. Prof Jones said there had been no ""inkling"" of any danger and Hedges was ""no stranger"" to the UAE, having ""lived there on and off"" since he was nine years old. This video can not be played Shana Marshall, a friend of Matthew Hedges, says she is ""shocked"" at the UAE's verdict Prof Jones said: ""He knew many of the people he was going out to interview, so again it is utterly bizarre, and indeed perverse, and indeed a miscarriage of justice, that this has befallen him."" Conservative MP and former soldier Johnny Mercer said it would be ""absolutely disgraceful,external"" if Ms Tejada's claims were found to be true, adding: ""We have no interests with the UAE that outweigh the rights and freedoms of our citizens abroad."" He earlier said the case was ""unacceptable"" and ""consequences must be immediate until he is released"".

"This video can not be played Michele Jacques found rent-to-own meant paying over the odds for her cooker Plans to cap the costs of buying domestic goods such as TVs and fridges through rent-to-own shops have been welcomed by the stores' customers. Michele Jacques, from Droylsden in Manchester, ended up spending Â£700 on a cooker as a result of interest rates that can reach 99% a year. Had she gone to a High Street shop, it could have cost her as little as Â£250. The proposals from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) mean rent-to-own customers would pay much less. Rent-to-own customers make monthly payments, in effect renting goods until they have paid in full. ""Interest rates should be capped. They shouldn't be allowed to make so much profit from vulnerable people,"" said Ms Jacques. ""It does make you frustrated. It makes you angry."" She said the cap proposed by the FCA was ""the correct thing to do"". First, the FCA will limit the amount of interest that customers pay. From April 2019, they will pay no more in interest than the cost of the product itself. So if a cooker costs Â£300, they will pay no more than Â£600 in total, including the cost of credit. However, rent-to-own shops will still be able to charge for insurance and warranties on top of that. Second, the cost of the goods themselves will be limited. Shops will be able to charge no more than the median - i.e the middle price - of three mainstream retailers. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA said: ""Today's measures are designed to bring down very high prices in the rent-to-own sector, which is used by some of the most financially vulnerable in our society. ""A cap will prevent firms charging over the odds for essential everyday items like cookers or washing machines. We believe a cap is the only intervention that will effectively tackle the highest prices."" The FCA says the cap could save about 400,000 consumers up to Â£22.7m a year. In a series of examples, someone who buys a Hotpoint cooker on a rent-to-own basis could save as much as Â£606 over a three-year period, or Â£3.88 a week. Someone buying an Indesit fridge freezer through rent-to-own could save Â£360 a year, or Â£2.31 a week. The main providers of rent-to-own goods are Brighthouse and PerfectHome. A BrightHouse spokesman said: ""BrightHouse has been working closely and constructively with the FCA over a number of years. This comprehensive process has led to many changes in the way we operate as a business and serve our customers. ""We're going to carefully consider today's announcement, while continuing to offer those excluded from mainstream credit ways to get the household goods they need."" PerfectHome said it too would consider the plans in detail. The proposed cap was welcomed by the debt charity StepChange, The Money Advice Trust, and by  Citizens Advice. ""This cap is a victory for people who struggle with the runaway costs of rent-to-own agreements,"" said Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""A cap gets to the heart of the problem by stopping costs from spiralling out of control and pushing people into further debt. ""Our evidence has repeatedly shown that well-designed caps can reduce the harm high-cost credit can cause, as they have done in the payday loan market."" However Andrew Hagger, a personal finance expert at Moneycomms, said rent-to-own goods will remain expensive. ""The measures are long overdue and will help, but you have to question whether a 100% mark up is acceptable. It's a big shift in the right direction, but in essence customers can end up paying double the retail price which still seems excessive.""

"Daniela Tejada previously said her husband Matthew Hedges was being held in ""inhumane and degrading"" conditions A Briton jailed for life for spying in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) pleaded guilty when he was confronted with ""compelling"" evidence, prosecutors say. Matthew Hedges, 31, always said he was innocent and had been researching the country's security strategy for a PhD. The verdict angered the UK government, triggering a diplomatic row with the UAE, a long standing ally. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt urgently wants a ""call with Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed"". He feels personally ""betrayed"" by the verdict as he was given assurances only nine days ago in a meeting with the Emirates' Crown Prince that this would not be the outcome of the case, the BBC's James Robbins said. Mr Hunt has pledged to meet Durham University student Hedges' wife Daniela Tejada on Thursday. This video can not be played Theresa May is asked about the fate of Matthew Hedges at PMQs He also said he had raised the case with the ""highest levels of the UAE government"", adding the verdict was ""not what we expect from a friend and trusted partner of the United Kingdom, and runs contrary to earlier assurances"". But in a statement, UAE Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi, said Hedges had pleaded guilty to all charges after the court presented him with ""compelling legal evidence concluded after thorough judicial investigations"". ''The defendant confessed in detail to his crimes during investigations whereby he was accorded his full rights and assurances as per the UAE Constitution and state laws to fair and transparent trial,'' he said. Dr Al Shamsi also said Hedges was in court with representatives from the British Embassy and he ""exhausted all methods of defence by his lawyer during the trial"". Hedges' family however, said that during the first six weeks of his detention he was interrogated without a lawyer and consular access was unavailable. During this time he was made to sign a document in Arabic which transpired to be a confession, they said. ""Matthew does not speak or read Arabic,"" the family added. Daniela Tejada has repeatedly rejected suggestions her husband, Matthew Hedges, is a spy Ms Tejada said her husband shook his head as the verdict was delivered, adding: ""I am very scared for Matt. ""Matthew is innocent. The Foreign Office know this and have made it clear to the UAE authorities that Matthew is not a spy for them."" She said the British government ""must take a stand now"" and the UAE authorities ""should feel ashamed for such an obvious injustice"". Does UAE stability come at a price? United Arab Emirates profile This video can not be played Shana Marshall, a friend of Matthew Hedges, says she is ""shocked"" at the UAE's verdict At prime minister's questions, Tory MP Crispin Blunt told Mrs May she should make clear to the UAE that ""if he is not released, I don't see why we should be committed to their defence"". According to Abu Dhabi newspaper The National, alife sentence means a maximum of 25 years,externalin jail, after which Hedges would be deported. Hedges, who is also liable for the costs of the case, has 30 days to appeal during which time he will be held in custody, the paper reports. Matthew Hedges was detained at Dubai Airport in May Hedges is said to be in a poor state of mental health, the BBC understands, and Ms Tejada has previouslycriticised the lack of treatmenthe has received in prison. WATCH: Detained student 'is not a spy' Free 'spy' student, academics demand Vice-Chancellor of Durham University, Professor Stuart Corbridge, said the conditions Hedges was being held in ""breached his human rights"". ""[And] this judgement has been delivered in the absence of anything resembling due process or a fair trial,"" he said. ""There has been no information given on what basis Matt was handed this sentence and no reason to believe that Matt was conducting anything other than legitimate academic research."" By BBC Reality Check More than 5,000 UK companies do business in the UAE - it's the UK's largest export market in the Middle East and the 13th biggest in the world.

"This video can not be played Who are the Sentinelese? The family of a US man reportedly killed by arrows fired by members of an endangered tribe in India's Andaman and Nicobar islands have said they forgive those who killed him. In a statement, they said John Allen Chau ""loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people"". Seven people who helped him reach North Sentinel island have been arrested. The Indian authorities say it may take ""some days"" to recover Mr Chau's body. A missionary who was in contact with Mr Chau in the last days of his trip says his aim was to bring the gospel to the island's tribesmen. Outsiders are banned from even approaching the island to protect the people who live there, and their way of life. The complete isolation of the Sentinelese people means contact with the outside world could put them at risk, as they are likely to have no immunity to even common illnesses such as flu and measles. Mr Chau's family released a statement on Instagram, saying he had gone to the island of ""his own free will"". ""We also ask for the release of those friends he had in the Andaman Islands. He ventured out of his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,"" the statement said. Allow Instagram content?

A murder case has been registered against unknown persons, and seven people, including at least five fishermen, have been arrested for helping Mr Chau reach the island, police say. The authorities have sent a helicopter and a ship to the area to identify where the incident took place. ""We maintained a distance from the island and have not yet been able to spot the body. It may take some more days and... [reconnaissance] of the area,"" Dependra Pathak, director-general of police on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, told the AFP news agency. Police have roped in field experts, including Indian anthropologists and tribal welfare and forest officers, to help them tackle the situation. ""We have to take care that we must not disturb them or their habitat by any means. It is a highly sensitive zone and it will take some time,"" he said. Who was US man killed in remote islands? The sad truth about uncontacted tribes On his last visit to the island, Mr Chau had taken a boat with local fishermen towards the remote North Sentinel island. He then ventured alone in a canoe to the beach. As soon as he set foot on the island, he was attacked with bows and arrows, according to the fishermen. Few images of the endangered tribe exist According to extracts of a journal published in the Washington Post,external, on a previous visit, he had shouted at them: ""My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you."" One of the tribesmen shot at him with an arrow, which pierced his waterproof Bible, he wrote. In a last note to his family, he wrote: ""You guys might think I'm crazy in all this but I think it's worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people. ""God, I don't want to die."" He had taken scissors, safety pins and a football as gifts to the tribe, according to a source quoted by Reuters news agency who had access to his notes and asked not to be named. He wrote he was ""doing this to establish the kingdom of Jesus on the island... Do not blame the natives if I am killed,"" the source said. Jeff King is president of International Christian Concern, the organisation with which Mr Chau was aligned, and was in contact with him during his visit. ""John went there to bring the gospel to these people... He had talked about it... planned it for a while, so it wasn't a whim, it wasn't a lark,""he told the BBC's Newsday programme. ""He'd been in the islands before, to this particular island... there were three or four visits on that day, and what happened was on the first visit he was turned back by arrows; the second visit, he came with two big fish as a gift. ""My understanding was the men accepted the gift; they sat together for an hour; he said they were menacing and they actually shot him. He went back to the boat, and then gradually went back a third time. That's when the fishermen who were looking through binoculars saw that they'd killed him and were taking him apart. ""This was not a job he was doing - this was a dream he had that unfortunately went wrong."" The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a chain of small islands hundreds of kilometres east of India in the Indian Ocean. Contact with several tribes on the islands is illegal to protect their indigenous way of life. In 2017, the Indian government also said taking photographs or making videos of the aboriginal Andaman tribes would be punishable with imprisonment of up to three years. Two Indian fishermen fishing illegally off North Sentinel Island were killed by the tribe in 2006. The Sentinelese stand guard on an island beach in 2005 The Sentinelese are totally cut off from the rest of the world. Global organisations like London-based Survival International have been campaigning to protect the indigenous tribes living in the Andamans. The tribe live on their own island, roughly the size of Manhattan, but most of what is known about them comes from viewing them from a distance.

"Less than half of the tuition fee paid by students in England can be spent on the cost of teaching, says research from a university think tank. The Higher Education Policy Institute says the rest is spent on buildings, IT and libraries, administration, or welfare such as mental health support. It comes as a review is scrutinising the cost of student fees and loans. A separate public spending watchdog report warns that the sale of student loans is providing poor value. The Public Accounts Committee says that student loans with a face value of Â£3.5bn were sold last year to private investors for Â£1.7bn - with MPs unconvinced this was a good deal for taxpayers. The review of post-18 education funding, commissioned by the prime minister, is examining how to redesign university fees and student loans. There have been suggestions that the review is looking atcutting fees to Â£6,500- raising questions about the cost of delivering courses. Both university reports from the Higher Education Policy Institute and the Public Accounts Committee examine whether students and taxpayers are getting value for money. The think tank report says that universities might only spend 45% of tuition fee income on teaching - with the rest spent on other services or administration. Students should be given much more information about how their fee is being used, says the study. A breakdown from Nottingham Trent per student showed: 39% spent on academic staff, course equipment and staff-related costs 36% spent on buildings, libraries, IT, sports, careers, admissions, staff, administration and widening access to poorer applicants 17% invested in ""enhancing teaching, research infrastructure and the student experience"" 8% spent on professional services, including marketing, finance and the vice-chancellor's pay The research also shows that universities can have very different levels of dependency on the current Â£9,250 annual tuition fees. Tuition fees were only 15% of income for Cambridge, but at Falmouth it was 83% and Nottingham Trent was 81%. This puts financial pressure on universities to recruit - and last week it was revealed that auniversity had to be bailed out with an emergency loan. ""Tuition fees were introduced 20 years ago and they have been tripled twice. Ministers and regulators have repeatedly demanded information on where the fees go. Yet there is still little information available,"" says the institute's director, Nick Hillman. The Office for Students said: ""We can identify and will act when they are not transparent about value for money or are not delivering strong enough outcomes for students or taxpayers."" A report from the Public Accounts Committee warns that the taxpayer should be getting a better deal when the government sells off student loans to private investors. Last year, it says the government only received a return of 48p in the pound - in the deal in which Â£3.5bn of student debt was sold for Â£1.7bn. The MPs recognise that the full value will not be obtained, because so many students are unlikely to pay back all that they have borrowed. ""In this case, government received too little in return for what it gave up,"" says the committee. The committee, which oversees government spending, says it is ""not convinced"" by explanations for the pricing of these public assets. It also calls for more transparency about the investors profiting from the sale. ""The public deserves to know who stands to gain from the sale of public assets,"" says committee chair, Meg Hillier. Labour's Angela Rayner described it as ""ripping off the taxpayer"". But a spokeswoman for the Department for Education said: ""We are confident that we achieved value for money for taxpayers from the first sale of student loans. ""As the National Audit Office has found, we received more for the loans than the value to government of retaining them, further strengthening the public finances."" But she said the system was designed on the basis that ""many students will never fully pay back their loans"". Are students overpaying for tuition fees?

"There are nearly 7,000 children and young adults under 25 with type 2 diabetes in England and Wales - about 10 times the number reported before, according to Diabetes UK. Its analysis of 2016-17 data found most were being treated in GP practices rather than in specialist units. The condition is linked to obesity and is more aggressive in children. Child health experts said the government should act now to implement proposals to cut childhood obesity. The Obesity Health Alliance said it was ""hugely concerning"" to see so many young people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. ""We know that obesity contributes to the development of this and other serious health conditions, and with one in three children leaving primary school with excess weight or obesity, these findings are worrying but sadly not surprising,"" said Caroline Cerny, from the Alliance. How can I reduce my risk of diabetes? Diabetes prescriptions now cost Â£1bn to NHS 'Your loved ones act as your pancreas' The new figures come from the latestNational Diabetes Audit for 2016-2017,externalwhich contains information on cases of type 2 from 95% of GP practices in England and Wales, as well as numbers treated in specialist paediatric units. It found that a total of 6,836 children and young people aged under 25 were being treated for the condition. This includes: 11 five to nine-year-olds 196 10 to 14-year-olds 1,246 15 to 19-year-olds 5,383 20 to 24 year-olds This video can not be played Stephen Richardson had to have his leg amputated because of type 2 diabetes Buta previous report, from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, suggested the figure was 715 - the number of children and young people receiving care for type 2 diabetes from paediatric diabetes units in England and Wales. These units provide specialist support to young people. Some may be at risk of the condition progressing quickly, creating other health complications, such as blindness, amputations, heart disease and kidney failure. GPs also provide lifestyle advice and support and many young people are treated in primary care. Family history and ethnic background, as well as obesity, are factors in children and young people developing type 2 diabetes. However, most children who develop diabetes have type 1 - not type 2. Type 1 is an autoimmune disease,externalwhich is not linked with being overweight or inactive. It is a common condition that causes the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood to become too high It's caused by problems with a chemical in the body (hormone) called insulin Type 2 diabetes can cause symptoms like excessive thirst, needing to pee a lot and tiredness It can also increase the risk of getting serious problems with the eyes, heart and nerves It's a lifelong condition which may mean a change in diet, medicine and regular check-ups Bridget Turner, director of policy and campaigns at Diabetes UK, said:  ""Type 2 diabetes can be devastating for children and young people. ""We need to encourage healthy living by providing clear and easy to understand nutritional information about the products we are all buying, and protect children from adverts for foods that are high in fat, salt and sugar."" She said children and young people with type 2 should have access to expert treatment from healthcare professionals trained to manage the condition. Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said these new figures emphasised the need to act. ""For many children, the development of type two diabetes can be prevented with lifestyle changes, but this isn't easy - they need support. ""That's why we were pleased to see the ambitious proposals set out in chapter two of its Childhood Obesity Plan. We urge the government to maximise their impact by introducing them all and doing so quickly."" A spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said it was committed to halving child obesity by 2030. ""We will be launching consultations to restrict promotions in shops for sugary and fatty foods, as well as a 9pm watershed ban on advertising. ""The upcoming NHS long-term plan will have prevention at its core and build on our existing work to keep people healthy and well.""

"Nearly one in four young women has a mental illness, with emotional problems such as depression and anxiety the most common, figures for England show. The official NHS report found young women aged 17 to 19 were twice as likely as young men to have problems, with 23.9% reporting a disorder. Problems are less common in younger age groups, but are rising, albeit slowly. In children aged five to 15, one in nine had a disorder, up from one in 10 when the review was done 13 years ago. Thefindings are based on a survey,externalof more than 9,000 young people. The results have been gathered by statistics body NHS Digital and assessed by experts to try to ensure only diagnosable conditions are included. Dr Bernadka Dubicka, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the numbers of young women with problems was ""alarming"". She said body image pressures, exam stress and the negative effects of social media may all affect girls disproportionately, while they were also more likely to be victims of abuse and sexual assault. ""We can only speculate. We still do not fully understand this - all we know is that we see more girls in our clinics. ""We have to make sure services are available for them."" Youth mental health report in charts Why help ends at a milestone birthday It comes as the Children's Commissioner for England warned there was a ""vast gap"" in NHS mental health support. Anne Longfield's report criticised slow progress made in improving specialist community services for children. She said waiting times were too long and she was concerned about numbers being rejected by services in some areas. Nearly half of those in their late teens with mental health problems had self-harmed or attempted suicide. For younger teens it was about a quarter. This video can not be played Poor mental health ""has taken so much of my life from me"" Emma Blezard, 18, says her mental health problems have robbed her of her teenage years. She started experiencing difficulties when she was 13, suffering from anxiety and panic attacks before developing an eating disorder. It was a year before she let on to her parents. She ended up having suicidal thoughts and was sectioned in hospital at one point. ""I've missed so much of my life because of this illness - I've lost friends, I've missed birthday, holidays. ""I wish I could do things over."" Even when she was receiving treatment, she felt she did not deserve it. ""I became really isolated. At school I spent a lot of time out of lessons with the nurse. It was very difficult."" She has travelled all over the country for treatment and says she still struggles, although her problems are more manageable now. ""I don't think they will ever go away."" This video can not be played How should we talk about mental health? It may be a factor, although it is hard to tell. The NHS Digital review found children aged 11 to 19 with a mental health problem were more likely to use social media. Nearly a third of them spent over four hours a day on social media. Those who did not have a mental health problem were two to three times less likely to spend that amount of time on it. The young people with mental health problems were more likely to say their mood was affected by the number of ""likes"" they got and they were also more likely to compare themselves to others on social media. The report cited cyber-bullying as an issue too. But while this does suggest social media can have a negative impact, it does not prove it is to blame. People with mental health problems may be just more likely to find themselves on it, rather than it causing their problems in the first place. Indeed, they could even be using social media for support. How to help a friend who is struggling 'I'll only get help if I try to kill myself' Child mental health referrals up 26% in five years, says report Children 'must be suicidal to get help' A mother's love: 'Fearful of failing to keep her alive' The majority of problems reported, particularly in the older age groups, are linked to emotional disorders. These are on the rise, whereas the other disorders they looked at - behavioural and hyperactivity - have remained relatively stable over time. University College London psychiatrist Dr Michael Bloomfield said: ""Adolescence is a critical period for a person's development, particularly as our brains go through important changes during our teenage years. ""Since prevention is better than cure, it is really important for all of us in society to understand together why this is and start reducing the rates of mental disorders in young people."" The NHS is only treating a fraction of the young people who have problems. The Children's Commissioner's analysis of NHS figures from 2017-18 show that 325,000 children were treated by community services, while there are another 5,000 in hospital. That is fewer than 3% of the population. The figures showed that more than a third of young people referred to community services were turned away. This could be because their needs were not severe enough to need help and could be dealt with through other services, such as in school or by charities and council social care teams. But Ms Longfield said she was concerned children were getting turned away because services simply did not have time to see them. Her report also raised concerns about waiting times. Just under half of people who received treatment after a referral in 2017-18 had waited longer than six weeks. The average waiting time was nearly two months. The commissioner believes children's services are under-funded. Around Â£700m is spent on child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and eating disorders support. By comparison, services for adults receive 15 times more despite children representing 20% of the population. The commissioner said an extra Â£1.7bn would need to be invested to bring children's services in line. She said this could help pay for more early help by funding NHS counsellors in schools for example. Emma Thomas, chief executive of the Young Minds charity, said there was a lack of support for children. She said the charity gets ""calls every day"" about children who are waiting for help or have been denied help. ""This can have devastating consequences - in some cases, children start to self-harm, become suicidal or drop out of school while waiting for the help they need."" She agreed early intervention and better funding were essential. Both NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care have made improving children's mental health care a priority. In fact, the commissioner's report noted that investment was increasing and there had been good progress in terms of tackling eating disorders with new services and strict targets for access. Last month, in his Budget, the chancellor announced at least Â£2bn of the extra Â£20bn earmarked for the NHS by 2023 would go on mental health. A new four-week target for access to CAMHS is also going to be piloted soon and NHS England has promised another 70,000 children will be able to access support in the coming years. National mental health director Claire Murdoch said the scale of the problem identified by NHS Digital showed the importance of ""ramping up"" access to services. She said the NHS long-term plan, due out soon, would set out more details about future investment. ""Everyone who works with children and young people, whether in the public, private or voluntary sector, has to play their part if we are to protect young people's mental wellbeing."" Ministers have also being putting pressure on social media firms to do more about cyber-bullying and aggressive behaviour online. One option being considered is a new regulator for the internet.

"This bronze and enamel decoration would have been worn by the chariot's ponies A metal detectorist has found what is thought to be the first Celtic chariot burial to be uncovered in Wales. The burial ritual was reserved for high-ranking chiefs who would be interred complete with their chariot, horses, tack and even weapons. Mike Smith believes his find may point to a huge undiscovered Iron Age settlement nearby. National Museum Wales describes the finds as ""significant and exciting"". The actual location in south Pembrokeshire is being kept secret while archaeologists prepare for a major dig next year. His first find in February came purely by chance as his favourite hunting ground was waterlogged, forcing him to switch to another field where he had not had much luck before. One of two bridle bits being unearthed, indicating a pair of ponies But this time he found what he first thought was a medieval brooch. He emailed a picture to an expert contact who said it was part of a Celtic horse harness dating from around 600 BC. Mr Smith, from Milford Haven, went straight back the following day. The flower-shaped bridle decoration was the first find He dug down to find more pieces, their red enamelling still vivid, and realised what the collection might mean. ""I knew the importance of them straight away,"" said Mr Smith who has been prospecting for around 30 years. ""It was just instinct. I'd read all about chariot burials and just wished it could have been me, so finding this has been a privilege."" Mike Smith (centre) enlisted fellow detectorists to help He still had to convince the experts. One of the first he spoke to told him: ""No, you're wrong. One's never been found in this part of the country."" But by June a preliminary excavation was underway by Dyfed Archaeological Trust and National Museum Wales, partly funded by Cadw, which manages many of Wales' historical monument and buildings, Unearthing hidden treasures Heat wave reveals ancient Welsh sites DIY remote control detector's jackpot,external This terret ring would have guided the chariot reins Ground penetrating radar showed a pattern of buried ditches and walls, suggesting a large, previously unknown Celtic settlement, possibly bigger than Castell Henllys - an important archaeological site in north Pembrokeshire. Then a trial excavation revealed the tops of a pair of chariot wheels. ""Often the wheels were laid flat,"" said Mr Smith. ""But this one appeared to have been buried intact. It could have had the chieftain or queen sitting in it. ""There would have been a mound over it but that has gone."" Preliminary excavations revealed the tops of a pair of Celtic chariot wheels He believes past ploughing might have brought the finds closer to the surface. The site has now been recovered and given legal protection, with a full excavation planned for next year. A National Museum Wales spokesman said: ""Full excavation of the site and analysis of the find will need to be carried out before we can fully understand its importance. ""National Museum Wales is working with its partners on this continuing treasure case and in developing a detailed and fully funded proposal for further investigation. ""It is intended that a wider museum project will be developed, to offer opportunities for local communities near the find-spot to engage with this discovery and to become involved in revealing new stories about their prehistoric past."" Mr Smith's finds will now be the subject of an inquest. But what is still exciting him is a 3m metal anomaly shown up by the scans and actually underneath the chariot. ""It could be weapons. Or it could be treasure,"" he said.

"This video can not be played Who are the Sentinelese? The family of a US man reportedly killed by arrows fired by members of an endangered tribe in India's Andaman and Nicobar islands have said they forgive those who killed him. In a statement, they said John Allen Chau ""loved God, life, helping those in need, and had nothing but love for the Sentinelese people"". Seven people who helped him reach North Sentinel island have been arrested. The Indian authorities say it may take ""some days"" to recover Mr Chau's body. A missionary who was in contact with Mr Chau in the last days of his trip says his aim was to bring the gospel to the island's tribesmen. Outsiders are banned from even approaching the island to protect the people who live there, and their way of life. The complete isolation of the Sentinelese people means contact with the outside world could put them at risk, as they are likely to have no immunity to even common illnesses such as flu and measles. Mr Chau's family released a statement on Instagram, saying he had gone to the island of ""his own free will"". ""We also ask for the release of those friends he had in the Andaman Islands. He ventured out of his own free will and his local contacts need not be persecuted for his own actions,"" the statement said. Allow Instagram content?

A murder case has been registered against unknown persons, and seven people, including at least five fishermen, have been arrested for helping Mr Chau reach the island, police say. The authorities have sent a helicopter and a ship to the area to identify where the incident took place. ""We maintained a distance from the island and have not yet been able to spot the body. It may take some more days and... [reconnaissance] of the area,"" Dependra Pathak, director-general of police on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, told the AFP news agency. Police have roped in field experts, including Indian anthropologists and tribal welfare and forest officers, to help them tackle the situation. ""We have to take care that we must not disturb them or their habitat by any means. It is a highly sensitive zone and it will take some time,"" he said. Who was US man killed in remote islands? The sad truth about uncontacted tribes On his last visit to the island, Mr Chau had taken a boat with local fishermen towards the remote North Sentinel island. He then ventured alone in a canoe to the beach. As soon as he set foot on the island, he was attacked with bows and arrows, according to the fishermen. Few images of the endangered tribe exist According to extracts of a journal published in the Washington Post,external, on a previous visit, he had shouted at them: ""My name is John, I love you and Jesus loves you."" One of the tribesmen shot at him with an arrow, which pierced his waterproof Bible, he wrote. In a last note to his family, he wrote: ""You guys might think I'm crazy in all this but I think it's worthwhile to declare Jesus to these people. ""God, I don't want to die."" He had taken scissors, safety pins and a football as gifts to the tribe, according to a source quoted by Reuters news agency who had access to his notes and asked not to be named. He wrote he was ""doing this to establish the kingdom of Jesus on the island... Do not blame the natives if I am killed,"" the source said. Jeff King is president of International Christian Concern, the organisation with which Mr Chau was aligned, and was in contact with him during his visit. ""John went there to bring the gospel to these people... He had talked about it... planned it for a while, so it wasn't a whim, it wasn't a lark,""he told the BBC's Newsday programme. ""He'd been in the islands before, to this particular island... there were three or four visits on that day, and what happened was on the first visit he was turned back by arrows; the second visit, he came with two big fish as a gift. ""My understanding was the men accepted the gift; they sat together for an hour; he said they were menacing and they actually shot him. He went back to the boat, and then gradually went back a third time. That's when the fishermen who were looking through binoculars saw that they'd killed him and were taking him apart. ""This was not a job he was doing - this was a dream he had that unfortunately went wrong."" The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a chain of small islands hundreds of kilometres east of India in the Indian Ocean. Contact with several tribes on the islands is illegal to protect their indigenous way of life. In 2017, the Indian government also said taking photographs or making videos of the aboriginal Andaman tribes would be punishable with imprisonment of up to three years. Two Indian fishermen fishing illegally off North Sentinel Island were killed by the tribe in 2006. The Sentinelese stand guard on an island beach in 2005 The Sentinelese are totally cut off from the rest of the world. Global organisations like London-based Survival International have been campaigning to protect the indigenous tribes living in the Andamans. The tribe live on their own island, roughly the size of Manhattan, but most of what is known about them comes from viewing them from a distance.

Piers Morgan is known for being a provocateur on issues like this. During a debate about the image and Little Mix on ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier this week, he said the girl band were using a naked photo shoot for attention and accused them of ""using sex to sell records"". Little Mix rate seven years of photos Ariana Grande addresses boyfriends in new song Piers Morgan: Breaking the breakfast TV rules The photograph, which was used to promote their new song Strip, showed the band naked with insults written all over their bodies. The lyrics to the song encourage fans to ignore negative comments on social media The band told the BBC the image represents all of their flawsand ""how far they've come"" on a journey toward ""self-love"". The lyrics of their latest song include lines like: ""Finally love me naked, sexiest when I'm confident."" But Morgan made it clear he didn't buy their message of body positivity. ""Here's a great idea, girls - if you want to really empower yourselves, get naked and put the word slut all over your body,"" Morgan said on GMB, before showing a mock photo-shopped image of him posing with insults all over his body. ""Why don't we stop pretending that getting your kit off is feminist empowerment?"" he added, citing other celebrities who have posed nude including Kim Kardashian. The row between the band and Morgan then escalated further when member Jesy Nelson told the BBC's Nick Grimshaw on Radio 1 she was not surprised by his comments before using an expletive to describe the TV host. She then posted pictures of herself posing in underwear on her Instagram account. The band photographed with Ariana at the 2013 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards The next day, Morgan said on the programme: ""Oh Jesy, you've let yourself down, love"" before demanding a public apology from the band. He also tweeted that the 27-year-old looked ""ridiculous"" and suggested the band had stolen the idea for the photograph from the Dixie Chicks. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Daniela Tejada said her husband Matthew Hedges was ""scared"" in court The wife of a British academic jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates says the British government put UK interests above his right to freedom. Daniela Tejada spoke to the BBC shortly after returning to the UK from Abu Dhabi where she saw Durham University'sMatthew Hedges sentenced to life. The 31-year-old denies spying butprosecutors said he had confessed. Ms Tejada has arrived for a meeting in London with the Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Mr Hunt met the UAE ambassador in London earlier for ""a very frank conversation"" and Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""deeply concerned"" by the situation, which was ""being raised at the highest level"" in the UAE. Hedges, who is originally from Exeter, said he had been in the country conducting research on the UAE's security strategy for his PhD thesis when he was arrested at Dubai airport on 5 May. Daniela Tejada met Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt to discuss her husband's case According to the BBC's security correspondent Frank Gardner, sources in the UAE claim ""espionage material"" was found on Hedges' laptop. However, Mr Hunt has insisted there was no basis for the spy charges. Ms Tejada told BBC Radio 4's Today programme earlier the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office had been ""stepping on eggshells instead of taking a firm stance"" and only began to take her husband's case seriously once he had beenreleased on bail on 29 Octoberafter enduring months of solitary confinement. ""I was under the impression they were putting their interests with the UAE above a British citizen's rightful freedom and welfare,"" Ms Tejada said. She said she had contacted the Foreign Office ""on a weekly basis"" since her husband's arrest in May. ""They just disregarded my requests, they said it wasn't part of their job, it wasn't part of their duty,"" she continued. ""On one occasion, one of the case workers said the Foreign Office did not have a duty of care so weren't obliged to make such representations."" Ms Tejada said she felt the Foreign Office had disregarded her early requests for help She said: ""I believe they should have taken a firmer stance from the beginning, if not publicly then through their private representations. ""This is something they failed to do throughout. ""He was being detained in unacceptable conditions for something that he didn't do."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said his ""heart goes out"" to Hedges and his family but that Mr Hunt had ""raised this case personally with the crown prince on 12 November"". He told Today: ""The Foreign Office has been acting on (Hedges') behalf at the highest possible levels."" Following a question in the House Lords, Baroness Goldie (Conservative) said consulate staff had met Hedges on six occasions, ""three before his recent bail and three whilst on bail"". She said Mr Hunt was also ""urgently seeking a call"" with the UAE's Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed. News and updates from the North East Does UAE stability come at a price? United Arab Emirates profile Ms Tejada said she had been unable to speak to her husband since he was sentenced but she could ""imagine he is just as distraught as I am"". ""He was very, very scared standing in front of the judge,"" she said, because he was aware of the possibility of receiving an arbitrary judgement. ""I asked him to look at me if he was feeling too nervous and he tried to do so on a couple of occasions but was asked to face the judge."" She said Hedges was shaking when the translator told him the sentence and ""asked to double check if he had heard it right"". Matthew Hedges was arrested in the UAE in May Ms Tejada said there had been no due process, adding: ""He was put through so much strain for six months that absolutely nothing he said or did could be used against him. ""Anything used against Matt is completely unfounded."" Mr Hedges' family claim he signed a document written in Arabic - a language he cannot speak or read - that later transpired to be a confession. This came after he was interrogated without a lawyer or consular help, his family added. Ms Tejada later told Reuters: ""Handing a life sentence to an innocent researcher who held the UAE in high regard speaks volumes about their lack of tolerance and respect for human life."" UAE Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi said Hedges had ""confessed in detail to his crimes"" and was ""accorded full rights"" with a ""fair and transparent trial"". Abdulla Al Naqbi, head of the Department of Legal Affairs for the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs, added: ""Compelling and powerful evidence was presented in court. That included information extracted from his personal electronic devices by expert forensic analysis techniques, evidence provided by UAE intelligence agencies, witness testaments and Mr Hedges' own confession. ""The case was heard by three judges in the security division of the Higher Federal Court who met a total of four times. In the first session on 3 October Mr Hedges was asked whether he had proper representation and was offered the services of a court-appointed lawyer, which he accepted. ""It is not true that he was asked to sign documents he did not understand."" The ministry said the UAE was ""determined to protect its important strategic relationship with a key ally"" and added that it hoped both sides could find ""an amicable solution"" to the case."" The UAE attorney general previously said the sentence - which could see the academic serve up to 25 years in jail before being deported - was not final as he had the right to appeal. Frank Gardner, security correspondent, BBC News Britain has a very deep and quite long-standing defence relationship with the UAE - it is an ally. There are roughly 200 serving British personnel permanently based in the UAE. There is an airbase called Al Minhad just south of Dubai where RAF Typhoons and Tornadoes are rotating in and out, including for flights to Afghanistan. There is a port called Port Zayed which is the most visited Royal Navy port in the world. And hundreds of Emirati officers are trained at Sandhurst military academy. Britain has got a very close defence, security and counter-terrorism relationship with the UAE and though there is no suggestion of that being threatened, if the situation escalates, the calls to reconsider that relationship will increase. The suggestion Britain would send a spy makes no sense. I'm sure MI6 would use academics to spy on a place if they could, but only in hard-to-target countries. I cannot imagine what an academic could get out of the UAE that the UK couldn't get by asking the UAE directly. There is nothing I can see that Matthew Hedges has done which in any way would constitute spying. There are far greater sensitivities there than in this country - somebody has reported him to the authorities saying he is asking suspicious questions. I've known someone, who was a businessman in Dubai - a former British army officer - who was arrested because he upset the wrong person and didn't have the connections that would get him out of jail. Prof Clive Jones, Hedges' supervisor at Durham University, said there would now have to be ""some kind of moratorium"" on sending students to do field work in the UAE and the wider Gulf region. He said Hedges had been looking at civil-military relations in the UAE since the Arab Spring and ""there was nothing clandestine or covert"" about the material he had. Prof Jones said there had been no ""inkling"" of any danger and Hedges was ""no stranger"" to the UAE, having ""lived there on and off"" since he was nine years old. This video can not be played Shana Marshall, a friend of Matthew Hedges, says she is ""shocked"" at the UAE's verdict Prof Jones said: ""He knew many of the people he was going out to interview, so again it is utterly bizarre, and indeed perverse, and indeed a miscarriage of justice, that this has befallen him."" Conservative MP and former soldier Johnny Mercer said it would be ""absolutely disgraceful,external"" if Ms Tejada's claims were found to be true, adding: ""We have no interests with the UAE that outweigh the rights and freedoms of our citizens abroad."" He earlier said the case was ""unacceptable"" and ""consequences must be immediate until he is released"".

"This video can not be played Stephen Richardson had to have his leg amputated because of type 2 diabetes Diabetes prescriptions are costing the NHS in England more than Â£1 billion a year, according to figures from NHS Digital. The total cost of the prescriptions has risen significantly - by more than Â£422 million - in the last 10 years. Almost one in 20 prescriptions written by GPs are now for diabetes treatment. The biggest increases are seen in treatments for type 2 diabetes, which affects around 90% of diabetes patients. Robin Hewings, head of policy at the charity Diabetes UK, said the figures reflect a dramatic rise in the incidence of diabetes. ""The number of people diagnosed with diabetes has doubled in the last 20 years, and it is responsible for 26,000 early deaths per year alongside serious complications such as blindness, amputation or stroke. ""This data shows that diabetes prescribing costs Â£1bn, but it is estimated that the total cost to the NHS is over Â£10bn a year, so the real price we have to pay for diabetes is not medications, but the devastating and expensive complications."" Mr Hewings pointed out that drug costs have not risen significantly during this period, and that the increase in prescribing costs is largely a result of the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes signs 'detectable years earlier' 'Postcode lottery' for diabetes monitors Diabetes 'info prescription' plan There are now over three million people in England with a diagnosis of diabetes. The number has doubled over the last two decades and there are nearly 100,000 diagnoses per year. 92% of recorded diagnoses of diabetes relate to type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, unlike type 1, is closely linked to lifestyle factors and is preventable through lifestyle change. Almost seven out of 10 men are overweight or obese (66.8%) and almost six out of 10 women are overweight or obese (57.8%) in England. Source: NHS England Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body not producing enough insulin, or by the body's cells not reacting to the insulin that is present, resulting in high blood sugar. It may be controlled by diet, or by antidiabetic drugs or insulin, or both. Type 2 is caused by a variety of factors, some of which are out of people's control, but more than 80 percent is caused by obesity or being overweight. In overweight and obese people, type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed by losing weight. The NHS England figures also include the cost of devices used by people with diabetes to monitor their condition. Nearly Â£477 million was spent on antidiabetic drugs in 2017-18. Over the same year, around Â£350 million was spent on insulin, and Â£181 million on diagnostic and monitoring devices. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity at NHS England, said: ""Thanks to better diagnosis and treatment, the NHS is caring for more people than ever before with diabetes, and this new data highlights the urgent need to prevent type 2 diabetes from developing in the first place. ""The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme has now reached over a quarter of a million people at high risk of type 2 diabetes."" FollowLaurel Ives,externalon Twitter.

"This year, 320,000 people were recorded as homeless in Britain, analysis from housing charity Shelter suggests. It is a rise of 13,000, or 4%, on last year's figures and equivalent to 36 new people becoming homeless every day. London has the highest rate of homelessness, but it is growing fastest in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, and north-west England, the analysis says. The government says it is investing Â£1.2bn to tackle homelessness. The report, which is published as temperatures start to plummet, says the real level of homelessness is notoriously difficult to measure. Only individuals in contact with local authorities or in hostels are included in the official figures. Telli Afrik, his wife and two young children, are one family caught up in the homelessness crisis. They lost their home this year because, despite working, they could on longer afford to pay their rent. They are living in a single room in their sixth homelessness hostel and have to eat sitting on the floor because they have no table. Telli also lost his job as a supermarket manager because he had to attend so many appointments with different housing teams. ""That was a direct result of our homelessness,"" he says. ""Financially we've been brought to nothing. ""My confidence - nothing. My family is at breaking point."" Shelter analysts arrived at the total of 320,000 after collating official figures for those living in temporary accommodation, sleeping rough and the number of hostel places taken up, reducing them to compensate for potential double-counting. Statistics for Scotland include only those in temporary accommodation, while those for Wales cover temporary accommodation and known rough sleepers. The charity says its figures are likely to be a conservative estimate, as they do not include people unknown to the authorities or experiencing other types of homelessness not included in the figures. They add that rough sleeping figures are particularly difficult to record because many people hide and remain out of sight for safety reasons and are not seen by the council officials who carry out the counts. So, those who bed down for the night in derelict buildings rather than the more obvious shop doorways are often missed out of the tally. But the figures show that since Shelter first carried out this kind of analysis in 2016, an extra 25,000 people have become homeless. They also mean one in every 200 Britons is either sleeping rough or living in temporary accommodation, such as hostels and B&Bs. Chief executive of the charity Polly Neate said: ""These new figures show that homelessness is having a devastating impact on the lives of people right across the country. ""Due to the perfect storm of spiralling rents, welfare cuts and a total lack of social housing, record numbers of people are sleeping out on the streets or stuck in the cramped confines of a hostel room. ""We desperately need action now to change tomorrow for the hundreds of thousands whose lives will be blighted by homelessness this winter."" Previous research by the charity highlighted how many people were prevented from finding somewhere new, when made homeless, because the low level of housing benefit they were entitled to would not cover their rent. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said a new law required local councils to do more to prevent homelessness. He added that the government was supporting those working on the front line to help get people off the street and into accommodation. And he highlighted the government's affordable housing programme.

"Theresa May will return to Brussels for Brexit talks this weekend as the UK and EU strive to do a deal in time for Sunday's summit of European leaders. After a two-hour meeting with EU officials, the prime minister said progress was being made on the future shape of EU-UK relations. Spain has said it will not agree to the Brexit deal unless changes are made to the wording over Gibraltar. But No 10 sources said they expected a solution before Sunday's gathering. Sources said the announcement that the PM would make an unscheduled trip to Brussels on Saturday did not signal ""major problems"" over a document setting out the UK's future relations with the EU. Mrs May spoke to Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez on Wednesday evening and said discussions would continue following ""good engagement"" between the countries and the government of Gibraltar, according to a Downing Street spokesperson. Kuenssberg: Will they, won't they? Adler: May gambles on last-minute Brussels trip London and Brussels have already agreedthe draft terms of the UK's exit from the EUon 29 March 2019 - a 585-page document covering citizens' rights, financial issues and the Irish border. Some Tory MPs want what BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg described as ""nips and tucks"" to this legally-binding agreement, but the UK and EU have signalled there will be no major changes. The EU is now in a race against time to complete the text of an accompanying declaration on its future relations with the UK, covering trade, security and other issues, amid concerns from several member states. The latest draft of this document, known as the political declaration, has just been published and is being considered by member states. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has indicated she will not attend Sunday's meeting of European leaders - which has been called to approve both the declaration and the withdrawal deal - unless the text on future co-operation is agreed in advance. The EU had hoped to agree on the text of the political declaration, which is not legally binding but will be the starting point for future negotiations, on Tuesday. The BBC understands the ""real deadline"" in Brussels to settle it and thus ensure Sunday's summit goes ahead is now considered to be Friday morning - when ministerial negotiators meet.

After an hour of talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Wednesday, Mrs May sought to strike an upbeat note but signalled talks were set to continue until the eve of Sunday's summit. ""We've made further progress and as a result we have given sufficient direction to our negotiators, I hope, for them to resolve the remaining issues and that work will start immediately,"" she said. ""I now plan to return for further meetings on Saturday to discuss how we can bring to a conclusion this process and bring it to a conclusion in the interests of all our people."" Under the terms of the draft withdrawal agreement, there will be a 21-month transition period after the UK leaves lasting to the end of 2020. The future relations document sets out the basis for economic, security and defence co-operation from the start of 2021 onwards. The UK has said it hopes to agree a trade deal by then although most observers believe it will take much longer, based on other trade agreements. Please upgrade your browser When it was first published last Wednesday, the document was just seven pages long and has since been extended to 20 pages. In a statement on Wednesday, the UK said its objectives included a free-trade area for goods with zero tariffs on UK products, an end to membership of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy and ""ambitious arrangements for trade in services"". The French, Dutch and Danish governments are concerned about the amount of access their fishing fleets will get to British waters. There are broader concerns about what the Brexit agreement will mean for the future of the single market, if the UK ends up enjoying preferential access to EU markets but does not have to comply with freedom of movement rules. This video can not be played Reporter Gavin Lee visited Gibraltar in April to ask: ""Does Brexit put the Rock in a hard place?"" The other major issue is the future of Gibraltar, the British overseas territory which Spain has long laid claim to. Spain is insisting that the texts state clearly that any future trade agreements between the EU and the UK will not cover the disputed peninsula and the UK would have to hold direct negotiations with Madrid over how they applied to Gibraltar. While Spain cannot explicitly veto the deal on Sunday, the EU hopes to proceed by consensus and the BBC's Europe correspondent Damian Grammaticas said it would be politically problematic for other EU countries to press ahead without Spain's support.

She said Hedges was shaking when the translator told him the sentence and ""asked to double check if he had heard it right"". Matthew Hedges was arrested in the UAE in May Ms Tejada said there had been no due process, adding: ""He was put through so much strain for six months that absolutely nothing he said or did could be used against him. ""Anything used against Matt is completely unfounded."" Mr Hedges' family claim he signed a document written in Arabic - a language he cannot speak or read - that later transpired to be a confession. This came after he was interrogated without a lawyer or consular help, his family added. Ms Tejada later told Reuters: ""Handing a life sentence to an innocent researcher who held the UAE in high regard speaks volumes about their lack of tolerance and respect for human life."" UAE Attorney General Dr Hamad Saif Al Shamsi said Hedges had ""confessed in detail to his crimes"" and was ""accorded full rights"" with a ""fair and transparent trial"". Abdulla Al Naqbi, head of the Department of Legal Affairs for the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs, added: ""Compelling and powerful evidence was presented in court. That included information extracted from his personal electronic devices by expert forensic analysis techniques, evidence provided by UAE intelligence agencies, witness testaments and Mr Hedges' own confession. ""The case was heard by three judges in the security division of the Higher Federal Court who met a total of four times. In the first session on 3 October Mr Hedges was asked whether he had proper representation and was offered the services of a court-appointed lawyer, which he accepted. ""It is not true that he was asked to sign documents he did not understand."" The ministry said the UAE was ""determined to protect its important strategic relationship with a key ally"" and added that it hoped both sides could find ""an amicable solution"" to the case."" The UAE attorney general previously said the sentence - which could see the academic serve up to 25 years in jail before being deported - was not final as he had the right to appeal. Frank Gardner, security correspondent, BBC News Britain has a very deep and quite long-standing defence relationship with the UAE - it is an ally. There are roughly 200 serving British personnel permanently based in the UAE. There is an airbase called Al Minhad just south of Dubai where RAF Typhoons and Tornadoes are rotating in and out, including for flights to Afghanistan. There is a port called Port Zayed which is the most visited Royal Navy port in the world. And hundreds of Emirati officers are trained at Sandhurst military academy. Britain has got a very close defence, security and counter-terrorism relationship with the UAE and though there is no suggestion of that being threatened, if the situation escalates, the calls to reconsider that relationship will increase. The suggestion Britain would send a spy makes no sense. I'm sure MI6 would use academics to spy on a place if they could, but only in hard-to-target countries. I cannot imagine what an academic could get out of the UAE that the UK couldn't get by asking the UAE directly. There is nothing I can see that Matthew Hedges has done which in any way would constitute spying. There are far greater sensitivities there than in this country - somebody has reported him to the authorities saying he is asking suspicious questions. I've known someone, who was a businessman in Dubai - a former British army officer - who was arrested because he upset the wrong person and didn't have the connections that would get him out of jail. Prof Clive Jones, Hedges' supervisor at Durham University, said there would now have to be ""some kind of moratorium"" on sending students to do field work in the UAE and the wider Gulf region. He said Hedges had been looking at civil-military relations in the UAE since the Arab Spring and ""there was nothing clandestine or covert"" about the material he had. Prof Jones said there had been no ""inkling"" of any danger and Hedges was ""no stranger"" to the UAE, having ""lived there on and off"" since he was nine years old. This video can not be played Shana Marshall, a friend of Matthew Hedges, says she is ""shocked"" at the UAE's verdict Prof Jones said: ""He knew many of the people he was going out to interview, so again it is utterly bizarre, and indeed perverse, and indeed a miscarriage of justice, that this has befallen him."" Conservative MP and former soldier Johnny Mercer said it would be ""absolutely disgraceful,external"" if Ms Tejada's claims were found to be true, adding: ""We have no interests with the UAE that outweigh the rights and freedoms of our citizens abroad."" He earlier said the case was ""unacceptable"" and ""consequences must be immediate until he is released"".

"Unemployed and low-paid women are to be the focus of a new government drive to improve their lives, cabinet minister Penny Mordaunt has announced. The Government Equalities Office will shift its approach from getting more executives into the boardroom to focusing on Britain's ""invisible women"", she said on Wednesday. Policies will be aimed at removing the ""multiple barriers"" to working women. These women ""keep our families... and our nation going,"" she said.

"Nearly one in four young women has a mental illness, with emotional problems such as depression and anxiety the most common, figures for England show. The official NHS report found young women aged 17 to 19 were twice as likely as young men to have problems, with 23.9% reporting a disorder. Problems are less common in younger age groups, but are rising, albeit slowly. In children aged five to 15, one in nine had a disorder, up from one in 10 when the review was done 13 years ago. Thefindings are based on a survey,externalof more than 9,000 young people. The results have been gathered by statistics body NHS Digital and assessed by experts to try to ensure only diagnosable conditions are included. Dr Bernadka Dubicka, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the numbers of young women with problems was ""alarming"". She said body image pressures, exam stress and the negative effects of social media may all affect girls disproportionately, while they were also more likely to be victims of abuse and sexual assault. ""We can only speculate. We still do not fully understand this - all we know is that we see more girls in our clinics. ""We have to make sure services are available for them."" Youth mental health report in charts Why help ends at a milestone birthday It comes as the Children's Commissioner for England warned there was a ""vast gap"" in NHS mental health support. Anne Longfield's report criticised slow progress made in improving specialist community services for children. She said waiting times were too long and she was concerned about numbers being rejected by services in some areas. Nearly half of those in their late teens with mental health problems had self-harmed or attempted suicide. For younger teens it was about a quarter. This video can not be played Poor mental health ""has taken so much of my life from me"" Emma Blezard, 18, says her mental health problems have robbed her of her teenage years. She started experiencing difficulties when she was 13, suffering from anxiety and panic attacks before developing an eating disorder. It was a year before she let on to her parents. She ended up having suicidal thoughts and was sectioned in hospital at one point. ""I've missed so much of my life because of this illness - I've lost friends, I've missed birthday, holidays. ""I wish I could do things over."" Even when she was receiving treatment, she felt she did not deserve it. ""I became really isolated. At school I spent a lot of time out of lessons with the nurse. It was very difficult."" She has travelled all over the country for treatment and says she still struggles, although her problems are more manageable now. ""I don't think they will ever go away."" This video can not be played How should we talk about mental health? It may be a factor, although it is hard to tell. The NHS Digital review found children aged 11 to 19 with a mental health problem were more likely to use social media. Nearly a third of them spent over four hours a day on social media. Those who did not have a mental health problem were two to three times less likely to spend that amount of time on it. The young people with mental health problems were more likely to say their mood was affected by the number of ""likes"" they got and they were also more likely to compare themselves to others on social media. The report cited cyber-bullying as an issue too. But while this does suggest social media can have a negative impact, it does not prove it is to blame. People with mental health problems may be just more likely to find themselves on it, rather than it causing their problems in the first place. Indeed, they could even be using social media for support. How to help a friend who is struggling 'I'll only get help if I try to kill myself' Child mental health referrals up 26% in five years, says report Children 'must be suicidal to get help' A mother's love: 'Fearful of failing to keep her alive' The majority of problems reported, particularly in the older age groups, are linked to emotional disorders. These are on the rise, whereas the other disorders they looked at - behavioural and hyperactivity - have remained relatively stable over time. University College London psychiatrist Dr Michael Bloomfield said: ""Adolescence is a critical period for a person's development, particularly as our brains go through important changes during our teenage years. ""Since prevention is better than cure, it is really important for all of us in society to understand together why this is and start reducing the rates of mental disorders in young people."" The NHS is only treating a fraction of the young people who have problems. The Children's Commissioner's analysis of NHS figures from 2017-18 show that 325,000 children were treated by community services, while there are another 5,000 in hospital. That is fewer than 3% of the population. The figures showed that more than a third of young people referred to community services were turned away. This could be because their needs were not severe enough to need help and could be dealt with through other services, such as in school or by charities and council social care teams. But Ms Longfield said she was concerned children were getting turned away because services simply did not have time to see them. Her report also raised concerns about waiting times. Just under half of people who received treatment after a referral in 2017-18 had waited longer than six weeks. The average waiting time was nearly two months. The commissioner believes children's services are under-funded. Around Â£700m is spent on child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) and eating disorders support. By comparison, services for adults receive 15 times more despite children representing 20% of the population. The commissioner said an extra Â£1.7bn would need to be invested to bring children's services in line. She said this could help pay for more early help by funding NHS counsellors in schools for example. Emma Thomas, chief executive of the Young Minds charity, said there was a lack of support for children. She said the charity gets ""calls every day"" about children who are waiting for help or have been denied help. ""This can have devastating consequences - in some cases, children start to self-harm, become suicidal or drop out of school while waiting for the help they need."" She agreed early intervention and better funding were essential. Both NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care have made improving children's mental health care a priority. In fact, the commissioner's report noted that investment was increasing and there had been good progress in terms of tackling eating disorders with new services and strict targets for access. Last month, in his Budget, the chancellor announced at least Â£2bn of the extra Â£20bn earmarked for the NHS by 2023 would go on mental health. A new four-week target for access to CAMHS is also going to be piloted soon and NHS England has promised another 70,000 children will be able to access support in the coming years. National mental health director Claire Murdoch said the scale of the problem identified by NHS Digital showed the importance of ""ramping up"" access to services. She said the NHS long-term plan, due out soon, would set out more details about future investment. ""Everyone who works with children and young people, whether in the public, private or voluntary sector, has to play their part if we are to protect young people's mental wellbeing."" Ministers have also being putting pressure on social media firms to do more about cyber-bullying and aggressive behaviour online. One option being considered is a new regulator for the internet.

"Gen Korobov served in the Russian air force before becoming GRU chief (Aug 2017 pic) The head of Russia's GRU military intelligence agency, General Igor Korobov, has died aged 62, Russia's defence ministry says. Gen Korobov, who took up the post in 2016, is said to have died after ""a serious and long illness"" on Wednesday. The GRU was this year linked to a nerve agent attack in Britain on Russian ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Gen Korobov is understood to have faced criticism by Russian officials over the failure of the operation. The attack on Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury on 4 March led to them requiring weeks of hospital treatment. The poisoning is alleged to have been carried out by suspects Alexander Mishkin and Anatoly Chepiga, both identified by British authorities as GRU operatives, and ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. Russia denies the allegations. The UK and its Western allies expelled more than 150 Russian diplomats in retaliation for the attack. Russian spy poisoning: What we know so far This video can not be played What we know about the GRU Vice-Admiral Igor Kostyukov, who has commanded Russian forces in Syria, will serve as interim GRU chief. He had already taken over while Gen Korobov was ill, military sources told Russian media. The appointment of a permanent chief is a matter for President Vladimir Putin. The GRU, or Main Intelligence Directorate, is the intelligence arm of the Russian military, tasked with carrying out undercover international operations. UK accuses Russian spies of cyber-attacks Gen Korobov had received the Hero of Russia medal - the state's highest award. In December 2016 the US added Gen Korobov to its list of senior Russian officials subject to sanctions, accusing him of involvement in computer hacking. Other Western sanctions target Russians accused of helping the separatist insurgents in Ukraine. Russia has two other main spy organisations: the Federal Security Service (FSB), mainly involved in internal security, and the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR), whose role is similar to that of Britain's MI6. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg in Moscow writes: Igor Korobov's career in the Soviet, then Russian military, spanned more than 40 years. He joined military intelligence in the mid-1980s and rose through the GRU ranks to a key position, overseeing strategic intelligence-gathering. In 2016 he was given the top job: agency chief. Under Korobov, and his predecessor Igor Sergun, the GRU became the Kremlin's spy agency of choice for a series of high-profile and highly controversial operations.  The GRU has been linked to Russia's military operation in eastern Ukraine, to Moscow's meddling in the US election and to a failed coup in Montenegro. The defence ministry described Korobov as a ""wonderful person"". But 2018 has been less than wonderful for the agency he headed. A series of botched operations - most notably the Salisbury poisoning - has thrust the GRU into the limelight and raised questions about its methods and activities. Korobov reportedly died ""after a long, extended illness"". Did he fall ill, as rumours suggest, after a dressing-down from the president? I can't confirm that. But what's clear is that if you take on the role of GRU chief, don't expect a carriage clock and a happy retirement at the end of it. Korobov's predecessor, Igor Sergun, also died while in office. Sergei Skripal - the spy at centre of poison mystery How the Dutch foiled Russian 'cyber-attack' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Modernisation of the GRU headquarters in Moscow was completed in 2006 Gen Korobov was described by Russia's defence ministry on Wednesday as ""a wonderful person, a faithful son of Russia and a patriot of his homeland,"" Reuters news agency reported. The ministry did not provide any further details about his death. The GRU is highly secretive - its total staff is not known, nor is its organisational structure known in detail. The GRU was involved in undercover operations in Ukraine - including Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 - and allegedly in the computer hacking during the 2016 US presidential election. Russians charged with US election hack The GRU includes Spetsnaz special forces - crack military units - who have fought in the Syrian war, helping President Bashar al-Assad's troops, and against separatist rebels in Chechnya. In the Soviet period they fought against Western-backed guerrillas in Afghanistan. In 2015 President Putin admitted that GRU units had been deployed in Crimea shortly before the peninsula was annexed. President Putin (3rd R) visited the new GRU HQ in November 2006 Among the GRU's tasks are: agent-running, sabotage, hi-tech eavesdropping and reconnaissance, the government daily Rossiyskaya Gazeta reported. The Spetsnaz logo is a black bat with wings spread out across the globe. According to the Russian news website Meduza,external, GRU officers get three years of specialist training, which includes cybernetics, foreign languages, geopolitics, use of codes and other elements of espionage.

"The ad was posted months after the real-life murder of a woman in similar circumstances A French court has ruled that posters showing a woman tied to train tracks did not promote violence against women. The posters were put up around the town of BÃ©ziers last December to celebrate the arrival of high-speed TGV trains. They carried the caption: ""With the TGV, she would have suffered less."" The ads faced a legal challenge from a number of feminist groups and criticism by France's equality minister. But the court said they were legal, despite the questionable humour. The posters were launched four months after 34-year-old Emilie Hallouin died when she was tied to TGV tracks by her husband and hit by a train in a murder-suicide in northern France. Many Twitter users, including French Senator Laurence Rossignol, drew parallels between the posters and the tragic news story. Allow Twitter content?

"This video can not be played Stephen Richardson had to have his leg amputated because of type 2 diabetes Diabetes prescriptions are costing the NHS in England more than Â£1 billion a year, according to figures from NHS Digital. The total cost of the prescriptions has risen significantly - by more than Â£422 million - in the last 10 years. Almost one in 20 prescriptions written by GPs are now for diabetes treatment. The biggest increases are seen in treatments for type 2 diabetes, which affects around 90% of diabetes patients. Robin Hewings, head of policy at the charity Diabetes UK, said the figures reflect a dramatic rise in the incidence of diabetes. ""The number of people diagnosed with diabetes has doubled in the last 20 years, and it is responsible for 26,000 early deaths per year alongside serious complications such as blindness, amputation or stroke. ""This data shows that diabetes prescribing costs Â£1bn, but it is estimated that the total cost to the NHS is over Â£10bn a year, so the real price we have to pay for diabetes is not medications, but the devastating and expensive complications."" Mr Hewings pointed out that drug costs have not risen significantly during this period, and that the increase in prescribing costs is largely a result of the rise in prevalence of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes signs 'detectable years earlier' 'Postcode lottery' for diabetes monitors Diabetes 'info prescription' plan There are now over three million people in England with a diagnosis of diabetes. The number has doubled over the last two decades and there are nearly 100,000 diagnoses per year. 92% of recorded diagnoses of diabetes relate to type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes, unlike type 1, is closely linked to lifestyle factors and is preventable through lifestyle change. Almost seven out of 10 men are overweight or obese (66.8%) and almost six out of 10 women are overweight or obese (57.8%) in England. Source: NHS England Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body not producing enough insulin, or by the body's cells not reacting to the insulin that is present, resulting in high blood sugar. It may be controlled by diet, or by antidiabetic drugs or insulin, or both. Type 2 is caused by a variety of factors, some of which are out of people's control, but more than 80 percent is caused by obesity or being overweight. In overweight and obese people, type 2 diabetes can be prevented and reversed by losing weight. The NHS England figures also include the cost of devices used by people with diabetes to monitor their condition. Nearly Â£477 million was spent on antidiabetic drugs in 2017-18. Over the same year, around Â£350 million was spent on insulin, and Â£181 million on diagnostic and monitoring devices. Professor Jonathan Valabhji, national clinical director for diabetes and obesity at NHS England, said: ""Thanks to better diagnosis and treatment, the NHS is caring for more people than ever before with diabetes, and this new data highlights the urgent need to prevent type 2 diabetes from developing in the first place. ""The NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme has now reached over a quarter of a million people at high risk of type 2 diabetes."" FollowLaurel Ives,externalon Twitter.

"This video can not be played James Cordier apologised to his investors The boss of a Florida-based financial firm has made a tearful video apology to clients after bad bets on oil and natural gas prices wiped out their investments. James Cordier blamed a recent bout of market volatility for the losses, which are set to destroy his firm. ""I truly invested your funds like you were family,"" he said in the10-minute video posted on YouTube,external. ""I'm sorry that this rogue wave capsized our boat."" Natural gas prices enjoyed their biggest one-day percentage gain in eight years on Wednesday last week, only to suffered their largest one-day loss in 15 years the very next day. Meanwhile, oil prices have also fallen sharply. Mr Cordier is president of OptionSellers.com, based in Tampa, and co-wrote a book called The Complete Guide to Option Selling. The company managed money for wealthy investors and specialised in options, which give investors the right to buy or sell at a pre-determined price. OptionSellers said the losses were its ""clients' private business. We are in communication with them."" It was not clear how much money the firm managed or the size of the losses. Mr Cordier said in his video that he had 290 clients. However, the losses could total more than $150m, according to Ohio lawyer Jason Albin, who has been in contact with about 80 clients. Mr Albin said he thought the trades, which in some cases involved retirement accounts, should not have been permitted because of the risk involved. He is looking at taking legal action against INTL FCStone, the brokerage that cleared the bets on behalf of Mr Cordier's company. INTL FCStone declined to comment on the claims. The firm said accounts managed by Optionsellers.com were liquidated after ""unprecedented volatility"" in the oil and gas markets last week. ""Although well collateralized, accounts managed by a commodities trading advisor, Optionsellers.com, had to be liquidated as a result of these moves,"" the company said. ""Liquidation of these accounts was in accordance with our customer agreements and our obligations under market regulation and standards.""

Little Mix rate seven years of photos Ariana Grande addresses boyfriends in new song Piers Morgan: Breaking the breakfast TV rules The photograph, which was used to promote their new song Strip, showed the band naked with insults written all over their bodies.

The lyrics of their latest song include lines like: ""Finally love me naked, sexiest when I'm confident."" But Morgan made it clear he didn't buy their message of body positivity. ""Here's a great idea, girls - if you want to really empower yourselves, get naked and put the word slut all over your body,"" Morgan said on GMB, before showing a mock photo-shopped image of him posing with insults all over his body. ""Why don't we stop pretending that getting your kit off is feminist empowerment?"" he added, citing other celebrities who have posed nude including Kim Kardashian. The row between the band and Morgan then escalated further when member Jesy Nelson told the BBC's Nick Grimshaw on Radio 1 she was not surprised by his comments before using an expletive to describe the TV host. She then posted pictures of herself posing in underwear on her Instagram account.
